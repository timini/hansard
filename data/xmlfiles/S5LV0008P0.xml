<title>ARMY (ANNUAL) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00146" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00147">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00148"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it may be convenient that I should state shortly the nature of the provisions of the Bill the Second Reading of which I now rise to move. To begin with, the Bill contains the usual clauses required to keep alive the law under which alone the Army is legal. Therefore it has to become law by April 30. These provisions are in the usual form. Then there is a short clause at the end which I need merely mention, which enables the Army Council to make stoppages from pay for the purpose of satisfying costs incurred by women in obtaining affiliation orders against soldiers. That, of course, is perfectly right and reasonable, but there has been no adequate provision for it up to this time.<lb/>
But the real point of interest to your Lordships in the Bill of this year is the new set of provisions as regards horses. Everybody knows that of all the difficult subjects connected with the British Army that of horses is by no means the least difficult. No systematic attempt has been made in years gone by to deal with the question of how to provide the Army on mobilisation with the horses that it requires. Two years ago certain additions were made to the Army (Annual) Act in the form of clauses enabling County Associations to undertake the beginning of a classification and census of horses. A census was, in the first instance, taken by the police under powers which they possessed, but it has been found that, although several counties have been engaged in carrying out the census, the powers conferred did not go far enough. We propose now to put the whole matter upon what after consideration we have decided to be the most satisfactory footing.<lb/>
The importance of this question I need not dwell upon. The Expeditionary Force must be hampered upon its mobilisation until adequate provision has been made for the supply of horses. It may be convenient that I should state to your Lordships the result of inquiries which I have just made as to the progress of the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0008"/>
<col>7</col>
arrangements in connection with the Expeditionary Force on mobilisation. The state of matters now is that the combatant <i>personnel,</i> the fighting line, in all arms is now complete. The whole of the stores are there, the whole of the weapons are there, and the whole of the ammunition is there. The only points connected with the Expeditionary Force which are not yet in perfect order are certain minor auxiliary services and the officers. As regards those services, the changes that have been made have now supplied everything required except in the case of the Army Service Corps, the Army Medical Corps, and the Veterinary Service. As regards the last-named service, a temporary provision has been made, and the deficiency will presently be properly filled up. As regards the Army Service Corps, the arrangements which have now been completed will supply shortly all the <i>personnel</i> wanted to complete for mobilisation, and in the meantime temporary arrangements have been made which will enable the Divisions to be mobilised. As regards the Army Medical Corps, again machinery is working which will produce the full quota required for mobilisation, and meantime arrangements have been made which will supply sufficiently trained men to fill up.<lb/>
I am therefore in a position to say, as a result of my inquiries, that the entire <i>personnel</i> of the six Divisions could be mobilised at once, subject to this, that the arrangements as regards the Army Service Corps and the Army Medical Corps, although in a form which is quite sufficient for immediate mobilisation, are not vet in the scientific shape in which we hope to see them when the machinery has been working a little longer. Then as to the number of officers, there are quite sufficient officers to mobilise the entire Expeditionary Force. We have a surplus of officers in the higher standing. In subalterns, however, we should have to make great demands on the staff at the dep&#x00F4;ts. We shall not have many left over for the dep&#x00F4;ts and for wastage of war unless steps are taken. The steps which it is proposed to take have been organised in the shape of the new Special Reserve of Officers&#x2014;a young organisation but one which has now begun to work, and I am hopeful that it will give the results it has been designed to yield. Meantime, if war came we would, with the temporary steps which we have taken,
<col>8</col>
be able, we think, without difficulty to fill up what is required in the way of subaltern officers for the services at home. For mobilisation, as I have said, we have amply sufficient officers of all standings to mobilise the Expeditionary Force.<lb/>
Our ideal has been to be able to mobilise the entire Expeditionary Force within ten days. We can at this moment, except so far as regards horses, mobilise four Divisions within ten days, and the whole of the six Divisions within twenty-one days. That is what I am informed as a result of inquiries which I have made this week in the different departments. Therefore all that has to be done is to complete matters so as to be able to mobilise the other two Divisions within the ten days. That is what we are aiming at, and it is in sight. But as regards the supply of horses the situation is much more serious. There is no proper organisation in respect of that supply. Under the law as it has stood for some years everyone in this country who possesses horses and vehicles suitable for military purposes is bound to produce them on mobilisation, and they may be taken compulsorily, the price to be paid being afterwards settled, in the event of a dispute, in the County Court. There is also power on the part of the police to make a list of those who would be liable to contribute horses and vehicles, but the powers of the police are very limited. The police, moreover, are not fully qualified to discharge the somewhat delicate task of saying what horses are fit and for what purpose.<lb/>
It is that situation with which we have to deal. The police census, however, is valuable as showing the number of horses in the country and their general quality. Excluding horses under four years old, brood mares, and stallions, there are 1,600,000 horses in the country which would be available. Of these I reckon that certainly not more than one-third&#x2014;I prefer to take it at a little lower than a third&#x2014;could be counted upon as likely to prove fit for Army purposes; but even that leaves us with 500,000 horses on which we could draw. I now come to the number required for mobilisation. The Territorial Force requires 86,000 horses for mobilisation, and the Regulars, who already possess a considerable peace establishment
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0009"/>
<col>9</col>
of horses, require for mobilisation 52,000 more. These figures amount together to 138,000; but there are 12,000 horses at present registered and on which we can put our hands. Therefore taking it that we have to find 126,000 horses on mobilisation for the Regulars and the Territorials, the question is, How is this to be done? There are about 500,000 suitable horses out of which they can be got, so that there is an ample margin and an ample supply for wastage; and young horses, of course, would be coming on in the course of a prolonged war.<lb/>
This Bill contains clauses which provide what we think is the machinery necessary to solve the problem of sifting out and classifying these horses. The police cannot do it. They can tell you what horses there are, but they cannot classify them. We have never regarded a police census as giving us anything inure than an indication of how many horses there were in the country and what sort of horses they might be. We look to the County Associations to do this work but they cannot do it without great help. They have in some ten counties made progress in the way of mapping out the districts into areas and sifting the horses, but what <i>is</i> required is something much more thorough than that. Accordingly we propose in this Bill to enable the County Associations to use the powers which the police possess, but we leave the police their powers in case it: is necessary that they should exercise them, as it will be, for instance, in the case of Ireland. There the Lord Lieutenant is the head of the Constabulary, and the Lord Lieutenant can set the machinery which I shall presently describe in motion; but in this country, where County Associations exist, although it is well to retain the police powers to fall back upon in case of a breakdown, the County Association seems to us the body most likely to inspire confidence in the people in the neighbourhood. We give the County Associations the same power, with some improvements, that the police possess at the present time for entering premises and looking at the horses; and if they are resisted, there is power to go to a magistrate and obtain an order.<lb/>
The County Associations, however, will exercise these powers through the medium of Regular officers set apart for the purpose. There are at present 500 Territorial
<col>10</col>
adjutants, some of them possessing considerable knowledge of horses and all of them available for the work. We propose to give them in the winter months, when these adjutants have very little to do, time duty of classifying the horses within definite areas, and we propose that they should do so under the supervision, and, indeed, under the command, of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in the district in which the county is situated. The legal powers will be with the County Association, and the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief will be in consultation with the County Association as to the exercise under their &#x00E6;<i>gis</i> of his powers of setting his officers to work. We have every confidence that they will be able to come to arrangements which will work without friction. The position, therefore, will be this. The Territorial adjutants, who will have the assistance when it <i>is</i> required of the Permanent Staff, will have the duty of making the classification. It will not be necessary to take a census. We think that with the basis we have in the existing police census the adjutants will be able to set to work. We leave the County Associations the same freedom that they possess at the present moment to co-operate in the work, but the primary work will be with the adjutants.<lb/>
Then there comes in another body of Regular officers whose duties will be specially concerned with the horses required for the Regulars&#x2014;I mean the Remount officers. We propose to strengthen the staff of the Remount officers in the Command and to set them at work to co-operate with the adjutants. We shall not need to classify every horse in every county. There are remote parts of counties where, for instance, there are only draft horses; it will be unnecessary to make a search there. But applying the principle of fair distribution of the burden, the plan <i>is</i> that a list should be made out of the horses that are reasonably available and necessary in each county in order that there may be a complete view of what horses there are there and for what purposes they would serve. The Yeomanry will not have their horses interfered with; the horses that they have they will keep. The regulations will require rather a better class of horse for the Regulars than suffices for Territorial work, for Regular horses may have to go abroad and have very rough experience.
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0010"/>
<col>11</col>
It is, therefore, desirable that they should not be younger when sent to service than six years. Steps have been taken with a view of putting the ages and training of Cavalry horses on a better footing. I shall, however, say nothing upon that just now, because there is a Question on the Notice Paper in the name of Lord Willoughby de Broke which deals with this subject, which is being investigated at the present moment by a very strong Committee of the War Office, and steps are being taken in order to determine the standards up to which Cavalry horses ought to come in the future. As I say, I will not go into that matter now, but will do so next week when I reply to the noble Lord's question.<lb/>
The work of the General Officers, co-operating with the County Associations, will be to sift out the horses which are to be for the use of the Territorials on mobilisation and the horses that will be required for the Regulars on mobilisation, and to classify and assign the particular horses; and when mobilisation comes then the old powers of the Army Act apply and there will be a right to take the horses. The price, I hope, will be agreed upon in many cases beforehand in time of peace. That is the process which seems to be popular already in some parts of the country. If there is any dispute, it is, as I have said, to be settled by the County Court Judge, but the taking of the horses is not delayed. We are making arrangements for the establishment of mobilisation centres to which the horses will be sent, and then delivery will be taken over by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, who will undertake the distribution. In this way we hope to prevent overlapping between the interests of the Regulars and the Territorials. The veterinary assistance that is required will be provided by the General Officers Commanding-in-Chief, and as I have said, we propose to give extra assistance to the remount staffs. The money now spent on registration will be no longer necessary, and we shall devote that money and any further sum that may be required to improving the remount and veterinary staffs.<lb/>
I have explained the general purpose of the provisions contained in the Bill now before your Lordships. The important clause is Clause 4&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<col>12</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00149"><i>Amendment of section one hundred and fourteen of the Army Act with respect to lists of carriages and animals.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00150"><b>4.</b>&#x2014;(1) The power conferred on police authorities by section one hundred and fourteen of the Army Act of causing lists to be made out of persons liable to furnish carriages and animals and of the number and description of the carriages and animals of such persons may in England and Scotland be exercised either by the police authority or by the county association established under the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act, 1907, and accordingly in that section the words "the authority hereinafter mentioned" shall be substituted for the words" the police authority," wherever those words occur, and at the end of the section the following subsection shall be added:
<quote>"(4) The authority for the purposes of this section shall in England and Scotland be either the police authority or the county association established under the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act, 1907, and in Ireland the police authority."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00151">(2) After subsection (1) of the same section the following subsection shall be inserted:
<quote>"(1A) For the purpose of assisting the authority hereinafter mentioned in the preparation of such list as aforesaid, any proper officer authorised in that behalf by the authority shall be entitled at all reasonable times to enter any premises in which he has reason to believe that any carriages or animals are kept, and to inspect any carriages or animals which may be found therein.</quote>
<quote>"If any such officer so authorised is obstructed in the exercise of his powers under this provision, a justice of the peace may, if satisfied by information on oath that the officer has been so obstructed, issue a search warrant authorising the constable named therein, accompanied by the officer, to enter the premises in respect of which the obstruction took place at any time between six o'clock in the morning and nine o'clock in the evening, and to inspect any carriages or animals that may be found therein.</quote>
<quote>"In this provision the expression 'propel officer' means any officer or person of such rank, class, or description as may be specified in an order of the Army Council made for the purpose."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00152">As your Lordships will see, this clause enables either the police authority or the County Association&#x2014;not merely the police authority, as at the present time&#x2014;to make the list; and it gives authority to enter, and to obtain, if necessary, a magistrate's order to enter premises if there is obstruction. Then it enables the Army Council through the General Officers Commanding-in-Chief to detail to the assistance of the County Associations, or the police authority, as the case may be, the proper Regular officers to whom I have already referred. These officers will be, of course, under the command of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, but will be detailed to the assistance of the Associations, and we have every confidence that the Associations and the General Officers Commanding-in-Chief will work so well together that friction is not likely to arise. I have now
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0011"/>
<col>13</col>
explained the general provisions of the Bill. I can only say that in this, as in other matters, one is in the region of speculation, but this horse question is so difficult that we felt that unless some vigorous and energetic legislative steps were taken it would be hopeless to get it on a satisfactory footing; and I venture to commend the provisions in this Bill as an attempt, made after much consideration, to solve a problem that has weighed upon us all like a nightmare for a long time past.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00153">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Haldane.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00154"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not desire, I need hardly say, to in any way oppose the Second Reading of this Bill. It is obvious that the Bill must be passed, and there is nothing in it that any one would desire to see rejected. But at the same time I do feel that particular attention ought to be drawn to the new Clause 4, which obviously the Secretary of State for War regards as the most important new matter in the Bill, and I desire to do so, though I feel sure that all your Lordships on this side of the House are just as anxious as the Secretary of State for War to see this question solved and to help in its solution. I cannot help regretting that the noble Viscount did not explain a little more fully why this clause is in this particular form. The clause seems to me to be much more stringent&#x2014;I would almost say more roughshod&#x2014;than is necessary in the circumstances of the case, though I am quite certain that the noble Viscount in drafting it in this form had no such intention. The clause, however, authorises the proper officer to enter at all reasonable times any premises in which he has reason to believe any carriages or animals are kept. What exactly is intended by the conferring of those powers? Is it that an officer is to start out in a motor-car at 8 or 9 o'clock one morning and make a tour of a county, calling everywhere? He may visit premises on a day when it is snowing&#x2014;for this is to be done in the winter time&#x2014;and say to the person concerned, "I have called to see your horses; bring them out; I am going to walk them, to trot them, to gallop them, and to veterinarily inspect them, and generally turn your establishment inside out. You have had
<col>14</col>
no notice of this, but I am here with power under the Army (Annual) Act to do this." The clause as drafted may work in a most unfortunate way in making what the noble Viscount is endeavouring to do unpopular, and this will be of no use if it is not done with the hearty goodwill of all owners of horses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00155"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: He would be a very bad officer who behaved in the way the noble Earl suggests, and he would be promptly removed from his duties. It is, however, impossible to draft a clause in a legal form unless you provide for all cases which may arise. We certainly have no intention of using the powers in the way indicated by the noble Earl.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00156"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: I understand it is the intention that these things should be publicly done and done with the greatest convenience to the countryside. I ant not a lawyer&#x2014;I do not know whether I ought to say I am sorry or glad&#x2014;but as the clause is drafted it seems to me to confer stringent powers which might be badly worked. I trust that the Secretary of State for War will see that the convenience of horse owners is considered as much as possible. That was the only point I desired to make when I read the Bill, but having heard the speech of the Secretary of State this afternoon I desire to make one other. The noble Viscount made a very strong statement on the subject of the <i>personnel</i> of the Army. He told us definitely, from information he has at his disposal, that he is now prepared to mobilise four Divisions in ten days and the two other Divisions in twenty-one days.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00157"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Except for horses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00158"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: I quite understand that the noble Viscount was referring to the <i>personnel</i> only. Those who have heard the questions asked by my noble friend the Duke of Bedford this session and the answers which have been given to them have drawn a very different estimate as to the time that it would take to mobilise the Expeditionary Force. I think that after the very definite statement of the Secretary of State&#x2014;the most definite statement that has been made for many years on such a subject&#x2014;we
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0012"/>
<col>15</col>
have a right to ask that figures showing how it is arrived at should be laid before Parliament, and I suggest to the noble Viscount that he should take this into consideration with a view of laying figures to prove effectively to the country the accuracy of his strong and emphatic statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00159"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like, as chairman of a County Association, to give to my noble friend the Secretary of State for War the assurance that at any rate as far as we are concerned we shall render every possible assistance to him in carrying out his plan. I have always felt that the police were hardly the authority to carry out this work. It is obvious that a policeman is not a judge of horses. One very useful result, however, of the police census is that they have found out the actual number of horses there are in this country. As far as I could make out from the figures which the noble Viscount quoted, we would require 126,000 horses out of the 500,000 which are considered serviceable for military purposes. I would ask my noble friend to take care, if this work is to be handed over to the County Associations, that very definite instructions are given to them as to the qualifications required of the horses&#x2014;that is to say, as to their age, whether they are fit for draft or the saddle, and all those detailed explanations without which we should be entirely at sea.<lb/>
As I understand it, the arrangement is to be this, that the General Officer commanding the district is to nominate a certain number of officers, who presumably will either be adjutants of Yeomanry or Remount officers, or officers specially qualified to judge of horses. But I would ask whether it would not be possible for members of County Associations themselves to form part of these officers. In my own Association we have three gentlemen who have commanded the Yeomanry of the county, in addition to the officer who now commands that force. They would be able to give very useful information, and would be exceedingly good judges of the horses required for the Yeomanry. I think there ought to be some elasticity in this matter. I had at one time an idea that we might get rid of the police altogether, but I observe from a statement in another place that
<col>16</col>
the police will give valuable assistance. For instance, in the case of any county&#x2014;I there will not be one&#x2014;not undertaking this duty, then the police will fill the vacuum. In addition to that, in the case of a recalcitrant owner who objected to his stables being inspected, all that the police officer would have to do would be to get an order from a magistrate under this Act. I do not share in the alarm of the noble Earl opposite as to the compulsory character of Clause 4. If he will look at it again he will see that it only says that they are to make out a list of the persons liable to furnish carriages and animals, and of the number and description of the carriages and animals, and to inspect. You cannot get any information at all unless you inspect, and I do not see how my noble friend could possibly have omitted that from the clause.<lb/>
One other point. There has never been a year in which there has not been a dispute about the amount granted to innkeepers for the provision of meals to the troops. I was happy to see that in another place it was stated by Colonel Seely that this schedule would be examined, but I should like to have an assurance from my noble friend the Secretary of State that before another year elapses he will examine it. I am aware that the amount of allowance must be absolutely defined in the Schedule, but I would ask any one whether it is proper to allow a soldier only 2&#x00BD;<i>d.</i> for supper and 4<i>d.</i> for breakfast while he is on the march and performing heavy duty. Surely this schedule is more adapted to the gentlemen who make their headquarters on the Embankment than to members of His Majesty's Forces. I hope that before another year elapses the noble Viscount will look through the schedule and redress what has been a long-standing grievance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00160"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL FORTESCUE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say, as chairman of a County Association, that I think the scheme foreshadowed by the noble Viscount is one that ought to be capable of being worked without any great difficulty. I do not share the apprehensions of the noble Earl, Lord Donoughmore, about remount officers riding roughshod over people whose horses they have to inspect and register. A considerable number of these officers will be adjutants of local units. These gentlemen have the re-
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0013"/>
<col>17</col>
cruiting of their own corps very much at heart, and they know that the worst possible thing they could do for recruiting would be to upset any of the people of the locality with whom they come in contact.<lb/>
There are some points on which I hope guidance will be given to County Associations in the arrangements that will have to be made under these proposals. The noble Viscount, if I understood him correctly, suggested that in a great many cases arrangements as to the price at which horses might be taken would be made beforehand in time of peace hope there will be no very rigid limitations on the price that may be paid for horses. I believe that far the greater number of horses that broke down in South Africa broke down from want of condition. It is notorious that none did better than the London 'bus horses, which had been having hard food and had been doing regular work. In my own opinion it would pay over and over again to give better prices for horses that had a year's corn in them than to give &#x00A3;30 or &#x00A3;40 for soft animals direct out of the farmer's hands. If you buy a horse at &#x00A3;100 that will last six mouths, that horse does not cost you so much as two at &#x00A3;50 which only last three months apiece. It would be of great assistance if it could be understood beforehand that remount officers will not be limited in price provided they get a good article for the money.<lb/>
Another point on which we shall require guidance will be as to the exemptions. I understand that horses owned by doctors would be exempt, and probably exemption would be given in a great many cases to people who only own one horse. I think such an exemption would be a cheap one to give, because a man who only keeps one horse can very seldom afford to keep a good one. There are, however, many horses belonging to village tradesmen which from running about the country every day are in excellent condition, and I think it would be well if in such cases Remount Officers were to be allowed to offer good prices for animals that were sound and serviceable.</membercontribution></p>

<title>DECEASED SEAMEN'S UNCLAIMED BALANCES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00195"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member> rose to refer to the account (presented by His Majesty's command) of the sums received and paid in respect of wages and effects of deceased seamen in the year ended 31st March, 1910, and to the unclaimed balance of &#x00A3;15,775 10<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> which has accumulated since the year 1904; to ask whether unclaimed balances of this kind are devoted to purposes of material advantage to seamen, and if not, whether the President of the Board of Trade will consider the desirability of so doing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00196">The noble Lord said: My Lords, as you will see from the Question that stands in my name on the Paper, there was on March 31, 1910, an unclaimed balance of deceased seamen's wages amounting to &#x00A3;15,775 10<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.,</i> which had accumulated since the year 1904. The White Paper which gives these figures does not say how long this accumulation is to run on, nor does it give any information as to the purpose, if any, to which these unclaimed balances are put, and I am asking for information on this matter. It seems to me a reasonable proposition that moneys of the kind which have been earned by seafarers and have fallen into the hands of the Government should be devoted in some practical way to the interests of seafarers. If they are not made use of, or if they are automatically swallowed up in meeting State expenses, then I submit to your Lordships that it is time there should be a change, and that accumulations such as I have referred to should be put to some purpose whereby they form the nucleus of a general fund for the use of British subjects serving in our mercantile ships. I beg to put the Question standing in my name.</p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00197"><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I regret that the noble Lord who represents the Board of Trade is unable to be in his place to-day, and with your Lordships' permission I will reply to the noble Lord opposite. The earliest enactment of which we have a note, dealing with the unclaimed wages and effects of deceased seamen, is Cap. 73, 37 Geo. III. Section 8 of this Act provided that all wages not claimed within three years should be paid to the use of the Seamen's Hospital of the port to which the ship belonged on winch the deceased seaman served. If there was no Seamen's Hospital at the particular port, then the amount was to be applied to the use and benefit of the old and disabled seamen of the port. By Cap. 52 of 4 and 5 Win. IV, Sections 30 and 31, the procedure was varied, but the application of the unclaimed balances practically remained as before. As a matter of practice these sums were paid over to the trustees of the Merchant Seamen's Pension Fund at the different ports, and formed part of the income out of which pensions were paid to seamen and their widows and children. The Merchant Seamen's Pension Fund having become insolvent it was wound up under Cap. 102, 14 and 15 Victoria (Merchant Seamen's Fund Winding-up Act), and all its liabilities were taken over by the Government; and by the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854 (Cap. 104, 17 and 18 Viet.) Section 202, the unclaimed wages and effects of deceased seamen became payable to the Exchequer as a set off against the liabilities above referred to. The financial result of the Merchant Seamen's Fund Winding-up Act is as follows:&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<title>EMIGRATION.</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00200"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH</member> rose to call attention to the unanimous resolution of the last Imperial Conference, that "it is desirable to encourage British emigrants to proceed to British Colonies rather than to foreign countries"; and to inquire whether His Majesty's Government are still of this opinion; and, if so, whether they have taken or intend to take any steps to give effect to it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00201">The noble Duke said: My Lords, in the course of the next three weeks, as your Lordships are aware, His Majesty's Government are going to meet the Colonial Ministers at the Imperial Conference, and that being the case I am anxious to remind your Lordships that among the various Imperial questions which His Majesty's Government will discuss with the Dominion Ministers the question of emigration will arise. At the last Conference, in the year 1907, His Majesty's Ministers together with the representatives of the Overseas Dominions passed a very strong and remarkable Resolution dealing with the subject of emigration. That Resolution runs as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"That it is desirable to encourage British emigrants to proceed to British Colonies rather than to foreign countries; that the Imperial Government he requested to co-operate with any Colonies desiring emigrants in assisting suitable persons to emigrate."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00202">Since that Resolution was adopted&#2014;and I may observe, in passing, that the Resolution was carried unanimously&#x2014;so far as I am aware His Majesty's Government have done nothing whatsoever in this matter of emigration. I have searched in vain the various official publications which have been made from time to time by the Colonial Office and other Departments. The most I have succeeded in discovering is a short paragraph stating the views of His Majesty's Government, and perhaps your Lordships will permit me to read to you the full extent, so far as I am aware, of what His Majesty's Government have done
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0017"/>
<col>25</col>
with regard to emigration since the year 1907. I can assure you it will not occupy very much of your Lordships' time. This is the note in one of the Blue-books published by the Colonial Office&#x2014;
<quote>"The view taken respecting the subject-matter of this Resolution was that, in the absence of any request from one or other of the Dominions for co-operation in a particular matter, the needs of the situation were, as stated by Colonel Seely in the House of Commons on June 22, sufficiently met by the offices of the self-governing Dominions in the United Kingdom, and by the Emigrants Information Office, which afford fell and trust worthy information to intending emigrants to the British Dominions. The whole question is, however, again under consideration."</quote>
That was published in July, 1910. Well, since the whole matter was again under consideration, I was in hopes that when the Colonial Office published a Blue-book last month some further information as to the views of His Majesty's Government on emigration might be forthcoming. But I have searched those Papers very carefully, and I am unable to discover any trace whatever of the views of His Majesty's Government upon this very important subject. I venture to ask the representative of the Colonial Office this evening whether His Majesty's Government still adhere to the Resolution passed in 1907, and carried unanimously at a meeting of the Conference at which I might observe the present Home Secretary was present and endorsed the Resolution; whether they have decided to modify their views, or whether they have completely changed them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00203">Whatever the views of His Majesty's Government on the question of emigration may be&#x2014;and I shall listen to them with the greatest interest&#x2014;we cannot be blind to this fact, that public opinion on this matter has considerably matured since the year 1907. In the first place, there is home opinion. What is the view of people in this country? I do not deny for one moment that there are many individuals who think that the emigration of adult labour from this country may involve the departure of those who are considered the best blood. Furthermore, questions of the defence of Great Britain itself may suggest to some minds the importance and necessity of keeping here at home as many individuals as possible. But, admitting this much with regard to adult labour, I believe that there is a growing
<col>26</col>
body of opinion that a considerable amount might be done in the direction of child emigration. It is felt that children at fourteen years of age should still be supervised, and should not be entirely out of control of some authority. The Prime Minister himself has endorsed this view.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00204">But when we turn to Colonial opinion what do we find? We find that the supply of adult labour from the North-West of Europe is to a certain extent slowing off, that the vast stream of emigrants from Northern Europe is not so apparent as it was in recent years. At the same time, Australia will shortly require a great amount of extra labour; in Canada we know that the demand for labour already exists. In fact the Dominion Governments themselves are prepared officially to entice labour to their shores. I do not think any one in this House will dispute these facts. We have all seen the advertisements that are published by Colonial Governments, and we are equally aware that there are a great number of Dominion officials throughout this country anxiously advertising the importance and the relative merits of their different Dominions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00205">There are three kinds of emigrants with whom we can deal. In the first place, there is the child emigrant; secondly, there is the woman emigrant; and, finally, the adult labour emigrant and his family. Let me deal first with adult labour, because it is, perhaps, the most controversial and the most complex of the three propositions. I do not deny, as I have said, that there is a reluctance in this country to part with adult labour. There is a feeling that we may be getting rid of our best blood. On the other hand, we know perfectly well that the Dominions are not anxious to have&#x2014;indeed will not have&#x2014;what we may call the failures here at home. So we start with that difficulty&#x2014;the reluctance, on the one hand, of the people here at home to encourage the emigration of adult labour because of the fear that we may be getting rid of our best blood, and the fact, on the other hand, that the Dominions are not prepared to accept our worst.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00206">And when we come to the particular kind of adult labour there is this further difficulty. The Dominions require, above all, the agricultural labourer. There is very little, if any, machinery in this country
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0018"/>
<col>27</col>
for training an individual who wishes to become an agricultural labourer in the Dominions, and, moreover, there is a very right and proper desire to absorb all the agricultural labourers we can on our own soil at home. So I fancy I am right in saying that organised labour would be opposed to any scheme of emigration of adult labour, and that being the case I presume that His Majesty's Government, with decent reticence of language, will endorse the view of organised labour. Therefore I will not discuss the question of the emigration of adults further this evening. I will dismiss it with this one observation. If you are able in this country to absorb most of the adult labour, indeed, if you are able to absorb all of it, are you quite certain that you are justified in asking individuals to remain permanently in this country in the position of artisans and farm labourers when you know that there is a stream of emigration from the Northwest of Europe going to our Dominions beyond the seas, and that these individuals, after a very short period of time in the Dominions, are able to rise and merge in the middle classes?</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00207">Let me turn to the, I think, more important consideration&#x2014;the question of child emigration. Children who are qualified to emigrate can be divided into three classes. There are those who are trained in private institutions like that of the Waifs and Strays and Dr. Barnardo's Homes; there are the Poor-law children emigrated by boards of guardians under the supervision of the Local Government Board; and there are the children who are trained in the industrial and reformatory schools, which are under the supervision of the Home Office. Every noble Lord in this House is aware of the fact that the Dominion Governments are very glad indeed to receive children who have been trained in private institutions. Dr. Barnardo's Homes have turned out something like 22,000 boys in the last twenty or thirty years, who have been emigrated to the Dominions; and all of them, with the exception of two per cent., have proved themselves useful and efficient citizens. No one will deny the good work which these voluntary institutions do in this country so far as these children are concerned. Both parties to the agreement are content&#x2014;the Colonies on the one hand, and public opinion here at home on the other.</p>
<col>28</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00208">How does the case stand with regard to Poor-law children and children trained in industrial schools? In the year 1909, 500 children were emigrated under the management and jurisdiction of the Local Government Board, and 200 children were emigrated from industrial and reformatory schools. What do we know about the merits of these children after they have emigrated? Let me remind your Lordships of the view of the Dominion Governments with regard to the merits of the Poor-law children who have been emigrated. It is essential, I think, if we want to arrive at the truth, to know what the view of the Overseas Governments themselves is. I will read an extract from a report last year by the Canadian Government inspector. Dealing with these Poor-law children he says &#x2014;
<quote>"I have no hesitation in saying, after many years of official experience, that there have been fewer complaints concerning the character and industry of this class of newcomer than of any other. The child emigrant comes to our shores at a plastic age. He has been subject to the careful oversight and strict but kind discipline which characterise the homes and schools of the Old Country. The Home Office and Poor-law schools in Great Britain are, with few exceptions, splendidly managed, and the training afforded the children is thorough and comprehensive; therefore, if the child has been enrolled at an early age, one has reason to expect a superior type of immigrant. The character of this pre-emigration training is taken as a guarantee of the fitness of the child for Canadian citizenship, seeing that he has undergone a careful supervision and education in a certified home or school."</quote>
That is the view of the Dominion Government inspector on the value and utility of children from Poor-law and industrial schools.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00209">Now let us look at the reverse side of the picture. What is the view of the Local Government Board officials in this country? Last year a circular-letter was issued by the Local Government Board to boards of guardians throughout England, in which it is stated that&#x2014;
<quote>"Careful inquiries conducted by competent investigators show that emigration affords one of the surest means of extricating children from pauperism and the influence of evil surroundings. At present only a comparatively small use is made of this method, but looking to the satisfactory results obtained the Board considers that guardians would do well in further exercising their powers of emigrating children."</quote>
When we have the testimony of the Overseas Dominions and of officials here at home as to the beneficial results accruing from
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0019"/>
<col>29</col>
the emigration of Poor-law children, surely I am justified in urging upon His Majesty's Government that the time is ripe for a consideration of this subject, and that child emigration might be conducted on a larger and more comprehensive scale. Let us bear in mind the fact that at the present time there are 70,000 Poor-law children. Our obligation towards these children ceases at the age of fourteen. After that age we have no longer any jurisdiction over them. They are then turned out into the streets. Many of them, I fear, drift into what are known as "blind-alley" Occupations; they get employment as van boys, errand boys, and in occupations of that description; and at the age of sixteen they are asked to make way for other boys at fourteen. Can you be surprised that these children learn the very worst kind of street habits, and that many of them, who leave Poor-law schools at the age of fourteen admirably trained and efficient in character in every sense of the word, frequently, from the fact that there is no supervision over them whatever, commit some offence which brings them to the reformatory school; and then they may no longer be qualified as emigrants, because the Colonial Dominions are very reluctant to accept children from reformatory schools, though in some cases they do accept them from industrial schools. The question arises, What are you going to do with these children at the age of fourteen? How are you going to handle them? How are you going to supervise them? I really do think that the public demands that we should consider this subject and, do something for these children. Therefore I ask His Majesty's Government why we should not emigrate them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00210">Then the question arises, how many of these children is it right and desirable that we should emigrate? Fortunately, to-day the Labour Exchanges put us in a position to ascertain how many of these children can be employed in useful and proper situations. But even if you were able to absorb half or even two-thirds of these children in useful and suitable situations&#x2014;and I do not think it will be possible to show that that is the case&#x2014;you still have a residuum to deal with, and I claim that it is in connection with that residuum that some system of emigration should be forthcoming. We know that if we do emigrate them to our Dominions the Colonies are
<col>30</col>
very glad to receive them. I noticed a paragraph in <i>The Times</i> the other day dealing with what is known as the Dreadnought Farm&#x2014;a farm started in Australia for the purpose of receiving children and training them and making them into efficient citizens. This is a phrase that caught my eye&#x2014;
<quote>"The Dreadnought Farm boys are making an excellent impression. Pastoralists and farmers are urging the extension of the movement."</quote>
It may be asserted that for His Majesty's Government in any way to involve themselves directly in child emigration would impose an extra burden on the citizens of this country. I do not deny that contention. But, on the other hand, we have to bear these facts in mind. As I understand, His Majesty's Government in the course of a short time propose to develop still further our continuation schools. Even if you keep these children at home you will have to pay for their supervision and control in the continuation schools; and if they are not fortunate enough to get the training of a continuation school, I fear they may drift, as some of them do, into the criminal classes, and, thus become a burden to the taxpayer, or become improvident and useless citizens and consequently become a burden on the rates. Surely it is our desire, and it is, above all, the desire of these children themselves, that they should become an asset to the British Empire and be of some use to their fellow-countrymen. They do not want, through lack of opportunity of training in their early youth, to become a burden in their later lives to their fellow-citizens.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00211">The conclusions I arrive at are these: that with regard to children directly under State control&#x2014;that is, Poor-law children and children in the industrial schools&#x2014;His Majesty's Government might with reason consider the possibility of emigrating them on a larger scale; and that with regard to these voluntary societies, of which I think there are something like 1,000 in this country, His Majesty's Government might consider them and their work with more sympathy and with a more favourable eye. I have recently had the honour of meeting many of the representatives of these voluntary societies. Their work is very remarkable indeed; I think we may say it is splendid. They do feel&#x2014;and in saying this I do not think
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0020"/>
<col>31</col>
I am giving expression to any confidence on their part which I ought to preserve&#x2014;they do feel strongly that the Government might consider them with greater sympathy. They think, on the one hand, that financial assistance might be given to them for the passage of the children who are emigrated; also that a closer touch might be preserved between the Government and these societies; and that a closer supervision of the children might be exercised. Bear in mind that whereas the Dominions send over representatives to this country and supervise these children here before they are sent to the Colonies, these voluntary societies are obliged, having emigrated these children, them selves to pay for inspectors in the Dominions to see that the children are properly and intelligently employed. This becomes a great financial burden on these voluntary societies, and they could employ their money more profitably in training the children here in England. They feel that the time has now come when His Majesty's Government might come forward and themselves appoint inspectors in the Dominions to exercise control over these children and report direct to the Home Government as to their behaviour and their bringing up. I cannot help feeling that if His Majesty's Government could see their way to consider such a proposal it would strengthen their hands in any negotiations and deliberations which they may have with the representatives of the Dominions at the forthcoming Imperial Conference.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00212">I now turn to the consideration of the question of the emigration of women. The case can be put quite briefly and concisely. As your Lordships are aware, there are a million more women in England than there are men, and there are a million more men in the Dominions than there are women. There is great competition at home among women for all kinds of work, and there is a great need for women in the Dominions. I do not suppose that any one would deny that the disparity in the distribution of the sexes is certainly, to say the least of it, unfortunate. Considerable efforts are being made to redress the balance. I dare say the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies will say that this adjustment, this redistribution of the female population of the Empire, can be allowed to work out automatically. I do not deny that. Possibly that is a right contention. All I claim is this&#x2014;and I
<col>32</col>
urge it on behalf of those ladies who have taken an active interest in the welfare of their own sex who desire to emigrate from England&#x2014;that it is only right that all emigration conducted on behalf of women leaving these shores should be done in as decent and proper a manner as possible.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00213">Now what are the conditions that these ladies claim should be observed? They ask that there should be, in the first place, proper supervision over all female emigrants during the voyage; secondly, that there should be proper hostel accommodation in the Dominions on the arrival of these women; thirdly, that some society should exist, either voluntary or under the State, which should supervise and control these people when they arrive; and, furthermore, that it is essential to see that the women are placed in suitable and proper situations. Of course, these voluntary associations do all they can. They exercise what supervision lies in their power; but we are coming to a time when we are dealing with enormous numbers. It is a question of a million women, and it is impossible to suppose that these voluntary associations can deal with such large numbers and exercise that complete control which those who are responsible for the women emigration movement are anxious to see effected. They would like the Dominion Governments to make themselves responsible for seeing that these women get into suitable and proper situations, or the Home Government themselves to undertake that obligation, or, perhaps better still, that both the Home and the Dominion Governments should combine together and work in co-operation in this matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00214">I trust that it will not be urged by the representative of His Majesty's Government that any emigration policy to the Dominions involves necessarily the draining of our best blood. I do not think that that is an argument which will really bear close and careful analysis. After all, these Poor-law children are not our best citizens and they are not our worst citizens. They are average, sensible, good English boys. We know the Dominions are glad to have them, and I think we should do all in our power to see that they are not unnecessarily forced to remain here at home. So far as the women are concerned, I do not suppose it will be urged that we are necessarily
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0021"/>
<col>33</col>
sending out our best from this country, because that rather involves an impolite reflection on those who do not undertake women I do think that the time has emigration. But with regard to the come, considering that they wish to emigrate in such large numbers, when His Majesty's Government might usefully and properly see that better control and supervision are associated with them in their journey to the Dominions and also when they arrive there.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00215">I trust also that it will not be claimed that any attempt to develop this emigration policy is merely a desire on the part of some individuals in this country to get rid of our surplus population and consequently avoid any agrarian legislation. I only mention this fact because I noticed the other day, in a newspaper which is a strong supporter of the policy of noble Lords opposite, an article dealing with the question of Scottish emigration. This paper suggested, in a leading article, that the reason why so many Scottish farmers were forced to emigrate was largely, if not mainly, due to the action of some Scottish Peers in this House who two years ago did not see fit to pass the Scottish Land Bill. I sincerely trust that there will be no suggestion made&#x2014;I feel sure His Majesty's Ministers will not make it&#x2014;that because a scheme is put forward for the emigration either of children or adults from these shores to the Dominions, it is necessarily done with a desire to get rid of our surplus population and to avoid agrarian legislation. Nothing could be more untrue, unfair and unjust. Only this week we have two Bills before your Lordships' House, introduced by noble Lords who sit on this side, dealing with the land problem. All of us in this House, irrespective of Party, would like to see many of the questions associated with the soil solved. But of this I am convinced, that whatever our agrarian policy may be, whether it comes from this side or from noble Lords opposite, or, better still, whether it is the result of joint action on the part of both Parties in the State, it will still be essential to have some kind of emigration policy, not to supplant, but to supplement, any agrarian solution at which you might arrive; for even if you solve to-day the agrarian problem, in sixteen or twenty years you will again be faced with a similar problem to deal with the surplus population.
<col>34</col>
Therefore in order to make an agrarian policy successful it is, in my humble opinion, essential to supplement it with an equally comprehensive scheme of State emigration.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00216">Finally I venture to urge this consideration on His Majesty's Ministers. They are going shortly to meet the Dominion Ministers. At the Imperial Conference they will discuss many problems connected with subjects of Imperial importance. Among those problems for consideration I submit that they cannot regard with indifference this question of the inequality of the distribution of the population throughout the Empire, and the means adopted by voluntary effort and voluntary societies in this country and also by the Dominion Governments themselves to redress that balance. I beg to ask the Question that stands in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00217"><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Duke has devoted the greater part of his speech to two aspects of this question on which I think a particularly strong case can be made out in favour of emigration from this country to the Colonies. I refer to the emigration of children, which, as he rightly says, has met with great success where it has been carried out, and it has already been carried out largely; and to the emigration of the surplus population of women from this country to those Colonies where there is a great preponderance of men, which, of course, must recommend itself to everybody if only on the purely logical ground. But, after all, at the back of these two questions you have the question of principle, as to what line the State is going to adopt towards the whole question of emigration, and there you have two alternatives. You have to consider whether you are going to start a system of emigration organised and subsidised by the State, or whether you are going to have, what we have at the present moment, a general policy of encouraging British emigrants to go to British colonies rather than to foreign countries.<lb/>
With regard to the first of those two alternatives, which I think was the principle recommended to us by the noble Duke to be applied to women and children, I have only to say this, that that system was not the policy of the Government of which the noble Duke was a member;
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0022"/>
<col>35</col>
that it is not the policy of the present Government; and that I think one may fairly say it is not the policy of the Dominions themselves. Nobody can read the account that was published in the Bluebook of the discussion at the last Imperial Conference on the question of emigration without coming to that conclusion. In the first place, there was not one Dominion representative who asked for it, and in so far as it was mentioned at all it was rather opposed by them, and on one simple ground. As was said more than once in the course of that discussion, one of the most vital questions to the Dominions is the class of emigrant sent out. The more of the suitable class of men they can get the better they are pleased; but there are classes of people in this country whom they would rather not receive as immigrants. But if you have a system which is controlled, organised, and paid for by this country, it would deprive the Colonies to a very great extent of any control over the class of men we might choose to emigrate from this country under that system. Moreover, a general system of State subsidised emigration from this country is one which has not been asked for by the Dominions.<lb/>
I pass to the other alternative&#x2014;the policy of encouraging British emigrants to go to British Colonies rather than to foreign countries. As to the extreme desirability of that I think everybody is in agreement. The only question with regard to it is as to the actual means which are adopted to carry out that policy. I will state to your Lordships what are the forces at work upon that at the present time. First of all, you have the extremely efficient and effective agencies largely maintained by the self-governing Dominions for placing before intending emigrants the advantages of the Colonies which they represent. Then you have another extremely efficient organisation in the Emigrants Information Office. That is entirely an advisory body. It has no executive functions, and it devotes itself entirely to advising intending emigrants who go to it for advice in the best interests of themselves. It does not pretend to be an office for the purpose of advising intending emigrants to go especially to the Colonies, but, as a matter of fact, in at least nine cases out of ten its advice to intending emigrants is to go to the Colonies because the openings for these men are so much better there than
<col>36</col>
in foreign countries. They are doing extremely useful work with their publications and general advice, and there is no doubt at all that the excellent work which they are accomplishing is largely contributing to the stream of emigration which is flowing towards our Colonies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00218"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: As the noble Lord is dealing with the Emigration Bureau, perhaps he will bear in mind when he says that it is an excellent institution, which I would not deny, that at the last Imperial Conference Mr. Deakin spent a good time in criticising the work of the Bureau, and brought it prominently to the notice of the President of the Local Government Board and the Colonial Secretary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00219"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I would ask the noble Duke to refresh his memory by looking at the reply which was made to Mr. Deakin's remarks by Mr. John Burns. From the standpoint upon which I have explained that the Emigration Information Office always acts&#x2014;namely, to advise simply and solely in the best interests of the intending emigrant&#x2014;I think Mr. Burns completely vindicated the office from the charges made against it by Mr. Deakin. Another important agent in this matter is the Labour Exchange. When vacancies are announced in the self-governing Dominions they are advertised in the Labour Exchanges here, and men are emigrated to fill them. Then my noble friend Lord Ashby St. Ledgers reminds me that the Chelsea Hospital Commissioners now enable pensioners to commute their pensions in order to go abroad and settle, and I understand from my noble friend that in almost every case, if not in every single case, those men who take advantage of this go to the Colonies and not to foreign countries.<lb/>
Then there is that large number of private bodies to whom the noble Duke referred, who are doing extremely useful work in emigrating people to the Colonies. The results of that work are extremely striking, and, if I may, I will state those results. In the year 1910 over two-thirds of the total number of emigrants from these shores went to British Colonies. That is a very great change from the condition of things that existed a comparatively short time ago. As your Lordships are aware, practically the only foreign competitor for British emigrants at the present time is
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0023"/>
<col>37</col>
the United States of America. In 1888 they absorbed 72 per cent. of the total number of British emigrants; in 1906 the figure fell to 47 per cent.; in 1909 to 40 per cent.; and last year to 31 per cent. So that every year we see that an increasingly larger proportion of the emigrants who leave these shores go to British Colonies. To show how rapidly this change is taking place I may mention that in 1910 94,000 more emigrants left these shores than in the previous year, and out of that number no fewer than 77,000 are accounted for by the increased emigration to the Dominions. Your Lordships will see from that that the current is setting very strongly in the direction of the Dominions.<lb/>
I now come to another form of emigration. I refer to people who are assisted in various ways to go out. I leave out of account the assistance given by purely private bodies, for we have no information upon that, and I leave out of account also the assisted passages given by certain of the self-governing Colonies. There are two principal sources of public money by which people are assisted to emigrate from this country. Men and their families are emigrated through the funds obtained under the Unemployed Workmen's Act, and there is also the source to which the noble Duke referred&#x2014;the funds of boards of guardians. Since the Unemployed Workmen's Act came into force 5,458 emigrants, with 10,460 dependants, have been emigrated, and only 27 out of those 5,458 with their dependants went to foreign countries, the whole of the rest remaining within the Empire. The figures as regards boards of guardians are equally remarkable. In the twenty-one years during which they have carried out this work&#x2014;namely, from 1890 to 1910, in-clusive&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00220"><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: You are referring to Poor-law children now.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00221"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Yes, they are mostly Poor-law children. During that period the boards of guardians assisted 9,300, of whom only forty-seven went to foreign countries. Every day the tide of emigration turns more strongly towards the Colonies, and these people go to the Colonies for the simple reason that the openings are better there and there are greater advantages in other ways. They go to a land where the same speech obtains, where to a great extent the same laws obtain, and where they find themselves
<col>38</col>
in conditions much more like those, to which they are accustomed than would be the case in any other country. That, and the fact that the openings are, as I have said, actually better, explains why these people are drawn to our own Dominions. The various agencies are doing their work excellently, and it would be difficult to devise means which would really largely increase or improve the perfectly natural flow which is taking place at the present moment. As the noble Duke said, this question is one of those which will come up at the Imperial Conference shortly to be held, and if proposals for closer co-operation between ourselves and the Dominions on the lines that I have indicated with regard to these matters are put forward, all I can say is that we shall do everything we can to meet the wishes of the representatives of the Dominions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00222"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MEATH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was very pleased to hear the noble Duke bring forward this question. It is one in which I have taken a deep interest for many years. At one time the Government did attempt to assist emigration. It will be in your Lordships' recollection that for two years State-aided colonisation was supported by the House of Commons, and &#x00A3;10,000 was voted for two years for the purpose of emigration. The emigrants were principally chosen from Scotland. It was in consequence of an agitation, in which I took part, carried on for some years to try and induce the Government to favour State-directed and State-aided colonisation. Unfortunately the Government of the day did not adopt the scheme in the way which those who originally brought it forward thought was the only practical way. We foreshadowed that it would be a failure, and it proved a failure after two years. It was not, however, a complete failure. There are still a good number of those Colonists on the land in Canada, for it was in Canada that the farms were situated to which the people from Scotland were sent out. But a certain number went away from their farms and into the towns, and that was due to the fact that the people had not been chosen with sufficient care. Some of them were very successful, but there were others who had not got the necessary grit in them or the knowledge to enable them to work their farms properly.<lb/>
Since those days we have learnt something, and I think all who know anything about the subject will agree with me that
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0024"/>
<col>39</col>
the consensus of opinion at this moment is that if anything of the sort is to be done on a large scale it must be done through the children. The children must be trained for Colonial life either at home or in the Colony. The best way, I think, is in the Colony. But it is within your Lordships' knowledge that large numbers are trained at home and sent out by such institutions as Barnardo's, and with very good results. I have just returned from South Africa, and I know that there the immigration of well-trained children would be attended with great success. The difficulty of emigrating people from this country is that many of them, especially those from the towns, have no idea how to work on the land. Many of them have not the stamina, and some of them have not the desire. On the other hand, if boys are sent out in early youth who are well trained and then put on the farms they are taught how to work under the conditions of the Colony, and they become most useful citizens. His Majesty's Government have not shown, through the speech of the noble Lord the Under-Secretary, any very great desire to give assistance towards emigration. The noble Lord could only point to 5,458 emigrants that had been sent out in one year under the Unemployed Workmen's Act. That is not a very large number. The other figure given, the 9,000 odd sent out by boards of guardians, I understand covered a great many years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00223"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Twenty-one years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00224"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MEATH</member><membercontribution>: That is a very small number spread over such a long period. I can hardly call assistance from boards of guardians public assistance; it is certainly assistance from the rates, but not from Imperial funds. If I might be allowed to make a suggestion I would express the hope that more assistance will in the future be given to the societies engaged in this work, and of which the noble Lord spoke in very flattering terms. He said they were doing excellent work. They are. But they lack funds. It appears to me that public money could be very well spent if it was given under certain conditions to these associations, the stipulation being laid down that before the children went out they must be examined by some Government official to see that they had been properly trained. And in order not to stop voluntary contributions it could be laid down that the giving of the public money should be dependent on a
<col>40</col>
certain proportion of voluntary contributions being received. In that way the public purse would be protected and great good would be done. There is no doubt that in this country we do want to train for our Colonies a large number of children who would not in ordinary circumstances be likely to find employment at home. On the other hand, we know that our Colonies are crying out for proper immigrants. They do not want the unemployed man, or the so-called unemployed man. They want the man who is trained to use his hands and has grit in him. I trust that this debate will do some service by causing His Majesty's Government to think about this question; and now that we have so many of the leading men from our Colonies in our midst I hope the Government will consult them as to the best means of assisting emigration through the State.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00225"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to appeal for a few minutes on behalf of the children from industrial schools. Those in reformatory schools are, I am afraid, too much under suspicion to be readily acceptable in the Colonies. But the class of children who are sent to our industrial schools and receive a very careful training there are entitled to a much superior consideration on the part of the Colonies than they now receive. They have a very large claim upon the Government, who have practically taken their future into their own hands and purposely removed them from the care of their parents and from the surroundings in which they were being brought up. I think this action on the part of the Government entitles these children to the particular care of the Home Office, and I trust that when this question is being discussed the Home Office will see what can be done to assist the emigration of these children so that they may not return to their old surroundings. I am quite aware that there are difficulties in the way, and that it may be necessary to make some stringent regulations to ensure that only proper and selected children out of such institutions should be sent. The question is worthy of the attention of the Home Office, and I hope that in the forthcoming deliberations of the Imperial Conference it will have due importance given to its consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00226"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad that my noble friend behind me has brought forward this subject, and I
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0025"/>
<col>41</col>
think I may congratulate him on the manner in which he did so. He showed a complete mastery of its various parts, and altogether he has contributed not a little to the consideration of this question by the public. The answer of the noble Lord who represents the Colonial Office was certainly sympathetic. So far, I would say, so good; but I do not think that His Majesty's Government have gone far enough in this matter. I do not think they have even really carried out the spirit of the Resolution passed at the Imperial Conference. It would surely be a great misfortune if His Majesty's Government were to get into the habit of treating Resolutions of an Imperial Conference rather as Resolutions of an Imperial debating society; and yet between Conferences the driving power for carrying out the intentions of the Resolutions must be supplied by His Majesty's Government. The scattered Ministries of the Dominions cannot contribute the machinery, or what I prefer to call the driving power, to carry through between Conferences the great ideas of policy that are agreed upon at these Imperial Conferences. The noble Lord said, quite truly, that the policy of a more complete and systematised scheme of emigration by the Government of the day, recommended by my noble friend, had not been the policy of oar Government. I quite admit the justice of that retort.<lb/>
Since I had the honour of being a member of a Government here I have done a little turn of Colonial service, and I have come back greatly impressed with the lost opportunities by the Imperial Government, no matter which Party may be in power&#x2104;the lost opportunities of organising this question of emigration, or rather the misapprehension of how grievously this question requires organising. We have here an Emigration Bureau, a very good office I quite agree. Its only function is to give good information and advice to those who seek it. We have the offices of the Dominion Agents-General, or High Commissioners as they are now called. Those are recruiting agencies for certain specified purposes, at certain times in operation and at certain times not in operation; and altogether apart from them there is a large undirected and unadvised stream of emigration constantly going on. We have heard that in Canada particularly Englishmen who have gone out have been regarded as rather hard bargains, and I have heard of
<col>42</col>
advertisements in which occurred the words, "No Englishmen need apply." That is not flattering to our English sense of patriotism, but it is the natural result of the want of organisation of this matter by His Majesty's Government. What happens? Everybody who goes out does not go to the Emigration Bureau and ask for information. You get many square pegs everywhere trying to force themselves into round holes, but, more than that, you get applying for situations on the land and attempting to settle on the land whole series of emigrants quite unfitted, not by their character, not by their physique, but by their complete want of training, to take any part in the tilling of the soil or in the industry of agriculture. My experience in South Africa is that there is no use dumping men down on the land if they are townsmen who have had no experience of agriculture. You must provide them with training.<lb/>
That is my first experience. My second is that there are a great number of men of all classes who have not been countrymen in England, nor willing under any circumstances to become countrymen in England, because the rewards of agriculture here are not sufficient, but who are tempted by the greater rewards of agriculture in the Dominions; these men become the very best settlers on the land but they require training, and for their training there can be no machinery on any adequate scale except that provided by the Government. I would draw your Lordships' attention to the Resolution of the Imperial Conference in 1907&#x2104;
<quote>"That it is desirable to encourage British emigrants to proceed to British Colonies rather than to foreign countries."</quote>
The noble Lord gave us figures to show that that part of the Resolution had received real attention, and that marked success had followed the efforts to so divert the stream of emigration. The second part of the Resolution was&#x2104;
<quote>"That the Imperial Government be requested to co-operate with any Colonies desiring emigrants&#x2104;</quote>
Co-operation is organisation&#x2104;organisation not apart from the agencies of the Dominions, but in co-operation with them&#x2104;
<quote>"in assisting suitable persons to emigrate."</quote>
You cannot assist without machinery and money, and if you add assistance to co-operation I do not want any better definition of a really well-organised system.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00227"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: The whole sense of the discussion at which that Resoluction was passed points very clearly to the fact that it was in nobody's mind at the time the Resolution was passed that a State-aided and subsidized system of emigration should be started in this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00228"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: Then I submit that the Resolution did not carry out the intention of those who framed it. As it stands, certainly it means what I have suggested or bears that interpretation most naturally. The next point I make&#x2014;and I wish to lay great stress upon it, not in any controversial spirit but as very deeply impressed with the importance of the matter&#x2014;is with regard to the emigration of women. I can conceive absolutely no objection on any ground to the carefully organised emigration of women. It does require very careful organisation both at home and in the Dominion or Colony to which the women are to be sent. I have seen excellent results from the work of the Victoria League and other voluntary societies. I really cannot exaggerate the value that I attach to the work done by these societies in emigrating women to South Africa. The percentage of failures is infinitesimal, and so it will always be under a proper and adequately organised system. The proportion of success, of women who not only earn their livelihood but marry and settle down, is very large. And I do not think His Majesty's Government could spend money better than in relieving the congestion which we know exists at home and the competition between women who have to earn their livelihood under difficult conditions, and for whom a very fair future waits exactly where they are most wanted. A surplus of 1,000,000 women here, a deficit of 1,000,000 women in the Colonies; and it is only His Majesty's Government who can organise on a large scale the deflection of this stream from harassing competition at home to the fair and happy homes that await them in the Colonies. I have only one other word to say, and that is with respect to whether we should emigrate our best or our second best. The Dominions will not take anything but the best. They are quite right. We should be equally ill-advised if we sent out anything but our best. No farmer who knows his business sows anything but the best seed, and when your field is the Empire your Imperial seed should be only the best.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE CONGO.</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00229"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government why no Consular Reports from the Congo State have been published since the one furnished by Consul Thesiger in 1909; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00230">The noble Earl said: My Lords, in putting this Question I should like to make a few remarks. It is well known to the the House that the treatment of the Congo under the system created by King Leopold of Belgium excited horror and disgust throughout the whole world, and the so-called Congo Free State became a by-word amongst the nations. Let me recall that the Congo was annexed by Belgium in 1908, and that the Belgian reform scheme was published in October, 1909. By the terms of the reform scheme half of the Congo was to be left, for varying periods, under the same Leopoldian <i>r&#x00E8;gime</i> of slavery and international illegality against which the British Government had been officially protesting since 1903. The reform scheme did not receive the Royal Assent in Belgium until March, 1910, and I ask, Why did not the Foreign Office use its influence during that interval, by publishing its Consular Reports and in other ways, to protest against the reform scheme which applied to only half of the Congo territory?</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00231">The last report we had from the Congo was the report of Consul Thesiger in January, 1909. That was a courageous and straightforward report. It narrated a tour in the Kasai district, begun in May, 1908, and lasting apparently until August, 1908. What did Consul Thesiger say in regard to that? His report disclosed a condition of things abominable in the extreme. These are his words&#x2014;
<quote>"No method of reform or change of administration will be of any real benefit to the people of this district unless it includes the entire abolition of this company, which has so long been held up as a model of what a <i>concessionnaire</i> company should be."</quote>
What was the result of that report in Belgium? The Belgian Colonial Minister, who had had the contents of Consul Thesiger's report quoted to him through M. Emile Vandervelde, who had met Consul Thesiger on the Congo, declared in the Chamber on December 17 and in the Senate on December 23 that&#x2014;
<quote>"The Kasai Company did not 'levy taxes or force the natives to work,' and those who contended the contrary were 'ignorant of the true state of affairs."'</quote>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0027"/>
<col>45</col>
The fact of Consul Thesiger's report compelled this Minister to speak on the subject, and he had to admit that forty-five of the company's agents were under arrest, eleven of the counts being for manslaughter, eleven for illegal imprisonment, and two for "blows leading to death." The Belgian Government holds fifty per cent. of the company's shares, estimated in the Treaty of Transfer at a value of &#x00A3;l,426,698. If the Consul's report did nothing else it led to a statement from the Belgian Minister which shows what sort of reform this is, and what it is worth. Is the reform scheme applied, to only half the territory an excuse for not publishing any further Consular Reports? But what about the reports from the un-reformed half? Surely there can be no excuse whatever why we should not have had Consular Reports from that territory.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00232">Although no Consular Reports are available we have evidence from missionaries, and I will quote from a report by a missionary dated February 7, 1911, giving particulars of a journey in the Aruwimi district of the Upper Congo. He writes&#x2014;
<quote>"We regret to say that rubber is still the tax paid to the State by hundreds of natives in the inland districts visited by us. Three months ago, in coming back to this station after furlough in England, one was still with sincere hopes that the reforms promised by the Belgian Government and accepted in good faith by many ardent reformers and statesmen would be put into execution immediately and thoroughly by those who have the responsibility of the administration of this country. And in justice it should be remarked that, owing chiefly to the substitution of money instead of labour as the tax along the banks of the main river generally, the condition of the natives in that region seems to have improved. But now, in penetrating the <i>Hinterland</i> and only a few days march from the great Congo river, imagine how keen and bitter was our disappointment at finding the old <i>r&#x00E9;gime,</i> so greatly denounced and discredited, still in operation."</quote>
The old <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> is practically this&#x2014;that by forced labour these natives have to bring in rubber. The compulsory period fixed is forty hours a month; but how does it work out for the natives? In actual experience in the district visited by the missionary from whose report I have quoted, it works out for them at six months, and in some cases at eight months, of laborious compulsory toil in the year in order to bring in the necessary rubber. And if they fail to bring in the rubber there must be some penalties, and therefore you have the old system going on throughout the whole of the unreformed, part of the Congo. For two years we have
<col>46</col>
had no Consular Reports telling us what is going on.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00233">Those who are interested in the Congo have put their hands in their pockets and formed a considerable fund and, have sent out the Rev. John Harris, whose wife has accompanied him, to find out for us what is going on in the Congo. I look with extreme interest to the receipt of Mr. Harris's report. He is a man who can talk the language of the natives, and is well known to, and respected by, those who have anything to do with Congo reform. But why should it be necessary for us to send, out Mr. Harris? We have a Vice-Consul at Leopoldville, another in the Katanga, and another in the Kasai. But we do not get a word. They are as silent as the dark forests which hide the natives and the rubber. I think it is only right that we should ask that these reports should, be published. England has not recognised the annexation of the Congo by Belgium. According to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs we are awaiting reports as to what is going on. But let the public know by means of the reports of their Consuls what is going on in this territory. I admit that there has been some reform, but this letter which I have quoted from the missionary is not good reading, and it is important that we should have official reports from our Consular officers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00234">I am not going to take any credit for all that has been done by Congo reformers, and I hope your Lordships will not think that we have other than a humanitarian interest in the matter. There is no question of acquisition of territory or of minerals, or anything of that kind. Speaking at the Guildhall banquet on November 9, 1910, the Prime Minister said&#x2014;
<quote>"The agitation in this country with regard to Congo reform has been subjected to much criticism based on the assumption that it has some political motive. The agitation never had any such motive. It is disinterested; it is sincere; it has no ulterior or selfish end. It is in no sense impertinent, for it has regard to a territory and a population towards which by Treaty we have undertaken solemn obligations."</quote>
As we have undertaken solemn obligations by Treaty it is only right that we should know what is going on in the country in respect of which those obligations have been undertaken. I beg to put the Question which stands in my name, and to move that the Consular Reports which have been so long delayed be laid before the House.</p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00235"><i>Moved,</i> That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty for further Papers relating to the Congo State.&#x2014;<i>(The Earl of Mayo.)</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00236"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Viscount replies I should like to add a few words to what has been very clearly stated by the noble Earl who has just sat down. Eighteen months have passed since some of us, of whom I was one, took a somewhat active part in raising a protest against what we believed, and still believe, to be the unspeakable horrors that were then going on in the Congo State. I do not think it has often fallen to the lot of those who occupy the responsible position I do to receive such unqualified approval from all sorts of people as we received for the action we took in connection with that protest. Shortly after that protest&#x2014;I do not say in consequence of it&#x2014;a promise was given on behalf of the Belgian Government as regards certain changes that were to be brought into operation, and in England this was regarded as a sort of quieting assurance.<lb/>
Those of us who took part in that protest now find ourselves in an exceedingly difficult position. If we again raise our voices and express our hesitation and doubt about what may now be happening in the limited region shrouded from our view in which reforms are said to be taking place, we are told that we are seeking to pull up the plant by the roots to see how it is growing and that time must be allowed for the reforms to bear fruit. On the other hand, time is a narcotic, and if we are silent it may be supposed that we are for the time being satisfied with regard to what may be going forward. The last official report from a Consul in the Congo Free State is nearly two years old. The fact of our having Consuls there has been advanced as an assurance that we would have the means of testing whether or not the changes hoped for were taking place. Without reports we are in a very helpless position. I agree that such sources of information as reports from travellers and missionaries may not be always judicial, and may have to be received with a certain amount of caution, although if ever there was a case in which the reports of the missionaries were justified when probed, it was in the Congo region. But we ought to have something we could rely upon in a different kind of way.<lb/>
<col>48</col>
The reports which have trickled through in an unofficial way are almost uniformly to the bad. Reports about certain places on the river itself, where coinage for the purpose of barter has been substituted for the rougher methods that preceded it, show that there is a certain amount of amelioration. But missionaries who have penetrated a little further state that a few miles inland the mischief is, in some quarters where amelioration is supposed to be taking place, as bad as before. Then there are the reports from the Belgian authorities who are responsible for the administration, and if we are to receive with a certain caution reports from irresponsible travellers, it is not going too far to say that we must receive with very considerable caution the reports from those who are responsible for the administration, and are therefore judges in their own cause. If we turn from the Belgian who is responsible to the Belgian critic, we find that reformers in Belgium are profoundly dissatisfied with the information which reaches them from the Congo.<lb/>
But the real source of information to which we are entitled to turn is our own Consular agents. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has told us again and again that we have those Consuls there, and may look to them for being kept in touch with what is happening, and he has told us that it will be on the strength of those Consular Reports that he will be obliged to form his opinion about what is actually taking place, and what ought to be now done, or left undone, by England, whether or not our protests require to be renewed, whether we are to express gratitude at the results, or whether the whole reform-plan has collapsed. The narcotic as regards time is showing itself to be productive of a great deal of mischief. It is suggested that, inasmuch as there are now no complaints, has not the time come for annexation. We want the facts in order to know whether or not we are to complain. Either reports from the Consuls do exist in the Foreign Office or they do not. If they do not, one asks why not? What are the Consuls about? Have the Consuls been pressed to send in reports? If, on the other hand, the reports do exist, is it really necessary that the public should be kept for two years in complete ignorance of what is happening in a region about which so much has been said?<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0029"/>
<col>49</col>
In this House we are always ready to recognise the force of an appeal from the Foreign Office that it is not in the public interest at a given juncture that information should be given, but that cannot go on for years. One's fear is that the reports must be of such a character that to produce them would be to show the failure of the protests we have made, and a breach of the promises to which we have been urged to listen. Therefore I am grateful to the noble Earl for raising the question to-night, and I look forward with keen anxiety&#x2014;and I am sure many outside will look forward with keen anxiety&#x2014;to the reply which the noble Viscount will give to-night. I hope the noble Viscount will inform us whether official reports from the Consuls exist, and, if not, why not; and if they do exist, why the country is not put in possession of them, in order to know whether it is necessary to renew our protests with regard to one of the most intolerable episodes in ancient or modern history. A civilised country, owing to a series of events which I need not now recall, finds itself answerable for the well being of enormous numbers of people helplessly under its control in a region about which it is almost impossible to obtain first-hand information in the way in which we obtain it from other quarters. For these reasons I endorse with all my power the appeal of the noble Earl for further information upon a matter wherein we, too, have a very real responsibility.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00237"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I certainly do not complain for a moment either of the noble Earl for raising this question or of any of the language used either by him or by the most rev. Primate. But we have to remember that this question is at this moment in a stage in which all of us who have had, to fight uphill battles have found questions. An operation of such a kind as the complete transformation of the old system of government in the Congo State is an enormous operation. The area is enormous. I forget its dimensions.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00239"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: The area is enormous, communications are exceedingly difficult, the conditions of the communities concerned, are dark and bar-barons. Therefore a transformation in the fiscal, economic and social conditions of a strange pack of communities like that
<col>50</col>
cannot be the work of a few months. There always conies a time when those who have laboured hard, as the Congo Association have done&#x2014;of which I am a member&#x2014;to arouse the conscience of this country years ago, are not able to see the full fruitage of their hopes and efforts. But, of course, the whole set of circumstances have to be taken into consideration, and I declare that I do not think this arrangement which has come into force opening up these new areas within a period of two years leaves us wholly devoid of information as to what is going on in those open or partially opened areas. There are two or three reports, I think, in the Foreign Office. But I cannot think it is unjust to believe that it would be much better, before coming to a final judgment, to wait until we get evidence of what is going on in the larger portion of the area now opened up. There is nothing unreasonable in saying that before British opinion is again roused, if aroused it is to be, there should at least be every opportunity taken to get a thorough knowledge of the facts and, of the steps which have been already adopted.<lb/>
In virtue of the Decree of March 22, 1910&#x2014;of which to-day a translation has been placed in the Library of your Lordships' House&#x2014;the system under which the rubber and ivory products of the country were exploited by the State&#x2014;that system which produced the most hateful results is undoubtedly passing away. It involved a heavy tax in kind on the natives, and, the tax in kind, instead of through some species of coin, led to the most villainous acts and systems of oppression. Every effort was naturally made by the State officials to screw out as much as they possibly could, and an immense area of the country was so treated. In that area no private enterprise was permitted, so that the natives evidently had not the opportunity of obtaining money with which to pay their taxes, even if they had been allowed to do so. But by the Decree it was settled that the country should be opened up to trade in three sections. More than half was thrown open in July, 1910, and another section will be thrown open in July this year, while the third section will be opened in July, 1912. This will leave only a relatively very small area which is occupied by the companies whose concessions give them exclusive rights, and in which trade will still be restricted. Besides
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0030"/>
<col>51</col>
the Decree there is in the Library a map explaining to your Lordships exactly how this great area is divided. There are other Decrees passed since 1909 which are calculated to improve the system of administration and to promote general trade.<lb/>
The noble Earl said there was no doubt that according to some of the missionaries the old system was still going on. According, however, to the information at the disposal of the Government, I think that is a tremendous over-statement. The noble Earl and the most rev. Primate also ask why we do not produce the latest reports we have. There are now two Consular agents travelling in the more recently opened area. We are expecting their reports, I will not say daily, but within a moderate space of time, and the moment these reports have been considered by the Foreign Secretary they will be laid before Parliament. This is the point which seems to have puzzled the most rev. Primate; but it appears to the Government to be useless to ask His Majesty's Consular agents to furnish merely general reports on the state of things in the Congo until some accurate and pretty full idea can be formed of the effect which these reforms are taking, until they have been in operation at all events for some few months. At present the two Consular officers are engaged in an extensive tour, and it is the intention of the Government immediately their reports are received to publish them together with others that have recently arrived, and I hope that then your Lordships will be able to form a clear and well-supported idea of what is actually going on in that country.<lb/>
The most rev. Primate made some reference about annexation. I must remind him that the Government have systematically refused to recognise annexation under the Act until they are able to lay before Parliament evidence to show that the actual state of things in the Congo with regard to the condition of the natives and the state of trade is such as brought us at any rate within a reasonably near approach of the fulfilment of our Treaty rights. Those in the Foreign Office who carefully watch this matter and my right hon. friend the Secretary of State are convinced, however, that there has undoubtedly been an improvement in the state of affairs. I sympathise with the impatience of the noble Earl and the most rev. Primate, but
<col>52</col>
I hope they will not allow that impatience to make them unjust or precipitate in forming a judgment. We are taking all the steps that can be taken to get information that can be depended upon. I observe that some remarks have been made in a rather hostile spirit to the Government on the ground of what is called the apologetic language used by His Majesty's representative in Brussels to the Belgian Government. You could not do a worse thing to promote the advance of reform in the Congo State, or to get support for the ideas of the best people in Belgium and in Great Britain than to let the Belgian Government feel that you are there as a sort of censor or as a rather over-fastidious schoolmaster. I am sure your Lordships will feel that to take steps of that kind would be the least likely of all policies to further the objects in view.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00240"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not quite sure that the noble Viscount will feel that even his own reassuring speech in any way precludes us from being grateful to the noble Earl for having brought forward this question. I am confident that we would all endeavour to support the view contained in the noble Viscount's last sentence or two. We have not the slightest desire to do anything which would lead a friendly Government to feel that we were unduly pressing our views upon them at a time when we hope they are moving in the desired direction. On the other hand, I think the noble Viscount will see that the plea which he has made for not putting forward reports until the operation of reforms over the whole of the wide area can be ascertained and until there can be some completeness is one which must not be strained too far. The question cannot be left at the point at which it was left by the Memorandum of Sir Edward Grey now nearly two years old; and nobody can wonder that any member of Parliament, aware of all that has taken place before and who realises the language which the Foreign Secretary thought it necessary to employ to the Belgian Government nearly two years ago, should be a little surprised that in the whole of the interval we do not get any information whatever as to what has taken place. The Foreign Secretary remarked, on June 11, 1909, in reference to the question of boundaries&#x2014;
<quote>"Tribes have in many cases shifted their quarters and emigrated to new districts; and the ravages of sickness and the results of the system of administration
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0031"/>
<col>53</col>
pursued by the authorities during the last twenty years have swept away altogether the population of some districts and greatly reduced that of others."</quote>
The addition of two years to twenty years would be a serious item in this history unless we were satisfied that a better course was being pursued.<lb/>
From the statement of the noble Viscount we have reason to hope that the reports which he promises us will come to hand very shortly will show a greatly improved state of things. I go so far as to say that not even our desire to co-operate with a friendly Government, not even our wish to avoid anything which could give pain, would justify us in leaving an obvious duty undertaken two years ago unless we are satisfied that during the intervening period there has been a real step towards reform. One must remember in this matter that those who are engaged on reform are not hampered as some have been who have had to carry out reforms in the East. The Congo State has produced enormous funds. A great deal of what is required to be done is merely a question of money. The removal possibly of some officials, the foregoing of some amount of taxation, the establishment of a coinage for money transaction&#x2014;these are all matters which need some time and may need some expenditure of money, or rather the foregoing of some receipts, but I do not think the noble Viscount of all men will urge in this House that we can treat the matter which began, I think, in November, 1908, as in any way to be halted. This is not the acquisition of new country, or the establishment of new institutions. It is really the substitution, by a nation already in possession, of a better system than the one which has prevailed. They have ample funds and the whole official hierarchy at their back, and have, as we believe, the best wish to create in the new reign a different record from that which distinguished the old one before the State was taken over by the Government.<lb/>
I still cannot help thinking that the Foreign Office were ill-advised in giving such a long halt as two years in the publication of these reports. As the most rev. Primate said, either these reports are in the Foreign Office or they ought to be. The plea that they would give only a partial view does not hold good, especially as reports from unofficial quarters give us
<col>54</col>
reason to fear that the view of the noble Viscount will prove to be too sanguine. I gathered, however, from what the noble Viscount said that we may expect these reports in the course of a few weeks at the latest.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00241"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I do not think I mentioned any time. The words I used were "within a near measure of time."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00242"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble Viscount used the expression "almost at once." At any rate, I hope that before we part with this session we may see these reports. If after the adjournment for the Coronation they have not been presented I hope my noble friend will renew his Question, so that we may have an opportunity of considering the reports and discussing them before the year has gone too far. I venture to suggest that the Foreign Secretary should, if possible, communicate by telegraph with our Consuls and urge them to expedite their reports, on which so much expectation has been based, and which we heartily hope may go to show that a new era has been inaugurated throughout these regions.</membercontribution></p>

The first Amendment in Clause 1 is merely to strike out the word "by-law" and to insert the words "order to be approved by the Local Government Board."

There does seem to be in this matter a real grievance in certain parts of the country, but it applies really to a rather limited area. The promoters of the Bill have been in consultation with the Government Departments concerned, and I believe they have very fairly agreed to and adopted the alterations that have been suggested. On

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00306"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: The words which I now move to insert are put in to meet the views of the Board of Agriculture. They conceived that it was possible that permission might be given by a county council to encamp upon a common which was already regulated by or under an Act of Parliament. It certainly was not intended in the least that this should be so. The permission was provided for in order to prevent people from camping on unauthorised ground without such consent, and certainly where commons are regulated under or by virtue of an Act of Parliament it is unlikely that any abuse of movable dwellings would be permitted under the rules.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00309"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My next Amendment is to leave out the words "and it shall be the duty of the police to remove such offender." It was pointed out to me that the inclusion of these words gave to the police a power of summarily removing people in consequence of what is, after all, only trespass, and that in the Bill itself there was a great additional power given for dealing with these cases. In the past almost the only way in which a trespasser who was doing not very great damage to the soil could be removed was by getting an injunction in the High Court or in the County Court, and this only applied to the individual van dweller, and was a very expensive, slow, and almost useless power. But under the Bill the person who breaks the by-law will be liable to prosecution before a Court of summary jurisdiction and to a fine, and it was con-
<col>64</col>
sidered that until one had very strong evidence to the contrary one was not justified in supposing, when a constable told the van dweller that he must remove from the spot and that if he did not he would be prosecuted before a magistrate and fined, that that would not be sufficient to insure his removal with sufficient promptitude. Until that has been found inadequate it is considered inadvisable to extend the power so as to allow a constable to remove the offender at once upon his refusal to quit.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>Clause 2, page 2, line 21, leave out ("and it shall be the duty of the police to remove such offender.").&#x2014;(<i>Lord Clifford of Chudleigh.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00311"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid that if these words are omitted a very useful portion of the Bill will go. On all the commons in Surrey and Kent and within fifty miles of London, where great nuisance has been found to arise from these gipsies camping there and cutting trees and committing all sorts of havoc, the difficulty up to now has been that although it has been possible to take out summonses against them, they were fifty, sixty, or seventy miles off before the summonses could be returned in any Court of summary jurisdiction. What the people in these counties have been very anxious for a long time to obtain is some provision such as Lord Clifford now proposes to omit. If these words are omitted I am afraid that exactly the same difficulty will arise in the future as in the past, and that it will be impossible very often to obtain a conviction against these people, who are here to-day and gone to-morrow.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00312"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I quite see the force of the objections to my Amendment, but still I am in hopes that, with the granting of enlarged powers to bodies with a much more extensive jurisdiction than previously, there will be much greater facilities for following the wandering delinquent who has broken the by-laws than there have been in the past, and that it may be possible to enforce the orders of the Court in a way which was not possible before. It would, of course, be an additional strength if the words remained in, but I feel, in view of the objections raised against them, that it would be better for the future working of the Bill that the words in question should be deleted.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00313"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say a word on this point as I was a member of the Committee to which this Bill was referred, and I must confess that I rather agree with my noble friend Lord Hylton that the leaving out of this provision makes a very serious difference. The original Bill as sent to us was designed for the registration of this wandering population, and the majority of the Committee thought&#x2014;and I agreed with them&#x2014;that it was impossible practically to register this kind of population, and therefore we introduced other provisions to make up for the want of registration. If you had registration I could understand the argument which has fallen from my noble friend Lord Clifford, that the enlarged powers of the county council would enable them to follow people up; but if you have no registration&#x2014;and we have dropped registration&#x2014;then you must have some summary power of getting at these people. Either you should have registration and the ordinary powers of the law, or no registration and summary powers. But if you are going to drop</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00332"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I now move the insertion of a new clause after Clause 2. Clause 3, which I shall move in a moment to omit, appeared to take from the sanitary authority their power to carry out the by-laws which in some cases they had already made and hand it over to the county council. It was not the desire of the promoters of the Bill to in any way interfere with the exercise of the sanitary jurisdiction of the smaller sanitary authorities. But it was found that even where by-laws had been made by the sanitary authorities&#x2014;and in the majority of cases they had not been made at all&#x2014;they were in many cases inoperative on account of the wandering habits of the van-dweller and the comparatively limited area with which the authority dealt, and it was thought that it would be better, in order to make this desire on the part of the promoters more evident and pronounced, that the clause should be altered in this form. It practically amounts to this, that over the whole of their area the county council will have power to put in force the by-laws that exist. Where by-laws have already been approved, of course they will be found in existence; and where they have not been approved the county council will have power to step in and approach the Local Government Board direct in order to get by-laws put into existence over the remainder of the area of their jurisdiction. The difficulty which at first appeared to the promoters of the Bill with regard to the want of uniformity in respect of the various by-laws and the desire that the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0039"/>
<col>69</col>
county council themselves should make and approve the by-laws will not, I think, cause very serious difference, because as all these orders and by-laws have to be approved by the Local Government Board we may safely trust that Department and the county councils to take such steps as may be necessary in getting the by-laws of all the sanitary authorities in these areas to practically agree. We hope, of course, that in most of the cases the power of the Local Government Board will be sufficient to induce, if not immediately, at least in course of time, uniformity in all the existing by-laws.</membercontribution></p>

I am afraid that many of your Lordships will have no great opinion of an advertisement in the <i>London Gazette</i> as a means of publicity, and I think their objection would be much better met by laying the duty on the county council to give the information if desired by any association of the nature of the Showmen's Guild.

<title>SMALL OWNERSHIP AND NATIONAL LAND BANK BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00365" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00366">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00367"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill which I am going to ask your Lordships to read a second time is one which I trust will meet with some measure of support, as it deals with a problem in which many of your Lordships are deeply interested. The Bill, I may say, is promoted by the Small Ownership Committee, of which Sir Gilbert Parker is chairman. Both Parties are agreed that land should be more widely distributed in this country among the people. The depopulation of the land and the congestion of the towns form a very serious national problem; but although both Parties are agreed on the terms of the problem, they part company on the question of tenure.<lb/>
It is now some three years since the present Government passed the Small Holdings and Allotments Act. At that time we were told that there was a great desire on the part of the people to gain access to the land. How far that desire was based on ignorance of the real conditions attached to the life of the small cultivator it is difficult to say, but I myself believe that there are men to-day who would gladly face those conditions if they could be given the additional incentive of ownership. The Government have based their policy on a system of tenancy. That policy has been conscientiously supported and carried out by the county councils throughout the country. I think the noble Earl opposite, the President of the Board of Agriculture, will support me in that statement. I have nothing against the system of tenancy, against the Government policy, which I know the noble Earl has worked so hard to make a success, provided you can get the people on to the land and provided you can make it worth while their remaining there.<lb/>
The Report which was issued by the Board of Agriculture last July fully justifies the experiment of splitting up land in this country into small holdings, and shows that under certain conditions the small cultivator can make a living out of it. But there are two dangers in the Government system. One is that county
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0041"/>
<col>73</col>
councils, under pressure of the Board of Agriculture, can be forced into buying or renting land under conditions unsuitable for subsequent small holdings. The other danger is the natural and inevitable outcome of the first, and consists in the very high rent which is subsequently charged to the small holder. I could, if the noble Earl wished, give instances showing how very high this rent is&#x2014;in fact, in many cases it is higher than the annuity which would be paid under an instalment purchase system. But I think the noble Earl has admitted that the small holder will, under the Government's Act, pay more for his land than the tenant would pay to an individual landlord. My own opinion&#x2014;I give it with all due respect&#x2014;is that the relative difference between the cost of renting and the cost of purchase, by which a small holder pays for his land in rent as much as, or more than he would pay under an instalment purchase system, is absurd, and I think that under the latter system an owner would get a great deal more for his money.<lb/>
One cannot blame the county councils. They have to administer the Act. They have to purchase or rent land in districts which may be economically unsuitable for small holdings. If they do nothing, the Board of Agriculture comes down upon them. But anyhow the result for these county council tenants is that they pay very high rents, and the very fact that they are able to pay these high rents is, I think, a happy augury of what they would do under the Unionist policy of freehold tenure. The results of the Government Act during the last three years are very disappointing as regards the number of small holdings which have been taken up. This may be explained by looking at the Small Holdings Report which was issued last July. I will, with your Lordships' permission, read one or two sentences which I think explain this. It says&#x2014;
<quote>"It has been found that a considerable number of the applicants who have been provisionally approved in the first instance are inclined to withdraw when a definite offer of land is made to them."</quote>
And it goes on&#x2014;
<quote>"In many cases the rents which councils are bound to ask to recoup their outlay on the acquisition and adaptation of the land are higher than the applicants expected or were willing to pay, and many applications have been withdrawn in consequence."</quote>
<col>74</col>
It seems that the Government's conditions are hardly so alluring as we were led to believe three years ago. At any rate, the would-be small holders when they come to close quarters with those proposals are in some instances inclined to fight shy of them. And yet there is a great deal of land in the market to-day, and a great many people who would like to own it working it. In fact, we have got the land and we have got the people; all we have to do is to bring them together. I believe that a desirable result depends on three things&#x2014;ownership, easy access to capital at a low rate of interest, and co-operation. It is in accordance with these three principles that I venture to produce this Bill for your Lordships' consideration.<lb/>
I will deal first with the provisions in the Bill to facilitate ownership. As the county councils in England&#x2014;and this Bill applies only to England&#x2014;are already concerned in the provision of small agricultural holdings both under the Unionist Act of 1902 and under the Radical Act of 1907, which Acts have been consolidated in the Act of 1908, so we in this Bill have got the county councils as a medium for bringing together the man who has land to sell and the man who is anxious to buy. It is provided in the Bill that the county council shall keep a register of all agricultural land in the county available for sale for the purposes of the Bill, and on this register will be entered full particulars as regards price and details of building expenses, &amp;c. It would also be the duty of the county council to communicate from time to time with owners of agricultural land, inviting them to place their land on the register for sale. Recognising that it is desirable to encourage large owners to put their land on the register, we propose to relieve all land so entered from the Land Value Duties imposed by the Budget of 1909 and from all future duties which may be imposed. But this privilege is subject to two restrictions&#x2014;first, that the price of the land so entered must be subject to the approval of the Board of Agriculture, who would, no doubt, be advised by the county councils; and, secondly, that the land should be entered in parcels not exceeding 50 acres. In return for this privilege of relief from the Land Value Duties an owner will be under compulsion to sell his land at the registered price. But I would like to make it quite clear to your Lordships that this compulsion only arises
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0042"/>
<col>75</col>
on the offer to purchase, as prior to any such offer an owner will be at liberty to withdraw his land from the register.<lb/>
The Unionist Party have always been in favour of doing all that they can to facilitate the transfer of land&#x2014;a policy for which at one time our opponents expressed much affection; but as regards the Radical Party it must be taken that they have abandoned their former policy, since the Chancellor of the Exchequer by his Budget of 1909 clogged the machinery of transfer by doubling the former Stamp Duties. In order to facilitate transactions under this Bill we propose to give power to the Treasury to remit half the Stamp Duties&#x2014;a proposal which will result to the benefit of the would-be small owner, as it is always on the purchaser that the cost of Stamp Duty falls. These, my Lords, are the provisions in the Bill for bringing together the man who has land to sell and the man who is willing to buy.<lb/>
The problem which has next to be faced is how to provide the necessary capital at a low rate of interest in order to enable the would-be small owner to purchase his land, and, if necessary, provide the buildings and equipment. It is not an easy problem to face. In Ireland the solution has been sought by a direct advance from the Imperial Exchequer; but I fear that here, with the ever-increasing claims on the Imperial Exchequer, any system of direct State advances might prove to be an insuperable burden on the finances of the country and might lead to a postponement of the operation of this scheme. Therefore those who have promoted this Bill have provided in it for a Land Bank, whose duty it will be to make the necessary advances to purchasers of land under the Bill. This Land Bank will be a commercial bank, with a suggested capital of &#x00A3;5,000,000 and an authorised debenture issue of five times the capital. It is in respect of this debenture issue that the Bill invokes the aid of the State. Obviously the Bank must obtain the bulk of its working capital at a low rate of interest, as its charge for advances for land purchase is limited to 4 per cent., of which &#x00BD; per cent. is allocated to the sinking fund to provide for the redemption of the loan. The debentures, therefore, will bear interest at a rate not exceeding 3&#x00BD;per cent., which will be guaranteed by the Government. But, of course, the bank, being a commercial affair,
<col>76</col>
will endeavour to obtain its money as cheaply as possible; certainly at a lower rate than 3&#x00BD; per cent., otherwise there would be no margin for profit between the rate it borrowed at and the rate it lent at. In view of the Government guarantee, the Treasury will appoint two out of the seven members of the board of directors.<lb/>
I have no doubt that certain of your Lordships who possess far greater knowledge of finance than I can pretend to will presently rise from both sides of the House and criticise the financial part of this Bill. You may deprecate the giving of power to raise what you may, perhaps, describe as another Government loan. But, my Lords, this is not a Government loan. It is a contingency liability which, under proper businesslike management, the country will never be called upon to meet. The debentures which are guaranteed by the Government are secured on valuable assets&#x2014;mainly on land and buildings. But I would ask your Lordships to consider for a minute for what purpose this guarantee is to be given. You are not asked, as is usually the case, to throw a great burden on the finances of the country in order to enable a large number of people to live on the State. You are not asked to remove the responsibility from earning his own living from a single individual to the State. On the contrary, a contingent liability is to be assumed by the State in order to enable a large number of individuals not only to earn their own living, but in doing so to greatly add to the wealth and prosperity of the country.<lb/>
I would also ask your Lordships to consider the alternative. Under the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, if small holdings prove to be an economic failure the whole of the loss, whatever loss there may be, will fall on the county councils&#x2014;that is, on the ratepayers. We must remember that both Parties are committed to this policy of small holdings, of trying to get people on to the land. If that policy should prove to be a failure, if for some reason or other an Englishman is not fitted to undergo the hardships, we will say, of agricultural life, perhaps owing to his education&#x2014;if that is the case, and if there is any loss, does it make such a vast difference whether it falls on the ratepayer or on the taxpayer? I should have thought that the latter would be the best fitted to
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0043"/>
<col>77</col>
pay; but the very fact that we provide in this Bill that this policy should be carried out by a commercial undertaking on businesslike lines is, I think, the greatest safeguard we can provide against any loss, against rash speculations in land, against taking up land under conditions which are economically unsuited for small holdings.<lb/>
I might, perhaps, be allowed to say a word about the rate of interest which is charged to the small owner. I have seen it compared with the rate of interest charged under the Irish Land Act. I need not point out the difference which exists between the position in Ireland at that time and the position in England to-day. We were called upon in Ireland practically only to finance the sitting tenant, to enable the man who was already in occupation of his land to become the owner. In this country we have got to bring new people on to the land. In fact, we have to colonise the land, and there is an additional expense of administration. But I would also point out to your Lordships that the Government have to pay a great deal more for their money to-day than they had to pay a few years ago, and I venture to predict that future Governments will have to continue paving a good deal more for their money than they were able to get it in the past, and that no Government in the future will be able to advance money for land purchase at a lower rate than 3&#x00BD; per cent. if any of the cost of administration is to be included in that rate. Under this Bill we advance money for land purchase at 3&#x00BD; per cent., and on 80 per cent. of the purchase price we charge &#x00BD; per cent. in addition to provide for the redemption of the loan, and on the remaining 20 per cent. we charge 1&#x00BD; per cent. to provide for the redemption of the loan. It works out in this way. A man who can find 20 per cent. of the purchase money himself will pay a total rate on the money he borrows of 4 per cent. A man who can find no part but has to raise the whole of the purchase price will have to pay a total rate of interest of 4 guineas per cent. until he has paid off the loan to the county council, when the rate of interest would be reduced to 4 per cent.<lb/>
To illustrate the method by which this advance of capital will be made, I will assume that an agriculturist desiring to purchase land, but lacking the means to
<col>78</col>
provide any part of the purchase money, has by means of the county council register found a suitable holding. He would apply to the Land Bank, who, after due inquiries and after consultation with the county council, would, if those inquiries were satisfactory, advance 80 per cent.&#x2014;that is, four-fifths of the purchase price. The county council would advance the remaining fifth at a rate of interest not exceeding 5 per cent., of which not less than 1&#x00BD; per cent. would be allocated to the sinking fund to provide for the redemption of the loan. The county council would be under an obligation to advance this balance unless, considering the security to be insufficient, they appealed to the Local Government Board and were relieved of their responsibility either in whole or in part. I would remind your Lordships that under the Government's Act the responsibility for the whole of the purchase price rests on the shoulders of the county council whenever they buy land for small holdings. Under this Bill only one-fifth part of that responsibility would rest on their shoulders. And I would also ask your Lordships to note that every payment that the small owner makes reduces the responsibility of the county council at a rate just three times as fast as that at which the responsibility of the bank is reduced.<lb/>
I see that my noble friend Lord Belper is going to raise an objection to that part of the Bill which puts part of the financial responsibility on to the shoulders of the county council. I am not prepared to say that the noble Lord's objections are without weight. I would rather point out to the noble Lord that this part of the Bill, putting the last 20 per cent., the second mortgage, as it were, on to the shoulders of the county council, is not an essential part of the Bill: it is not vital to the Bill itself. There are many other alternatives. It might be put on to the shoulders of the Board of Agriculture, or it might follow the precedent in the Ashbourne Act. But I think noble Lords will agree with me when I say that if the would-be small owner is to be called upon to find any part of the purchase price himself, it Will prevent many otherwise suitable candidates coming forward to take up land. This is essentially a point to be thrashed out in Committee, and I trust that the noble Lord will not take this detail of the Bill as an argument against the scheme as a whole.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0044"/>
<col>79</col>
There now only remain to be dealt with the opportunities for co-operation as provided for in the Bill. Clause 11 provides that the Board of Agriculture shall make regulations for the formation or extension of agricultural credit societies or village banks on a co-operative basis, having for their objects&#x2014;(1) the profitable working of agricultural holdings purchased under this Bill by making advances for the provision of buildings, drainage, water supply, fences, and other improvements of the holding; (2) the benefit of all agricultural holdings by making advances, or by otherwise affording facilities for credit banking and insurance and for the purchase of requisites, the sale and distribution of produce, and for such other purposes as the Board by regulations prescribe.<lb/>
I need not detain your Lordships by entering on the obvious advantages of co-operation to the agriculturist. Most of your Lordships are well acquainted with the great results achieved in Ireland mainly through the efforts of Sir Horace Plunkett. Any economic disadvantage that there may be in splitting up a large farm into small holdings ought to be overcome by a sound system of co-operation. Mr. Hill, the American economist, has shown by remarkable figures how very much more productive small farms are than large. Co-operation enables the small farmer to grade his produce, to make large contracts, and to obtain more favourable railway rates, and, in addition, it gives to the small farmer the financial strength and credit of the large farmer. In fact, co-operation is absolutely necessary to any scheme of this sort in order to provide that security which each individual by himself can hardly be said to possess. The liability of these agricultural credit societies is unlimited. It is a practical application of the principle, Each for all, all for each; and it is the system which exists and is working very well at the present moment in Italy, in Austria-Hungary, in Belgium, and in Germany.<lb/>
I have explained the details of the Bill. I do not ask your Lordships to support all the details but I do ask you to support the broad principles which lie behind those details. In advocating the system of ownership, backed by co-operation and a land bank, I hesitate to adopt the obvious argument which one might produce in support of such a system. In Germany,
<col>80</col>
in France, in Denmark, and in many other countries we find the land studded by small holders who have succeeded by the means I propose. In all of these countries ownership and prosperity have gone hand in hand. It might be said that the success of these small owners is due to a better climate and a different fiscal system. Of course, tariffs are both directly and indirectly of great assistance to small owners, but I do not think that either of these factors is really essential to the success of these small holders. If we look at Denmark, for instance, we find it has a more rigorous climate than ours, and none of their tariffs are really of direct assistance as regards the produce of small holders except a tariff on cheese, and in Belgium there are no tariffs on cereals except a tariff on oats. I think those who argue merely on economic grounds against the splitting up of land into small holdings fail to take into account one factor which will go a long way to ensuring success, and that is the capital value of the energy and extra work which will be forthcoming from the individual stimulated by the magic spell of ownership.<lb/>
Anyhow one thing is certain&#x2014;that all the arguments which can be brought to bear against the system of ownership can be brought to bear with greater effect against the system of tenancy. Under the Government's Act a man not only pays the rent of his land but a proportion of the sinking fund to repay to the county council the cost of the land. In other words, he purchases and pays for the land by instalments spread over eighty years, and at the end of that time does not own his land. Under that system all the work that he puts into his land goes as unearned income to the county council. Even his improvements go to the county council unless they were made with their consent. I think that is a very fair summary of the working of the Government's Act. But the question we are concerned with is, Has that Act proved to be a success? I see that, in answer to a Question put to him on March 22 as regards small holdings of fifty acres and under, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Agriculture informed the House of Commons that the number of small holdings in 1910 was 288,802, whereas in 1907, before the passing of that Act, the number was 289,093. There are, therefore, 291 fewer small holdings to-day than there were

<col>81</col>
three years ago. It seems to me that a system of tenancy requires no further criticism. It is a system which has been condemned by all the great agricultural countries, with the exception, perhaps, of Belgium, where, owing to intensive culture, the price of land is almost prohibitive; but even in Belgium the people pay high prices to own land, and over one-third of the land is already held in ownership.<lb/>
I feel certain that in this country if small holdings are to succeed it will be under the Unionist policy of freehold tenure, under which a man will receive the full benefit of all the work he puts into his land and full benefit of all his energy and enterprise. Therefore I bring this Bill forward in order to get an opportunity for discussion by Parliament of a question which is admitted by both Parties to be of the utmost importance. I do not ask your Lordships to pass the Bill as it stands. I have brought it forward on behalf of the Small Ownership Committee in order that its provisions may be criticised and examined. I hope that both Houses of Parliament, having regard to the importance of the subject, will submit these proposals to a careful investigation. With this end in view I propose, if your Lordships are good enough to give a Second Reading to the Bill, to move that it be referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00369"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution> had given notice, on the Motion for the Second Reading, to move to resolve, "That this House, whilst approving of the principle of extending the small ownership of land, is unwilling to proceed further with a measure which places on county councils duties and obligations which are alien to the objects for which they exist, and which would impose on them financial schemes of a novel and doubtful character, involving considerable risks to the ratepayers."<lb/>
The noble Lord said: My Lords, in rising to move the Resolution of which I have given notice, I think I may congratulate my noble friend who has brought this Bill to the notice of the House upon having explained its provisions and touched upon the various points to which he wishes specially to call attention with his
<col>82</col>
usual clearness. But I did not find that he touched upon the objections which I have raised to the Bill except in one small point, to which I shall refer later. I think that he and other members of your Lordships' House who are conversant with local government affairs will not be at all surprised to find that I have put down this Motion in the terms in which it stands. Let me say at once in moving this Resolution I am not acting on my own initiative. This Bill came before the County Councils Association during the course of the last two or three weeks. A report was brought up to the Executive Council from two of the most important committees of that Association&#x2014;the Parliamentary Committee and the Committee which deals, amongst other things, with small holdings&#x2014;and on the recommendation of both those Committees a large and important meeting of the Executive Council of the Association unanimously came to the conclusion that it was their duty to oppose this Bill.<lb/>
Let me call attention to the wording of my Resolution. It states, in the first instance, that this House, whilst approving of the principle of extending the small ownership of land, is unwilling to proceed further with a measure which places on county councils duties and obligations which are alien to the objects for which they exist. Everybody who has been conversant with the course of local government during the last few years will have noticed how many occasions there have been when county councils have had to make some protest against the extended duties and powers which were given them in many cases under Government Bills. Those cases were the natural extension of local government, the desire to have more detailed provisions with regard to matters with which county councils already had to deal. Let me say that although we have had to make protests we have always been willing cheerfully to undertake any duties which should naturally fall upon county councils in the development of local government, and if we have had objections to make it is because, whilst these extended duties were constantly being cast upon us, no funds were found by the central Government to relieve the county councils from the extra expense put upon them of administration.<lb/>
But, my Lords, this Bill stands in a wholly different category. This is a
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0046"/>
<col>83</col>
measure which is not brought forward by the Government. It is, at all events for the moment, the measure of a private member of your Lordships' House. It contains provisions of a most novel and far-reaching character, and many of the provisions of the Bill may be said not only to be novel but very doubtful in their character. It is a Bill which will put large and onerous duties upon county councils, and it seemed to us that it was our duty to take the very first opportunity that we could of protesting against these duties and obligations being put upon us, and for that reason I have placed this Resolution on the Paper. We have avoided dealing with important parts of the Bill which my noble friend has explained to the House. We are quite willing to admit that it may be very desirable to extend the small ownership of land, and we wish at the same time&#x2014;and I might have put it in the Resolution if it had been in order&#x2014;to give every opportunity for a reasonable and fair development of the system of small holdings which has been brought into existence by the present Government. We do not wish to take any Party view of this Bill. Personally I should look with the greatest favour on any reasonable measure which would bring back to us the state of things which existed thirty-five or forty or fifty years ago, and would again bring into existence, on satisfactory terms, those yeomen of England who were of such great advantage to this country&#x2014;men of stability, men of independence, who were squeezed out in the first instance, I think, by the very high prices that land was fetching, and later by a series of years of agricultural depression.<lb/>
My noble friend referred to the fact that the administration of this Bill had been given to county councils as they already had powers with regard to small holdings, and I notice that in the Memorandum prefixed to the Bill it is also stated that the county council machinery for doing the administrative work is already in existence, and that therefore it was very convenient to utilise the vast deal of voluntary effort which they were capable of giving. I must say I rather resent the idea of putting this work on county councils as if they had not enough work to do already. If it is thought that the administrative work of county councils will admit of their doing more work it is a great mistake. Only the other day I was informed, in connection
<col>84</col>
with my own county council, that it was impossible to do the existing work with the present staff. The duties of the county council have been constantly increasing and it was found necessary to have extra clerks, and it was only in response to an appeal not to make a larger charge at the present moment for clerical assistance that as a makeshift some temporary help was arranged for. And if it is thought that any part of the present staffs of county councils could do any of the work put upon them by this Bill it is a great mistake.<lb/>
The provisions of the Bill point at this not being a small extension of the system of small holdings. The provisions evidently aim at setting up a very large and important system, not only of registration of land, but also of land agents for small ownership. Take one or two of the clauses. Every county council is to keep a register of agricultural land within the county available for sale under the Act, showing every sort of particular with regard to the land, including price, acreage, and encumbrances. The register is to be open daily at the offices of the county council, and no person is to pay any fee for taking copies or extracts from the register. Then it is to be the duty of the county council to provide, for the carrying into effect of the Bill, such a number of persons skilled in the valuation of agricultural land as the Board of Agriculture think necessary. In the next clause it is laid down that not less often than once in every year communications are to be made from the county council to the owners of agricultural land in the county, requesting them to enter upon the register their land for sale in the manner prescribed in the Bill. All this points at not a small extension of the present system of small holdings, but to a large office which will have to be equipped very fully with a large number of clerks, and which, if this system of setting up small holdings is successful, will increase as time goes on. As far as I can see, no provision is made in the Bill for the initial expense of setting up these large offices. It is quite true there is a certain payment to be made with regard to land agents, but that percentage would not cover the expense of setting up these offices, which expense seems wholly unprovided for in the Bill.<lb/>
Take the financial side of this question. I do not wish to go very fully into it, or into any details connected with the question of land banks. It is quite clear, as far as
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0047"/>
<col>85</col>
these banks are concerned, that owing to the conditions which would obtain they would be able to raise money. But the question is what will be the position of the would-be small holders who have to borrow money from these banks. The noble Earl pointed out that the banks are to lend up to 80 per cent. of the value of the land. I have had some little experience myself of banking and of country banks, and certainly in past years a great deal was done in the way of lending money to those employed in agricultural pursuits. I venture to say, however, that there is no sound bank, however much accustomed to this sort of work, who would lend up to 80 per cent. of the supposed value of the land unless there was some collateral security or some good reason to know that the person who wished to borrow was a man of stability. But what is the case when it comes to the unfortunate county council? The land banks, at all events, are secure enough. They are supported by the Government. Though the noble Earl did not stick very closely by the clause with regard to county councils&#x2014;for he gave it away by saying that it was not a necessary part of the Bill&#x2014;I must refer to it because it is evidently part of the scheme; and if my noble friend does not think very much of it, at all events those who drew up this Bill included it as a substantial part of the scheme. What is the proposal with regard to county councils? The proposal is this, that where 80 per cent. has been lent as a first mortgage it shall be the duty&#x2014;not the discretion, but the duty&#x2014;of the council of the county in which the land is situated to advance upon the security of the land, as a second charge, the other 20 per cent. That is to say, the money is to be lent right up to the hilt of the supposed value of the land. It might be supposed that if the county council are to be given these duties they might have discretion put into their hands with regard to whether or not it is desirable to lend this last 20 per cent. But that is not the case at all, because the clause goes on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided that if the county council object to make such advance the council may submit the question to the Local Government Board, and if the Local Government Board are of opinion that the security for the second land charge is insufficient to protect the county council against the probability of loss, the Local Government Board may make an order relieving the county council from the liability to make such advance, or such portion thereof, as the Board may determine."</quote>
<col>86</col>
Therefore what it comes to is this, that the Local Government Board is to be the arbiter in the case of land which is in the neighbourhood of the county council and with which the county council are fully conversant, and if they do not relieve the county council then the county council are forced, against their will and against their own discretion, to use the money of the ratepayers in making this advance.<lb/>
Let me take two cases. Many of the members of your Lordships' House will remember the state of things thirty or forty years ago when there was great land pressure. Supposing an Act of this sort had been in force at that time and money had been lent up to the hilt on the full value of the land. There is not a single county in England where not only the whole of the money advanced by the county council would have been lost on those terms, but also a great part of the money advanced by the national bank, because land has deteriorated in counties within my own cognisance from a minimum of 30 per cent. in value to as much as 50 per cent. or even more. What has happened once may happen again. Take another case. Supposing a small tenant who wished to become a small landowner, tempted by these liberal terms of lending, consented to take a small holding, out of which he thought he was going to make a good profit. It may turn out that he could not make a living out of the land. Supposing it turned out also that he was neither industrious nor competent? It would be extremely easy for the whole of the advance of the county council to be lost in two or three years; and if the land had to be sold, it would be extremely likely that the mismanagement of the two or three years would have reduced the capital value by at least 20 to 25 per cent. I only make this point because it seems to me obvious that provisions of this sort are not such as should be imposed upon county councils, who would be compelled to work the Act against their will. And in that respect they would be placed in a most disagreeable position as regards the ratepayers, because they would have to tell the ratepayers that the money had been lost, not by their own fault or mismanagement, but because the representatives of the Local Government Board knew nothing about the land, and had allowed the last 20 per cent. to be borrowed in the manner proposed.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0048"/>
<col>87</col>
I do not wish to dwell at any length on the provisions of this Bill. There are provisions with regard to regulations to be imposed by the Board of Agriculture under the Bill which I think they might not care about having to pass any more than the county councils would care about having these duties imposed upon them. There is no question which has given rise to more soreness in Parliament than this with regard to regulations imposed by Government offices without consultation with the county councils themselves, and I am rather surprised that we should not find in this Bill even the usual power given to Parliament to object if it desires to do so. I am aware that I am at some disadvantage in moving a Resolution objecting to this Bill on the Second Reading when I am only dealing with particular parts of the measure, because naturally I have not been able to address my remarks to some of the important parts of the Bill on which no doubt other members of the House will speak later. My only excuse for that is that it was thought by the County Councils Association that they would stand on much stronger ground if they confined their objections to matters on which they could speak with confidence and knowledge.<lb/>
Let me say, when I am asked why I desire to reject the Bill and not amend it at a future stage, that one great objection to the latter course is that the county councils take up so large a part of the Bill that were they struck out altogether the Bill would have to be practically redrafted. But the noble Earl has taken care that there shall be no opportunity to amend the Bill at a future stage. If he carries his proposal that the Bill should be referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses, the Bill having been read a second time would be taken away from the cognisance of the House. On many occasions it has been convenient to refer Bills to Joint Committees, but I do not believe there is any precedent for so referring a Bill if it is novel and contains totally new proposals of a very contentious character. Where Bills of late have been referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses they have been diligently threshed out, if not in both Houses, at least in one House. These Joint Committees facilitate the solution of details which have given rise to differences of opinion in both Houses. If this Bill were to be going through its usual course in this House it might not have been neces-
<col>88</col>
sary for me to move its rejection by a Resolution of this sort, for we should at all events have then attempted to amend it in Committee by striking out the parts which refer to county councils. But as the Bill stands, if it is given a Second Reading and the proposal to send it to a Joint Committee carried, we shall be precluded from taking any action after the Joint Committee has discussed the Bill. The Bill will go from this House as if not only its principle was approved, but also its machinery. I hope that, whatever course may be taken with regard to the Second Reading of this Bill, noble Lords who are interested in the local government of this country will support us in making a strong protest against having provisions of this particular sort imposed upon county councils.<lb/>
Amendment <i>moved,</i> To leave out all the words after ("That") for the purpose of inserting the following Resolution, viz.: "This House, whilst approving of the principle of extending the small ownership of land, is unwilling to proceed further with a measure which places on County Councils duties and obligations which are alien to the objects for which they exist, and which would impose on them financial schemes of a novel and doubtful character, involving considerable risks to the ratepayers."&#x2014;(<i>Lord Belper.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00370"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I say that I look upon this matter solely from the point of view of national finance. As regards the first portion of the Bill I have very little to say, and I say that little because I happen to have sat just lately for two years on a Royal Commission which had to deal with the very difficult question of land transfer. I notice that Clause 8 of this Bill provides that where any land shall have been purchased under this Bill, the purchaser shall apply to be registered as proprietor thereof under the Land Transfer Acts, 1875 and 1897, and may be registered as proprietor of the land with any title authorised by those Acts. That, of course, is quite right, but you do not attach any penalty to non-registration. That seems to me to be an omission, for there should, of course, be a penalty if the land is not registered. There is so much publicity in the anterior stages of this Bill&#x2014;the county councils have to enter the particulars of the land on their registers and so forth&#x2014;that I think the registrar on an
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0049"/>
<col>89</col>
occasion of this sort would be willing to grant an absolute title to the land, say, in six months, if the title was, of course, in order and other things apparently straight-forward. It would be an innovation, but I know the opinion of the Royal Commission was that we should take every opportunity that we could of making titles absolute. That is the only clause I have to allude to in the first portion of the Bill.<lb/>
But when we come to the second portion of the Bill, I have to object to those clauses which relate to the so-called National Land Bank. I do not object at all to banks. Far from it. However many banks there may be I hope I shall hold out the hand of fellowship to them, but this is a very different sort of bank from any with which I am acquainted. The noble Earl who introduced this Bill is rather sanguine in thinking that he will easily raise &#x00A3;5,000,000 of capital in &#x00A3;1 shares. I think he will find some difficulty. But let that pass. I object most strongly to Clause 14. Noble Lords will see that this clause deals with the power given to the National Land Bank to issue no less than &#x00A3;25,000,000 sterling of debentures on which the Treasury is to guarantee 3&#x00BD; per cent. Now, I take it at once that this is a National Land Bank, and not a commercial bank, because were you dealing with an ordinary commercial bank you would not be willing to find &#x00A3;25,000,000 of the national money as capital for that bank. If it is a National Land Bank, were I a director of that bank I should say, Should I be able if I had &#x00A3;25,000,000, or any part of it, to make 3&#x00BD; per cent. on that? I should not like to have to do it, and retain the capital intact. In addition to that, there would be all the salaries and expenses connected with the bank and I very much doubt if the National Land Bank could make the necessary interest.<lb/>
Noble Lords will remember that if the National Land Bank does not meet the interest on this &#x00A3;25,000,000, or any portion of it, the taxpayers will have to find that interest, and that will be an addition to the already very heavy taxes. But supposing for a moment that I am wrong, and that the bank could make their expenses and pay 3&#x00BD; per cent. What will the farmer have to pay? As the noble Lord below me said just now, we must take care in dealing with land in this country that we do not fall into the mistake that
<col>90</col>
the late Government made in the case of the Irish land-purchase scheme. The late Government never allowed sufficient margin between the amount of interest they had to pay for the money and the amount of interest they were getting from the Irish tenants. I think they were six or seven years ago going to borrow at 2&#x00BE; per cent. and lend to the tenants at 3&#x00BC; per cent. Obviously, if everything had gone right that was not nearly margin enough. It should have been much nearer 1&#x00BD; per cent. than &#x00BD; per cent. to put it on a commercial basis. Now as regards this bank, if it has to pay 3&#x00BD; per cent. and in addition has certain expenses, what will the farmer have to pay on his money? In estimating what the farmer will have to pay the question of bad debts must not be forgotten. In a paper the other day I saw this paragraph which has a bearing on the point&#x2014;
<quote>"At Thurles Quarter Sessions yesterday, County Court Judge Xerr granted decrees against fifty tenants for non-payment of instalments due to the Irish Land Commission. The practical failure of last year's harvest is said to be responsible for the inability of the tenants to meet these payments."</quote>
So that in addition to the Land Bank having to pay 3&#x00BD; per cent. interest and the expenses of working, it may have to meet some bad debts. The farmer, therefore, will have to pay from 4&#x00BD; per cent. to 5 per cent. at least, and will be worse off as a landowner than he was as a tenant.<lb/>
For the last thirty years, ever since 1880, landlords have borne the immense losses which have occurred in the pursuit of agriculture. They have stood between the tenants and ruin over and over again, and when one remembers what landlords have done for tenants in keeping farms in repair and in coming to the help of the tenants when seasons were bad, one wonders whether there is any magic in becoming an owner of land. I should have thought the tenants were very much better off as tenants. The landlord never got 4&#x00BD; per cent., nor anything like it. During the last thirty years 2&#x00BD; per cent. is more like the figure. Yet we are told that the tenants will be better off. I cannot agree. I do not think there is any magic in the mere ownership of land. It ought to be a great commercial pursuit. Can you make money out of the land, or can you not? Can you make money out of agriculture? At this moment I do not think you can. As your Lordships know quite well, we in this country have decided&#x2014;I do not say we have decided wrongly&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0050"/>
<col>91</col>
that the people, especially the people in the big towns, shall have the cheapest food that can be given to them. Very well then. We do not start on the same basis that other countries start on. In America, of course, they have the virgin soil, and pay very little rent. I saw the other day an advertisement of the sale of land in Western Australia at fourpence an acre. We have to compete with that. France is protected to the extent of ten shillings a quarter on wheat. Germany is also protected to the extent of twelve shillings. In these circumstances I doubt very much whether agriculture in this country can be made to pay at present. It can be made to pay in those other countries, but these particular circumstances that apply there do not apply in this country at the present time.<lb/>
I am inclined to think we shall have to leave the question of agriculture to supply and demand. I know, of course, that in days to come agriculture will be a paying trade in this country, for every day, every month, and every year that we live the population increases by leaps and bounds; but, of course, the land is a fixed quantity. Naturally, in a very short time in the life of a nation agriculture will become a paying industry in this country. At present I do not think it is paying. I think if we indulge in banks of this kind it will result in a loss, not only to the bank, but to the Government which provides part of the money of the bank. The taxes that we have to pay are heavy enough, and, if I may, I should like to allude for three or four minutes to the very interesting state in which we find ourselves with regard to the national finance and the national taxes of this country.<lb/>
I have always understood that the law of the Exchequer and the law of the country was this, that every year should stand on its own financial basis&#x2014;that it should be, so to speak, in a water-tight compartment; and so that there should be no inducement to any Chancellor of the Exchequer to budget for more money than he wanted it was decided that if there was any surplus in any single year, it was to go to the old Sinking Fund and to be used for the purchase of Consols, and that was to go in reduction of the National Debt. But we find that, although that may be the law, it has not been carried out. What are the facts to-day? The
<col>92</col>
Super-Tax between April, 1909, and April, 1910, has not been dealt with yet. The assessment papers for that Super-Tax were sent out in the first week in January this year. Many of those papers had the particulars filled up and were sent in to the authorities within three days of their receipt. That would be the second week in January. A good many of us have heard nothing more of them. Of course, that Super-Tax belongs to last year. It does not belong to 1911 or 1912.<lb/>
Then there is another question we have heard debated in the other House, and it is an interesting one. I have here a letter from the secretary of one of the largest companies, if not the largest company, in this country, and this is what occurred. In the middle of March, in accordance with the usual practice, the Income Tax officer called on this company, and the officer of the company handed the Income Tax officer a cheque for &#x00A3;157,000. That was in one cheque for Income Tax. Was it accepted? No. It was handed back to the official of the company with a request that he would not pay it in until April. That is contrary to the law. In point of fact we are in this position, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has taken from the taxpayers of this country some millions in taxes more than he ought to have done. He budgeted for more than he wanted, and the surplus ought to have gone to the reduction of the National Debt.<lb/>
The City has always been in the habit of knowing what the condition of the taxes were at the end of March. They generally know that the taxes have been collected by that date, and therefore money will become easier, and they can lay their plans accordingly. This year we find it all entirely different. We all expected cheap money as usual at the beginning of April, but there has not been cheap money, because taxes are still being collected. The moneys in the hands of the Government at the Bank of England are not less than &#x00A3;10,000,000 more than last year, and still many taxes are being collected. It is hardly fair on the commercial community that there should be this great uncertainty as to taxes. After all, I conclude that the duty of the Chancellor of the Exchequer is to obey the law of the country, and this has not been done. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was good enough to say the other day that he did not want to be too
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0051"/>
<col>93</col>
hard in the collection of the Super-Tax, that he wanted to have some feeling for the Super-Tax payer. All that is very good; but I wish he had had a little more feeling for them when he put the tax on them in the first instance. Mr. Hobhouse said in the House of Commons the other day that he thought it was the fault of the officials of the Income Tax Department. I do not want to allude to this, because I hardly think your Lordships take that view. That is all I have to say about the national finance. I must apologise for this digression, but one does not often get an opportunity in this House of alluding to financial matters, and perhaps in the future we may have fewer opportunities than we have now. As regards the Bill, I think this calling in of the help of the Government to the extent of many millions to give a guarantee to the proposed National Land Bank is such a source of danger that if the noble Earl insists upon leaving that clause in I shall be obliged to vote against the measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00371"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to question the action of the Chancellor of the Exchequer during the last few weeks, but inasmuch as the noble Earl has invited criticism upon the provisions of his Bill, I do wish to make one or two observations with regard to the machinery that he sets up for providing for small ownership as against tenancy. I am entirely in agreement with the noble Earl when he advocates ownership as against tenancy, but there are criticisms with regard to the machinery that he proposes to set up in this Bill which I want to make. To begin with, my small experience of local government leads me to think that the weight of argument on the question of the county council scheme in this Bill lies with the noble Lord who has moved the rejection of the Bill; but what I really want to draw the attention of the House to is Clause 11, which deals with the question of co-operation.<lb/>
The noble Earl never said a wiser thing than when he said that the success of the small holder depended upon his coming into the general co-operative movement which is now being established in this country. My experience in Ireland has shown me the advantages that the farmer can derive from organisation and co-operation; and in England the co-operative movement is spreading, not as fast
<col>94</col>
as I should like to see it, but it is undoubtedly making great progress. But the very life-spring of co-operation depends upon a purely voluntary movement on the part of the farmers concerned, their willingness to come together and combine for the purposes of organisation, and any provision in an Act of Parliament that offers State interference or State advocacy of the co-operative movement will, to my mind, hinder rather than help its progress. In Clause 11 your Lordships will see that the Board of Agriculture are given certain powers. The clause runs&#x2014;
<quote>"The Board shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, make regulations for the formation or extension of agricultural credit societies or village banks on a co-operative basis having for their objects&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(1) the profitable working of agricultural holdings purchased under this Act by making advances for the provision of buildings, drainage, water supply, fences, and other improvements of the holding;</li>
<li>(2) the benefit of all agricultural holdings by making advances, or by otherwise affording facilities for credit banking and insurance and for the purchase of requisites, the sale and distribution of produce, and for such other purposes as the Board by regulations prescribe."</li>
</ol></quote>
I believe the effect of a provision of that sort would be to kill the co-operative movement. The farmer is suspicious enough as it is of any combination of this sort, and if a public Department comes along and endeavours to, if I may use the word, dragoon the farmers into co-operation or combination, it will have the effect of making the co-operative movement a dead letter altogether. That is a criticism I wish to offer the noble Earl with regard to co-operation, which he has in his mind as a necessity for the welfare of his small ownership scheme, and I hope that, whatever the result of this debate may be, Clause 11 will be dropped out of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<col>95</col>
culture can pay, but that it is paying better now than it has done before, and that it will continue to pay better. But I must support the amendment of Lord Belper, partly for the reasons he has stated, but chiefly because this seems to me an exceedingly inopportune moment to bring in this Bill. It is brought in at a time when there is a very much larger scheme before the country&#x2014;a scheme which is taken up by farmers all over the country, and which has already had a Second Reading. As recently as last month the Central Chamber of Agriculture, of which I have the honour to be chairman, passed a resolution, with I think only one dissentient, in favour of that Bill. It has been supported by resolutions from the affiliated Chambers throughout the country, and I think it would be a matter of real regret that a scheme like this, touching really only a minor point, should now be brought into competition with that Bill.<lb/>
As to the scheme of this Bill, I do not wish to criticise it in any detail. Financially it has been found fault with. It does seem to me that many of its provisions are financially doubtful, and I do not think that in a scheme of State-aided purchase&#x2014;and it is a scheme of State-aided purchase although called a guarantee&#x2014;we should have any commercial undertaking between the State and the parties concerned. If you do, it is quite clear there must be increased expenses. There must be a certain amount of profit from the undertaking, and these expenses and that profit will absolutely and inevitably come out of the farmers' pockets. In order to carry out any scheme of purchase, the farmer must get his money at the lowest rate possible. I do not believe the lowest rate can be obtained except by direct aid from the State. But it is chiefly because I think the time is not ripe for bringing this Bill in that I shall oppose it. Supposing the larger Bill failed, your Lordships might then have an opportunity for trying the smaller scheme, but until the larger scheme has been thoroughly discussed I hope your Lordships will not agree to pass this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00373"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I only wish to say a few words on Lord Belper's Resolution. As regards the position of the county councils in these days, it is most necessary that they should protest vehemently against the extension of their duties which is perpetually being
<col>96</col>
made. County councils were established to take over those county duties which were originally performed by the magistrates. They were duties of an obvious nature, and such as could only be well carried out by a body situated in the localities themselves. To those duties was added very large and important work connected with local education, and that was quite enough to fill up such spare time and spare organisation which the county councils had. But in addition to all that, there is a tendency to thrust upon county councils many duties which are not in their nature purely local, though the advantages of a well-organised local administration are, no doubt, very tempting bait to those who wish to bring some scheme immediately into operation without the trouble and the difficulty of forming an organisation to carry it out.<lb/>
Work of national importance has from time to time been placed upon county councils, who have, I admit, evinced a certain willingness to take it over. Yet at the same time there has been a lamentable forgetfulness to provide the funds wherewith those duties should be carried out. The reason of this, I think, is not far to seek. It is that the central Departments find it easier to impose upon the silent representatives of county councils the duty of providing the money without the difficulties which the Treasury places in the way of their doing so. There is a very good instance of this in the Bill which is at present before us. The county councils are requested to go into a financial business, and to find a second mortgage covering the entire value of the property&#x2014;a transaction that no trustee would be allowed to look at for a minute. They are requested to do this, and if they object the Local Government Board can step in and practically compel them to do so. There might be something to be said for their compulsion if the Exchequer supported the doubtful second mortgage in the same way that they do the more secure first one; but I notice that that provision is obviously not in the Bill.<lb/>
Such a business as this is not one that ought to be entrusted to county councils. It is beyond the scope of the purposes for which they were constituted. It is beyond the scope of that possible enlargement which their administration and constitution might seem to offer. It is a work so national in its character, and so little
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0053"/>
<col>97</col>
confined to any county or locality, that it should be undertaken wholly and entirely by the Imperial Government. A county council is a body which is supposed to be under the control of those who elect its members, but there is a growing tendency to convert that body into a means of raising money which is entirely beyond the control of those who have elected its members. Yet the county council is compelled to find the money which ought to be found from other sources. I hope, therefore, that whatever form the proposals in this Bill may take the onerous duties which are cast upon the county councils may be removed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00374"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before saying a few words on this Bill I hope I may be forgiven one word on a remark that fell from the noble Earl who introduced the Bill. He said that the Small Holdings Act for which I am responsible is a failure. Well, I do not want to blow my own trumpet, but I do honestly think that that criticism is a little severe, and hardly justified. The Act has been in existence for three years. The first year was, of course, spent in preparing the ground and planting the seed, and in the two years in which we have been really at work I think it is enormously to the credit of the two excellent Commissioners&#x2014;Mr. Cheney and Mr. Baines&#x2014;whom I entrusted with the beginning of the work, that they have been able, with the assistance they have had in the office, to obtain more than 100,000 acres of land for small holders. If there has been a failure of the Act, it is from the success of it; because there is so great a demand for land under the present conditions that I have obtained permission from the Government to have six additional Commissioners in order to cope with the number of unsatisfied demands on the part of men who have been unable to get land. I think that in a year or two we shall be able to show such an advanced record even on the good work we have already done as will satisfy even the most exacting of our critics.<lb/>
As to the Bill before the House, I think I ought first to compliment the noble and gallant Earl who introduced the Bill for the clear and excellent way in which he put his proposals before your Lordships. During the whole of his speech his pro-
<col>98</col>
posals seemed to be to some extent attractive, and really looked as if they had something in them. I hoped that some noble Lord on that side of the House&#x2014;I am speaking under correction, but I believe there was a whip sent out for this Bill&#x2014;would get up and support him, but, unfortunately for him but very fortunately for me as it makes my task much easier, up to the present moment I do not think there has been one noble Lord opposite who has been able to give the Bill his whole-hearted support. But I think I may congratulate myself on the fact that in the noble and gallant Earl we have another recruit, and a most valuable recruit, to our side as regards the policy of small holdings, which some years ago was in such low water in this country. He is evidently also another recruit to our policy of the desirability of breaking up huge estates, which at one time were supposed to be the glory and the safety of this country.<lb/>
It is only four years ago that the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, whom we so very much regret not to see in his place to-night and still more the reason that keeps him away, stated his fear that the demand which we maintained existed for small holdings was only "local and sporadic," and was "not general at all." And some people&#x2014;I won't mention names&#x2014;went further still, and said that the desire for small holdings was a "dishonest cry," and they quoted against small holdings some correspondent who had been attached in days gone by to the Board of Agriculture. They never lost an opportunity of running the idea down, and trying to make people believe that there was quite enough land to meet any demand that existed. But now I am glad to say we are all supporters of small holdings. We are all agreed that it is absolutely necessary for the good of this country that the land should be broken up; that there should be more people put upon the land. I may adapt one of Disraeli's famous sayings about the christianising of the Franks. The Tory Party has been converted to the small holdings idea in platoons, and they are now being baptised in battalions. The landlords of England are taking up the idea not only in theory, but in practice.<lb/>
I do not know if your Lordships have seen <i>The Times</i> to-day. There is a full-
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0054"/>
<col>99</col>
page covered with advertisements of land for sale from one firm alone, and that firm advertises 265,000 acres of land as being in the market. It shows that landlords are unloading surplus land on to a grateful and obliged public. I believe they are doing that for two reasons. One reason I believe is that there is a boom in land, and that people who unfortunately have mortgages on their estates&#x2014;and even in the case of estates which are perfectly free&#x2014;see that they may increase their income at a very small cost to themselves, and, as Lord Onslow said, in some instances a landlord who sells will have pounds to dispose of where he formerly had shillings. It is not, therefore, much to be wondered at that they put their estates on the market. On the other hand, I am told there is no boom in land, that no one wants to buy land. It is the greatest rubbish that ever was. Land is being sold from a sense of duty, a sense of duty to our successors and to our country. We are not afraid of the present Government. Far from it. We know that no additional taxation of any sort or kind has been put on purely agricultural land. We know that large sums have been given to the agricultural interest under the Development Fund and otherwise, and that practically speaking the two words "Lloyd George" are really Welsh for liberality towards English landowners. But landlords say that they are apprehensive of a Socialist Government. They say, "We are not afraid of Mr. Asquith's Government in the least, but we are afraid of what may subsequently happen, and we had better get rid of our land. We think that perhaps a Government might come in that would think it right to tax the food of the people, and if they thought that was right they would not very likely think it wrong to tax the land that grows the food of the people, and therefore we had better clear out while the sun shines, and do the best we can."<lb/>
As I said before, I compliment the noble and gallant Earl on the way in which he introduced his Bill, but I am afraid I cannot go much further with him. I will save the time of the House by not repeating in any way what has been so well said by Lord Belper, who has forgotten more about county councils than most of us ever knew or will know. Something was said about the register of the agricultural land, and that it would be valuable. But still it has to be kept up by the county
<col>100</col>
council, and I would like to point out this. The county councils are to be asked to write to the owners of agricultural land asking them to enter their land on the register, and besides that they would have to write once a year to gentlemen who own land. What does that mean in plain English? It means that the county councils are to go round touting for business, and take the business out of the hands of the ordinary land agents. I have had a great deal to do with land agents, and I know them to be an honourable, industrious, and worthy lot of men, but I am also aware that most of them are warm supporters of the Party opposite. Therefore I would submit to the leaders of that Party whether it would be wise to take the bread out of their supporters' mouths, and whether that part of the noble Earl's Bill ought not to come out.<lb/>
The noble Earl said he did not insist on all the details of his Bill. Quite so. Perhaps that is very lucky. If you look at Clause 5 you will see that land can be sold with the reservation of sporting rights. If there is a possibility of upsetting tenant farmers it is through game being let. Under this clause the unfortunate purchaser would be subject to the perpetual inroads of the proprietors of the sporting rights, who could enter on his farm for the purpose of shooting game, which under the section means hares, rabbits, partridges, and so on. I shall be told, no doubt, that this is in my own Act&#x2014;the Small Holdings Act. That is perfectly true. I say in the strictest confidence I did not like it at all, but I allowed it to go through because I thought it would facilitate the passage of the Bill through your Lordships' House. And I was in great hopes that the county councils would not avail themselves of this power, but they have done so in some instances, and I am sorry to say that we have had a bother with the Kesteven County Council, who made a mistake in thinking that they were doing a kindness to their tenants by taking the sporting rights from them, because they thought in that way they would reduce the rents.<lb/>
I come to Clause 9. Your Lordships will see from subsection (1) that a tenant shall not hold more than seventy-five acres, except in a special case. Under the Bill he may hold up to seventy-five acres; that is to be the acknowledged size of his holding, and if he becomes entitled to any more land by descent, devise, gift, purchase,
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0055"/>
<col>101</col>
or otherwise, he shall, under subsection (2), enter the excess for sale. If he fails in this, then under the third subsection the county council can do this for him, and sell at such a price as the Board of Agriculture shall approve. I would ask your Lordships to consider this for one moment. The Marquess of Carabas sees an opportunity of increasing his income by selling a large portion of land, say, 10,000 acres. He puts it on the market and gives everybody notice to quit&#x2014;the villagers, small and big farmers, and everybody else. Then in order to appease his conscience he will release, under the noble Earl's Bill, some of this land and sell it to some of his hard-working tenants. He would sell it to two, perhaps, or twenty, or thirty or thirty-five hard-working agricultural toilers. Suppose he sells to William Barleycorn and John Barleycorn. Well, they have this property, and neither of them unfortunately lives to be one hundred years old. They both die before they reach the century, and what happens? John Barleycorn leaves his properly to John Barleycorn, junior. William Barleycorn dies intestate, without issue, and so John Barleycorn, junior, becomes the proprietor. What is that unfortunate man to do? He must enter the excess of the land that he owns on this register, and if he fails the county council may do this for him, and sell it at such a price as the Board of Agriculture may approve. Can your Lordships imagine anything more absolutely certain to infuriate John Barleycorn, junior, or to exasperate the county councils who are already worked off their legs and do not know where to turn, or to make the President of the Board of Agriculture even more unpopular than he is at present.<lb/>
The question of the National Land Bank has been so well dealt with by the noble Lord opposite, Lord Faber, that I need not trouble you with any observations of my own on that subject. But I should like to bring before your Lordships an opinion about this proposal from a very old friend of mine whose opinion is very valuable in agricultural circles&#x2014;I mean my right hon. friend, Mr. Jesse Collings. Now, Mr. Jesse Collings is frightened out of his wits at this Bill, and he writes from his country house at Birmingham to his leader, Lord Lansdowne, at Bowood, in the following terms&#x2014;
<quote>"My dear Lord Lansdowne,&#x2014;It is to be fervently hoped that the Unionist Party at least will not adopt the policy contained in Lord Dunmore's Bill.</quote>
<col>102</col>
I can assure Mr. Collings that the Liberal Party will not adopt it, whatever the Party opposite may do. He goes on&#x2014;
<quote>"Such a land bank as Lord Dunmore proposes is an entirely new departure for which there is no precedent, and the county councils are not likely to give up their position of comparative security under the Act of 1908 for such a scheme as this. The instalments for repayment would be too heavy and prohibitive for a new owner to buy his farm with any advantage to himself. The measure would be of no use to a large number of farmers on estates which are likely to come into the market."</quote>
And he recommends an alternative. Now my right hon. friend Mr. Jesse Collings is a very astute and clever man, and he recommends as his alternative his own Bill. He is exactly like those Irish horse dealers that you see at the Dublin Horse Show, who, when you are looking at a horse, come up and tap you on the shoulder and say, "Oh, Colonel, I have a nice little horse round the corner that will suit you down to the ground. Come and look at it with me." Mr. Jesse Collings recommends his own Land Purchase Bill which will be brought in to-morrow by the noble Earl, Lord Malmesbury, and submitted to your Lordships' House, and perhaps some of our friends on this side of the House may have something to say upon it.<lb/>
There is only one other matter to which I should like to call the attention of the House&#x2014;namely, Clause 11&#x2014;which provides that regulations shall as soon as possible be made for the formation of agricultural credit societies. But that has been done already. We do not want to wait for the passing of this Bill for that. This is one of the most important parts of the Government's agricultural programme. The noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, who is the pioneer and originator of the whole scheme in your Lordships' House, has very wisely shown the great dangers of the proposal in this clause, so that I need not any longer detain your Lordships upon it. Last summer I promised, with the permission of the Prime Minister and the approval of my colleagues, that the Government would bring in a Bill to deal with this great question of credit societies. And here I should like to make a public acknowledgment of the great courtesy that I have received from all the representatives of the great country banks with whom I have been in consultation during the winter and the spring, and also from the noble Lords who formed the Select Committee which produced that
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0056"/>
<col>103</col>
excellent Report on Lord Shaftesbury's Bill. I can only say that this Credit Societies Bill would have been in your Lordships' hands had it not been for the fact that the Government draftsman, like so many people during the last winter, has been seriously indisposed, but it is ready now and I hope very shortly to be able to submit it to the House. That Bill has been framed and drawn up with great care. Had we not better wait and see what there is in that Bill before we enter upon such an enormous enterprise as this Land Bank, with the &#x00A3;25,000,000 proposed to be guaranteed by His Majesty's Government?<lb/>
Seriously speaking, is this a Bill winch ought to be introduced into this House at all? That, I think, is a very great and grave question. Men of all sections and descriptions consider that the duty of this House is to revise and amend, and, under proper safeguards, to delay. But what does Lord Dunmore ask us to do? To give a Second Reading to this Bill with its gigantic proposal and then refer the Bill to a Joint Committee of both Houses. Would you get the House of Commons to join in a Joint Committee? It is very improbable. If the Bill before the House is given a Second Reading and its principle thus affirmed, I have a very shrewd suspicion that there would be a great many hard-headed and successful men on the Unionist side who would say, "Thank God, there is a House of Commons." I hope the noble Earl will not think I am objecting to his Bill in a factious or partisan spirit. No one would welcome more than myself any practical suggestion to further the one great object I have had at heart for the last forty or fifty years&#x2014;the acquisition of small holdings for the poor, and putting a population of working men on the land. But I agree with the noble Lord who said that this proposal is going the wrong way to work, that it would put the clock back and in no way help the object that we all have in view. Having taken advice from those who have practical experience, from those on whose opinion I invariably rely, I most respectfully beg to say that we on this side of the House agree with the proposition which has been so ably put before your Lordships by my noble friend Lord Belper, and if the noble Earl, Lord Dunmore, insists upon going to a Division, we as a body shall most certainly vote with Lord Belper.</membercontribution></p>
<col>104</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00375"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture, in the genial and discursive speech which he has just delivered, raised the question whether this is a class of Bill which ought to be introduced into your Lordships' House. I hope that your Lordships will not accept the definition of the functions of this House which was placed before us by the noble Earl. I cannot imagine anything more desirable in the public interest than that the noble Earl, Lord Dunmore, should devote himself, in the comparative leisure which we experience in this House, to examining a great question like this, to putting his scheme into legislative form, and soliciting the opinion of your Lordships upon it. And the mere fact that he ended his speech by a Motion to refer the Bill to a Joint Committee ought surely not to disable him from introducing the Bill at all or from receiving that attention from your Lordships' House which the intrinsic importance of the subject deserves.<lb/>
The noble Earl opposite said one thing with which I entirely agree. He paid a compliment to Lord Dunmore for the clearness and reasonableness with which he introduced this measure and in a very short space of time contrived to give us a very good idea of its general provisions. But the noble Earl, Lord Carrington, went on to draw attention to the fact that the bulk of the speeches which have been delivered in this debate had been critical of Lord Dunmore's Bill. After all, is that surprising? Is it not natural and inevitable that those who object to particular provisions of a Bill should rise and say so? Is it to be expected that those who favour the general principle of the Bill, a principle which has for a long time been accepted by the Conservative Party, should think it necessary on the present occasion to reaffirm their adherence to that principle? Is it not rather more natural that my noble friend Lord Belper should express the views of the county councils; that a great banker like Lord Faber should state his views about the National Land Bank; and that we should hear from Lord Carrington opposite the accepted Government attitude towards the Bill? It would, I think, be most unjust if Lord Dunmore were to draw from the critical attitude that has been adopted in the speeches to which I have referred the inference that there is not in this House a great deal of
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0057"/>
<col>105</col>
sympathy with a great deal of his Bill. And I think, moreover, it would be a great shame if, because there are certain provisions in the Bill which may fairly be criticised, this House were to adopt an openly antagonistic attitude towards it.<lb/>
Is it not the case that there is much more common ground between us on this question of dealing with the land than on many of the other great controverted issues of the day? I agree with a great deal of what Earl Carrington said about that matter. The problem is a serious one. We approach it on both sides, I believe, without Party passion. Broadly speaking, we desire the same issue. We all agree that the system of agrarian tenure in this country is imperfect; that it is capable of great improvement; that the present system, with its threefold division into landowner and farmer and tenant, is one which does not give an adequate return to all three; that our system of cultivation is capable of improvement; that subdivision of the land very desirable. I am not aware that Lord Carrington is just in saying that this is a sudden discovery on the part of the Conservative Party. If it is a question of consistency, I agree with Lord Dunmore that it does not lie in the mouth of Lord Carrington to make that charge. We all agree that the greater division of the soil is an improvement which both parties ought to have in view, and I agree further with what the noble Earl said just now that the moment is singularly opportune for making a change in our system.<lb/>
Nobody can pretend that there is any difficulty in obtaining land. You will see every day in the newspapers estates being offered for sale. The old system of great landed estates is rapidly breaking up. Whether it is due to economic or social influences, or whether it has been accelerated by the policy of the present Government, I need not pause to inquire. But there it is. Estates are in the market. I was speaking the other day to a great authority on the system of land tenure in England, and he told me that he believed that, with the exception of special sporting or residential estates, which he naturally excluded, as much as one-half of the soil of England at present is capable of being bought, provided the owner can obtain a return in proportion to the amount of money he has spent upon its development. That being the state of affairs, the two Parties in the State approach it from a rather different point of
<col>106</col>
view. The noble Earl opposite is the spokesman of the view that you ought to deal with this problem by creating a great system of leasehold tenure. He and his Party are apparently hostile to the ownership of the land. They look forward to the land of the country, if it changes hands, passing into the possession of the State or of local authorities, such as county councils and along with these general views they introduce a general, and, as I think, lamentable element of compulsion. I think that is regrettable, because compulsion carries a trail of unpopularity with it and is apt to mar the success of the scheme. However, that is one definite method of dealing with the question.<lb/>
Noble Lords on this side of the House have rather different views. Most of us hold strongly that small ownership is the real solution of the problem. I venture respectfully to disagree somewhat with what Lord Faber said upon the matter. He seemed to doubt the rooted instinct in human nature to acquire land. I must confess I do not agree with him. I believe it is one of the most natural and universal instincts in the human mind. Again, we hold that the ownership of the land in fee simple would give a great stimulus to energy and thrift and self-sacrifice, and all those qualities that we desire to promote in our agricultural population. A man will always do better if he is dealing with that which belings to him, if he can benefit by his own labour, if he can sell himself what he owns, or if he can bequeath what he owns to those who come after him. Moreover, I think it can be demonstrated that the system of small ownership in the land will be on the whole more economical and profitable than the schemes which find favour with the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture and his Party.<lb/>
But I do not desire on the present occasion to argue the two systems. I am ready to admit there is room for both. It would be a most foolish and dangerous thing to dogmatise about agriculture in this country. There may well be parts of the country for which your system is the best. There may be others for which ours would be superior. What I believe to be the main contention of noble Lords on this side of the House is this, that where a desire to become the owner of property exists, and where property is in the market&#x2014;and I contend that that is almost universal&#x2014;then the Government should not stand in the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0058"/>
<col>107</col>
way of the realisation of that desire, but that every reasonable facility should be given to enable it to be satisfied.<lb/>
There is one point to which no attention has been paid to-night. Is it not the case that there are two classes for whom we want to provide if we are to build up the agrarian system in this country? First, there is the tenant farmer who keeps a large farm, and who might wish to become the owner; secondly, there is the small man desirous of taking land, destitute of capital but at the same time very likely endowed with the intelligence and ambition which may make him wish to become the owner of the soil. I know it is often contended that there is no desire on the part of tenant farmers to become the owners of large properties. I can hardly think that is the case. You have only to read the transactions reported in the papers from day to day when great estates come into the market to see that the tenant farmers are the first who wish to become owners, and you have only to read the resolutions passed by the various associations and Chambers of Agriculture to see how strong a demand there is for the acquisition of the soil. I believe that as soon as you set up in this country adequate machinery for credit and co-operation, for finding the money on the one hand and for enabling farming to be conducted with greater economy and profit on the other, you will find a great forward movement in the desire for ownership of the soil.<lb/>
What stands in the way? We all know that in the first place the man who wishes to purchase, be he a big man or a small man, requires capital; and in the second place he wants capital not merely for purchase but for development, working expenses, and stocking the farm, purchasing implements, carrying his produce to the markets&#x2014;in other words, for carrying on his industry. It is to meet these needs that my noble friend puts his views into the form of a Bill. Is there anything so very extravagant about them? Is not his Bill to a large extent the embodiment of the successful experience of other countries? Does not his scheme of a Central Land Bank at the top and of associated or affiliated credit societies lower down exist in almost every European country great or small? Is it not admitted to be the main feature of the success of the agrarian systems in those countries? I thought that these were accepted axioms of political and social economy.<lb/>
<col>108</col>
I remember my own experience in India, where we have an agrarian problem to deal with infinitely larger and more complex than anything which confronts us here. It is more difficult, of course, because the weight and the burden of the usurer is much greater, and because you are dealing with a much more helpless, hopeless, and improvident class of peasantry. We passed a scheme for introducing exactly the same sort of societies as Lord Dunmore proposes in this Bill, and in spite of the difficulty of starting anything new in India, or of getting any novel idea into the minds of that ignorant peasantry, if the Secretary of State for India were here to-night he would tell you that the scheme has been a success, that the number of the societies has increased and that they have grown in public confidence. Why is that? Because everywhere we interested the representatives of the people, because we thought it better to have as little Government management and control as possible, and limited Government intervention, as is also proposed here, to the guarantee of financial assistance, to exemption from taxation, and to other privileges. To that part of the Bill, at any rate, I am sure the noble Earl opposite is not opposed, because in his speech just now he took credit for the fact that he and his Party propose to give increased facilities for agricultural banks. He referred to a pronouncement he made in the autumn of last year, and he referred also to the Bill of Lord Shaftesbury. He made mention of these societies. The creation of these societies&#x2014;and if they are to be successful there must be a land bank or some similar institution behind them&#x2014;is, I believe, an object with which the noble Earl will agree.<lb/>
I pass to the criticisms which have been made on this Bill. The point has not been taken, although I think it fairly might be, that the Bill applies only to the small owner. The noble Earl who introduced the Bill does not attempt to deal in his measure with the tenant farmer to whom I referred just now. I think seventy-five acres is the limit of the holding with which be proposes to deal, and his answer to that is, of course, that he has no wider ambitions in his Bill than those which I have indicated. Then I pass to the criticisms of Lord Belper and Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, which were echoed by Lord Carrington. Nobody in this House would dispute for a moment
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0059"/>
<col>109</col>
the great weight with which Lord Belper speaks as representing, not only his own individual view, but the views of that important body, the County Councils Association. What were his objections to the Bill, or that part of the Bill which relates to county councils? That these are already over-weighted and over-burdened bodies; that my noble friend Lord Dunmore proposes to thrust upon them&#x2014;and I inferred that the county councils would be most reluctant to accept them&#x2014;new and onerous duties which they have neither the staff nor the inclination to perform. Then the noble Lord pointed out that in the Bill it was proposed that there should be constructed a large body of agents and officers to conduct these sales, and that altogether there was to be placed on county councils a vast additional volume of labour. I think that was a very powerful and probably a very just criticism, and I imagine it is a criticism to which due weight would be given by the promoters of this Bill. Then there was a further objection raised as to the financial proposals with regard to county councils. The Bill contains a suggestion that 20 per cent. of the purchase money should be found by the county councils, and more than one criticism has been made upon that proposal on the ground that it is placing undue financial risks upon the shoulders of county councils&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00376"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: And the ratepayers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00377"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I was coming to that in a moment. That again, I think, is a very pertinent criticism; and the noble Lord very justly drew attention to the fact that Lord Dunmore had admitted that this was a part of the Bill which was not essential to it, and it was one which the promoters of the Bill were quite willing to reconsider. Then I pass to the objections of Lord Faber. He spoke, of course, as a banker of great experience, and he objected to the institution of this National Land Bank. I understood him to say that in his view it was not a scheme that would earn the requisite interest, and that it would not be a particularly good investment for the debenture holders. Well, that is very important as coming from the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00378"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: May I interrupt for one moment? I did not say it would be a bad thing for the debenture holders. They obviously would be all right, because the nation would be behind them. I said it
<col>110</col>
would be a bad thing for the nation&#x2014;for the taxpayer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00379"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I misunderstood the noble Lord. I think he is perfectly right. The criticism that may be made upon the proposal is that it is a good scheme for the capitalist and not a good enough scheme either for the taxpayer or for the purchaser, and I think in any reconsideration that is given to this Bill that point ought to be taken seriously in hand. There was another objection raised by the noble Earl, Lord Carrington, that the Bill would take business out of the hands of the existing body of land agents, to whom the noble Earl paid a well-deserved compliment. I do not think, after all, that that is a very serious objection. If there is going to be a great additional volume of land transactions, naturally the existing agents would like to have a finger in the pie. But I do not think any sore feelings would be entertained by others co-operating in that undertaking. There was another point taken by Lord Clinton, who objects to this Bill because he is in favour of an alternative method of dealing with the question. I understood him to say that his views are those of the Rural League and Mr. Jesse Collings, and he is trying to find a solution in the Bill which will be introduced to-morrow by Lord Malmesbury. That is the view entertained by many persons on our side. Mr. Jesse Collings and his friends do undoubtedly look to the assistance of the State in the most direct form for a solution of this difficulty. They look to carrying out in England the example successfully set by Mr. Wyndham in his Irish Land Act of 1903, and to placing the credit and resources of the State at the disposal of the would-be owner of the land.<lb/>
It is a very fortunate thing, I should say, that on two successive days your Lordships will have the opportunity of discussing these alternative methods of dealing with the matter. The question remains, What is the best method for your Lordships to adopt with regard to this particular Bill? My noble friend Lord Dunmore concluded his speech with the proposal that it should be referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses, but I am bound to say I think conclusive reasons against that were given by Lord Belper. He said, Here is a measure introduced into this House, rightly or wrongly, which you propose to take out of the cognisance of this House and send
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0060"/>
<col>111</col>
elsewhere, so that you practically lose control over it in its future stages. That is a just criticism to which Lord Dunmore will no doubt be willing to defer. The question is what ought we to do, not merely with regard to this Bill, but with regard to the one which will make its appearance to-morrow. The noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, had he been in the House, would have asked you to take this position. He would have asked you to give a Second Reading to both Bills&#x2014;because there is much in the principle of both with which a large number, I venture to think myself a majority, of your Lordships' House will agree&#x2014;and then send both Bills to a Select Committee of this House in order that all the powerful criticisms to which we have listened may be thoroughly investigated by a competent body and the alternative methods of dealing with the question sifted. Then when the Committee reports this House will be in a better position than they are now to advance to the further consideration of the matter. I hope that your Lordships will be inclined to adopt this advice, which it seems to me applies with equal force to both Bills, and which will be the course most helpful to your Lordships' House in the future discussion of this question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00380"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before a Division is taken, may I ask the noble Earl, Lord Dunmore, whether on behalf of the promoters of the Bill he has any real objection to its going to a Committee of this House and not to a Joint Committee. Speaking for myself, I confess that I shall find great difficulty in supporting the measure if it is to go out of this House. I am as enthusiastically in favour of its objects and principles as is the noble Earl, but so many objections have been raised to the Bill that if the noble Earl persists in his Motion to refer the Bill to a Joint Committee I shall have great difficulty in voting for the Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00381"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MILNER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope the noble Earl will agree to the suggestion of the noble Viscount who has just sat down. I do not see how it is possible for us to ensure the Bill being considered by any Joint Committee, for it is extremely likely that the other House would take an unfavourable view of that proposal. Personally I feel considerable anxiety as to the possible outcome of this discussion and the one we are to have to-morrow night on another proposal for carrying out the same
<col>112</col>
object. I am a strong believer in the policy of multiplying the number of owners of land in this country. I think it absolutely vital to our social welfare and to our political future. I believe that is the feeling of the majority of the members of this House.<lb/>
What is the position in which we are placed? There are two Bills before us for carrying out this object, the one introduced to-night and the other to be introduced to-morrow. The Government are opposed to both measures. Both are open to considerable criticism. Both have some excellent features. I hardly think that the Bill of the noble Earl has been quite fairly treated in the discussion to-night, especially the banking proposals. I think there is a great deal more to be said for those proposals than has been admitted, but I do not want to discuss that or to go into any question of detail. The point is this: There are two proposals for promoting increase of ownership in land. The Government are opposed to both. There are many critics on both sides of the House, and unless we are very careful what will happen will be that the Government, hostile to the principle, together with some noble Lords on the other side, who are critical of details, will defeat this measure to-day. The Government will then, with the aid of another set of critics, defeat the other measure to-morrow, and thus the result will be that an object which is dear to the hearts of many of us will be entirely frustrated as far as this House is concerned. I shall not discuss at all the misrepresentations to which we are likely to be exposed in the country if that were to take place. The only wise course seems to me to be that the critics should reserve their criticisms for the Select Committee which is proposed, and that the House as a whole should give its approval to both Bills, which are both in their way honest attempts to carry out a principle which I believe the majority of the House approve.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00382"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the speech to which we have just listened from the noble Viscount puts the difficulties with which we are face to face very strongly. I listened with attention to the speech delivered by the noble Lord opposite, Lord Curzon, and with regard to the other speeches I am bound to say that hardly one word has been said in the course of this debate in favour of the Bill. A great deal
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0061"/>
<col>113</col>
has been said in favour of the abstract principle&#x2014;a very valuable principle, a most important principle, and one on which controversy arises. But some of us think, certainly I do myself, that you ought to go very cautiously into the business of multiplying small owners unless you have, in the general interests, some security for control over the way in which these small ownerships may be developed. But that is a large question on which I do not want to say more now.<lb/>
What I do wish to say is that, on the plea that this Bill has a principle of some kind, the go-by has been given to the enormous difficulties which almost every clause in it involves. To my mind we are dealing with a situation in which there is a principle over which there may be controversy, and there are three or four different kinds of propositions for giving effect to it. We shall know of the details of the other Bill to-morrow; but you cannot, with a situation that is as vague as this is, take the course of reading a second time two Bills and referring them to a Select Committee without being involved in all the difficulties of which the noble Viscount, Lord Milner, has spoken. There is hardly a point of this Bill which will not come into conflict, so far as I can ascertain, with the views of the majority of the members of this House. In these circumstances, are we not laying ourselves a little open to criticism by voting for time Second Reading of a Bill which is attacked in the debate on every point of detail, and sending it on to a Committee on the ground that there is a principle?<lb/>
I do not say anything of the financial proposals here, or of the criticisms that may be made on the proposition that the Treasury should be called upon, without more ado, to guarantee the interest on &#x00A3;25,000,000 of debentures, and that the county councils should be compulsorily called upon to find twenty per cent. of the purchase money. The Bill bristles with these points. It is for your Lordships to decide what course should be taken, but if the Bill goes to a Select Committee it must not be taken that the Government are not very much alive to the defects from which nearly every clause of the Bill suffers, and we must reserve to ourselves complete liberty of action when we come to that stage. At present it is for your Lordships to say whether it is desirable, in the interests of our reputation for efficiency, to pass the

Second Reading of a Bill which has received the volume of criticism on points of detail which this Bill has received.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00383"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps it is due to the House that I should say a few words with regard to the Resolution I have put on the Paper. Let me say that. I think the House would be placed in a considerable difficulty if my Resolution was put to the vote. I may say that I listened with interest to the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, and I feel very strongly that the procedure which is now proposed with regard to the later stages of the Bill would put me in an infinitely better position than had the Bill been referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses. In that case, as I pointed out, I should have had no opportunity at any later stage of enforcing the arguments that I have made use of against putting this matter upon the county councils. If both Bills are sent to a Select Committee, both Bills will be accompanied to that Select Committee by the fact, which I do not think can be disputed, that the arguments which I used that this should not be administered by the county councils have hardly found an opponent in this House. I noticed the sympathetic tone in which Lord Curzon referred to those arguments, and I can assure him that in using them I was not expressing merely my own opinions but I believe I those of the whole of the county councils. I sincerely hope that if I withdraw this Resolution those who have not contested the arguments I have used to-night will at a later stage take care that some other machinery shall be found for carrying out any measure with regard to small holdings that it may be decided in the future to try. I have only to add that in these circumstances I should, perhaps, be consulting the convenience of the House if I withdraw my Resolution to-night.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00399">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00400"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MALMESBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, yesterday my noble friend Lord Dunmore produced to your Lordships a Bill dealing with the same object, with the same great problem, as that with which the Bill standing in my name to-day seeks to deal. In a speech of great lucidity and clearness he dealt with alternative proposals, and I am sure your Lordships will join with me in offering him our congratulations upon dealing with a very difficult problem in the manner in which he did. Within the last twenty-four hours my attention has been called to certain comments which make it appear that there is a hostile rivalry between his Bill and the one I am introducing to your Lordships to-day. I should like to say at once that there is no hostile rivalry whatever between us, and I am sure the noble Earl would be the first to repudiate any suggestion that our schemes are in any sense hostile to one another.<lb/>
The two Bills are, however, rivals in a perfectly friendly sense, in the sense that one alternative must always be to another, and for my own part I infinitely prefer my own Bill because I believe it is the simplest and most direct way of dealing with this difficult problem. A further criticism has been made to the effect that the. Unionist Party is divided and split up with regard to this land policy. I saw that stated in a Radical journal this morning. With that I should like to say that I entirely and absolutely disagree. The Unionist Party is not split up upon the line of policy to be taken with regard to this question, and the two schemes which have been introduced
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0063"/>
<col>117</col>
into your Lordships' House in the last two days are merely different aspects of the same question. I would sum it up in the old Latin motto, <i>Gradu diverso, via una.</i> We are taking the same road but by a different step. The object my noble friend and I had in introducing these Bills together was to afford your Lordships an opportunity of considering the two measures side by side and considering them in further detail by their reference to a Select Committee.<lb/>
With all respect to the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture, I venture to say that the Act for which he was responsible has entirely broken down. It has broken down because it was founded upon principles which will never go to satisfy the object of those who have the land question at heart. It has broken down because it is based on the principle of tenancy as opposed to the principle of ownership. When that Act was first brought into operation a long list of applicants was sent in from every quarter as suitable occupiers for small holdings, but I am afraid that many of those applicantswere found to possessed characteristics more akin to those possessed by the "Gentle shepherd of Dartmoor" than to making a man a good and useful cultivator of the soil. Whatever credit is due to the working of the Small Holdings Act must in large measure be attributed to the courtesy and tact with which the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture has managed this matter. I hold no brief for it, and I say it is an unworkable measure; but I hope the noble Earl will forgive me when I pay him the compliment of saying that whatever success it has attained has been due to his own tact and diplomatic administration. The noble Earl was good enough yesterday to say that the landlords had backed up the Government nobly. I am glad he said that, because in every case the landlords of England have done their best to make the Government's Act a workable measure.<lb/>
There are the two schools of thought as between leasehold and ownership. I do not propose to emphasise the difference between those two schools. It is sufficient to say that the Unionist Party favour the ownership principle. With regard to the scheme of my noble friend Lord Dunmore, there is one criticism which I have to offer&#x2014;a criticism which also applies to the
<col>118</col>
Small Holdings Act of the noble Earl opposite. It is that these schemes are too large, too big altogether for the local bodies to administer. The advantage of the Bill which I am asking your Lordships to read a second time to-day is that it is handed over to a Department already in existence, with advisers, with experts, with the machinery all there ready to cope with the measure. There is this further difficulty. The moment you hand over a great measure to local bodies, whether it be to the county council or to any other body, you at once have the extra financial risk placed on the ratepayers, and I take it your Lordships will agree with me when I say that the ratepayers of this country are already called upon to do too much.<lb/>
I will endeavour to make as clear as possible the provisions of this Bill. I take no credit for it to myself. Whatever credit there is must rest with that distinguished veteran statesman, Mr. Jesse Collings, who for so many years, in and out of Parliament, on the platform and in that charming volume of his, "Land Reform," has been advocating the great principle which this Bill contains. We are told that; there is no desire for land. Only a moment ago I was talking to a noble friend of mine in this House who very much questioned whether there was any desire for land; and a cynic once remarked that land was very much like matrimony&#x2014;those who were in it wanted to be out of it, and those who were out of it wanted to be in it. I do not accept the analogy of that cynic, but I certainly say that by providing land for the small holder you are giving opportunities to the most healthy young men of this country to settle and marry and live upon the land. You are taking a step towards re-establishing that most healthy class, which after all is the backbone of every nation&#x2014;the agricultural and farming class.<lb/>
This Bill is in two parts. The object of Part I is to restore and extend the system of cultivating ownership in England and Wales by providing facilities for the sale of land to occupying tenants, and the object of Part II is to restore and extend the system of peasant proprietary in this country. Under Part I it is hoped that money will be provided very much on the lines of Mr. Wyndham's Act for Ireland, which I think we must all admit has been an unqualified success. Clause 1 sets out
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0064"/>
<col>119</col>
the conditions under which the application for sale of land to the tenant may be made. It provides that where a landlord and his tenant are agreed to purchase, they may either jointly or separately apply to the Board of Agriculture for the sale to the tenant of the holding. The noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture will see that in this Bill the authority of the Board of Agriculture has been entirely and thoroughly safeguarded. With Clause 2 I need not trouble your Lordships. It has reference merely to the conditions of sale, and gives certain particulars about the different class of owners and is purely legal. Clause 3 deals with the title of the land&#x2014;a clause which it is necessary to insert in every Bill for land purchase. Clause 4 is merely a descriptive clause specifying certain charges not deemed incumbrances. Clause 5 deals with the costs of sale, and provides for the settlement of certain fees with regard to sale. Clause 6 has reference purely to the distribution of the purchase money.<lb/>
Clause 7 deals with advances to tenants for the purchase of their holdings. It provides that the Board may advance to any tenant for the purpose of purchasing his holding the whole or any less part of the price of such holding, and upon such advance being made the Board shall by order declare the holding to be charged, and the holding shall thereupon become charged, with the payment to the Board in respect of and in lieu of such advance. This clause simply regulates that after the advance has been made and the agreement drawn up the land becomes chargeable to the Board with the annuities specified elsewhere. Clause 8 limits the advance that may be made to any one purchaser. It provides that an advance shall not exceed&#x00A3;7,000 unless the Board, by reason of special circumstances, deem it expedient to make an advance not exceeding&#x00A3;9,000.<lb/>
The repayment of these advances is regulated by Clause 9, which lays down that the purchasing tenant shall pay at the rate of 3&#x00BC; per cent. in all&#x2014;2&#x00BE; per cent. to represent the interest on the loan, and&#x00BD; per cent. to represent sinking fund. These are distinctly more advantageous terms than the terms in the Bill which was read a second time last night. Then there follows the ordinary section to protect the Board in case of non-payment of the annuities. I am well aware that
<col>120</col>
there are certain parts of this Bill which could be modified, but that does not discourage me because I believe there is hardly any important. Act of Parliament which has ever been placed on the Statute Book without some modification or some extension. Clause 11 is, I think, important. It is a prohibition of sub-division and subletting. When this Bill goes to Committee, if it does go to Committee, I hope your Lordships will insert some clause which shall safeguard the vendor from loss and also prevent any possible land speculator using this Bill for purposes other than agriculture. The danger in any Bill of this sort is, of course, that a land speculator may take advantage of it in order to acquire land cheaply, and therefore I hope some strengthening clause will be inserted which will prevent that danger.<lb/>
I now come to Part II, which I consider almost the more important part of the Bill. Clause 13&#x2014;the first clause in Part II&#x2014;provides that the Board may, subject to the provisions of this Bill, purchase from any absolute or limited owner any land which they may deem suitable for the I purpose of providing small holdings. Under the Small Holdings Act passed by the noble Earl opposite the county councils and the Board of Agriculture together provide small holdings for certain applicants. What has happened is that many a hardship is inflicted upon a landlord&#x2014;but that does not matter&#x2014;and many a hardship is inflicted upon a tenant farmer. What has been going on all over the country? Landlords, in order to assist the noble Earl, as he so generously admitted last night, have very often been obliged to take the eye of the farm away in order to provide for these small holders, who generally apply for the best field in a farm. Under Part II of this Bill the Board of Agriculture will be able to do what has been done in Germany. In Germany there is a system whereby land, a whole farm, is purchased and handed out to small colonising farmers, who, as far as I am able to ascertain from people who have been there, are doing extremely well on the land.<lb/>
The other provisions in Part II are very similar to those contained in Part I&#x2014;that is to say, they are provisions protecting the Board and providing for the payment of interest, the arrangement of
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0065"/>
<col>121</col>
the advances, and so on. Clause 21 gives the Board power to erect buildings or adapt existing buildings. I am not sure that I am altogether satisfied that that clause might not require amending when it gets to Committee. I think it is desirable that the Board should be protected to this extent, that they should not be called upon to spend too much money upon the holding after it has passed out of their hands. For that reason I would be perfectly willing&#x2014;and I am sure my right hon, friend Mr. Jesse Collings would be willing&#x2014;that the clause should be somewhat modified. Part III is financial. Without any prejudice to the privileges of your Lordships' House, I think it is undesirable that we should discuss those clauses to-day. I hope I have succeeded in a measure in making the provisions of this Bill clear to your Lordships.<lb/>
The advantage which this Bill has over Lord Dunmore's Bill is this, that you have the advantage of direct dealing with the State. In the Bill which was introduced yesterday a National Land Bank with a State guarantee was to be the medium for providing this money. I do not like guarantees. I personally have never had to give a guarantee without having had to find most of the money afterwards, and if that happened in this case the last state of my noble friend's Bill would be exactly the same as the course which I am taking to-day&#x2014;namely, the State would have to find the money. Lord Faber said yesterday that he thought Lord Dunmore was very sanguine if he imagined that he would easily raise&#x00A3;5,000,000. I entirely agree with Lord Faber. I do not think it is possible to raise&#x00A3;5,000,000 in a National Land Bank, because, in the first place, in order to make it possible for the would-be purchaser to pay a reasonable rate of interest it would be absolutely impossible for the Land Bank to make a profit; and I would like to ask whether you are likely to get&#x00A3;5,000,000in a land bank without some of the owners of that money desiring to make a profit. In one clause of his Bill the noble Earl talks of bonuses and profits and other things, and in reading that clause I was somewhat reminded of an account I read years ago as a boy of the South Sea Bubble. That is why I prefer direct State guarantee. I prefer State guarantee because the State can lend far more cheaply than a private individual, and, what is more, you do not
<col>122</col>
have the middleman, and it is the object of every transaction in these days to as far as possible get rid of the middleman. The difference between the State financing the scheme and a bank financing the scheme is the difference between the wholesale and the retail merchant.<lb/>
No doubt your Lordships will have in your minds the Irish Loan, the enormous sums of money which were found and the loss which was suffered in providing that loan for land purposes. I do not think that is a very strong argument against this Bill, and I will tell you why in the first place I believe that the flotation of the Irish Loan was not as satisfactory as it might have been. It was a first attempt, and I do not doubt that in another attempt the Treasury could provide means for guarding themselves rather better. And in connection with this I might say that I am certain that no purchaser would find fault if he were asked to pay rather a higher rate of interest. Suppose the rate of interest was 3 per cent. instead of 2&#x00BE;, and then allow another &#x00BD; per cent. for sinking fund; 3&#x00BD; per cent. would not be at all too high for the advantage of acquiring ownership.<lb/>
There is one other advantage which I think attaches to this Bill. I would like to see His Majesty's Government dealing in land, because that would more than ever convince us that His Majesty's Government had confidence in this particular kind of stock. I myself would feel my confidence in land greatly restored if I saw His Majesty's Government come forward to advance a loan on the security of land. There is another thing which, after all, is very important. Take these land banks. As Lord Faber pointed out, the sum is an enormous one to raise, and I venture to think that a very small proportion of those who invested their money in the land banks would be what might be termed philanthropic financiers. I am afraid that the establishment of a land bank and the purchasing of land through the medium of this land bank would eventually mean neither more nor less than the handing over of the farmers of this country and others into the hands of glorified moneylenders. That may be a real or imaginary danger, but that is the reason why I prefer this scheme to the alternative scheme introduced yesterday.<lb/>

There is another objection, I think a real and substantial objection, to Lord Dunmore's Bill, and that is that county councils in this instance are called upon to administer an Act for the benefit of a private corporation. The land bank having been formed at once proceeds to apply to the county council and the Board to administer the Act. I have had some years' experience of county council work and still have the honour to be a member of a county council, but I do not see where the county council is going to get time to administer an Act of this sort, and under its provisions, if the scheme failed, the finances of the county council are placed in a very unfavourable position. The county council are to have the pleasure of coming in last. They are to have the pleasure of taking a mortgage on a mortgage. Suppose the scheme failed, the land banks would then call upon the State to provide the money; the State then would come in and the land bank would come in and grab all they could. But what becomes of the county council? They would have to go with a smiling face to the ratepayers and ask them to fork up the money which had somehow disappeared. I do not wish entirely to throw cold water upon the suggestion of land banks. Such institutions can be most valuable. For instance, in the scheme which my noble friend Lord Shaftesbury introduced some time ago we had a most valuable proposal for helping certain classes of people. I can well imagine that these land banks are most valuable for the purpose of helping a tenant who had purchased his holding by State money to develop his land afterwards; and the advantage of co-operative land banks I need not point out, as I am sure your Lordships will agree that such banks are and would be of the greatest salvation to this country. But I say that this scheme is altogether too large for a private corporation to deal with, and that it can only be dealt with by means of a Treasury loan and with the confidence that the Government was behind it and there was no intermediate body.<lb/>
One thing I forgot to mention earlier. When this Bill goes before the Select Committee, if your Lordships give it a Second Reading to-night, I think we might very well insert some provision with regard to land transfer in order to cheapen the transfer of land. I do not know whether His Majesty's
<col>124</col>
Government will agree with me upon that. They have made the transfer of land dearer, and therefore I hope when this Bill goes to the Committee something will be inserted providing for the cheapening of land transfer. I should like to see an investment, clause put into this Bill such as was in Mr. Wyndham's Act, and I would like to see a clause inserted to more closely regulate the sub-division and subsequent sale of land under the Bill.<lb/>
I do not think I need detain your Lordships longer except to refer to a few opinions in support of this Bill which come from various parts of the country. First of all I have opinions as to the causes why so much land is in the market. I expect the noble Earl knows as well as I do why there is so much land in the market at the present moment. But surely, having got all this land in the market, this is the very moment to pass a Bill or make possible the passage of a Bill which is going to give the sitting tenants an opportunity of purchasing their holding. Here is one extract&#x2014;
<quote>"What may happen in the future I do not know, It is the uncertainty as to future taxation, more than perhaps that lately imposed, which causes the breaking up of estates. I hear to-day that Lord&#x2014;is proposing to sell his estate, which has been in his family since the Conquest."</quote>
I have a large number of other extracts from farmers and others drawing attention to the amount of land available, and asking that there should be an opportunity for them to purchase their holdings. Then I have certain regrets which have been expressed by farmers and others that this Bill had not been in force during the last few years. In that case many a man would, they say, have had an opportunity of buying his holding, which has now been sold with the whole estate. Next I have "organised opinions of tenant farmers and others with regard to the advantages to be gained by this Bill." In addition to the Central Chamber of Agriculture, the Scottish Chamber of Agriculture, and the Farmers' Club, which have signified their approval of the principles of this Bill, no fewer than 168 other chambers of agriculture and farmers' associations have passed resolutions to a similar effect. I have the list, in my hand. One resolution states that&#x2014;
<quote>"The solution of the difficulty lies in the enactment of Mr. Jesse Collings's Land Purchase Bill."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0067"/>
<col>125</col>
And this resolution is from the Yorkshire Union of Agricultural Clubs and Chambers of Agriculture&#x2014;a most important body.<lb/>
I have to thank your Lordships for the kind indulgence which you have accorded me in moving the Second Reading of this Bill. I feel that the Bill is not perfect. I do not claim that it is any heaven-sent panacea towards entirely solving this problem. But I do say that it seems to me to be by far the most sound and the most practical scheme for the solution of this most difficult problem. I believe that if His Majesty's Government were to be good enough to give it their serious consideration they would find that it was not as much of a bugbear as perhaps they imagine, and I feel sure that the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture would be then able to tell us, in his courteous and ingenuous manner, that after all the Board had found something in this scheme. If your Lordships are pleased to give the Bill a Second Reading, I shall afterwards move that it be referred to a Select Committee.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Earl said: My Lords, before I move the Resolution which stands in my name I think it my duty to apologise for the necessity under which I am placed of inflicting another speech on your Lordships. Noble Lords on the opposite side of the House, in the friendly rivalry of which the noble Earl has so pleasantly spoken, seem to me to be determined to bring in almost daily some agricultural Bill which involves a very serious drain on the public purse, and therefore my having to speak again at such short notice is your Lordships' misfortune but really not my fault. I thank the noble Earl very much for his kindly words, and the only portion of his speech to which I could take exception was that in which he talked of the hard-
<col>126</col>
ships which, he said, under our Act had been inflicted on tenant farmers. That is a remark which is very often made. It is made on a great many platforms, but it is not a remark that will hold water. It has been made in this House, but not one member of your Lordships' House has ever been able to bring forward a single specific case where any hardship has occurred. I was able to get a Bill through your Lordships' House last year to pay compensation for disturbance to farmers, which was made retrospective for two years, and I have in my hand a list of the claims that have been paid under that Act. They amount to&#x00A3;1,772, and I shall be pleased to hand the list to the noble Earl to look over as a confirmation of my statement that our Act has been well and properly and fairly administered, and as far as I know there has not been a single case of hardship under it.<lb/>
I must ask your Lordships to give serious consideration for a few moments to the details of this Bill. As far as I can make out, Lord Malmesbury proposes by this Bill to crystallise the new attitude of the House of Lords with regard to the old system of landlord and tenant. He justly describes it as my old and right hon. friend Mr. Jesse Collings's Bill; and this Bill, if it means anything, means that the patriarchal system which was supposed to be the great stand-by and the great protection of English agriculture, is going by the board, if it has not already gone. Let us take the Bill of the noble Earl as it stands. The first clause, as he told us, provides that any landlord or tenant may, on having agreed upon a price&#x2014;rather an important thing&#x2014;apply to the Board of Agriculture for the sale to the tenant of his holding. What does that mean? In plain English it means that the Board of Agriculture, as was so well said yesterday by my noble friend, Lord Belper, are becoming land agents for the sale of land. Lord Malmesbury goes a step further. Not only are they to be land agents, but he hopes to see the day when the Board of Agriculture, which, after all, is the Government, become land dealers. That certainly is a great step in advance.<lb/>
Then let us go to Clause 3. That clause provides that every application to the Board shall be accompanied by a deposit by the landlord. That means that the Board of Agriculture is to take over the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0068"/>
<col>127</col>
deposit. I suppose it will be responsible for it. It will have to put it out at interest, or put it into the care of some person who will give the Board interest for it. In fact, the Board now becomes a banker. In the latter part of Clause 3 it is provided that the Board shall inquire as to the circumstances and the sufficiency of the price. As regards the circumstances, I suppose most people would say that would be a very legitimate and proper thing to do. But the sufficiency of the price&#x0021; Think for a moment what that means. It means that we are to inquire whether the landlord gets enough for the property that he sells of his own initiative to the tenant. It is well known that if glebe land, for instance, is sold, we have to see that the land fetches its proper value; but it seems to me a strong stipulation to impose to say that if a man sells his estate the Board of Agriculture should go and see that the poor, dear landlord had got a sufficient price from the rascally tenant. That means that the Board now becomes either a private or a public inquiry office.<lb/>
The noble Earl rightly describes Clause 7 as an important clause. It provides that the Board may make advances to "any" tenant for the purchase of his holding. The Board now becomes a moneylender. Therefore we have the Board of Agriculture in these four distinct capacities&#x2014;land agents, bankers, inquiry office, and moneylenders; though I am bound to say there is a qualification that the unfortunate Board of Agriculture is not to lend more than &#x00A3;7,000, going up, I believe, to &#x00A3;10,000, to any one particular tenant. I should like to ask the noble Earl how this advance is going to be repaid. As I understand, it is going to be repaid by a purchase annuity calculated at 3&#x00BC; per cent. The noble Earl adumbrated&#x2014;I believe that is the proper word&#x2014;some peculiar changes that were going to be made in the Bill, either by Mr. Jesse Collings or some unknown persons, but I prefer to stick to the text of the Bill, and take it as I find it. I presume the provision in the Bill means that 2&#x00BE; per cent. is to be paid as interest, and &#x00BD; per cent. for sinking fund, and that is to be repaid in 68&#x00BD;years. I will say a word about that in a moment.<lb/>
Clause 11 provides that the prospective owner shall not subdivide or sublet his property. That is not a very attractive proposal to a man who is going to be
<col>128</col>
seduced by the belief that he is going to have the magic of ownership. He is not only not to subdivide or sublet it during the 68&#x00BD; years in which, if he lives long enough, he is going to pay off the sum by the &#x00BD; per cent. sinking fund, but when he becomes the absolute possessor of his land he is neither to divide nor sublet it. Just think what that means. A man pays &#x00A3;700 or &#x00A3;1,000 for his farm, and he is not allowed, without the consent of the Board of Agriculture, to subdivide any portion of the land which belongs to him and over which he has the magic of ownership. Nor without the permission of the Board is he allowed to set aside a field for allotments or for potato-growing for his labourers. I honestly do not think that that is a very attractive proposition to lay before intending purchasers. Then he cannot mortgage his holding for any sum exceeding five times the rateable value&#x2014;that, of course, would be about 20 per cent. of the capital value. I do not suppose anybody would advance much money on a holding which certainly for the first fifty years was being paid for at the slow rate of &#x00BD; per cent. But let that pass.<lb/>
There is one provision in this Bill which I think has been overlooked by the noble Earl. It is that a man can sell by the redemption of his purchase annuity. That opens the door to any amount of land speculation. This is the inevitable result: If the land goes up in value, of course the purchaser pockets the profit, but if it falls in value out he goes and the loss in money falls on the State and the community. Therefore I was not in the least surprised when I heard the noble Earl say that all these chambers of agriculture, farmers' clubs, and different agricultural societies in England are keen on the proposal. In fact, it would be a great want of intelligence on their part if they did not do everything possible in their power to get my old friend Mr. Jesse Collings's Bill through both Houses of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00404"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I am delighted to see that the noble Earl has discovered flaws in Mr. Jesse Collings's Bill, but with the permission of the House I would like
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0069"/>
<col>129</col>
to argue on the Bill as it is presented to us in black and white. Where is the noble Earl going to get the money for all this? Where is this money coming from? He will say, "You have not read the Bill; you have not read Clause 25. We get all the money we want from the Consolidated Fund." That is very nice indeed. But what is the Consolidated Fund? The Consolidated Fund is a fund into which are paid the proceeds of the Imperial taxes, which up to the present moment have been imposed by the elected House of Parliament. That is what the Consolidated Fund is, and therefore under this Bill fresh taxation will be imposed to the tune of &#x00A3;12,000,000, and will be imposed by the unblushing proposal of Lord Malmesbury and my right hon. friend Mr. Jesse Collings. And this measure is introduced into your Lordships' House at this particular time&#x0021; I leave it at that.<lb/>
May I say one word about the financial difficulties which are apparent to everybody on reading this Bill? The terms are 2&#x00BE; per cent. interest, and &#x00BD; per cent. sinking fund payable for 68&#x00BD; years. We all know that those are the terms that were payable under the Irish Land Act of 1903. Here again this Bill provides a text for a splendid platform oration. It was said all through the last election, "Why do they do all this for Ireland? Why do they do nothing for us? Here are you farmers being trampled upon," and so on. When you come to thresh this out in your Lordships' House there is not a single noble Lord who does not know that no Government since that date has ever been able to borrow on those terms. There has been a deficit every year ever since 1903. Then who has been paying this deficit? Why the noble Earl and myself and your Lordships and everybody in England. And this came to such a pitch that in 1909 the Act had to be amended and fresh terms made. We all remember what a hullabaloo there was in this House. We all remember the debates when poor Lord Denman was almost driven out of his seven senses, and we remember them all the more because it touched us&#x2014;I am an Irish Peer though I have no Irish land&#x2014;it touched the pockets of Irish Peers because they are paid now, not in cash, but in 3 per cent. Stock at par, though that Stock fetches much less in the market at present. And besides that the bonus which was given to the landlords was
<col>130</col>
reduced, I think, from 12&#x00BD; per cent. to something like 7 per cent., which naturally caused great commotion in your Lordships' House. Therefore I do say, without fear of contradiction, that the financial terms proposed by the noble Earl and Mr. Jesse Collings are quite inadmissible as they stand.<lb/>
Part II refers to the purchase of land for "smaller holdings." Small holdings are in size from one acre to fifty acres, but, curiously enough, in this Bill "smaller holdings" are from three acres to not more than 100 acres. If noble Lords will look at Clause 13 they will see a provision to the effect that the Board may purchase any land for persons who desire to buy. That is to say, you need not be a tenant. You may be anybody; the Board of Agriculture must buy the land for any tinker, tailor, or candlestick-maker who desires it. In Clause 21 the House will observe that not only can the Board of Agriculture advance the whole of the price&#x2014;just think of advancing the whole of the price&#x0021;&#x2014;but under Clause 21 it is to advance the whole of the cost of adaptation. I am not absolutely certain whether the Board cannot advance for buildings. Then in Clause 24 there is again the proviso that no "smaller holding" for the purpose of which the Board shall have made an advance shall be subdivided or let without the consent of the Board. But with that care which we all take over our poorer brethren there is the provision at the end of Clause 24 that if any such holding should be subdivided or let, the Board of Agriculture may cause the holding to be sold.<lb/>
Then with regard to finance there is this curious provision, that out of this &#x00A3;12,000,000 only &#x00A3;2,000,000 is to be devoted to the poor people, and &#x00A3;10,000,000 is to be devoted to the big farmers. "Unto him that hath," and so on. That shows the difference that has come over Mr. Jesse Collings since he has moved about in well-bred and fashionable society. In old days when he used to address the agriculturists and the chairmakers of Buckinghamshire with me from a farm cart and preach Radicalism to them, it would have been&#x00A3;10,000,000 for the poor and&#x00A3;2,000,000 for the rich&#x2014;and very lucky the rich would have been if he had given them as much as that. Now the poor people are to come off second best, and are only to get a sixth of the whole sum. I will not detain the House as to the respective
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0070"/>
<col>131</col>
advantages of tenancy and ownership. That has been threshed out so often that perhaps I might refer the House to a very important debate that took place at the Farmers' Club in November of last year, when the case for both sides was fairly stated, and any one who reads that debate will be able to judge for himself which side has the best of it.<lb/>
But I do maintain, and I challenge contradiction on this, that as far as we know at the present time there is not much demand for owning small holdings. My old friend Mr. Jesse Collings, who is a past-master in genial craft, went down to see my small holders in Lincolnshire, and he said to them, "Don't you wish that this land belonged to you instead of to Lord Carrington?" and all my tenants replied, "Yes, Mr. Collings, we do." They thought, "This is the man for us; Carrington is no good. This is the man we must stick to." Mr. Collings told them, "You stick to the Unionist Party and we will be the men who will do this for you." I went down about six weeks afterwards and saw a lot of my tenants. I said to them, "I hear you want to buy your small holdings. I will sell them to you with the greatest possible pleasure." Their chins dropped and they said, "God forbid; we are perfectly satisfied as we are"; and they gave me the idea that they had believed Mr. Jesse Collings wanted to make them a present of the land. In that case I can understand this desire for ownership. Out of 4,000 applicants for small holdings in 1910 there were only seventy-four persons who expressed any desire, and that was not a wild one, to buy&#x2014;only 1&#x00B7;8 of the whole, not a very large proportion; and in Cambridgeshire, where 4,000 acres of land were acquired by the county councils in the two years, there was only one man who wanted to buy his holding, and he turned out to be an uncertificated bankrupt and so they could not come to terms.<lb/>
On the other hand, I recognise that in Wales there is some demand, and I pay a tribute of respect and gratitude to Lord Penrhyn and Mr. Assheton-Smith, of Vaynol, for their chivalrous conduct in the way they met their tenants. They sold some of their outlying farms to men who wished to remain on their own holdings, and I sent a Commissioner down to Carmarthenshire who arranged with the county council to advance 80 per cent. We were
<col>132</col>
able to arrange for an advance of 80 per cent. of the purchase money to these people, who had a little money of their own and were able to get the remainder through friends. These purchasing tenants are on the land now and doing extremely well. There is no desire on our part, where arrangements can be made with justice to the public purse, to prevent ownership of land on a businesslike basis. There is, however, a good deal of misrepresentation in this matter. Mr. Walter Long said, in the House of Commons in June, 1907&#x2014;
<quote>"I think the Government will find, when they ask future small holders, 'Do you wish to become small holders on the basis of ownership or occupation?' that, in 90 per cent. of the cases the reply will be in favour of ownership."</quote>
As I have told the House to-day, our experience was that out of 4,000 applications in 1910 only 1&#x00B7;8 of the whole were wishful to buy.<lb/>
It may be said that it is a curious thing to find a Radical opposing Tory proposals for social reform, but I do respectfully beg to say that there is an enormous difference between your revolutionary land policy and ours. Our land policy for the last five years has been, without frightening or injuring or being afraid of any one, to try to build up brick by brick and stone by stone a self-supporting system economically sound, and I do think that we can show a good result from the seventeen Agricultural Acts out of the eighteen Bills which, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, I have introduced since I have been President of the Board of Agriculture. I do not take the smallest credit to myself for that. I only say, knowing the determination of your Lordships at all costs and all hazards not to allow any improper legislation to pass through this House, that I can lay my head on my pillow with an easy conscience because I know that in those seventeen Acts there could not have been anything wrong or detrimental to the welfare of the country. I quite agree that there is a serious outlook for farmers in this country. The patriarchal system of land ownership seems to necessitate proceedings of eviction. As everybody knows, when an estate is put in the market every one&#x2014;farmers, labourers, small holders, everybody&#x2014;is given notice to quit. That, we are told, is absolutely necessary, because for a sale you must have vacant possession. I do not quarrel with that, but I do say
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0071"/>
<col>133</col>
that we land reformers who have been thinking of this have had a remedy at the back of our heads for a considerable time.<lb/>
So long ago as 1902 or 1903, in the Report of the Welsh Land Commission of which I had the honour to be chairman, we recommended the suggestion that on the sale of an estate tenants should be allowed to remain for two or three years; and now since the matter has become acute I have appointed a Departmental Committee, and have been fortunate enough to secure Lord Haversham&#x2014;one of the best chairmen in England&#x2014;as chairman of that Committee to make inquiry into the subject. Would it not be wise to wait for the Report of Lord Haversham's Committee before we pledge ourselves to Mr. Jesse Collings's proposals, which, to say the least, are somewhat crude and ill-considered? Besides that, there is a higher principle involved. Ought we at this time and in this House to initiate financial proposals which must inevitably excite false hopes, and which, even if experimentally adopted, would entail a charge of &#x00A3;12,000,000 on public funds? In 1909 your Lordships, in your wisdom, thought fit to throw out our Budget, which provided means for meeting the extra taxation of the country which was absolutely necessary in the circumstances, and now you propose that that expenditure should be enormously increased. Our view is that a Bill which raises financial issues at every stage should be introduced in the house of Commons. Therefore I beg to move the Resolution standing in my name, and I respectfully hope that I shall have the support of the House in carrying it.<lb/>

<col>134</col>
crime&#x2014;I have just come from the West of England where I have been electioneering; and I should like to take this Opportunity of saving that, whatever may be said by noble Lords in this House, there is undoubtedly, for reasons which I shall endeavour to explain, a good deal of dissatisfaction at the existing conditions of things. My noble friend the President of the Board of Agriculture concluded his remarks by stating what we already knew&#x2014;namely, that he had appointed a Committee to investigate cases admittedly of hardship where farms are sold and tenants disturbed from their holdings. I wish to say, in passing, that although I have sold a good many outlying estates I have never given my tenants notice to quit. My noble friend said it was general that whenever a sale took place the tenants and cottagers and everybody were given notice to quit. That is not always the case. I admit that where it is the case some hardship does exist. But the real cause of that is that the very heavy taxation under the Budget and the policy and unrestricted language of a good many members of His Majesty's Government have so frightened the confidence of owners that they have felt no alternative but to sell large portions of their estates.<lb/>
What my noble friend has referred to as the patriarchal system, so far as the tenant farmers are concerned, has been an exceedingly beneficial system in this country. Most of the great landowners, whether wisely or unwisely, have certainly not received any commercial return upon their property in land. I should like, in regard to that, to refer to the alternative policy adopted by my noble friend. He said yesterday that he did not wish to blow his own trumpet. I am sure nobody in this House is more modest; but if he did blow his trumpet as I have known him blow his horn when he was Master of the Cotswold hounds he could do it with great effect. With all deference to the noble Earl, I do not think if he were to go down to rural constituencies and advocate the advantage of this system of county council tenancies it would awaken any large or responsive echo. Why? Because tenants under county council arrangements have a much stricter and a much more exacting landlord than they had before. I should like to refer to that matter. My noble friend says that the way to meet this difficulty is under his Act for creating
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0072"/>
<col>135</col>
tenants under county councils. I do not know whether your Lordships have studied the Annual Report of the Small Holdings Commissioners. It is a very instructive Report. There are two classes of cases. There are the cases where the county council purchases the land out and out. In that case, let us consider what the tenant has to pay. He has to pay the interest on the purchase money, <i>plus</i> a charge for the sinking fund. Besides that, he has to pay a charge for moneys expended on buildings, equipment, and adaptation of the land. Then in addition he has to pay from 15 to 20 per cent. of the total for repairs, for insurance, for management, and for what is termed in a very elastic phrase "contingencies." Now, under the patriarchal system which the policy of the Government has had the effect of frightening out of existence, on the large estates the tenants practically had their repairs kept up for them, and they certainly did not pay anything for insurance or management.<lb/>
Now I come to the more general case of county council tenants, where the county council leases the land from the owner. Where there are no buildings, the rent is equal to that which is paid by the county council; but in addition the tenant has to pay from 7&#x00BD; to 10 per cent. for management, and where there are buildings he has to pay an additional 7&#x00BD; to 10 per cent. for repairs. What the people feel is this, that they are paying more than they would pay to a large landowner, and at the end of the time the land will not be theirs. There is another remarkable statement in that Report. I find these words&#x2014;
<quote>"There have been several cases of particularly good purchases where the Councils could have afforded to let the land in small holdings at rents considerably less than the former occupiers have paid. The Board of Agriculture have, however, taken the view that in such cases the rents charged should be based on a fair rental value."</quote>
In other words&#x2014;and this is what I want to point out&#x2014;the policy of the Board of Agriculture under the existing Act is that the State and not the tenant is to get the benefit of the good bargains. That is a very important point. I confess I was somewhat surprised to hear my noble friend Lord Carrington state that there was no demand for small holdings. I believe I am quoting my noble friend correctly.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00413"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I am glad that the noble Earl has made the matter clear now. Be that as it may, if there be a demand for small holdings what I maintain is that there is a still greater demand for a system under which these people should become owners, and not become permanent occupiers under the State. I do not see why on this occasion we need go into criticisms directed against certain portions of the Bill. No doubt the financial points are very serious and anxious ones. I read the interesting speech of my noble friend Lord Faber yesterday, and I quite appreciate, of course, that it is a matter we cannot discuss in this House. Nobody proposed that we should discuss the financial proposals. All that is proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Malmesbury, is that his Bill should be accorded a Second Reading similar to the Bill of Lord Dunmore last night, and that it should then be referred, not to a Committee of your Lordships' House, but to a Joint Committee. [Several NOBLE LORDS: No, no.] I understand now that he proposes to refer it to a Select Committee. Very well. There will be no objection whatever to that, because the matter can be carefully considered. It is perfectly obvious, from the reply of my noble friend opposite, that the present Government do not intend to deal with this question at all, but in the meantime
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0073"/>
<col>137</col>
we shall at least be making some progress in getting the difficult points that have been raised considered by a perfectly impartial Committee. In these circumstances it does seem to me that your Lordships' House ought to adopt the suggestion of Lord Malmesbury, read his Bill a second time, and then refer it to a Committee to further investigate and report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00414"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in his remarks in moving the Second Reading of this Bill the noble Earl made certain references to the Irish Land Purchase Act, in which he seemed to find an analogue to the Bill which is now before your Lordships. A cursory reading of the Bill will satisfy any one that there is great similarity between it and the Irish Land Purchase Act of 1903, particularly in regard to the voluntary nature of the transactions and in regard to other provisions upon which I do not propose to detain your Lordships now, as they are matters more for Committee, should the Bill reach the Committee stage. I will only say, in regard to the provisions of the Bill other than the financial provisions, that I trust the noble Earl will not rest satisfied with the securities which he has provided in Clause 11 of his Bill, if he wishes to prevent the splitting up of holdings and the division of small holdings into still smaller holdings. He has taken that provision from the Irish Land Act, but I assure your Lordships that the provision has been found in Ireland to be unsatisfactory and insufficient.<lb/>
I desire particularly to direct your Lordships' attention to the financial points. It is quite true that the Irish Land Act of 1903 did provide for the payment of the purchase advance in cash. Therein it differed from the custom of previous Acts&#x2014;those Acts with which the name of my noble friend Lord Ashbourne is so honourably connected; and the result was that the Treasury had to raise loans in order to provide funds for land purchase. Those loans could at the time only be raised at a loss, and provision was made in the Land Act of 1903 to meet that loss. The Ireland Development Grant in the first instance was made a sort of buffer between the Irish ratepayer, upon whom the loss was ultimately to fall, and the Treasury. But the Ireland Development Grant was soon exhausted, and then the loss caused by the flotation of loans had to be paid either by the Irish ratepayer
<col>138</col>
or by the Treasury. The Act provided that the obligation lay upon the Irish ratepayer, and he was called upon to pay. The Irish ratepayers, represented by the county councils, stated that they never knew they were incurring such an obligation as that. The obligation had been imposed in former Land Purchase Acts but had never been enforced, and finally they refused to pay. The Treasury said, "We cannot raise loans without incurring expense. Somebody must pay, and inasmuch as you refuse to pay we refuse to raise any more loans until we are made secure against the loss." In that way land purchase in Ireland came to a standstill. When the Act of 1903 was passed Consols stood at about 94 or 95, but in a few years Consols had fallen to nearly 80, so that the Treasury could raise no loans without incurring a loss of 15 to 20 per cent. Consequently the whole thing came to a standstill, and it was absolutely necessary that some steps should be taken in order that land purchase should go forward. The Government took up the matter, and the result was the Act of 1909, the principal provisions of which were that the Irish ratepayers were relieved of the obligation imposed upon them, discretion was given to the Treasury to pay owners in Stock instead of cash, and in order to enable them to issue a 3 per cent. Stock the annuity was raised from 3&#x00BC; to 3&#x00BD; per cent.<lb/>
Now in this Bill it is provided that the Treasury shall make certain advances from the Consolidated Fund. The Consolidated Fund is nothing more than the aggregate of the year's taxation. Therefore, as was pointed out by the noble Earl, Lord Carrington, it would be necessary, in order to make advances from the Consolidated Fund, to impose at the beginning of each year an adequate amount of taxation in order to provide the money wanted. It is an impossible thing, I should say, that this burden should fall upon the ordinary taxpayer who does not benefit from land purchase, although he may have a sentimental desire, as we all have, that small holdings should be enlarged and increased in number. If you are unable to advance the money from the Consolidated Fund, the only possible way of raising it is by loan. Then you incur the danger which the Irish Government have experienced, and if you advance in Stock you are face to face with the difficulty the Irish Government are experiencing now. It was expected that
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0074"/>
<col>139</col>
the 3 per cent. loan raised on the basis of the Consolidated Fund would sell at about par. At the time the Act was passed the War Loan was selling at par, and Local Loan Stock at 98. What is the case to-day? Local Loan Stock is selling at about 94, and the Government 3 per cent. Irish Loan is selling at 92. Irish landlords naturally object to take payment in depreciated Stock, and so you have arrived at this pass, that, notwithstanding the endeavours made under the Act of 1909 to remedy the difficulties of land purchase in Ireland, land purchase is still at a stand still. I venture to say, with the utmost respect to the noble Earl, that the finance of the Bill requires entire recasting. It is quite impossible that any scheme of land purchase could be based upon such finance as is in this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00415"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just spoken is thoroughly familiar with many of the topics which have been discussed this evening, and he is also fully conversant with everything relating to the Irish land purchase code. Therefore what he says about the finances of land purchase as applied to Ireland is entitled to great weight, and will no doubt be received with respect when it is sought to apply any of those principles to England. But the broad question that underlies the whole of this discussion is whether it is wise and reasonable to seek to give the tenants of England an opportunity of becoming the absolute owners of their farms. We have the teachings of nearly the whole civilised world to indicate that it is a reasonable thing to give those who live on and till the land, not merely security of tenure as tenants, but an opportunity of acquiring their holdings. This is a wide and important issue, which marks the dividing line between those who criticise this Bill and those who are in favour of its provisions.<lb/>
This subject has commended itself to a vast number of those whom it is sought to benefit, and I do not think it has been adequately met by the noble Earl who is in charge of the Board of Agriculture. Is it unreasonable that the proposals should be presented to your Lordships? Have we not here the benefit of the presence of the Minister in charge of this particular question who makes on each occasion that he rises a speech if possible more genial than its predecessors? It is impossible not to listen with interest and with a certain measure
<col>140</col>
of personal sympathy to the noble Earl. It is impossible to entertain any feeling of animosity towards him. But in this matter we must divest ourselves of the weakness of sympathy and try to look at the matter from a common sense point of view. The question is whether Lord Carrington is in favour of doing more than his own Act does. I am not disparaging his Act. I am sure he was animated by the best possible motives when he passed it. But does he recognise that it is a reasonable and a fair thing that the tillers of the soil should aspire to go a step further and become the owners of their land?<lb/>
This is an important question which is growing in intensity every day, and as far as my observations go from a perusal of the Press I believe that the noble Earl does not rightly appreciate the gravity and seriousness of the position. Why is it that all other countries have recognised the force of this claim on behalf of the tillers of the soil? Any one who is conversant with agrarian legislation on the Continent of Europe knows that this is an ideal which is sought to be carried into practice, with all the safeguards that financial prudence can suggest. The noble Earl, Lord Carrington, passed lightly over the teaching almost at his door in the case of Ireland. I am entitled as an Irishman, not to forget that, and the noble Lord opposite, Lord MacDonnell, having the same advantage as myself, cannot get away from it either. What is the principle that has guided and governed the administration of the land purchase system of Ireland? One of the greatest appeals you can make to human nature is to recognise that people all desire to become, if you like on fair and reasonable conditions, the owners of the farms which they till, on which they were born and on which they live. The whole purchase code of Ireland is founded upon that. I do not put that forward as a Party claim, because great names are identified with that code. Mr. Bright, I think, was the first to give it practical application. The name of Mr. Gladstone is identified amply with it, and also the late Lord Salisbury's Government and Mr. Balfour himself.<lb/>
Finally there was Mr. Wyndham's great Act of 1903. Of course that Act is open to some of the criticisms made just now by Lord MacDonnell as to its financial proposals, but it has been applied on the whole with great and substantial success. When
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0075"/>
<col>141</col>
one turns to Ireland and finds that thousands of tenants have become owners under this code, one recognises that it has worked vast changes and given a wide measure of peace where there was formerly a vast amount of discontent. And when we remember that the credit of England has been invoked, that over &#x00A3;100,000,000 has been devoted to this great purpose, is it unreasonable to say that it would not be unbecoming to see whether something could not be done to give a similar measure of relief and advantage to the tenant farmers of England?<lb/>
This is a great and wide question, and one not to be put aside by small criticisms of detail. I am bound to say that the noble Earl Lord Carrington did not show much grasp of the intricacies of the Irish land system. Many of the things upon which he commented as open to question are found working fairly and well under that system. It is true that in some of the matters of finance and some of the dealings in reference to the floating of Stock difficulties have occurred which have been sought to be met. But the points made by the noble Earl did not strike me as entitled&#x2014;If I may say so with great respect&#x2014;to any serious weight in the comparison of the legislation now proposed with the legislation that exists in Ireland. Does the noble Earl suggest that whilst the new purchasers were under an obligation to the State it would be competent to permit them to subdivide their holdings and mortgage them? Surely it is reasonable to say that those who advance the money shall have the right to see that they are adequately protected, and that the holdings on which the advances are made are kept free from further burdens. The governing phrase in Clause 20 is "if satisfied with the security." That is apart from the zone system, which is altogether another matter. Surely that shows that this Bill, which I suppose was largely framed on the Irish model, does not seek to run not with the finances of the country, but leaves ample control.<lb/>
The noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture appeared to suggest that this was not the place to bring forward a proposal of the kind. Is that so? That has not been the history of the Irish land purchase code. I myself had the honour of bringing into this House the Bill of 1885, making proposals which were afterwards
<col>142</col>
accepted by the House of Commons. There is nothing to prevent a Bill being brought in here, although I admit it is open to the House of Commons to say whether it will supply the financial requirements which alone can enable the Bill to be worked out. Points have been made in reference to the money part of the Bill, but I shall not discuss them except to make this remark. Does the noble Earl suggest that at no time is any encouragement to be held out to the tenant farmers of England? that nothing is to be given to them to enable them to purchase their holdings? It is easy to make objections to particular proposals, such as &#x00A3;2,000,000 being assigned for one purpose, and so on. I admit that all these things have to be considered by the financiers who deal with this topic. The Money must come from some source, and in Ireland it came from the security of the State to the extent of over &#x00A3;100,000,000. Is it not reasonable to suggest that you should hold out some expectation to these people? Do the Government really contend that no encouragement is to be held out to the tenant farmers of England, by means of national credit, to enable them to purchase their holdings? There are many topics that I would like to discuss in reference to this matter, but I forbear. This is not an occasion for dealing with details. I will close the few remarks I have made by a reference to a phrase which the noble Earl himself used&#x2014;"the magic of property." That is a phrase that must have been very present to the minds of the promoters of this Bill, and it is a consideration that should receive sympathy from your Lordships. I therefore hope you will accord a Second Reading, at all events, to this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00416"><member>LORD BYRON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have very few words to address to your Lordships. I thought, while listening to the speech of the noble Earl, Lord Portsmouth, that he was going to save me the trouble of speaking, because he got very hot on the scent. My object in rising is to request the noble Earl, Lord Malmesbury, to reconsider the point as to whether he would send this Bill to a Select Committee or not. The noble Earl, Lord Portsmouth, was not quite certain, I think, as to whether the Committee should be of the Whole House or a Select Committee I suggest that this Bill should be sent to a Committee of the Whole House. The fact is, this is a Bill that will receive the sympathy of a great many members of
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0076"/>
<col>143</col>
this House, and the difficulties in connection with a measure of this kind would be greatly reduced if there could be general suggestions from noble Lords who are practical agriculturists. There is one point to which I would like to call attention. It is stated in the Bill that the sum wanted amounts to &#x00A3;5,000,000, but in the prospectus of the Rural League the figure is given as &#x00A3;10,000,000, and then in a letter from Mr. Jesse Collings to the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, whose absence we so much regret, the amount required is set out as &#x00A3;25,000,000. That is a point that will require elucidation.<lb/>
Then, again, it is said that these loans would be made subject to the payment of the annual instalments and "certain other conditions." I trust that in Committee some one will be able to take up the point as to what those other conditions are. One great objection to this measure is that those tenants who have not sufficient capital of their own to purchase a farm will always experience the greatest difficulty, once they have purchased it, in finding capital to work it and keep it going. More especially will this be the case if the purchaser happens to be a married man with a family. It must be remembered that in this case he will cease to have a landlord behind him who can do the repairs for him. He can expect no remission of principal or interest from the Government which lent him the money as he could in the matter of rent from his landlord; and he must not be behindhand with his payments, as rural tenants are sometimes now permitted to be. It must be remembered further, that a great deal depends upon the skill of the purchaser himself. That is not a thing he can bequeath to his offspring, and unless a tenant is able to pay off his holding in his own lifetime there is always the danger that the purchase will not be completed.<lb/>
Another point is that when a tenant has to pay off a mortgage it becomes excessively difficult for him to hire fresh land, and it is generally the desire of every successful yeoman to hire more land. I think that in Committee some provision for permitting a man to hire fresh land should be inserted. Then, again, legal charges are apt to mount up rapidly. I think the noble Earl, Lord Malmesbury, said there were certain provisions with regard to that. Further, there is always the danger that land may
<col>144</col>
be cut up and sold by the man who purchases his holding. This may cause the greatest annoyance to the landlord who has sold a farm to a tenant and who finds it gradually being purchased, say, by a neighbouring landowner, perhaps the very last person he would have wished to purchase it; because it seems to be a law of nature that the large fish should swallow up the small one in that way. I would further point out that under the Agricultural Holdings Act very great security of tenure is given to tenants holding under the county council, and there is no fear that the rent of a tenant under the county council will be raised.<lb/>
The tendency of modern ideas and legislation is rather to municipalise, if not actually to nationalise, the land, and it is quite clear that a measure of this kind runs counter to that tendency. I cannot help thinking that that would be one insuperable objection to this Bill becoming law. I for one regret that it is so, and I fancy that before long a reaction may set in, but certainly that is the tendency of the present day. Without a doubt there is in the Home Counties a great dislike to holding long leases. There is a kind of restlessness among the tenants especially in the North, at any rate in Scotland, and I venture to think that that, too, will militate against a Bill of this kind. At the same time I feel that there is so much to be said for a measure of this kind that I am inclined to support it on Second Reading. Two great advantages, I think, will accrue from it. First of all it presents a social barrier against revolution or socialism, and, secondly, it enables the cultivation of the poorest land by the energy and allay of the new owners to be undertaken. They will dress it and cultivate it to the very best of their ability, and so in that way the poor lands of England will get improved. I would invite the noble Earl to say whether this Bill could not be considered in Committee of the Whole House. If so, I should support the Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00417"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to say a few words in support of this Bill in the hope that it may go to a Second Reading and afterwards to a Committee, in order that the various details may be considered and its provisions perfected. I noticed that the noble Earl, Lord Carrington, directed a great deal of attention to
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0077"/>
<col>145</col>
certain details which I think could be perfectly well remedied in Committee, if the Bill goes there. But first of all I should like to congratulate the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture upon one thing. The noble Earl, I think, from our pleasant experiences of his speeches, can generally he relied upon to give away the more extreme members of his own Party with a refreshing candour which is particularly grateful to your Lordships. We had a delightful instance of that this evening, when he reminded us that out of eighteen beneficent agricultural Bills which had been introduced, no less than seventeen had been passed by this House of landlords, which is generally supposed to be so obstructive and to act entirely in opposition to the truest interests of the agriculturists of the country. I commend those figures to any of your Lordships who may be speaking on public platforms, and we are very glad to have them on the authority of the noble Earl himself.<lb/>
One of the points which the noble Earl raised was this. First of all he challenged us to show that there was any reason for alarm on the part of landowners, and he stated that nothing had been said for the purpose of creating that alarm. I remember a speech made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he was speaking with his accustomed frankness on the subject of landlords and their land, and somebody at the far end of the room shouted out, "Take it from them." The Chancellor of the Exchequer replied, "Well, I think I have made a pretty good beginning, have I not?" Then when we have speeches of that description made by leading members of the Government surprise is expressed by the noble Earl because owners of land are somewhat nervous at the present moment, and because investors hesitate to come forward to buy land as an investment. Land is bought for two purposes. It is either bought as an investment or for the purchaser to farm. I believe I am right in saying&#x2014;I have it on the authority of a leading firm of auctioneers in this country&#x2014;that there is a very great falling off indeed in the purchase of land for investment. In regard to what the noble Earl said on the question of giving the tenants notice, I think he made rather a wrong point on that. The noble. Earl laid stress upon the fact that tenants are given notice in order to "sell with possession." I do not think there are many cases of that.</membercontribution></p>
<col>146</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00418"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Vacant possession.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00419"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: The landowner gives notice in order that possession may be had within a reasonable time after the sale, and in cases where farms are sold singly. There are few, if any, cases where estates are sold as an entire estate where tenants are given notice. I do not see any reason whatever why when an estate is sold as an entirety tenants should be given notice; but where a landowner has to sell individual farms it is very difficult for him to find a purchaser unless the purchaser feels he can enter upon occupation within a reasonable time after purchase. Consequently, seeing that the Government have frightened investors to such an extent as they have done it generally happens that the landowner, when he does put up his land in that way, finds the land on his hands if he has not got anybody but the actual tenant to bid for it; that is to say, if the tenant is unable to bid for it. That is the opinion of men who have had great experience in the buying and selling of land, and I am not at all certain that I do not prefer their experience to that of the noble Earl.<lb/>
But there is another point which I would like to mention. The noble Earl laid great stress upon the duties and obligations which it is proposed to lay upon the Board of Agriculture, and he considered it most objectionable that his Department should be called upon to act as what he called land agents. I think it is far better that a State Department should act as land agents than as land owners; but the ownership of land by the State, as we know perfectly well, is a policy which is being deliberately put forward by a large section of the noble Earl's supporters. The Chancellor of the Exchequer himself has said that he regards what he calls land nationalisation as bound to come "by degrees," whatever that may mean. That is nothing more nor less than the State ownership of land, and I consider that agriculturists and tenants will have a far worse time of it with the State as landlord than with an individual. I do not see any real objection to the Board of Agriculture being called upon to act as a sort of arbitrator in a matter of this description.<lb/>
The noble Earl may not agree with the wording in the Bill where it is suggested that the Board should satisfy themselves with
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0078"/>
<col>147</col>
regard to the sufficiency of the sum. I do not think that is what is meant by the noble Earl, Lord Malmesbury. What I take it is meant by the Bill is not that the Board should be called upon to see that the landlord gets a sufficient price for his land, but that the price is a fair one as between the landlord and the purchaser when the State is called upon to advance the money; in other words, that the State should be safeguarded against being asked to advance a larger sum than the land is worth. I think that is all that the noble Earl who introduced the Bill meant, and therefore the objections raised by Lord Carrington are quite beyond the mark. There are various details in the Bill which are, perhaps, unworkable, more especially the clause which deals with the question of sub-letting, but these are all details which can be put right in Committee. But on the general principle of the desirability of getting land into the ownership of more people than at the present time, I give the Bill my hearty support. It seems to me somewhat incongruous that a Government which is largely supported by gentlemen who go about the country denouncing your Lordships for being owners of such a large proportion of land, men who are never tired of saying that the land is owned by far too few people, should now oppose a Bill for the purpose of increasing the number of owners of land.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00420"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BARNARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I may say that a large portion of my time is occupied with matters connected with agricultural land and agricultural tenants. I ask your Lordships to revert for one moment to what is the object of our debate this afternoon, and from which I think we have been somewhat deflected&#x2014;I refer to the principle of the Bill. I cannot help thinking that Lord Carrington was somewhat hard on Lord Malmesbury when he said he would only consider the details of the Bill. He picked out clause after clause and I was going to say discussed them, but he passed over them very lightly. He ignored altogether the principle of Part I of the Bill. What is the object of Part I? It merely says that when a landlord is willing to sell and a tenant to buy, the State shall under certain guarantees assist the tenant to buy. I have not heard one single word from the noble Earl in opposition to that theory He does not offer any alternative policy. I know he dislikes the system of great landlords. At the same time, when an opportunity is offered of assisting a tenant who
<col>148</col>
has been, or whose family has been, on a farm for generations, in order to save him from being turned out of his home, the noble Earl does not offer any alternative policy to that suggested by Lord Malmesbury. For that reason I shall support, and I hope every noble Lord in this House will support, the principle of Part I of the Bill.<lb/>
The principle in Part II is based upon rather different ground. It is largely to prevent what has been called the "eye of the farm" being taken to satisfy the aspirants for small holdings and leaving the worst part in the hands of the existing tenants. The noble Earl, Lord Carrington, forgot in his speech that Lord Malmesbury, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, expressly stated that he did not tie himself down to every detail. I am quite willing to admit that there are many clauses in this Bill which require a great deal of consideration, but the principle of the Bill cannot be denied by any fair-minded or honest man. Lord Carrington stated very prominently to this House&#x2014;and it must be borne in mind that in addressing this House your Lordships are also to a certain extent addressing the outside public&#x2014;that it is proposed that the agricultural interest shall put their hands into the pockets of the taxpayers to the extent of ten or twelve million pounds. A man not well instructed reading that would imagine that that was to be a gift from the taxpayer, but the principle of the Bill does not mean anything of the kind. It is merely that the money should be advanced by way of loan to enable these men to acquire their holdings, and that the money should be repaid under ample security. If the provisions in this Bill are not sufficient, then further safeguards ought to be inserted for that purpose.<lb/>
The noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture said that it was very hard that the Board should be land agents, bankers, and money-lenders. It is quite true that they are asked to act as bankers and as money-lenders, but I do not admit that they are asked to act as land agents. The principal clause of the Bill is to apply to cases where landlord and tenant agree to sell and purchase; the Board are not to be asked to intervene in the matter at all, and the only case where they are to satisfy themselves as to the sufficiency of the price has already been explained by Lord Denbigh. Then the noble Earl, Lord
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0079"/>
<col>149</col>
Carrington alluded somewhat scornfully to the provisions forbidding subdivision or mortgaging. I think those clauses were directed to the same end&#x2014;to affording sufficient security to the State against the property being in any way injured and the State being allowed to suffer. The noble Earl also made scornful allusion to the division of the funds which it is proposed to allot to the Bill. He said that &#x00A3;10,000,000 were to be applied for the benefit of the well-to-do farmers and only the miserable sum of &#x00A3;2,000,000 for the poor people who were to have the small holdings. I do not know on what principle the two sums have been allotted, or on what principle every tenant farmer is supposed to be well-to-do and somewhat of a rascal, and every applicant for a small holding is regarded as a most deserving and necessitous person. But I have consulted the noble Earl in charge of the Bill, and I am informed that there is no magic in these sums of ten and two millions, and that these figures can be easily altered if necessary.<lb/>
One word with regard to these applications for small holdings. Lord Carrington objected to the proposal to provide holdings for any persons who desired to buy, but he omitted the words at the end of the clause, "and who will themselves cultivate the holdings." The noble Earl made some remark about tinkers and tailors. I do not know whether we are right in assuming that he does not consider tinkers and tailors proper persons to have small holdings. I should think that was the very object he and his friends in the Government are aiming at. However, provided a tinker or a tailor wished to buy and wished to himself cultivate the holding, I think he has a perfect right to do so. We have been asked by the noble Earl to cite a concrete case where injury has been done under his legislation. Well, I will venture to give the noble Earl a challenge. I ask him whether he can give us a concrete case where injury has been done to any person&#x2014;tenant, labourer, or cottager&#x2014;not an isolated case, of course, for there must be such cases&#x2014;by the existing system of land tenure in this country. I cannot help being reminded in this connection of a correspondence I lately read between the noble. Earl and a noble Duke, in which I think the noble Duke came out triumphantly. I apologise for having detained your Lordships. All my
<col>150</col>
time, as I have said, is spent among agricultural people and tenants, and for that reason I hope that this Bill will be read a second time and referred to a Committee, when ample opportunities will be given for considering its details.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00421"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have listened to a number of most pertinent observations from the noble Lord who has just sat down. Lord Barnard has had much experience, and has made one of the most effective contributions to this debate. Lord Denbigh reminded us that we are sometimes spoken of as a House of landlords. Whether that accusation be just or unjust as applied to your Lordships' House as a body, you seem to me to be pre-eminently qualified to devote two afternoons to discussions such as we have listened to yesterday and to-day. If we are a House of landlords these debates show that we are not only prepared but anxious to share the advantages of that position, if advantages they be, with as large a number as possible of our fellow-countrymen. I venture to say that noble Lords on both sides of the House ought to be indebted to the two noble Lords who have on successive afternoons with so much clearness, modesty, and ability put forward their views on this great agrarian question, both dealing with the same problem&#x2014;the problem of adding to the number of the owners of the soil of this country&#x2014;but dealing with it from different points of view.<lb/>
Lord Dunmore last night advocated the system which has attained so much success in foreign countries, the system of providing purchase money and credit by means of credit societies and land banks; and although a considerable volume of criticism, and perhaps fair criticism, was levelled against the details of his Bill, quite insufficient justice was rendered to the soundness of the main principle of his Bill. It would be irrelevant for me to pursue that subject further this afternoon. Then the noble Earl, Lord Malmesbury, this afternoon approaches the same problem from an entirely different point of view, or rather he proposes a widely different solution. Lord Malmesbury, basing his advice upon the success of Mr. Wyndham's Irish Land Act, by which we know that a body of something like 300,000 tenants have become owners of their land, asks why, of course admitting the differences
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0080"/>
<col>151</col>
that we know exist between the different parts of the United Kingdom, the same broad principles should not be applied, or at any rate considered, in relation to the solution of the same question in this country. That is surely a most reasonable suggestion, and one which must commend itself to the sympathetic consideration of your Lordships. Further there is a special advantage in this Bill in that it is divided into two parts and is not confined to one branch of the question. I think I remarked last night that Lord Dunmore's Bill only attempted to deal with the problem of ownership on a small scale. Lord Malmesbury's Bill covers the whole field. Part I deals with large tenants who may wish to acquire farms of larger acreage. Part II deals with the small cultivator who may desire to become the possessor of a holding. From that point of view Lord Malmesbury's measure is a very comprehensive one, and one which seems to me to deal adequately with the different aspects of the case.<lb/>
The noble Earl who introduced this Bill has been rather more fortunate in the speeches made upon his Bill than Lord Dunmore was last night. That is to say, he has received from many members of this House a full measure of encouragement and approbation of the principal points in his Bill. Of course he had directed against him the merry artillery of the noble Earl opposite. I noticed that Lord Carrington's speech was divided, as most of his speeches are, into two parts. The first was an innocent exaltation of the performances of himself and his own Department. He told us of the excellent administrative work performed by his officials, and of the enormous number of Bills successfully passed, as Lord Denbigh reminded us, through this Chamber which is said to be the enemy of the rights of the people and the mutilator of the proposals of Liberal Governments. Lord Carrington then went on to describe the effect produced by his own magical rhetoric, with which we are so familiar, when it is directed upon the agricultural labourers, some of whom he has had the privilege of addressing in his own part of the country. That was the attractive embroidery of his speech.<lb/>
The second part of Lord Carrington's speech was an attack upon, or at any rate a criticism of, Lord Malmesbury's Bill. May I say, before I pass to that, that as regards the policy of his own Department which
<col>152</col>
Lord Carrington expounded, not for the first time, we give him full credit for his desire to increase the number of small holdings in this country, and I think he himself admitted that he had received great assistance from many of those who belong to this Party and sit on this side of the House. Very gladly do we render that assistance, but what we do complain of is that neither by word nor by act do we ever receive any sympathy in regard to the proposals which we put forward. This policy of land ownership, upon which is built up the stability of every prosperous State in the world and which should commend itself to the sympathy of every patriotic man, we put before His Majesty's Government, but they say "Oh no; no ownership by the individual; we support ownership by the State, the county councils and local authorities; any arrangement rather than that individuals should become possessors of the soil on which they work." The noble Earl never said a truer thing than when he said there is a great gulf between the policy of the two Parties. His policy is tenancy; our policy is ownership. And although we do not get much support from the noble Earl now, yet in the fluctuations of politics I can well conceive that the time may arrive when even from the opposite side we may find conversions to that view of this problem which has been so much derided to-night. There was a slight misunderstanding between Lord Portsmouth and Lord Carrington. Lord Portsmouth thought the noble Earl had said that there was no demand for small holdings in this country. That obviously is not the case, because he gave us the figures. But what the noble Earl did say was that he was conscious of no demand for ownership.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00422"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00423"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: He accepts my interpretation of his language. There I venture to say we dispute him altogether. Whether you take the class of the rather superior tenant farmers or the smaller man, both of whom are provided for by the Bill of my noble friend, surely there is abundant evidence of a desire on the part of both for ownership. You merely have to go to any land agent or auctioneer, or read the records of any estate thrown on to the market, to find that, at any rate in the class of tenant farmers, there is an ample and widespread desire to become owners of the soil if only adequate means
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0081"/>
<col>153</col>
can be devised to enable the intending purchaser to buy and to provide him with the purchase money on reasonable terms.<lb/>
Then, again, as regards the smaller class, is it true to say there is no demand for ownership on their part? I have always been led to think by those who are connected with the soil, first that that demand does exist, and, secondly, that the great obstacle in the way of its gratification is this, that a man does not want a small piece of ground unless he has a dwelling in which to live upon it. If you gave him the land and a cottage upon it, or the means of acquiring a cottage upon it, it would be quite a different thing. It is the object of these Bills, whether you do it through the credit societies or through a Department of Government, to provide a man with the money to get the land and to build something on it. If you solved that question you would find a material and widespread desire among the poorer classes of the peasantry of this country for ownership of the land.<lb/>
It would not be right for me to follow Lord Carrington into the criticisms of the details of this Bill. I am not responsible for the Bill; it represents the views and the activity of a League with which we are all acquainted. But some of the criticisms which Lord Carrington made are criticisms which an ingenious Minister, backed by a capable Department, can always direct against any Bill. I have introduced Bills into the House of Commons myself, and I know perfectly well that the officials of a Department can give you reasons equally good for opposing any clauses contained in any Bill. I have no doubt that if the officials who serve Lord Carrington's Department so well had been permitted to direct their criticisms against the seventeen Bills to which the noble Earl referred, they might have been riddled from end to end. Therefore I am not seriously impressed by these particular criticisms, although I do not deny that in many cases they were pertinent and ought seriously to be considered.<lb/>
But there was one feature which did surprise me, or rather it was an omission, which very much surprised me, in Earl Carrington's speech. He placed upon the Paper a Motion to this effect&#x2014;and I imagined that this Motion represented the
<col>154</col>
line of argument that he was going to take against the Bill&#x2014;
<quote>"That this House is not prepared to give its consent to a fill which entails a new and very onerous burden upon the public revenue until adequate financial provision has been made by Parliament to enable its provisions to be carried into effect."</quote>
I was waiting to hear the noble Earl argue that proposition, but it never came. At the end of his speech he read out in a perfunctory manner the terms of his Motion, but not a word did he say in its favour or support. He was very wise, if I may be allowed to say so, and I will tell your Lordships why. I carry in my mind very distinctly a recollection of debates that took place in this House only three years ago.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00424"><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00425"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend Lord Cromer cheers. He knows very well to what I am going to allude. I speak of the debates on the Old-Age Pensions Bill. On that occasion the Government brought in proposals for placing a great&#x2014;I do not say an illegitimate&#x2014;charge on the revenues of this country before "adequate financial provision had been made by Parliament to enable its provisions to be carried into effect." The estimates of that charge varied in the course of the passage of the Bill through the two Houses of Parliament from six to seven millions and from seven to eight millions&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00426"><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: Twelve millions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00427"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: And they have subsequently risen to twelve millions, if not more. When that Bill was introduced into this House noble Lords opposite responsible for it had no idea what it was going to cost. They gave no indication whatever of the manner in which the cost was to be met. All that we had was obscure and menacing hints by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that there were plenty of henroosts to be robbed&#x2014;a menace which I am bound to say was most amply fulfilled in the ensuing Budget. I remember Lord Cromer getting up and making a most powerful speech, in the course of which be said he had never known a case of more reckless finance. But surely the case here is even worse than I put it. The Bill of which I am speaking, which was thrown upon the Table of this House in this reckless manner, was a Bill vested with the full authority and responsibility of the Government of this
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0082"/>
<col>155</col>
country. And yet members of the Government had none of these scruples on that occasion. But here to-night, on a small Bill introduced by a private member of your Lordships' House, without, as we know, the slightest chance of passing into law, at any rate at present, and only introduced with the object of inviting discussion in the hope that it may be threshed out by a Committee&#x2014;in this case the scruples of Lord Carrington, which were dormant three years ago, are apparently aroused. I think the noble Earl, it I may say so, whatever may have been his reasons for putting his Motion on the Paper, was wise not to argue it. I have nothing more to say except that I hope your Lordships will mete out the same generous treatment to Lord Malmesbury's Bill that you did to Lord Dunmore's Bill last night. It is quite obvious that a great many of the matters in the Bill will be much the better for a good deal of discussion by competent persons. My noble friend has indicated his desire to meet all reasonable criticisms, and I do not think your Lordships will have done a bad two days' work if after listening to the discussions on both these Bills you refer them to the same Select Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00428"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened with the deepest interest to the latter part of the speech of the noble Lord who has just addressed the House, because he has come upon the real point in this Bill. We are not, I beg respectfully to say, discussing a mere academic proposition in a debating society. To a more discouraging <i>apologia</i> for a Bill than the one just made in the concluding part of Lord Curzon's speech I have never listened. One would have imagined that this Bill was never intended to be taken as a practical proposition put before a body of legislators. What is the Bill? Stripped of its surroundings and brought down to the root principle, it proposes that the Government shall take out of the Public Exchequer &#x00A3;12,000,000 and apply the money as a lever for carrying through a certain reform. The reform may be an excellent one. I think it is an admirable idea that it should be made as easy as possible for people to transfer land, but when you propose to take &#x00A3;12,000,000 out of the Public Exchequer you are proposing to take a very grave step, particularly when it is apparent, as it is on the face of this Bill, that this is only a first step. If the Bill succeeds, or is in the
<col>156</col>
slightest degree a reality, you must proceed to further large sums without limit.<lb/>
The gravity of the situation is also complicated by considerations which were mentioned by Lord MacDonnell, who showed that the finance of the Bill was of the most hopeless kind, and if the Treasury consented to go into this speculation they would go into it at a large loss. It is no answer to these arguments to cite the case of the Irish Land Purchase Acts. The noble and learned Lord opposite, Lord Ashbourne, is associated, and very honouraby associated, with that legislation. He said to-night, Could there be a better policy than that the tenants of England should be given an opportunity to buy their land, and that the State should give assistance to that end? But it was not on any such grounds that land purchase was brought forward in Ireland. Land purchase was brought forward and State assistance given and money lavished because we were dealing there with a grave problem of social order, and without the intervention of the State and without appealing to the Public Treasury that problem could not have been solved. We are dealing here with something desirable, but not with a question of social order. The reform is, I agree, a good one, but it is one that is not urgent for the expenditure of public funds.<lb/>
Have we, in the course of this debate, given serious consideration to what is the only point in this Bill&#x2014;the proposal to use the Public Treasury? In this Bill there is no new or remarkable legislative machinery. There is no proposal for compulsion, as there was in the case of leasehold enfranchisement, a subject which was very much before the public mind twenty years ago. There is nothing of that kind here. It is simply this, that if a landlord and a tenant choose to make a bargain and the Board of Agriculture approve it, the Treasury is to find the whole purchase money and to be repaid on the very speculative basis of a &#x00A3;3 5<i>s.</i> annuity. In these circumstances speaking for the Government, I can only say we take a very much more serious view of the proposition than that taken on the Benches opposite. We are not a debating society; we are a House of the Legislature; and if we are discussing anything we are discussing it in a serious spirit. Taking that view there is only one alternative, and that is to protest against this proposition
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0083"/>
<col>157</col>
being made, and the only way we can do that is by dividing upon it.<lb/>
About the merits of the scheme I wish to say very little, because it seems to me that the whole matter is swallowed up in the considerations to which I have referred. I am not sure that there are not other ways of helping tenants still more effectually than enabling them to become the owners of their holdings. I have often felt that what was wanted was greater opportunities for people to become tenants of land. That is much more important than to enable those who are already tenants to become the purchasers of their own holdings. The small farm is a new, and, I think, a growing feature. Certainly in Scotland, with which I am more familiar, nothing is more striking than the growing demand for the small farm of 150 to 200 acres. But this Bill does</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00465">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00466"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: This is a Bill the substance of which I hope to be able to explain to your Lordships in a few minutes. The Bill is proposed in pursuance of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Feeble Minded. That Commission reported in 1908, and recommended a large scheme which contained no fewer than ninety-six recommendations with regard to England and Wales alone, there being also others with regard to Scotland. The Commissioners very naturally appreciated that there would be much difficulty in the preparation and also in the passing of a Bill of that magnitude, and accordingly they made a temporary recommendation&#x2014;Recommendation XXIV&#x2014;in urgent terms, which runs as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"That for immediate purposes, and pending the establishment by the Legislature of the proposed central authority and local authorities, it is expedient that the Lord Chancellor, in pursuance of his power under Section 337 of the Lunacy Act, 1890, should at once&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>"Amalgamate the office of the Chancery visitors and their duties and staff with the office, duties, and staff of the Lunacy Commissioners; (2) appoint two additional medical Commissioners to the amalgamated office, at such salaries as, with the concurrence of the Treasury, he may think reasonable."</quote>
There is a section&#x2014;Section 337&#x2014;in the existing Act which purports to give the Lord Chancellor power to do this under his own hand without any legislative authority, but questions have been raised with regard to the sufficiency of that section to justify an act of that kind. It would be a great misfortune if, after an order of that sort were made, it were to be in any jeopardy of being lawfully made; and I have therefore thought better to ask the consent of Parliament to do that which was evidently contemplated as long ago as 1890, and which is strongly recommended by the Commissioners, with whose recommendation I entirely agree.<lb/>
The second point in the Bill is this. Unfortunately the Commissioners in Lunacy have been shorthanded for a considerable time, and I have, in the hope that some fresh scheme might be started, put off from time to time asking Parliament to grant two more medical Commissioners. It has
<col>162</col>
been found necessary to make orders in three successive years diminishing the number of visits each Commissioner had to make, and I do think the number is at present insufficient. The Commissioners in Lunacy remain the same in number as they were in 1845, though the number of patients under their care has increased from 25,000 to 120,000. I think this ought to be dealt with now. I believe that a Bill was introduced by my predecessor, Lord Halsbury, before the late Government went out of office, for the purpose of adding two new Commissioners.<lb/>
The scheme in this Bill also provides that the unpaid Commissioners may include women. To my mind it is almost essential that women should be associated with the central administration of the Lunacy laws. I may state to your Lordships that this was suggested in the Report of the Royal Commission&#x2014;Recommendation XX&#x2014;and that I went so far as to ask one lady whether she would serve as one of the unpaid Commissioners and she was kindly willing to do so; but the Law Officers advised that under the framework of the Lunacy Act, 1890, women could not be appointed Commissioners. This, I hope, will be remedied by the clause in the present Bill.<lb/>
The remaining clause as to vesting orders is a small and technical matter. It is a minor detail in the administration of lunatics' estates, strictly belonging to Chancery practice, and it is desirable to place that branch of the work in the hands of the Chancery Judges, though it cannot be done without an Act of Parliament. I may say that the whole administration of these estates was recommended by the Royal Commission to be transferred to the Chancery Court. A Committee, of which the Master of the Rolls was a member, inquired into it, but found that it would not be practicable to do this except in so far as vesting orders were concerned, and accordingly this Bill is limited in that form. That is all I have to say with regard to the substance of this Bill, but I am glad to be able to add that Lord Halsbury authorises me to say that he heartily concurs in the Second Reading of the Bill, which I need hardly tell your Lordships gives the Bill great, additional authority.</membercontribution></p>

<title>EDUCATION (SCHOOL ATTENDANCE) BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00469" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00470">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00471"><member>LORD SAYE AND SELE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, for two reasons, which your Lordships will recognise as being amply sufficient, I will not occupy much time in describing this little Bill, and I confidently predict that your Lordships will ungrudgingly give it a Second Reading. My first reason for brevity is that close upon two years ago, after an exhaustive inquiry at which fifty-two witnesses were examined, including representatives of Chambers of Commerce and Agriculture, of associations of employers and of trade unions, officials of the Home Office, of the Board of Education and of local education authorities members of the consultative committees of the Board of Education, certifying factory surgeons, school teachers, farmers, and private persons&#x2014;an inter-Departmental Committee presided over by Mr. Trevelyan submitted its Report to the President of the Board of Education, and this Bill, as I will show directly, is closely framed upon that Report.<lb/>
My second reason for brevity is that on April 27 of last year my noble friend Lord Sheffield moved in your Lordships' House to resolve&#x2014;
<quote>"That in the opinion of this House it is desirable that legislative effect should be given to the recommendations of the inter-Departmental Committee on Partial Exemption from School Attendance, and that a statutory obligation should be imposed on local education authorities to provide, where it is reasonably practicable, continuation schools," &amp;c.</quote>
My noble friend completely convinced your Lordships of the reasonableness of his Resolution, and after sympathetic speeches from the noble Earl the Leader of the House, from the right rev. Prelates of Southwark (now Winchester) and Hereford and from Lord Meath, the Motion was agreed to.<lb/>
The law as it stands now with respect to school attendance is, in the words of the Report, "somewhat complicated, and in certain minor respects uncertain." The Committee indeed evidently found it very complicated, for in preference to setting it forth at length they rather cunningly refer
<col>164</col>
to a Memorandum drawn up by one of their members, Mr. Lindsell. This Memorandum describes the present state of affairs as lucidly as is possible, and yet with its references to Education Acts, Factory Acts, and by-laws, with their exemptions and partial exemptions, you need to read it very carefully and more than once to understand the position of the child in this country at this moment as regards its educational liability. Broadly speaking, the law of the land at this moment is as follows. Every educational authority is compelled through its by-laws to take educational notice of every child between the ages of five and fourteen, but having taken this notice it may grant exemptions of two kinds&#x2014;partial and total.<lb/>
First as to partial exemption. A child between eleven and thirteen may, if employed in agriculture, be absent from school during part of the year if he makes 250 attendances during another part of the year. Again a child of twelve may claim partial exemption if he is employed under the Factory Act, and as this is what is usually called the half-time system, though I should myself prefer to call it the double-time malpractice, I will pause for a moment to describe it. It is the system by which a child in alternate weeks spends his mornings in the mill and in the school, and his afternoons in the school and in the mill. Thus a child of twelve may leave his bed at 5.30 a.m. to be in the mill at 6, work there with an interval for breakfast till 12.30, and after an interval for dinner, work in school from 2 to 5. If this was the child's lot this week, then next week he would spend his mornings in the school and his afternoons in the mill. But what I would specially draw your Lordships' attention to is this. A fortnight's work for a half-timer figures out as follows: 55&#x00BD; hours in the mill, and 27&#x00BD; hours in the school, or half as mach again in actual hours as the full-time scholar.<lb/>
Now as to total exemptions. A child of twelve who has not availed himself of either of the foregoing partial exemption facilities may obtain total exemption on reaching a standard of proficiency, varying in different localities from Standard 5 to Standard 7 of the Code. Again a child of thirteen may obtain total exemption for the purpose of employment if he has made 350 attendances after five years of age in
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0087"/>
<col>165</col>
not more than two schools during each of five previous years. This is the provision under which total exemption is most commonly claimed.<lb/>
I said that I would show that my Bill is framed very closely upon the Report of the inter-Departmental Committee. With your Lordships' permission I will read the summary of the recommendations of that Committee in conjunction with my Bill. The recommendations of the Committee are as follow&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(1) That partial exemption should be abolished.</li>
<li>(2) That there should be no total exemption under the age of 13.</li>
<li>(3) That no exemption should be allowed by reason of previous school attendance.</li>
<li>(4) That exemption at the age of 13 should only be allowed for beneficial or necessary employment.</li>
<li>(5) That in the case of exemption before the age of 14 the obligation to attend a continuation class be imposed; or</li>
<li>(6) That with the approval of the Board of Education the alternative of passing a standard not lower than the 6th be permitted, and that these recommendations should over-ride the Factory Acts.</li>
</ol>
Now, My Lords, turn to the Bill. The pith of it is contained in Clause 1. Subsection (1) says&#x2014;
<quote>"The earliest age at which a child shall be entitled to any exemption from the obligation to attend school shall be 13, and such exemption shall be granted only for the purpose of beneficial and necessary employment."</quote>
Here we have Recommendations 2 and 4 given effect to. Subsection (2) says&#x2014;
<quote>"No child shall be entitled to obtain partial exemption from school attendance under the age of 14, and the ordinary condition for total exemption under 14 years of age shall be due attendance at a continuation class, or, subject to the approval of the Board of Education, the passing of a standard not lower than the 6th."</quote>
Here we have Recommendations 1, 3, 5 and 6 given effect to. Your Lordships will recognise the sweet reasonableness of the Bill. You will see that it follows the dictates of the Committee, and you will know that it carries out your own wishes expressed by your agreement to my noble friend's Resolution last year.<lb/>
It only remains for me to say a word or two in justification of the Bill from my own point of view. I will say without fear of contradiction that, as the Bill gives effect to the recommendations of the Committee, so
<col>166</col>
those recommendations were the only possible result of the evidence that was heard by that Committee. With regard to the raising of the age for any exemption from twelve to thirteen, surely no evidence was required. It is common knowledge that while a child of twelve has memory he has little or no reasoning power, and to take him from school at that tender age is to deny him a fair opportunity in life. I look forward confidently to the day, not far distant, when the compulsory age will be raised yet another year, and when education will be carried further, through continuation classes, to the age of sixteen or seventeen&#x2014;continuation classes not necessarily in the evening, when the child is tired out, but forming a part of a new and reasonable half-time system by which a child from fourteen to seventeen shall divide a fair day between work and education.<lb/>
To show how rapidly public opinion is working in that direction I would draw your Lordships' attention to a little fact. Lord Sheffield, in his speech on his Resolution last year, said, referring to the recommendations of the Consultative Committee&#x2014;
<quote>"The proposals of the Committee which would require statutory enactment comprise recommendations that local authorities should be compelled to provide continuation schools and empowered to make by-laws making attendance at such schools compulsory up to the age of 17 years."</quote>
He went on&#x2014;
<quote>"I do not think the time is ripe for carrying out the latter proposal. A similar provision was made in the Scottish Education Act of last year, but none of the great towns of Scotland have exercised the power to make such by-laws, and I am informed that none of them contemplate doing so."</quote>
One can hardly imagine the noble Lord being otherwise than there or thereabouts when an educational reform was on foot, and yet Scotland seems to have given him the slip, for I visited several education authorities in Scotland last month and I brought away with me, among other little gems of Scottish commonsense, this pamphlet headed, "School Board for Glasgow. By-laws for enforcing attendance at continuation classes, made by the School Board for Glasgow under the Education (Scotland) Act, 1908. Dated 19th December, 1910." I think my noble friend is to be congratulated, for, like the Huddersfield School Board, he has been bringing steady pressure in this direction all his life.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0088"/>
<col>167</col>
I will only say a word in conclusion on the half-time system as I understand it. The evidence before the Committee amply proved that this so-called system is nothing but the survival of a vicious habit by which parents in some parts of the country, more by custom than from need, exploit their children for the sake of a small weekly wage. I say more by custom than from need because, for instance, the half-time system is prevalent at Halifax in Yorkshire, whereas at Huddersfield, only six miles away, where the chief industry is a similar one, it has been stamped out by the steady pressure of an intelligent school board, the figures of half-timers falling gradually there from 1,762 in 1879 to 94 in 1901, and the half-timer is now as dead as the dodo. The custom is not justified by the necessities of poverty, because the wages earned in the places where it is prevalent are higher than in other places where it is absent. That it demoralises the children who are the victims of it and hinders the classes in which they are irregular attendants is the testimony of every teacher in the land, and, moreover, to numbers of boys who are half-timers it is a system leading to nowhere except to unemployment.<lb/>
My own first hand knowledge is very small, but, such as it is, a day spent in the mill and in the school in Preston, where the custom is in vogue, confirms me in the conviction that not a day should be lost in wiping it off the Statute-book. Is there any conceivable reason why the children of Bradford, Preston, Halifax and Dundee should not have the same chance in life as those of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Hamilton, Reading, Huddersfield and London, where the education authorities would scorn to allow their little ones to be the victims of this relic of the dark ages? I do not wish to harrow your Lordships' feelings, and indeed some of the half-time children whom I saw in Preston were marvels of brightness, but there were others; and the face of one little chap remains in my memory, carrying upon it, as it seemed to do, the weight of the whole of those eighty-three hours of toil. If I could place him here in your midst, you would say that this miserable practice must cease.<lb/>
Your Lordships are in the peculiar position to-night of having two Bills before you of a curiously similar nature. I feel no hos-
<col>168</col>
tility whatever towards the Bill of my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke. On the contrary, I recognise that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Moreover, when noble Lords on both sides of the House are tumbling over each other to secure legislation on this subject the Government will, I hope, recognise that the matter is not only urgent but somewhat overdue. I hope your Lordships will give my Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00473"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF HEREFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope your Lordships will give this Bill a Second Reading. As we have just been reminded, it is a very useful bit of legislation long overdue. Technically our education laws are for the good of the child, but in this case the various concessions which have been made in our educational system have not been in that direction. The present system must, I think, be described as an extremely wasteful system. Until it has been supplemented by some reasonable system of continuation schools, I do not think that any other description would appropriately apply to it. Just at the time when your Lordships are considering to which of the great schools you will send your own sons, these children in the elementary schools are stepping out into their little world, and multitudes of them, so far as we know, then turn their backs on any organised system of education, and, in fact, begin to forget the little they have learned. The concessions which this Bill is intended to put an end to greatly aggravate the waste, and while aggravating the waste they rob the children of the best part of the education available and at the same time inflict upon them very serious hardship. As we have been reminded, the half-timer, if you add the hours of attendance at the mill and at the school, has to attend daily just one-and-a-half times as many hours in the mill and school together as the whole-timer spends at school. The result is physical degeneration, and the child arrives at school too weary to benefit by the instruction given, and therefore suffers both loss and hardship. I sincerely hope your Lordships, by giving a Second Reading to this Bill and finally passing it with such Amendments as may seem reasonable, will
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0089"/>
<col>169</col>
put an end to these cases of injustice and hardship.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00474"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel extremely doubtful as to when to intervene in this debate, because the Bill now before the House is to be followed by one in charge of my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke, and though to a certain extent they are on all fours they approach the question from a totally different point of view. The noble Lord who introduced this Bill has stated that the Bill is due to Lord Sheffield having brought this matter forward in the year 1908, and as a result of the debate which then took place the Committee was formed on whose Report, as far as I understand, this Bill is based. Lord Saye and Sele's Bill embraces two points. It embraces the question of half-timers and deals also with compulsory attendance of children after school age. This, of course, is a question which gives rise to a good deal of controversy; and the question is not settled there, because there arises the Bill of my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke, who takes exception to the attendance age in the Bill now before the House. He does so to a certain extent with perfect justice, because I know from personal experience that the agricultural classes do not view the increasing of the age with the same admiration as the noble Lord or those who live in the great manufacturing towns.<lb/>
The half-time principle was originally started in order to take children from the factories and give them time for education. The present Bill proposes to reverse that and keep children at their education rather than let them go back to their work. I do not express any opinion upon that, more than saying that I sympathise with the noble Lord's view, and I also sympathise very sincerely with my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke, whose Bill is to follow this. I cannot help thinking that in regard to the raising of the minimum age a good deal of the difficulty might be met if the child's last year at school were devoted to instructing him in the details of that industry in which he is situated, instruction which would be of use to him in after life. I know there is a good deal of controversy on this subject. I have no doubt that the agricultural classes, who look to children when they reach these years to be able to assist them, think that
<col>170</col>
they can do far better by working on the farms than in what they call book-learning at school. Therefore I think the proposal I have made might go a little way towards meeting that difficulty.<lb/>
But the present Bill seems to me to treat these cognate questions in an indefinite manner. I read in March last that Mr. Runciman informed a deputation that the Board of Education had been at work for some time upon schemes for linking up continuation classes and other educational reforms. A proposal, he said, had been made by a Committee for the abolition of half-time or raising the age, which must be accompanied by work in continuation classes or schools, and he would shortly introduce a Bill to carry out some of these recommendations. From this statement I think we are justified in arriving at the conclusion that the Board of Education have in contemplation a measure of wide scope on this subject, and I cannot but think that, in view of this fact, if I am right in the opinion I have formed, it would be wiser on the present occasion to postpone dealing further with the Bills of my noble friends until we have the Bill of the Minister for Education before us. We shall then be able to see how far it goes towards meeting their wishes and requirements. In what I have said I have not in any way opposed these Bills, for I sympathise entirely with the views of both noble Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00475"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had rather hoped that we should have taken the course, not unusual in your Lordships' House, of discussing both of these Bills at the same time. However, as Lord Willoughby de Broke has not risen I will proceed to say what there is to be said on behalf of His Majesty's Government on this Bill, though what I have to say applies equally to the second Bill to be moved this afternoon. In the first place, I should like to congratulate the noble Lord behind me upon the fact that, having put this Bill down, I think, for every day this week, he has at last been able to secure an opportunity for discussing it. I venture also to think that both he and the noble Lord whose Bill is to follow have rendered a real public service in bringing forward this matter. This is one of those questions on which it is important we should raise a strong public opinion throughout the country, and
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0090"/>
<col>171</col>
discussions of this kind in this House can only do good, because they support the object which all education reformers have at heart, and when the time comes they will no doubt make it easier for Bills having the same object to pass into law. One good result I hope will be that further attention will be drawn to the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Partial Exemption from School Attendance, which was published in 1909. It is a very valuable Report and deserves a good deal of attention from all who are interested in the subject, especially, perhaps, the paragraphs in it which deal with partial exemption in cases of agriculture.<lb/>
The noble Lord who moved the Second Reading of this Bill referred, quite fairly, to the expectations and hopes which have been expressed on various occasions that legislation would shortly be introduced. I do not suppose he is very much surprised to know that it has not been possible, in the pressure of other business during the last twelve months, for the Board of Education to lay any measure upon the Table of either House before this date. Having been concerned with the preparation of this Bill the noble Lord will, I am sure, be one of the first to realise that the questions involved are very complicated questions; and in our opinion they are best met by a Bill introduced by the Government, who have behind them the experience of the Board of Education and the technical skill of the Parliamentary draftsman. Take the question of continuation schools. If attendance at continuation schools is to be enforced it is obviously necessary to provide suitable machinery. What, therefore, I hope on this occasion is that your Lordships will follow the advice of the noble Marquess opposite and give both Bills a Second Reading, and then wait, at any rate for the present, to see the terms of the Bill which will be introduced by His Majesty's Government. I hope that noble Lords who are interested in this matter will be able to bring pressure to bear in order to secure the passage of that Bill, and that when next year comes the whole question will be in a far more forward state than it is now.</membercontribution></p>

I may say that I offer no opposition whatever to the Bill of Lord Saye and Sele. The only real difference between the two Bills is that the object of the Bill which I am moving is to make it easier for children in agricultural districts to obtain exemption from school attendance. The exemption foreshadowed by the Bill of Lord Saye and Sele depends upon continuation classes and upon passing Standard VI. I propose to add to that the qualification of having made 350 attendances in not more than two schools during each of the five preceding years. This will mark some difference between urban and rural districts. The reason why I shall make a point in any future discussion of insisting as far as I am able on this provision as to attendances is that there may be, and are, boys in agricultural districts who are not able to pass even Standard VI, and whose detention at school is a pure waste of time and money. In my opinion they would be far better working on the land than absorbing public money by being kept at school for the purpose of eventually being examined in a standard in which there is no reasonable possibility of their passing. Provided that in future discussions this principle is accepted, I believe I am in accord with everything in the Bill which Lord Saye and Sele has moved.

I hope we may look forward to the Government Bill being laid
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0091"/>
<col>173</col>
on the Table of the House of Commons within a reasonable time, and if any long period after Whitsuntide goes by without our seeing the text of the Government Bill we might then say that it is fair that this House should proceed with its own Bills. The difference between the two Bills before your Lordships this afternoon is so microscopic that practically they might be treated as one Bill and the points of difference made a matter of amendment. I confess I have a preference for the Bill of my noble friend Lord Saye and Sele, but I would gladly welcome the Bill of the noble Lord opposite.<lb/>
As to what the noble Marquess on the Front Opposition Bench said with reference to the importance, if we prolong the school age to fourteen, of devoting the child's last year at school to instructing him in the details of the industry in which he would work in after life, I think if that could be well done it would be a very great improvement in the school curriculum. I have in my hand the last Report of the Board of Education, and any one who reads, on page 61, a paragraph headed "Practical Instruction in Rural Public Elementary Schools" will see that the Board of Education there say that they have continued to give close attention to the needs of country schools, more particularly as regards practical instruction. I think that in town and country alike boys should learn some form of handicraft and girls should learn cookery. The Report goes on to say that in a large number of rural schools a great deal is now being done to give a practical turn to the education of the older girls. Girls might be taught ordinary subjects in the morning and in the afternoon receive instruction in practical subjects, such as dressmaking, cookery, and home nursing. From the Report you will see that there has been a substantial expansion of this work in the case of girls, and I think noble Lords who are working on the education committees of their counties will know what an impulse has been given to that branch of education in rural districts. But the same Report shows that very much less is being done in the way of manual instruction for boys. Something, however, is being done both in the way of school gardens and by manual instruction. I should be glad to see those forms and other forms of practical instruction greatly
<col>174</col>
developed in boys' schools. This, how ever, is a matter of curriculum and does not depend on any Act of Parliament.<lb/>
Again, the possibility of doing this will depend entirely upon securing a sufficient number of competent and adequate teachers for giving instruction in these subjects. All that means money. I should be glad if the Board of Education would be a little more liberal in grants at the upper end of the school. The grants given to schools have been rather with a view to relieving the burden of the school managers than with a view to improving the education in the schools. In former days we used to have grants earmarked in a way which did encourage more advanced teaching. I do not wish to return to that, but we could do a great deal to improve the instruction in our village schools if we took a leaf out of the Scottish Code and secured in England what is now the law in Scotland, where in every village school, no matter how small, it is obligatory that the school shall have a supplementary class for children over twelve, in which the claim of those children to a wider education is recognised. Until you are willing in England to do something like Scotland is doing&#x2014;and remember that the Scottish law will not allow in future any teacher in a school who is not a trained and certificated teacher&#x2014;until you are prepared to work to that type of teacher in England you cannot expect to get that liberal, wide, and intelligent curriculum in our village schools that we all desire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00482"><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to express my satisfaction at the laudable rivalry which has been shown by the House on either side, even to anticipating the action of His Majesty's Government in bringing about a change which I think every educationist feels to be a desirable one. I confess to some little apprehension when I listened to the rather reticent phrases in which the noble Earl, Lord Beauchamp, referred to the production of the Government Bill. I should have liked to hear something a little firmer as to the prospect of the appearance of that Bill at a really early date. I am afraid that the passing of these two Bills to-night may serve as a narcotic rather than a stimulus,
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0092"/>
<col>175</col>
and that it is not inconceivable that some little time may be allowed to elapse before we see the Government measure. Therefore I should like to say that in the event of the Government Bill not being forthcoming I hope there will be no scruple whatever on the part of either or both of the noble Lords in going forward with these Bills. It does not seem to me, notwithstanding what the noble Earl said as to the labours of the Board of Education of late, that the task ought to have been an impossible one of producing a Bill of not a very complicated character on this particular matter, and I do hope that we may expect before long to see the Government measure.<lb/>
Reference has been wisely and appropriately made to-night to the great advantage of the final school year being used where possible for the preparation for the actual work which will be immediately begun outside. But we have to note one caution in that matter. It is only by prolonging the period of school attendance that we can justify the abstraction of a portion of the school hours for the other work which is to be taken up. I should in no sense regard it as an improvement in our educational plan if what I regard as the too early age at which children now cease their educational work were to be further curtailed by preparation for the work which is to follow. With that caution I am entirely in favour of the suggestion as to the better use that might be made of the further year, and I look forward with eager expectancy to the production of the Government Bill at no distant date.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00483"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL BATHURST</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am rather handicapped by not having heard the speech of Lord Saye and Sele in moving the Second Reading of his Bill. I do not quite know, therefore, what his arguments were in favour of it. But my own view, after comparing the two Bills, is very much in favour of Bill No. 2. In the first place it is much plainer and simpler than that of Lord Saye and Sele, which appears to me to be rather involved. Lord Saye and Sele's Bill begins by saying that the earliest age for exemption should be thirteen, but it is not clear in the second paragraph whether the age is to be thirteen or fourteen.<lb/>
<col>176</col>
I do not like the provision that "no child shall be entitled to obtain partial exemption from school attendance under the age of fourteen." Partial exemption is most completely condemned by the Departmental Committee, whose Report devoted pages to the harm which partial exemption does. It shows how children who are allowed to go from school to factories for a certain time return to school tired and unable to give the necessary attention to their studies. The Report supplies various reasons why partial exemption should be abolished. The reference in Lord Saye and Sele's Bill to attendance at continuation classes would absolutely bar rural children. The main object of No. 2 Bill is to assist children in rural districts to work on farms when they are thirteen. Children who make the best agriculturists are not always the cleverest, and therefore it would be useless to keep them at school until they were fourteen when they might be learning their business and doing good work on a farm. There are no such things as continuation schools in most villages, and therefore the provision of Lord Saye and Sele's Bill with regard to continuation schools would be absolutely useless to the agricultural child.<lb/>
Lord Willoughby de Broke's Bill is clear and expresses the whole case so well that it is very much the better of the two, and I think with a very slight amendment, by incorporating a few lines of Lord Saye and Sele's Bill, it could be made a very good Bill. I know that the objection that people will take to this is that it makes a differentiation between rural and urban children. If you can accomplish that it will be a very good thing. It is ridiculous to have a hard and fast rule for children living in towns, and that that rule should apply also to children who live in the country and attend village schools. I hope your Lordships will give Lord Willoughby's Bill a Second Reading and make provision for including within its scope children in urban districts under fourteen years of age on condition that they attend continuation classes, thus incorporating a few lines of Lord Saye and Sele's Bill. Amended in that way the Bill would be a great stride towards perfecting the education of children.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00485"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member> rose to call attention to the deficiency of trained horses for the Cavalry Division, and to ask the Secretary of State for War whether he proposes to rely on untrained horses to fill up the deficiency on mobilisation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00486">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I desire to call public attention to the lack in the number of trained horses in this country&#x2014;that is, trained for the purposes of war. The difficulty of trained horses and trained men is not at all a new one. It appears to have been present to the minds of people ever since the days of Hezekiah. Your Lordships will recollect that the King of Assyria sent a message to Hezekiah to say that he would provide a thousand horses if Hezekiah would provide a thousand men to put on them. It seems to me, looking at the number of trained horses in relation to the men you have in this country at the present moment, that the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War is going to do even better than Hezekiah did. He is going to put three men on one horse instead of one man on each horse. But be that as it may. What I desire to call serious attention to is not so much the method of increasing the number of trained horses&#x2014;we shall come to that later on, because I understand that the Secretary of State for War has under consideration a scheme for dealing with this matter&#x2014;but the present peace establishment. We cannot say with what nation we may be allied in the event of a European conflict. We have an <i>entente</i> with the French nation. The French have a large Army of Infantry; and. I submit that it is not too rash a statement to say that in the event of a European conflict the French, or any ally that we had, would rely mainly for assistance from this country upon the Cavalry Division of twelve regiments, which contains, if our information is correct, some of the finest trained Cavalry soldiers and Staff that Europe has yet seen. But it is absolutely vital that you should be in a position to place your Cavalry Division in the field at the very first moment after the outbreak of hostilities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00487">I am told that the war establishment of the Cavalry Division, including Horse Artillery and the rest, is 10,618 horses, and that the peace establishment you provide at present is only 6,810. I know that it is
<col>178</col>
difficult, probably impossible, to keep your Cavalry Division supplied with trained horses for every man, and I am not able to state positively what is done in other countries with regard to this; but I submit that some of them have the double training establishment on which they can count for a certain number of trained horses at the outbreak of hostilities. I submit with great respect to the Secretary of State for War that the fact that there is a supposed deficiency&#x2014;I hope the noble Viscount will be able to contradict it&#x2014;of 3,808 horses required on mobilisation, is a very disquieting factor in considering our military strength; and it should be further remembered that this figure of 3,808 horses has been arrived at after deducting 10 per cent. as unfit to take the field, which percentage in the opinion of all experts is, I am informed, a very low rate of deduction.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00488">The next question that arises is, where are you going to get trained horses from supposing your Cavalry has to be mobilised suddenly? Do you propose to take totally untrained horses to the front? I am aware that in the Boer War a great number of comparatively untrained horses went to the front, and I believe they behaved in the field with more or less satisfaction, but I should say that a European campaign would be quite a different matter. In support of that opinion I am fortified by the view of General Haig, who, I believe, is one of the experts upon whom the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War relies. He calls attention to a very striking incident in the Battle of Gravelotte, owing to a squadron of the 9th German Hussars being mounted on untrained or comparatively untrained horses&#x2014;at any rate, horses added on mobilisation. These horses stampeded as soon as the slightest confusion arose, as soon as a shot was fired, and carried with them not only that regiment but several other regiments and the baggage wagons which were standing on the side of the road down which the horses stampeded.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00489">Another question which has to be seriously considered in the event of mobilisation is that if you have to send, as you must endeavour to send, all your trained horses to the front, what provision is going to be made for a certain number of horses for the recruits who are to be trained at home? You will be compelled to leave some of your stock of trained horses, which ought to be sent to the front, for your recruits to train
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0094"/>
<col>179</col>
on or else they will have to train upon horses which will not enable them to carry out their training as quickly as with trained horses. I understand that some scheme is being proposed for training the horses of private owners with a view to their being mobilised in a satisfactory condition, and I should like to tell the Secretary of State for War that as a private owner of horses I will do everything in my power to help him and the War Office to make that scheme a success. I think he is very wise to undertake it, because the trouble is not the lack of horses in the United Kingdom. I have some horses myself which would be very safe mounts. If the noble Viscount could see his way to foreshadow this evening anything he has in his mind for the strengthening of the supply of horses I am sure we should be much obliged. But the point I particularly want his views upon is whether he thinks, putting on one side altogether the number of horses in the country which might become available, that the present peace establishment of trained horses is adequate supposing the Cavalry had to be mobilised at anything like short notice?</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00490"><member>LORD GREVILLE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I crave your indulgence in addressing your Lordships for the first time. My excuse is that, having served something like fourteen years in a Cavalry regiment, this question of trained horses naturally appeals very much to me. I heartily support the noble Lord in raising the question of the shortage of trained horses for the Cavalry Division. I do not think it is necessary to call your Lordships' attention to the enormous handicap that any trained soldier is under when placed upon a horse that is not properly trained. Many of your Lordships have had experience in the hunting field and on the polo ground, and I am sure as regards yourselves the last thing you would wish to do would be to take the field on untrained horses.<lb/>
What would be the position of the Cavalry soldier, who in time of peace has probably no horse at all allotted to him owing to the number of horses being short, when he is called up suddenly on active service if he is given, say, one of those delightful Irish four-year-olds and asked to ride it in his squadron or troop? Any one who has had experience of Cavalry will tell you the enormous mischief an untrained horse can do in the ranks. I had the honour of serving in a regiment with
<col>180</col>
General Haig to whom Lord Willoughby de Broke referred, and also with the present Commandant of the Cavalry School, and in that regiment great stress was laid on the training of our horses. I have also had some experience on active service of untrained horses, and I had the pleasure on one occasion of riding some sixty miles after 150 horses which had stampeded, mainly owing to the fact that we had bought horses which were not trained. I do hope, and I speak very feelingly as a late Cavalry soldier, that this question of trained horses for trained men will be considered, because I do not think there is any use spending money on the trained Cavalry soldier if you are unable to give him a trained horse to take the field on. You might just as well keep him an infantry soldier.<lb/>
Attention was also called by Lord Willoughby de Broke to the question of recruits. We all know that a very large percentage&#x2014;a much larger percentage than I care to think of&#x2014;are put in all regiments to fill up. With regard to the recruit on an untrained horse, I leave it entirely to your Lordships' imagination to consider what would be the result on active service. I understand that the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War is taking an interest in flying machines. He is going to pay a visit to the headquarters, and perhaps take a ride in one. May I suggest to the noble Viscount that when he next visits Aldershot he should ride a trained horse and also an untrained horse, so that he will be able to appreciate the position of the trained soldier?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00491"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we owe a good deal to the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, and to the noble Lord who has just spoken for bringing this matter before the public, because the subject of Cavalry horses has for long been the least explored part of the whole of the not very deeply explored military organisation of this country. Our practice has been when we wanted horses on the outbreak of war to go and buy them wherever we could get them. Those horses, of course, were not trained, and the unfortunate Cavalrymen were put on them. We did the best we could. That practice contrasted in an extraordinary fashion with the Continental practice, where the question of remounts has been carried to a very high pitch of perfection.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0095"/>
<col>181</col>
There are two systems. There is the German system, where the regiments have their own mounts, and there is the Austrian system, where boarded-out horses are used extensively. I may say to your Lordships that it was not till two or three years ago that I myself realised the gravity of the situation in this country, and there is very little in what Lord Willoughby de Broke and Lord Greville said that I dissent from. Supposing our Cavalry are mobilised, they are obviously at an enormous disadvantage particularly if opposed to well-mounted Cavalry. We therefore set to work to consider what was the best to be done, and in what has been done I have been guided by men such as General French and General Haig, great Cavalry experts, who were consulted at the beginning of this business&#x2014;and a very difficult one it is going to be. The constitution of the Cavalry Division two or three years ago brought to light an enormous number of new points never dreamed of. The whole machinery was put to the test, and we found that the weakest points were the remounts. Since then we have added men and horses to the regiments. We have added to the men and substantially to the horses, and we have added remounts&#x2014;regimental horses and boarded-out horses. But I say at once that although we have a peace establishment which shows an actual number of horses in excess of the war establishment, we have not yet solved the problem of how to produce that war establishment of trained horses; and I entirely agree with Lord Willoughby de Broke that until your horses are trained your Cavalry cannot be said to be properly efficient.<lb/>
At the present time the peace establishment of a Cavalry regiment is as follows. I will take regiments as more convenient than Divisions, because the figures of a Division are complicated by transfers and other things which prevent your getting the right figures as regards the horses. The peace establishment of a Cavalry regiment is this:&#x2014;With the regiment, 469 horses; boarded-out, 73&#x2014;total 542. The war establishment is:&#x2014;With the regiment, 434; at the base dep&#x00F4;t, 48&#x2014;total 482. But the surplus is only a nominal one, because a considerable number of these horses are untrained horses, and as I have already said I agree that the problem we have to solve is how to get trained horses for the Cavalry. There is no difficulty
<col>182</col>
about numbers. Numbers can be got by means of the boarding-out system. If that proves, as the result of experiments, to be useful, it may facilitate our task, but I should be sorry to dogmatise about this business, and I will tell you why. This is one of those things that can be solved only by making careful investigation by the best experts. We have had sitting now for about a month a Committee which I think leaves very little to be desired. Some of the best Cavalry soldiers in the country are sitting on that Committee, and I believe we are to have the advantage of the evidence of Lord Willoughby de Broke as a Master of Hounds on the subject of what training can be given to boarded-out horses in order to make them efficient.<lb/>
There are two views on this question. One view is that you can by perfecting your system of training secure that every boarded-out horse may reach a certain condition of efficiency. The other is that you can only provide properly trained horses if the horses are allocated to a regiment. That view can only be tested by experts. Germany takes one view, Austria the other; but the Committee must take some time to inquire. There is a good deal of evidence, and therefore I do not want to say anything about the subject or in any way to prejudice the conclusions to which the Committee may come on this subject. One very important point arises in this connection. We know how wasteful it is in war to use horses under six years old. Our custom has been to use for war purposes four and five year old horses. That has not been done on the Continent, although you may do it very well for the Yeomanry where the stress is not so great. But for Regular Cavalry, particularly for the Expeditionary Force, who may have severe work, it is wasteful to use horses under six years old. What we want to do is to train our horses thoroughly if possible, and not use them until they are in a proper condition. There are experts who say that British horses can be taken at less than six years old, that you can utilise them between five and six years old, but that is a point upon which the Committee will come to a decision.<lb/>
I think I have said enough to show your Lordships the extraordinarily conflicting character of this problem. At all events,
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0096"/>
<col>183</col>
the War Office is very busily engaged with it at the present time. We hope under the new legislation of this year to complete before long the census of horses. No doubt we shall find many more horses than we require, but the difficulty will be when you come to the Cavalry to get trained horses, and I doubt very much whether the census will help us in this matter. The problem that remains is a Cavalry problem, and I can only say that I hope the light thrown upon it by the Committee will enable us to come to some practical conclusion. We have so far solved the problem that we have increased the establishment for Cavalry very substantially within the last two years, and there are more than enough horses to mobilise them; but you cannot properly mobilise with these horses, and therefore there remains this secondary problem which I consider in some respects a more difficult problem than the first.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00492"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Secretary of State for War has most frankly stated how indebted your Lordships are to the noble Lord for bringing this subject forward, and I desire to associate myself with the noble Viscount in saying that. It seems to me that this is really a most important question, more specially important perhaps because it is not the kind of question that, from its ordinary nature, comes very much before the public eye. At the same time it is a question about which rumours fly around, and one on which the public should be reassured.<lb/>
It seems to me that there are really two questions involved&#x2014;the question of the provision of trained horses on mobilisation to which the noble Lord has referred and to which I desire to refer no further, and the question of reassuring the public as to the fitness of the horses you have in the ranks at the present moment. The noble Viscount spoke the other day of mobilising four Divisions in ten days and the remaining two Divisions in twenty-one days. I did not gather at the time in which of these two categories the Cavalry are at present considered to be, apart altogether from the question of the provision of the number of horses. But I rise this afternoon in order to ask the Secretary of State for War if he will consider whether something might not be done to bring clearly to the mind
<col>184</col>
of the public the fact, and I believe it to be the fact, that the horses you now have in the ranks are as efficiently trained as they ought to be if they had to go to war at ten days' notice. I do not think the public mind is satisfied at the present time on that point, and I think it ought to be.<lb/>
The French Cavalry during the last few weeks have performed a most remarkable achievement, with the details of which I have no doubt the noble Viscount is familiar. It arose from a good deal of discussion in France as to whether the horses in the ranks were kept as fit as they ought to be. The result was that a prize was offered to the regiment which should prove itself best in a competition organised more or less on the lines of a scouting movement. The trial took place about four weeks ago, when I had the good fortune to be in France. Although I did not actually see any of the trials going on, I think I fully appreciated the atmosphere. The tests were to be that parties from the various regiments&#x2014;an officer, a non-commissioned officer, and four men&#x2014;were given seventy-two hours in which to cover a distance of 300 kilometres, or, roughly, 188 miles. They were to perform this feat, all converging upon Paris, as a unit. It was perfectly useless for a horse or a man to fall out; disqualification met them the moment one of their number was unable to keep up with the others. It was not a race, because no unit was allowed to enter Paris before the seventy-second hour, but you will see at once that it was a very high test of courage and endurance&#x2014;a very high test of the brains of the officer in charge, and of his power to study his route and look after his horses and men. It was also a very high test of the efficiency of the turn-out, the efficiency of the fitting and the saddlery, and, in fact, a very high test of a Cavalry unit.<lb/>
Well, the remarkable part of this trial is that whereas twenty-seven parties started from twenty-seven regiments to take part in this competition, twenty-three parties actually carried it out. There were only four failures, and of those one was caused by a horse slipping on the tram line as it was entering Paris and thus becoming lame. It was coming along, therefore, in the last few yards of the competition. Another failure was caused by a piece of bad luck&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0097"/>
<col>185</col>
a horse going lame. The non-commissioned officer and the men sat up all night but failed to get it right, so it had to be sent home to Paris by rail. But they felt so disappointed that although they only remained five in their unit and were disqualified, they determined to complete the competition themselves, and in order to be in at the proper time they did eighty-four miles in twenty-four hours, and arrived spic and span on the last morning of the trial. These sort of failures are not failures to be ashamed of. They only illustrate more fully, I think, the excellence of the whole performance. The very heavy feat of going 188 miles in this time was performed successfully by twenty-three units out of twenty-seven, the four failures being really very small failures, and two were almost, as I have pointed out, successes.<lb/>
The reason I have drawn attention to this matter is this. There is no doubt whatever that this competition made a most profound impression upon public opinion in France. It profoundly impressed public opinion there as to the efficiency of their Cavalry. I would suggest to the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War whether he would like to give us a similar impression in England. It would be possible for him to carry out a similar competition amongst thirteen regiments at this moment which are all within that distance&#x2014;188 miles of London. He could bring fourteen regiments if he chose to bring in York, but he would have to arrange for York to start 10 miles this side of London. If the noble Viscount thought it desirable and found it convenient to carry out such a trial as this, it is important that a start should be made very soon because it is undesirable that horses should be put in special training. We want to know whether the horses in the possession of our Cavalry are fit to go to war in ten days' time. If the noble Viscount thought it desirable that this trial should take place here, I do not wish to put myself unduly forward but I think I might undertake, having consulted Lord Willoughby de Broke and one or two others, that a small sum would be forthcoming to give a prize to the successful men and a piece of plate to the successful regiment. I do not myself doubt that the British Cavalry could carry out this trial every bit as well as the French Cavalry, but I do not know whether the public also realise that. I should like them to, and
<col>186</col>
therefore I commend this idea to the noble Viscount opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00493"><member>THE EARL OF CLANWILLIAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have been a Cavalry soldier for a short time myself, and although I agree with a part of what the noble Earl, Lord Donoughmore, said, I think he rather&#x2014;I do not like to put it too strongly&#x2014;cast an aspersion on members of the Cavalry in this country. I could not quite hear what he said. I was sitting behind him, but I think I heard him describing a ride of French Cavalry recently towards Paris. The ride, I understand, was about 188 miles, but I could not hear the time which the noble Earl gave.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00494"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: Seventy-two hours.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00495"><member>THE EARL OF CLANWILLIAM</member><membercontribution>: It is two or three years since I was in the Army, but I remember that a squadron of the regiment in which I had the honour to serve certainly did as much as sixty or seventy miles in a day in reconnoitring and that sort of thing, and although it was man&#x0153;uvres carried on as much as possible under the conditions of war that squadron continued its very active operations next day and the next day after that, and I do not remember that there were any casualties in that squadron or that the horses were in any way put out of action. I fancy in course of time the officer commanding that particular squadron took a certain amount of pride in having carried out this ride, and it certainly surprised several people that the horses of an ordinary Cavalry regiment in England could do such a thing. But there it was, and I do not think the noble Earl would find any difficulty in discovering several Cavalry regiments in England who would be able to carry out a ride and compete with any Cavalry regiment abroad.<lb/>
The root of the trouble in regard to the supply of horses is, to my mind, the initial difficulty of getting horses at all. The Remount Department are limited as to the amount of money which they can expend. At least they used to be. Formerly they were limited to a certain amount as the price which they could give for a horse. I suppose the Exchequer did not like to produce as much money as the Army officers would like, and the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0098"/>
<col>187</col>
result was that Cavalry regiments as a rule had to train their men on an insufficient number of horses. Besides that, the Remount Department used to obtain horses of too young an age. They could not afford to pay a longer price, and the result was they bought three or four-year-olds. What was the effect of that? These horses were trained in the riding school and given a very severe training, and in several cases the constitutions of the horses were ruined and they never recovered. That will be borne out by any Cavalry soldier in your Lordships' House, and that is where the British Army suffers such a disadvantage as compared with the German Army. I believe the Germans never fight with, or even train, a horse until it is six years old, and the result is that it lasts much longer. The reason we cannot do that is that we have not the horses.<lb/>
The Secretary of State for War, of course, knows all this. He has a Committee sitting, and all these points are naturally gone into. The great difficulty so far as trained horses are concerned is, as I have said, the initial difficulty of supplying the horses to begin with. If you give the Cavalry regiments sufficient horses you will find sufficient trained horses to go to war when the time comes; but, as everybody knows, the Cavalry regiments are insufficiently horsed, and the result is the horses have to do a great deal too much work. They are worked from morning till night, from year's end to year's end. In the regiment I was connected with we had this great advantage over other Cavalry regiments, that our horses were not worked all the winter as well as all the summer. They had a certain amount of rest, and the result was they were much better; and though I do not say it in derogation of any other Cavalry regiment, our horses were much fitter when man&#x0153;uvres came than the other horses of the Line, for the reason that they had been cared for a bit more because we could rest them.<lb/>
I was in Canada about two years ago, and an officer of the Canadian Pacific Railway was talking to me about the supply of horses. He said, as everybody knows, that it is quite feasible to obtain a supply of horses fit for Cavalry regiments from Canada, if the Government would only give
<col>188</col>
the ranchers an undertaking that they would go and buy a certain number every year. The Government did not do so, and the result is that the ranchers do not any longer breed the class of horse fit for this particular work, but go in for the shires and the hackneys. But this officer told me that a few years ago he was authorised by the President of the Canadian Pacific Railway to write to the War Office and offer them 10,000 acres of land at a nominal price, about a cent an acre, the idea being that this land would be carefully chosen and would act as a collecting station for troop horses to mount Cavalry, or gun horses. I asked him what happened. He said, "They never even answered my letter." This was several years ago and the noble Viscount the present Secretary of State for War is quite exonerated in the matter, because he probably never heard of the letter much less ever saw it. But there it is. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company made this offer. They hold to it, I believe, to-day. They would produce these 10,000 acres at the nominal rent, as I say, of a cent an acre, and you would then be able to collect your horses and buy the very best, for in Canada, as is well known, there are most excellent horses. It is difficult to improve upon them; and so long as you had the command of the sea you would be able to ship them over very quickly during war time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00496"><member>THE EARL OF ERROLL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I entirely agree with the last speaker, that the English Cavalry would be perfectly competent to carry out the exercise which Lord Donoughmore so graphically described. The question is not so much one as to the training and fitness of the English horses, but as to the quality of the horses themselves. I was told only a year or two ago by one of the Inspectors-General of Cavalry&#x2014;I will not mention his name&#x2014;that he had attended in an official capacity the man&#x0153;uvres in Germany, France, and Austria, and the conclusion he had come to was that the Cavalry in those three countries were far better mounted than the Cavalry in this country. And the worst of it is that the horses on which these Cavalry are mounted are either English horses or their descendants. The reason this is so is that the foreigners come over here and buy our horses at three years old, whereas we do not buy them until they are four years old; the result is we only get what they will not take.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0099"/>
<col>189</col>
I was very glad to hear the noble Viscount opposite say they were not going to send out any horses until they are six years old. I think that is economically correct. I took a horse to South Africa which had never been worked at all until he was six years old, and I have got him running in a cart now, and he is over twenty years old. I believe that is entirely due to his not having been hard worked when he was three or four years old. I would point out, further, that in the case of a Continental war there might be difficulty in providing horses for this country, as the foreign markets would probably be closed to us. I speak with some diffidence on this question, as the noble Earl the Minister for Agriculture has put me on the Advisory Board. When I was in a regiment and anybody grumbled at the food he was immediately put on the Mess Committee, and I think it was on this principle that the noble Earl placed me on the Advisory Board. As far as I understand, the duty of the Board of Agriculture is to provide the horses and to see to the breed of horses in this country, but I think, on the other hand, it is the business of the War Office to retain them, either by buying them at three years old or getting a lien on them, so that they shall not be taken away by the foreigner, or so that we, at any rate, shall have the first choice.<lb/>
It seems to me that if we had to mobilise suddenly the Territorials would be more or less denuded of horses to fill up the Cavalry Division when they started. I think it would be the right thing if every Yeoman had a horse registered on which he could rely at the moment of mobilisation. At the end of six months we should probably want to entirely remount the Cavalry in a campaign, as the mortality is something enormous amongst horses, not only from want of food and from exposure but from the extraordinarily hard work which they have to undergo. The Yeomanry, as your Lordships know, are very short of horses. Three men as a rule have to ride one horse. Mr. Tilling, I believe, provides these horses; and I was much surprised the other day to hear from the Secretary of State for War that Colonel Repington had said that two Yeomanry regiments were equal to one Regular Cavalry regiment. I should like to know whether those Yeomanry regiments are mounted, because if they are not I do not think it is putting the Regular Cavalry regiment very high.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00497"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, nobody is more conscious than I am of the difficulties which beset the Secretary of State for War, and I have no doubt that every effort is being made by the War Office to overcome them. There is one point which I think is not sufficiently realised by some Cavalry officers, and that is that the difficulty as regards the shortage of horses for regiments in ordinary times, in time of peace, is not by any means due to the parsimony of the War Office. I myself on two occasions had a Committee of Cavalry Officers and directed them to let us know the largest number of horses they would take in a regiment in time of peace, and on each occasion the War Office exceeded the number which these officers declared themselves willing to take. The difficulty was that with the number of duties to be performed one man was found to have to groom two horses unless you kept down the number to a reasonable limit. The difficulty before the war was that Cavalry officers found it impossible to house, or rather to maintain, as many horses as the War Office would have been glad to give. Then, of course, there comes the difficulty as regards age, and the provision of horses on mobilisation. I believe that those officers who had the advantage of the first 14,000 registered horses which were used&#x2014;some for Cavalry, some for Artillery, and a few for transport&#x2014;all agree that on the whole the first demands in the South African war were well met. I might even now commend to the noble Viscount the suggestion made by the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, that there should be a registered horse for each Yeoman. I believe that would not be an undue demand, and would really make the Yeoman efficient for the immediate purposes of mobilisation without waiting for a further supply.<lb/>
What I rose chiefly to say was this. It fell upon me later in the war, after the original difficulties of supply had been more, or less met, to have to maintain a supply of 10,000 horses per month for a year and a half&#x2014;300 horses a day to be landed in South Africa; and I have always been convinced that we could never attempt that again unless we had some supply from British territory on which we might depend. I would therefore ask the noble Viscount opposite, before all these vacant lands are taken up in Canada&#x2014;I mean lands con-
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0100"/>
<col>191</col>
venient for this purpose&#x2014;to consider such offers as Lord Clanwilliam said had been made. The sooner we make this provision in some country where there is ample range and where we can secure the class of horse which we desire, the better it will be for the Army. I dare say it is well known to all those who have studied this question that the breed of horses in Australia for this purpose left a great deal to be desired; and I am sorry to think that in the years that have elapsed since the war we have not at the War Office made any change in this respect.<lb/>
I hope that the noble Viscount will, if he possibly can, enable a system to be set on foot which will register for every trooper who will be mobilised, whether in the Regular Army or in the Yeomanry, a horse on which he can put his hand on the day of mobilisation, and that the noble Viscount will also be able to find for us outside the United Kingdom, without in any way prejudicing the supply from here, some supply which will enable us in that particular country where we get the horses to keep them until they are five years old if not till six years. I know that the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War is fully alive to this grave and increasing danger in regard to a sufficiency of horses, a danger which must increase owing to motor traction so largely diminishing the supply of horses in some parts of the United Kingdom, and one which I am sure your Lordships will be glad to help him to overcome.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00500"><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I ask the House to consider and approve this Report from the Select Committee. There are only two points which require special notice. One indicates a slight change of policy with regard to the appointment of messengers. At present there are some messengers who are called temporary messengers, and are only employed during the weeks that Parliament sits. This has not been found by the Clerk of the Parliaments to be an altogether satisfactory system, because while those who are appointed temporary messengers have a sort of claim to a permanent post, the temporary nature of the first employment does not always tend to attract those whom the Clerk of the Parliaments thinks would be the best men. Under the policy indicated in this Report the temporary messenger will be absorbed in the regular staff, and it is hoped by adding one to the staff and not having temporary messengers at all that a more satisfactory arrangement can be made. I need hardly say that appointments to this staff, as a matter of practice not by any order, are made by the Clerk of the Parliaments from those who have served in some portion of His Majesty's Dominions.<lb/>
The last paragraph of the Report is, I think, worthy of notice by your Lordships. It states that&#x2014;
<quote>"The First Commissioner of His Majesty's Works reported that the Trustees of the National Gallery had kindly offered to lend for exhibition within the precincts of the House of Lords Copley's picture of "The Death of Chatham."</quote>
The Committee accepted that offer with gratitude, and the picture is now hung at the head of the Royal Gallery. I hope that it will remain there, and, as is indicated by the First Commissioner of Works, that he will be able to induce the Directors of the National Gallery to send us some further pictures which will adorn the walls of this House. I think the House owes a debt of gratitude to the First Commissioner of Works for the interest he has taken in this matter, and I hope his policy will go further. I would also call attention to the fact that the First Commissioner himself has made us a gift of a coloured engraving by Nash representing the opening

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00510">2. The unfitness of the men of the 2nd Class of the Army Reserve, Section D, and of the Special Reserve, for the duties assigned to them in connection with the Expeditionary Force; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00511">The noble Duke said: My Lords, in the Notice that stands in my name on the Paper I call your Lordships' attention to two points&#x2014;the lack of quantity in the First Class of the. Army Reserve and to the lack of quality in the Second Class of the Army Reserve and of the Special Reserve to meet the requirements of the Expeditionary Force in 1913. I deal with non-commissioned officers and men only. My figures are taken from statements made by Lord Lucas when Under-Secretary of State for War on November 15 last, and also from the War Office Table dated April 8, 1907, which sets forth very clearly and in considerable detail the numbers required from the peace establishment, from the Regular Reserve, and from the Special Contingent for the Expeditionary
<col>196</col>
Force. I am aware that there is a more recent Table than that, issued only last month, but it was dated June 1, 1910. This Table gives the total number of men required for the Expeditionary Force, but it does not differentiate between the numbers required from the peace establishment, from the Regular Reserve, and from the Special Contingent, and hence is valueless for my purpose. It is like substituting the comprehensive word "miscellaneous" for the separate headings of a financial statement, and produces the same impression.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00512">The Table which I have put upon the Paper shows that on the mobilisation of the Expeditionary Force in 1913 there will be a deficiency of 29,240 men in the First Class of the Army Reserve. This shortage is met in part by the men of the Second Class of the Army Reserve, whose estimated number in 1913 is 24,895. Assume that mobilisation takes place at the end of the trooping season&#x2014;that is, in or immediately after the month of April, when all the drafts required for foreign service have been sent abroad. At that time there will be a total deficiency in all classes of the Regular Reserve amounting to 6,834. In the debate which took place before Easter the noble Viscount alluded to&#x2014;
<quote>"a large number of surplus Reserve and the Special Reserve left in the country after the departure of the Expeditionary Force."</quote>
The question I beg to ask the noble Viscount is this, Whence will this large number of surplus Reserve be derived in 1913, and why do War Office Returns supplied for our information show not a surplus but a deficiency? There will not only be a great deficiency in the quantity of the First Class of the Regular Reserve, but there will also be a great lack of quality in the Second Class of the Army Reserve.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00513">The men comprising this class of the Reserve known as Section D of the Army Reserve were found by Lord Methuen and Sir T. Kelly-Kenny during the South African war to be unfit for active service. I have on a previous occasion quoted the evidence given by these two distinguished Generals upon this matter, but I failed to persuade the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, who then represented the War Office, to pay any attention to their opinion. I must therefore press the noble Viscount for an answer to this question. Why, if
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0103"/>
<col>197</col>
these Section D men were found unfit for active service in South Africa, should they now be considered fit for active service at a moment's notice with the Expeditionary Force in Europe and elsewhere? The noble Viscount knows that the reason why the men of the Second Class of the Army Reserve proved unsatisfactory in South Africa was due to the length of their absence from the Colours. I must remind the noble Viscount that whereas the men found by Lord Methuen and Sir T. Kelly-Kenny unfit for immediate active service abroad had been absent from the Colours from five to nine years, the men now relied upon by the noble Viscount to complete his Expeditionary Force will have been absent from the Colours from nine to thirteen years. The noble Viscount must be aware that he is counting upon men who will be the product of the three years with the Colours and nine with the Reserve term of enlistment, and that consequently the unfitness complained of by Lord Methuen and Sir T. Kelly-Kenny will be not only intensified but in some cases more than doubled.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00514">Now until the noble Viscount tells us some good reason for setting aside the evidence of Lord Methuen and Sir T. Kelly-Kenny it is useless for him to expect us to accept the men of the Second Class Army Reserve as in any way fit for First Line duties against Continental or other troops within three weeks of mobilisation. However, the noble Viscount must include 25,000 Second Class Army Reservists in the ranks of his Expeditionary Force, and even then he will have to draw at once on his Special Reserve to complete his numbers. The noble Lord has assured us, in answer to a question put to him by Lord Curzon, that&#x2014;
<quote>"He had the machinery and provision for keeping the Expeditionary Force in existence."</quote>
Now that provision is the Special Reserve. There is no other; therefore it is well to consider that force in some detail. The noble Viscount decided to destroy the old Second Line, the Militia, and to create a new force, the Special Reserve. The noble Viscount has told us that he is satisfied that the new Special Reserve is a better force than the old Militia. We have lost the Militia but we have gained a better force, the Special Reserve, and <i>pro tanto</i> our military forces are the stronger. I should for a moment like to set the loss against the gain.</p>
<col>198</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00515">For instance, in the South African war 126 battalions of Militia were embodied, and there served abroad sixty-one battalions in South Africa and nine in the Mediterranean and Egypt. These seventy battalions expanded the Regular Army abroad by complete units. In short, they carried out the chief recommendation made by the South African War Commission on the need for means of expansion outside the limits of the Regular Army for foreign service. No one would contend that you can simply wipe out a force which supplied seventy battalions for foreign and active service and put nothing in its place without weakening your military strength. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has told us that the Special Reserve in its present form&#x2014;
<quote>"is a far more valuable part of the military system than the old Militia, on which a considerable sum of money had to be expended."</quote>
Tested by war experience we know the value of the Militia Force in the past. It was good for seventy battalions abroad besides more than fifty embodied battalions at home, and it supplied its own officers and non-commissioned officers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00516">Now as to the present value of the Special Reserve. This is quite certain, that whereas you had seventy Militia battalions actually serving abroad, now you have not got a single Special Reserve battalion fit for foreign service. For this very duty the noble Viscount designed the twenty-seven fourth battalions, and told us on March 14 last that they were to go abroad in the same way as the old Militia. All the same, there is not a single battalion in a fit state to go on foreign service, and there is not the smallest prospect of any becoming fit for that duty. The noble Viscount announced on March 14 last that he was going to raise the establishment of these battalions from 530 to 750 men. That means that the noble Viscount must get 5,940 more men for his twenty-seven fourth battalions. At present the whole Special Reserve Infantry is 7,228 men short of its establishment. It is not enough for the noble Viscount to tell us that he proposes to raise more than 13,000 additional recruits; he must also be prepared to show us how he is going to get them without injuring recruiting for the Regular Army, and how he is going to provide them with non-commissioned officers. Last March the noble Viscount
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0104"/>
<col>199</col>
proposed to divert men from joining the Second Class Army Reserve and to enlist them into the Special Reserve. Yes; but then what becomes of the Expeditionary Force when the Second Class of the Army Reserve is thus depleted by being put into the Special Reserve?</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00517">The whole Special Reserve numbers at present 60,957 non-commissioned officers and men; of these, by the statement of the Under-Secretary of State for War on November 15 last, 15,175 Special Reservists are required to form the Special Contingent of the Expeditionary Force and to proceed abroad at once on mobilisation. That leaves at home 45,782 non-commissioned officers and men of the Special Reserve; one-third of these must be recruits too young to serve abroad. I must further explain that this number of 45,782 would include the twenty-seven fourth battalions who are, by the statement of the noble Viscount, earmarked for foreign service. If the noble Viscount adheres to his statement of March 1 last and sends the twenty-seven battalions abroad they cannot be counted in the home force; that would diminish the home force by some 15,000 men, reducing the total at home to 29,280 including the immature and the unfit. I shall include the twenty-seven fourth battalions in the home drafting pool, because it is obviously impossible for them to serve abroad as battalions. But I must insist on this point, that these twenty-seven battalions cannot be counted as serving abroad as battalions and at the same time as forming part of the home drafting pool. It is for the noble Viscount to elect to which duty he definitely assigns them, but I do protest against his using them in two places at one time. It is certain that the noble Viscount would never have detailed these twenty-seven battalions for foreign service had he not required them abroad. Well, they are not available for foreign service. How, then, are their places to be supplied over seas?</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00518">If we recognise the failure of the Special Reserve to provide battalion units for foreign service we shall have in round numbers 45,000 men in the Special Infantry Reserve at home. That number, less one-third too young for foreign service, leaves 30,000 men. That number, again less 10 per cent. for wastage and unfitness and less the number required to sail with the Expeditionary Force in the first instance,
<col>200</col>
would leave at the very outside 25,000 men available for immediate drafting abroad. There are no non-commissioned officers fit to go abroad with the drafts and take their places in the non-commissioned ranks on joining the Line regiments on service. This, then, is the fighting value of the Special Infantry Reserve at the present moment, but then it is a diminishing quantity. At first the establishment was to be 90,000 representing the whole Militia force transferred, and the noble Viscount credited the Regular Army with an additional 90,000 men; then the establishment came down to 70,000, and now the strength is about 60,000, and I read in the Army Annual Return published in 1911 that 7,803 fewer recruits were obtained for the Special Reserve than in the previous year. From 90,000 to 60,000 in three years is a pretty rapid descent down hill, and from the last Army Annual Report we have not yet reached the bottom. In spite of all this the noble Viscount told us that he&#x2014;
<quote>"believed that the Special Reserve was a better force than the Militia; its numbers were less but it supplied what the General Staff had worked out as the requisites for finding drafts and providing for the wastage of war during the early period of a war."</quote>
The numbers of rank and file of the Special Reserve are at present nearly 30,000 less than those of the Militia in 1905. We have been told that to supply the wastage of the Expeditionary Force during the first six months of a war 70,000 men will be required. Now if the General Staff work out a demand for 70,000 men and are well satisfied with providing 25,000 men to meet it, I do not think they are ever likely to be disappointed with the results of their administration, because they do not seem to appreciate the difference between success and failure.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00519">Twenty-five thousand men are no very great quantity. Now as to their quality and their fitness for the particular duty for which they are required. They are to go abroad within a few weeks of the departure of the Expeditionary Force on active service in Europe or elsewhere. In a recent debate the noble Viscount refused to regard men with one year of continuous service with refresher courses as sufficiently trained to meet Regular Continental troops, and he considered that&#x2014;
<quote>"if the doctrine were taken seriously it would spread alarm and consternation throughout the Army."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0105"/>
<col>201</col>
These Special Reservists, with whom the noble Viscount is satisfied, are wanted for this particular purpose, and yet the noble Viscount gives some of them five and others of them three months of squad drill at a dep&#x00F4;t, and it is noteworthy that the men of the battalions ear-marked for foreign service are the ones who receive but three months. That represents, or rather misrepresents, their term of Colour service. These Special Reservists are never trained with a regiment in the correct sense of the term. Their annual training of four weeks is but a skeleton training conducted with skeleton companies drilling in single rank, and never enough men in a company to carry out the minor tactics of company training.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00520">Then as to musketry, there is only time to fire 80 rounds instead of the 250 required for the Regular soldier. Machine gun practice and signalling are unknown. The Special Reserve is the special invention of the noble Viscount, and consequently he must accept the product as fit for First Line duties or he would stultify himself. He told us before Easter that&#x2014;
<quote>"His present military system gave a large number of highly trained Reservists, more highly trained than the Reservists of any other country in the world, who mobilise with your Regulars and make them efficient fighting battalions."</quote>
That is true of the men of the First Class Army Reserve only where there will be a deficiency of upwards of 30,000 men. But we know from the evidence of Lord Methuen and Sir T. Kelly-Kenny that it is not true of the men of Section D, the Second Class Army Reserve, who are to number 25,000, and it cannot be true of the men and boys in the Special Reserve. No military Power would include in their First Line&#x2014;that is, in their frontier force, and our Expeditionary Force represents our frontier force&#x2014;men who have been a dozen or more years away from the Colours, or boys with five and three months of squad drill and no Colour service at all and only trained in musketry up to one-third of First Line standard.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00521">I beg to ask the noble Viscount, first, if he expects us to believe that the men in the Second Class Army Reserve and the men and boys in the Special Reserve upon whom he relies for the requirements of his Expeditionary Force are really more highly trained than the Reservists of any country in the world; and, secondly, to show us
<col>202</col>
from whence the 70,000 men are to be obtained to feed the Expeditionary Force during the first six months of a war. It is certain they cannot come from the Special Reserve. The War Office Returns tell us that they are not there. They must be in the same place as the large surplus of Regular Reservists alluded to by the noble Viscount. The noble Viscount will produce them from somewhere because he has told us that he will do so, but why not let us know from where, because after all, in spite of the secrets of mobilisation, they are bound to appear within the next eighteen months on the Army Estimates.</p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00523"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the limits of my poor capacity have prevented me from doing more than catch a few drops from the torrent of figures which the noble Duke has poured forth, but I have secured enough to catch the general drift of his arguments. It is the custom of the noble Duke to give us the advantage of seeing his speeches in print, sometimes in the form of letters to the <i>Morning Post</i> and occasionally in a pamphlet, and that is a great advantage, because it enables one to follow what otherwise it would not be easy to follow.<lb/>
But I wish that the noble Duke, the next time he deals with such a question as the state on mobilisation in 1913, would pay a little attention to what has been explained by my noble friend Lord Lucas in this House and by myself elsewhere, which, I should have thought, could not have been misunderstood. We agree that in 1913, excluding Section D, the Regular Reserve will drop to about 106,000. We know all about that, and we have explained over and over again why it is so. It is so because the system of three years with the Colours and nine in the Reserve was altered by the late Mr. Arnold-Forster for a short period into nine years

<col>203</col>
and three. That, again, was altered to what I believe a much better subdivision, seven years with the Colours and five in the Reserve, and since then you have got nine with the Colours and three in the Reserve. Naturally in 1913 you will find your figures drop, but that need not perturb you very much, because if your battalions are full of men trained for nine years it is clear that you do not require so much of the Reserve to mobilise. Therefore it is as broad as it is long; not quite, but nearly as broad as it is long. In 1913 the Reserve will drop, but you will be wanting a much smaller Reserve because your battalions will be full of men who have been nine years with the Colours. I have explained over and over again that the year 1913 has to be watched. It will be down temporarily, but the Reserve will rise immediately after that to its normal, because the five and seven years' system will be in existence. We have explained fully that we are quite aware of what will be the state of things in 1913, and that such provision has been made as will avert any danger connected with it.<lb/>
But the noble Duke speaks of 1913 as if it would be the beginning of disaster. He ignores altogether that it is transitory, and that the state of things then will be due to circumstances and to a policy over which this Government have no control&#x2014;a policy which existed for a short time and which has given rise to circumstances which cannot but be temporary. I will say no more about 1913, except to express the hope that the next time the noble Duke speaks on this subject he will do justice to the fact that his point has been answered and disposed of, as far as I can judge, in a manner which admits of no doubt. The noble Duke went on to say that his figures had been taken from Papers which the War Office had laid on the Table from time to time, and they showed a deficiency which he brings out in the account he has put before your Lordships as a sort of appendix to his Question as 6,834. The noble Duke has also given your Lordships a whole string of figures which he says are taken from War Office Papers and establish his point. Will your Lordships believe that the true result is that there is not a deficiency of 6,834, but a surplus of nearly 27,000?<lb/>
I have thought it worth while to get out some figures, and I wish to take the opportunity of saying that I cannot be constantly putting that burden upon the hard-worked
<col>204</col>
officials at the War Office. These figures have taken three officers the best part of a day and a half to search out, and I will give them to your Lordships. In the first place the noble Duke said he had not paid much attention to our Table showing the state of the Army in June, 1910. He proceeded on the Paper which was laid on the Table in 1907. I should have thought it would have been more prudent to examine a little closely the figures of the 1910 Return to see how far the figures of 1907 compared. But the noble Duke has not done that, and the result is that the whole of his figures are vitiated. I will take them one by one, because it is interesting to notice the differences.<lb/>
The first point is a very minor one, and I will not dwell upon it; but the noble Duke, in the figures which he gives at the beginning of his Table showing the numbers of the Army to be 121,143, has omitted 851 warrant officers. It is a small point and I do not make much of it, but it shows how careful one has to be if one professes to be accurate. Next, under the heading "(A)&#x2014;From Peace Establishment," the noble Duke gives the number of non-commissioned officers and men in the United Kingdom as 121,143, and then he deducts "less number of non-commissioned officers and men under twenty years of age," 28,268. From that one would believe that on mobilisation men under twenty were never sent abroad. The noble Duke has confused two things. We do not send drafts to India under twenty; but since 1899 the constant practice, under Lord Midleton, Lord Lansdowne, Mr. Arnold-Forster and myself, has been to treat, for certain arms, for certain purposes, men of nineteen as fit to go even to India, and certainly to Africa and to the. Continent. We do not send men under twenty into the fighting line in the Infantry or the Cavalry, but, as I have pointed out, we should on mobilisation, following the established practice, use a very large number of men under twenty. The noble Duke has, therefore, made an altogether excessive deduction in his figure of 28,268.<lb/>
But the noble Duke has done another thing in this connection. He has taken, not establishment as he ought to have done, but strength, in giving these figures. Establishment and strength, I am glad to say, are not the same thing. There is at this moment, owing to bad recruiting&#x2014;the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0107"/>
<col>205</col>
recruiting is, I am glad to see, increasing this week&#x2014;a slight deficiency in the numbers of the pool, but no deficiency on the establishment. I should be sorry to contemplate it. It is undesirable to take your figures from strength, which may vary from day to day, instead of establishment, and the practice of doing this has led the noble Duke into a very great difficulty. He has put the number of men who leave the United Kingdom as drafts at 13,603, and he has said that these should be deducted; but he has overlooked altogether this fact, that, taking the trooping season with which he is dealing, while it is true that 13,603 are shown as drafts gone out, 12,369 men came home. Of course, there are men going out and men coming back. Most of them come to the Colours for a short time and then go to the Reserve, but there they are available, and if you deduct the drafts on one side going out you must take those who come home. Therefore the noble Duke's figures blunder by 13,000 at a stroke. No wonder he gets a deficiency where in the ordinary course of things there is a surplus.<lb/>
I come to other points. The noble Duke has given the number of Regulars available for the Expeditionary Force as 83,588. That comes of taking the 1907 Return instead of, as he ought to have done, the 1910 Return, which shows the Army as it is under the seven and five years' system. If the noble Duke had taken that Return he would have found that his figure was wrong by no less than 7,000 men. The true figure is not 83,588 but 90,953. I come to another figure. The noble Duke gives the number required from the peace establishment for the Expeditionary Force by quoting Table 1 of the Memorandum of April 8, 1907. As your Lordships will see, it is 1907 again. There again he has taken it wrongly. He has taken the number available not the number required in 1907. The Return of 1910, which he ought to have taken, shows not 60,927, but 70,288 actually existing men detailed to the Expeditionary Force. I am sorry to trouble your Lordships with these figures, which I am sure are quite as difficult for you to follow as the noble Duke's; but I am bound to protest against figures being brought forward and going out to the public which seem to show that the position of things is such as would naturally very much disturb the public mind, whereas as a matter of fact we have the whole of the men, the fighting <i>personnel,</i> of the
<col>206</col>
Expeditionary Force ready to mobilise at this moment.<lb/>
I do not wish to trouble your Lordships with the whole of the details, but I find the figure of actual Reservists available for the Expeditionary Force is put down by the noble Duke at 80,896, when it should be 87,557, because whoever prepared these figures for the noble Duke has made an accounting blunder. There are a certain number of men taken from the Reserve and detailed for Medical service for instance. Of course, these form part of the Expeditionary Force just as much as if they were combatants. The noble Duke has deducted them because they are said to be required for those purposes. But he should have put them on both sides of the account. Though they are deducted from the number on one side, they are still going as part of the Expeditionary Force, and they are just as much a part of the Expeditionary Force as if they were fighting with the combatants. Again, as stated in the 1910 Return, 5,000 men for the A.S.C. and R.A.M.C. may be specially enlisted. The noble Duke is therefore wrong here by nearly 7,000. I should only weary your Lordships if I went through all the noble Duke's figures, but there is one particular point in which they are altogether misleading. They make out that the total Reserve will show a deficiency, but after the corrections that I have pointed out have been made instead of a deficiency of 6,834, as stated by the noble Duke, there is a surplus of nearly 27,000. I am not giving these figures recklessly. They have been carefully investigated, and are the result of very hard work in the Adjutant-General's department and the Actuarial department. As far as human skill and industry can make them, they are right. At least I am certain of this, that they are arrived at by going through the proper numbers, and by taking, not an antiquated document, but the most recent document as the basis of calculation.<lb/>
The noble Duke has overlooked various things in this connection. In mobilisation you would not get much, but you would get a small amount for transport purposes by special enlistment, but in the substitution of mechanical transport it would be essential, not for transport in the fighting line, but the third and fourth transport, as it is called under the new system, to get highly skilled civil drivers for motor vehicles. This new system will to a con-
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0108"/>
<col>207</col>
siderable extent reduce the demand for horses, and also to a certain extent for men for the same, and this is also true of the medical. The general observation I would wish to make on the noble Duke's criticism of the Army is that he goes on the principle of counting noses. That is an archaic plan. We fight to-day with great units of mixed arms of Cavalry, Infantry, Artillery, and so on, with their transport, medical service, and supplies, and unless you have those things your mobilisation will be the old archaic mobilisation which has long been superseded in Continental armies.<lb/>
There is only one way to make the Army efficient, and that is to study the organisation of the units. It is all very well to have a large surplus of Infantry, but it is no good to you if you have not the transport and supplies and Artillery to make them effective. Your success on mobilisation turns, and must turn, on your having a proper provision of everything, and therefore the basis of study and the basis of criticism ought to be these large units. That is a problem which does not seem to attract the noble Duke, who goes back to the state of things in the old Militia days as if in the Militia days there was any proper system of mobilisation. Everybody knows there was none. It would have taken months to mobilise a proper Army in those days. We are trying to do the best possible with a system which will provide against wastage in war, and which will enable us to mobilise our Divisions in such a way as we could not do in the old days. I dare say there are many shortcomings and deficiencies, but among these are certainly not the deficiencies in the figures which the noble Duke suggests in the Question he has put down on the Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00524"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am much obliged to the noble Viscount for his reply to my Question, but I should like to be permitted to say a few words. First with regard to the question between the two Returns of 1907 and 1910. I beg to tell the noble Viscount that I could not make out anything in the 1910 Return, because you have not differentiated between the number of men you want from the Regular Reserve, the peace establishment, and the Special Contingent. You have lumped them together, and I have been unable to follow the Return. Will the noble Viscount lay on the Table of the House a Return made out precisely in the same way as
<col>208</col>
the one of 1907? If he does that, everything will be clear. The 1907 Return gives all the information wanted.<lb/>
The noble Viscount has told your Lordships that we are to send abroad men of less than twenty years of age. I admit that is news to me. If you take the number of men under twenty years of age and count them as available for the Expeditionary Force, that will give you a surplus in the Reserve at once. Then the noble Viscount said I had made a great blunder in taking 13,000 drafts leaving the United Kingdom during the trooping season and not counting the drafts returning. It is true you send out 13,000 to India and abroad, and bring others home again, but they are bound to go to the Reserve the moment yon have got them back. Therefore I hold that you must deduct those 13,000 in the way I have done. I asked the noble Viscount whether he considered the men of the Second Class of the Army Reserve fit for the Expeditionary Force. I do not think he has answered that question. As regards the Special Reserve, I think he admits that there are no battalions tit to go abroad now as battalions. That is certainly a very great disadvantage compared with what happened in the old Militia days. Then the noble Viscount expects after the year 1913 to have some rebound in the numbers of his Regular Reserve, but I do not think that that is anticipated to be more than 10,000 men, and as he is losing over 130,000 I think he will still find himself after the year 1913 short in the numbers of the First Class Regular Reserve. I am much obliged to him for his explanations, and I think that the great difference in our tables of figures would arise from the point of age for foreign service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00525"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I only rise to express the hope that the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War will see his way to meet the views of the noble Duke by giving us, in some form in which we can judge of them, the figures which he has so largely quoted. The noble Viscount's military strategy, I have been told by colleagues in the House of Commons, is of the very first Parliamentary order. He involves the House and himself in a cloud of figures, covering his front as it were with so great a cloud of skirmishers that no one knows what operations are going on behind. One hon. member of the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0109"/>
<col>209</col>
House of Commons said to me about the noble Viscount&#x2014;
<quote>"His speeches paralyse our minds, and leave the reporters in tears."</quote>
And he added that they were unable to follow his expressions, and could only come to the conclusion that he was himself perfectly satisfied and that he believed all those who were not satisfied ought to be ashamed of the part they were taking in criticising him.<lb/>
What I feel is that these duels of figures, though they may be necessary, are only useful in so far as they give concrete facts on which we can judge. The noble Viscount has done two things undoubtedly which have tended to increase the Reserve. The first is that the medical measures which have been taken have decreased, at least I hope they have, very largely the wastage in the ranks. And the second great change he has made has been by adding the old Militia to the Reserve, which increases the Reserve largely on paper but by including a number of boys who are immature and insufficiently trained among Regular Reservists. But as regards Regulars everybody knows you cannot get a quart out of a pint bottle. The noble Viscount has decreased the battalions in number and strength, and therefore, except for the medical advantage to which I have referred, he has decreased the output of the Reserve. Nothing can alter that. No actuarial calculations can make his Reserve stronger than the Reserve produced by a much larger force. But what I think is of importance is that we should know what the Reserve is, not in 1913 but the normal. A duel has been going on to-night about 1913, but what we want to know is not what may be our weakness in a given year but what it is we can depend upon under the present system at the normal.<lb/>
I wish to add one word of protest before I sit down. The noble Viscount told the noble Duke that, after all, the whole point was not numbers but the organisation for the purposes of mobilisation. The noble Viscount always speaks as if he had made a study of this organisation, of such an elementary fact as that, for the first time.
<col>210</col>
This is a subject which for the last twenty years has been exercising the minds of successive Secretaries of State for War, and the noble Viscount has lived and flourished on their efforts; he has boasted of the results which they created; he has prided himself on having changed certain conditions and has thrown a very thin gauze over what he has destroyed, especially in the case of the Artillery, which he has had to set up again. Your Lordships pressed him time after time to restore the number of Artillery batteries. We were assured it could not be done, but now it has been done, and the strength of the Reserve in the Artillery in the normal will be entirely due to that. I protest against its being supposed that these subjects are being looked upon for the first time, though I will not say <i>Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona.</i> What we have now I endeavoured to show the other night in a paper which the noble Viscount has. If he challenges those figures, I am ready to argue them at any time; but he must not, of course, take the Arnold-Forster changes which were incomplete, without giving him credit for undertaking what he had in mind to do. I ask the noble Viscount to adopt a fair estimate and give us figures of which we can judge. That, I think, would put an end to these discussions and exchanges of broadsides of figures, which are very difficult to follow and which do not instruct the public as we desire they should be instructed as to the strength of the Army.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HOUSE OF LORDS RECONSTITUTION BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00563"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member> rose to present a Bill to amend the constitution of the House of Lords. The noble Marquess said: My Lords, I have once again to apologise to your Lordships for the delay which has taken place in the presentation of this Bill, and I feel sure that your Lordships will have given me, and will give me to-night, the indulgence which I ask at your hands. Before I endeavour to explain to the House the provisions of this Bill, I think I ought to say a few words to account for the fact that we are producing a Bill at all. For I am certainly disposed to say that while it is, as a general rule, the duty of the Opposition to criticise the proposals of His Majesty's Government, and perhaps to put forward in outline a policy of their own, they are not called upon, in ordinary circumstances, to offer alternative legislation of their own. The reasons are easy to state. The Opposition has not the same facilities for preparing an intricate and comprehensive Bill as have the Government. They know, they may rest pretty well assured, that their Bill is not very likely to become law; and, besides that, there are prudential considerations of a very obvious kind which render the Opposition reluctant to offer, in the shape of a full measure, with its sections, subsections and schedules, a target to the criticism of their political opponents. Therefore I should be much inclined to hold with what was said by my noble friend Lord Rosebery a few weeks ago, when he told us that in his view, particularly when the question was one of constitutional change, it was for the Government and not for the Opposition to take the initiative.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00564">But, my Lords, this is not by any mears an ordinary case. The situation which confronts us is a most extraordinary situation&#x2014;a situation created by the conduct of His Majesty's Government in dealing with this great constitutional question. His Majesty's Government have, from the first, admitted that a measure of House of Lords reform was necessary and desirable. Their whole case arises from their complaint that this House, because it has not been reformed, has obstructed the action of the House of Commons and has been an insurmountable barrier, as they say, in the way of useful legislation. And in the Speech delivered from the Throne by his late Majesty last year they bracketed
<col>216</col>
together as interdependent subjects the two questions of the reform of the constitution of this House and the amendment of the procedure to be followed between the two Houses incase of differences arising between them. But although they made this initial admission, they now persist in dealing separately with the two branches of the case. And in this they have, I will say, been consistent, for I think the House will recollect that as long ago as 1907, when the Bill of my noble friend Lord Newton was before the House, and when the late Lord Cawdor moved for the appointment of a Committee to inquire into the whole subject, the noble Earl the Leader of the House, whose absence we all so much regret, made use of these memorable words&#x2014;
<quote>"It is inexpedient to proceed with the discussion&#x2014;</quote>
even with the discussion&#x2014;
<quote>"of various proposals for reforming the constitution of this House until provision has been made for an effective method of settling the differences which may arise between this House and the other House of Parliament."</quote>
And he even went the length of cautioning us against allowing ourselves to suppose that anything which the Committee could do, any recommendation which the Committee might make, could have the slightest effect upon the proposals of His Majesty's Government as to the relations between the two Houses. To that position, a thoroughly illogical position, as I venture to think, His Majesty's Government still adhere. They desire, we understand, that the two questions shall be separately treated. They hold that no change in the constitution of this House ought to be allowed to affect its relations with the House of Commons, and they are thereby led to the extraordinary conclusion that the House which they hive denounced on account of its constitution is to remain unreformed and with powers which are excessive if this House is as untrustworthy as noble Lords opposite would have us believe, and which are derisory if they are measured by the standard of the powers enjoyed by Second Chambers in any other civilized community in the world.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00565">Our position is a wholly different one. We are convinced that no lasting settlement, no balanced reform of the Constitution, is possible except with a reconstituted Second Chamber; and we hold that the amendment of the constitution of this House should proceed as far as possible <i>pari passu</i> with a reform of the relations between the two
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0113"/>
<col>217</col>
Houses. Indeed, I should almost venture to go further and to say that, if one of those questions is entitled to priority over the other, the reform of this House should come first, because, surely, it is impossible to decide what sort of powers, what sort of authority you shall give to any Assembly, until you have some idea, at all events, of the manner in which that Assembly is going to be composed. We hold, further, that if there should be any interval between the treatment of the two branches of the subject, that interval should be as short as possible, and that, while it lasts, and while the Constitutional machinery is, so to speak, out of gear, the country should be amply safeguarded against the passage of any reckless or ill-considered legislation. It was considerations of this kind that led an overwhelming majority of your Lordships' House to support the Resolutions moved by Lord Rosebery last autumn. Those Resolutions marked an epoch in the discussion. I will not now recapitulate them, but I may remind the House that they affirmed two main propositions&#x2014;in the first place, the proposition that, in our view, no Lord of Parliament should be allowed to sit and vote in this House merely on account of his hereditary right to a seat upon these Benches, and, in the second place, that it was desirable that this House should be strengthened and reinforced by the addition of new elements from outside. Throughout the General Election we affirmed that policy, and, now that the General Election is over, we desire to affirm it again, and to let the people of this country understand that we have no intention of receding from the position which we took up. I am tempted to say, in passing, that I think we have some right to complain of the manner in which our proposals were met by noble Lords opposite and their friends, because almost in the same breath they derided them as being of the most frivolous and unsubstantial nature, and also described them as being even more revolutionary than anything which they had proposed themselves. We desire now, by embodying our policy in a Bill, to lay it, chapter and verse, before the country and to show that a reform of this House upon reasonable lines is possible and, I hope also, that this House itself is not unwilling to undertake the task.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00566">We found the duty which we had undertaken a somewhat perplexing one.
<col>218</col>
It is quite clear, when you are dealing with what is usually described as a composite Chamber, that there must be any amount of room for variety of treatment in the grouping of the materials which are ready to your hand. That is naturally the case in this instance. Perhaps I may add that we had at any rate no reason to complain of lack of advice as to the manner in which we might deal with the problem. Constitution-making has a singular fascination for a great many people, and I have myself received innumerable suggestions, varying from proposals indicating the most grim tenacity on the part of those who made them, to proposals animated by an almost pathetic desire to immolate this House root and branch upon the shrine of public duty. We cannot in those circumstances hope to please everyone, and I should certainly despair of being able to construct an umbrella wide enough to cover, let us say, my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury, who is not here to-night, and my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke, who is on the Bench behind me. But I am somewhat consoled by the anticipation that, whenever noble Lords opposite come to make a similar attempt, they will find not less difficulty in discovering a refuge which shall be capable of accommodating, let us say, my noble friend Lord Courtney of Penwith, Mr. Barnes, and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00567">May I then say one word as to the principle on which we have proceeded in this Bill? We desire to provide the country with an appropriate and efficient Second Chamber, and it is, perhaps, worth while considering for a moment what is the place of such a Chamber in the political system of the country. I notice that some people apparently have for their ideal a Second Chamber which shall be, as it were, the corrective of the House of Commons, which shall be Conservative when the House of Commons is Radical, which shall be imbued with Radicalism when the House of Commons is Conservative. That seems to me, I must say, a very Utopian idea. I doubt whether any human ingenuity could contrive a Chamber which would approach to an ideal of that kind, and if you could contrive such a Second Chamber I cannot help thinking that the results would be, not only inconvenient, but disastrous. For let it be noted that one of the main grievances alleged against the system which now prevails is that when
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0114"/>
<col>219</col>
you have a Liberal House of Commons that House is obstructed and thwarted by a Conservative majority in this place. If you could add to that an arrangement by which when there was a Conservative majority in the House of Commons there should be a Radical preponderance in this House you would, surely, be merely duplicating the grievances of which complaint is made at present. Then it is sometimes suggested that we ought to seek for a Second Chamber which would be, as it were, merely a pale replica of the other House, always of the same political complexion, always ready to approve what it does. Again I would remind your Lordships that the other great grievance alleged against the present system is that when you have a Conservative majority in both Houses you have virtually single-Chamber government. Now should we improve matters by an arrangement which would produce not only a Conservative Second Chamber to say ditto to the House of Commons when the latter happened to be mainly Conservative, but a Radical Second Chamber which would when there was a Radical majority in the House of Commons, give that majority its support&#x2014;an arrangement which would, in a word, produce single-Chamber government, whatever the complexion of either House of Parliament might be?</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00568">Our ideal of a Second Chamber is, I think, a truer one. We desire to have one so composed that it will command the confidence of the country by its ability, its experience, its authority, and, above all, by its independence. We desire a Second Chamber which can be trusted to use its powers fairly as between the two great political Parties. We desire that it should be in close touch with popular opinion, but not that it should be at the mercy of popular caprice. We desire that it should not be strong enough to resist the House of Commons when the House of Commons represents the deliberate judgment of the country, but that it should be strong enough to make a stand when there is reason to believe that the country has not had an opportunity of expressing its will clearly and deliberately. Such a House we have endeavoured to construct&#x2014;not upon a site from which every shred and vestige of the old structure has been removed, but preserving the soundest materials which we can find on that site, strengthened and rearranged, so that the
<col>220</col>
new Chamber, while faithfully serving the democracy, will be strong enough to resist the gusts of passion and prejudice with which all democracies are necessarily familiar.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00569">At this point may I be allowed to say that a Second Chamber framed upon these lines must necessarily be incompatible with the idea of one dependent purely upon popular election. In a popularly-elected Second Chamber there can be no room, as we hope there will be room in our Second Chamber, for a section of Lords of Parliament drawn from the present House of Lords; and, moreover, a popularly-elected Second Chamber will certainly claim what we do not claim for our Second Chamber, full co-ordinate rights in all respects with the House of Commons.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00570">Our scheme, then, is based upon these conditions. In the first place, we suggest that there should be a large reduction in the number of the present House. I believe it is common ground to all of those who have paid attention to the question of House of Lords reform that the present House is far too numerous to do its work efficiently. I believe that if this House has lost authority in the country it is in no slight degree owing to the reckless manner in which from time to time large additions have been made to its ranks. The hereditary principle may be not very easy to understand, but it becomes absolutely unintelligible when you find an indiscriminate increase of hereditary Peerages without any reference whatever to the efficiency of the House as part of our legislative machinery. My Lords, we propose that the strength of the new House shall correspond more nearly to what I would call the effective strength of the working House of Lords as we know it, and that it should consist in round numbers of 350 Lords of Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00571">I proceed to describe how we suggest that the House should be composed. The governing factor in these matters is the Resolution of my noble friend Lord Rosebery, to which I referred a moment ago, that the possession of a Peerage should no longer by itself give the right to sit and vote in this House. I may be asked, Does this involve the abandonment of the hereditary principle? I think that question may with limitations be answered in the affirmative, and that we are prepared to say that no Peer shall henceforth sit in this House unless he can produce credentials other
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0115"/>
<col>221</col>
than the possession of a hereditary Peerage. Why is it that we have thus abandoned the hereditary principle? Not, I would say, because there is nothing to be said in defence of it. I have heard many excellent speeches in defence of the hereditary principle, but I will not attempt to deal with that subject now. Nor, again, do we take this course because we admit that the hereditary Peerage has abused its privilege by the manner in which it has dealt with the legislation which comes before it. I do not believe that a more flimsy indictment has ever been put forward than the indictment of this House on the charge of habitual obstruction of useful legislation. I believe that before any educated audience it would be possible to show convincingly&#x2014;I will not say that in every case the decision of this House was a correct or desirable decision&#x2014;but that our action in every case fell well within the limits of the discretion which any Second Chamber must have if it is to do its duty as part of the Constitution.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00572">My Lords, I remain deeply convinced that the real cause of the complaint brought against us is not that we have rejected, or I should more properly say reserved, certain measures for the consideration of the country, but that being hereditary Peers, and hereditary Peers only, we availed ourselves of our privileges as such in order to exercise the Constitutional rights which belong to us, and I believe that if you have been able, as you have, successfully, to work up a great body of prejudice against this House in the country, your success has been due not to deep-seated dissatisfaction with anything which we have actually done, but to the not unintelligible suspicion with which a purely hereditary Assembly is looked upon in a democratic community such as ours. And I myself certainly voted for my noble friend Lord Rosebery's Resolutions with the consciousness that in a country governed as ours is, a Second Chamber based either in regard to the whole, or even in regard to part of its members, upon hereditary privilege alone, unsupported by any other qualification, would always be so handicapped, so hopelessly handicapped, and so exposed to misrepresentation that it would be impossible for it to play its proper part in the Constitution of the country. We therefore realise, not only that this House must, be no longer purely hereditary, but that no part or proportion of its members shall owe their right to sit
<col>222</col>
and vote in it to heredity alone. But, my Lords, these considerations are certainly not inconsistent with the retention in the new Second Chamber of an element which shall maintain continuity between the old House and the new. We believe that there is a great body of conservative opinion in this country which would greatly resent the obliteration of one of the Estates of the Realm; and, apart from that, we hold strongly that there is to be found within this House a great reserve of experience and knowledge and ability&#x2014;a reserve which it would be folly to cast on one side, and which contributes to the solution of this question materials which it would be madness to scrap and to discard. It is therefore in our opinion desirable, both on the merits as well as for reasons of sentiment, that the new House should contain a section directly connected with the House as we know it to-day. And by that I mean not merely a few survivors who, when the roll is called, will come to this Table because they have been chosen by some body outside or nominated by the Minister of the day, but who shall owe their presence here to the suffrages of their brother Peers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00573">But, my Lords, I must explain that in our view the choice of the Peers ought not to be an unrestricted choice, We propose that only those Peers shall be eligible who possess certain statutory qualifications, the possession of which, added to election by their fellow Peers, will leave no room for doubt as to their fitness to take part in the business of this House. We think that an arrangement of this kind will be on the whole preferable to an arrangement under which a certain section of the House would be entitled to sit in it by virtue of qualification and qualification alone. We considered that alternative, and it is certainly one not without superficial attractiveness. The number of Peers who have written their names in the history of this country is considerable, and their title to a place on these Benches would certainly not be challenged. But there is undoubtedly, if you are going to rely on qualification alone, if you are to say that, certain persons are to be entitled to sit and vote merely because they hold or have held certain high positions, very great difficulty to be encountered. Where, in the first place, are you to draw the line? What amount of eminence in civil, military, or political, or professional life is to entitle a Peer to this distinction? It must
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0116"/>
<col>223</col>
be remembered that wherever you draw the line, whether you draw it high or low, you can scarcely fail to admit some members who, although meritorious, will not necessarily be the most efficient additions that we could make to the House, and whose admission would exclude younger, perhaps less conspicuous, but more active, enterprising, and useful candidates. Moreover, there is this observation to be added. If you are to rely on qualification alone, you are almost inevitably driven to give your qualified Peers a seat for life in this House. Their qualification is there and remains with them while they live.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00574">It is, however, part of our scheme that, with a trifling exception, no Peer should hold his seat in this House as a Lord of Parliament for more than twelve years, although the term of twelve years does not prevent him from being re-elected. There is this further objection to setting up a category based upon qualification alone&#x2014;namely, that if you begin by marking off, let us say, fifty of the most eminent members of this House, and saying that they shall as of right be entitled to seats, you then call upon the body of the House to proceed to elect from a list from which a great many of the mostdistinguished and representative personages have already been subtracted. That, we think, would be an unfortunate result, and we desire to avoid it. All these objections disappear if, instead of relying on qualification alone, we arrange that the Peers who are to be elected by the members of this House shall be elected subject to the possession of certain qualifications. We have accordingly prepared a schedule, which will be found in the Bill: a schedule enumerating the different qualifications, which we have drawn, as we believe, somewhat liberally.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00575">I will not trouble the House with the schedule <i>in extenso,</i> but perhaps I may say that we include in it Peers who hold or have held political office, and not only the highest political office, but minor political offices; for example, those offices which carry with them the representation of a public Department in either House of Parliament. Then, of course, we include appointments at home and abroad, and not only Viceroys and Governors-General, or Governors and High Commissioners, but the Governors of Presidencies in India, the Lieutenant-Governors of Provinces, as well as Chief Commissioners, and political Residents of the first class. We also include
<col>224</col>
membership of the Privy Council and all who have been elected to the House of Commons. In the Diplomatic Service we admit those who have held the rank of Minister Plenipotentiary or higher rank. We admit members of the Army Council and of the Board of Admiralty. In the Services we accept as a qualification the rank in the Navy of Captain, and in the Army of Colonel on the Active List. In the Civil Service we admit permanent heads of Departments, and, lastly, and I think this is important, we propose that it shall be a sufficient qualification that a Peer shall have held the office of Lord Mayor or Provost of a city, Chairman of a County Council, or Chairman of Quarter Sessions, and also Lords Lieutenant of Counties. Obviously the question of these qualifications is one for discussion. The list can easily be extended if necessary; and there is this also to be borne in mind, that the number of qualified Peers is almost certain to increase as time goes on. For this reason, that when members of your Lordships' House become aware that the holding of, let us say, the office of Mayor of a city carries with it a qualification to be elected to this House, they will probably become even more ambitious of these municipal honours than they are at the present time. This section of the House we propose should number 100 members. We propose for them a tenure of twelve years, subject, of course, to reelection. We propose that they shall be elected by the whole body of Peers under a system of minority representation prescribed by Order in Council and based on what is known as the single transferable vote.</p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00577"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Certainly. We are led to believe that our schedule is so drawn that it will include something like 300 members of this House as qualified for election by their brother Peers. Of these 100 Peers we propose that 25 should retire triennially, and that of the original 100 members 25 shall retire at the end of three years, 25 more at the end of six years, and 25 more at the end of nine years, so that the rotation may be properly established, and may proceed smoothly when once the machinery, so to speak, is set going.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0117"/>
<col>225</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00578"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: The first 25 will only sit for three years?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00579"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Yes, and the Peers who will thus retire before the completion of their full term of 12 years will be chosen by ballot. We make this recommendation not only on the sentimental ground that it will maintain a connection between the present House of Lords and the reconstituted Chamber, but in the firm belief that we shall, in this manner, obtain a contingent of Lords of Parliament who will be eminently fitted to take their share in the work of Parliament.<lb/>
I pass, then, to the second section. The second section is the section which will be&#x2014;to use the words of my noble friend&#x2014;"chosen from outside the House." We desire that it shall be chosen by machinery in close touch with, and sensitive of, public opinion. Now how is this section to be provided? We considered some alternatives only in order to set them on one side. We do not believe that it would be desirable for this purpose to have recourse to direct election under some bran-new system involving new areas and new constituencies. We should obtain, in this manner, a duplication of the other House of Parliament; and we certainly prefer to rely on areas with which we are familiar and on machinery which we find ready to hand. Nor, my Lords, do we suggest that these Lords of Parliament should be chosen by direct election by the present constituencies. We see no object in asking them first to elect members of the other House of Parliament and then to select, as it were, a second and smaller body of members for the purpose of checking the proceedings of the House of Commons. Moreover, such a scheme would obviously involve the grouping of the present Parliamentary constituencies into constituencies of vast magnitude: constituencies the size of which would impose upon the candidates an intolerable burden both of expense and of personal exertion. We therefore dismissed that proposal also.<lb/>
We found ourselves in the end driven to choose between two alternative plans. In the first place, we considered whether it might not be possible that this section of the House should be chosen by indirect election through the county and borough councils. The kind of scheme that we had in our minds, was that these great municipal
<col>226</col>
bodies should choose from their own ranks electoral colleges, and that these colleges again should choose members of your Lordships' House. But we found one fatal objection to this proposal. The county councils undoubtedly owe a great part of the high esteem in which they are held to the fact that they have&#x2014;I will not say completely, but to a very great extent&#x2014;been able to keep themselves clear of political entanglements, and we came to the conclusion that, however carefully we might guard our proposals, there would be a serious risk, if we imposed this duty on county and borough councils, of, as it were, inviting them to take part in Party politics from which they have, fortunately, to a great extent, kept clear up to the present time. In these circumstances we are led to the plan which I will proceed to describe to your Lordships.<lb/>
Under this Bill, if it becomes law, Commissioners will be appointed. It will be their duty to prepare schemes dividing the country into electoral districts. They will be instructed to have regard to population and area, to boundaries of counties and county boroughs, to existing Parliamentary constituencies, and to community of interests. With these considerations before them they will proceed to prepare a scheme providing for the election of not less than three and not more than twelve Lords of Parliament for each of the electoral districts. These schemes will have to lie on the Tables of both Houses of Parliament for thirty days. We propose that the Lords of Parliament thus chosen shall number 120; and I may perhaps point out that if you take the population of these islands as probably something like 45,000,000, that will give one Lord of Parliament for every 375,000 of the population.<lb/>
Now I come to the mode of election of these 120 Lords of Parliament. We propose to set up for each electoral district an electoral college, and we propose that that college shall be composed of the members of the House of Commons representing constituencies comprised within the limits of the electoral district. I may point out one obvious advantage, at all events, which this mode of procedure possesses. You have your electoral college already in existence. It is there ready to hand. You are not obliged to create any new body for the purpose. And, moreover, you have a body which&#x2014;and I am sure I shall not be contradicted in this by noble Lords opposite
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0118"/>
<col>227</col>
&#x2014;may be taken as fairly reflecting the popular opinion of the electoral district. Each college thus formed will return its quota of Lords of Parliament, a quota which, as I explained just now, must not be less than three and may not be more than twelve Lords of Parliament. The procedure will be regulated by Order in Council, and will be based on proportional representation and the single transferable vote. The tenure of these Lords of Parliament also will be for twelve years, and in this case also we propose a system of triennial retirements, as we do in the case of the Peers chosen by this House. We claim for our plan that, whatever its demerits, it is, at any rate, a very simple one, a very cheap, and, I think I may add, a very democratic one.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I come to the third section. The third section will number 100, and for that section we propose to rely on appointment by the Crown, of course on the recommendation of the Minister; and this section will be chosen either from inside or from outside the House. The reasons for resorting to nomination are, I think, of a kind that are entitled to some weight. The idea of nomination, of course, is one with which we are already familiar. Then again, a Lord of Parliament nominated by the Minister must obviously be held to have a democratic title to his seat in the House. But there are other reasons. I am not aware of any other plan which will afford the same opportunity of recognising merit or conspicuous service in any branch of public life. I know of no other plan which would so easily render it possible to provide in this House for the representation of great interests at present unrepresented. And there is also this incidental advantage, that as the choice of these nominated Peers will take place after the election of the first section by your Lordships' House, and after the election of the second section by the electoral colleges, it will be possible in choosing the nominated Peers to make good any omissions, or to correct any oversights which may have taken place in the choice of the first two classes.<lb/>
But I think the chief advantage of this plan of nomination is that it will greatly assist us to constitute this House fairly as between the two political Parties. We propose to effect our object in the following manner. We propose that these 100 nominated Peers shall be chosen for recommendation to the Crown in the same manner as the Select Committees of the
<col>228</col>
House of Commons are now chosen&#x2014;that is, with regard to the strength of Parties in the House. I think I had better read the actual words in order that there may be no doubt as to our intention in this respect. The clause will run thus&#x2014;
<quote>"The names of 100 persons chosen in proportion to the strength of Parties in the House of Commons at the time, shall be submitted to His Majesty for appointment, and in the selection of such persons regard shall be had to the manner in which Select Committees in the House of Commons are at present nominated."</quote>
Many noble Lords who are listening to me have a knowledge of the House of Commons to which I do not pretend, and they will probably understand, without difficulty, how this arrangement will work. I understand that what happens is that the representatives of the two Parties come together, they agree that the relative strength of the Parties is such and such, and they thereupon fill up the Committee in that proportion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00580"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: But there are four Parties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00581"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend says, very properly, there are four Parties. It would not at all dismay me if the result of our proposal was that we had in this House, not only representatives of the two great Parties, but of the two other Parties on whom noble Lords opposite depend for so large a measure of their support. It will be obvious to your Lordships that the result of this arrangement would be that each Party will leave its impress upon this House, and that the depth of this impress would depend upon the strength of each Party and upon the length of its tenure of office. And it also follows that that impress would continue even after a great political change leading to the disappearance of the Government of the day. There would remain for a time after the change of Government a residuum of Lords of Parliament representing the outgoing Government, and so it would come to pass that the pendulum would swing less violently in this House than outside it. This section of the reconstituted House would also sit for twelve years, and the triennial retirements would proceed on the same plan as that which I have indicated in reference to the other sections.<lb/>
Those are the three main categories, but there are three smaller categories which I must notice. In the first place, the Princes
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0119"/>
<col>229</col>
of the Blood will retain their seats as at present. In the second place, we think it right and proper that the Lords Spiritual should be represented in the reconstituted House. I can give many reasons why this should be the case, and I can think of no reason against the proposal. The Lords Spiritual are an Estate of the Realm. Their historical title to sit here is unimpeachable. They represent a profession which is barred from sitting in the House of Commons, and I do not think anyone will contradict me when I say that their position in this House is not only a very dignified, but a very useful one. In the discussion of a great many subjects they are able to speak with a knowledge and a practical experience to which few of us can pretend. They are all of them what I should describe as efficient members of this House, and I do not think even the most disrespectful caricaturists have ever ventured to portray such a thing as a backwoodsman in lawn sleeves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00582"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: How many Lords Spiritual?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00583"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: We propose that the two Archbishops should sit as of right and that there should be five Bishops elected by the full body of the Archbishops and Bishops under Order in Council, with triennial retirement.<lb/>
There remain what we generally describe as the Law Lords. Our proposal is that a Peer who holds or has held any office described as a high judicial office under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876, and the Amending Act of 1887 shall be a Lord of Parliament during his life. Under this scheme the Lord Chancellor, the ex-Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, ex-Law Officers who are <i>ex officio</i> members of the Appellate Court, and the four Peers appointed under the Acts which I have quoted would sit in this House. The Law Lords would number altogether sixteen. I have now given your Lordships a full account of the composition of the new House. If I may recapitulate, it would consist of 100 Lords chosen by the Peers themselves, 120 Lords chosen by the electoral colleges, and 100 Lords nominated by the Crown, on the advice of the Minister after consultation, in regard to a certain number of them, with the Leaders of the Opposition.<lb/>
There are other provisions in the Bill, but time only permits me to notice two
<col>230</col>
of them. There is an important clause under which we propose that Peers not Lords of Parliament shall be allowed to sit in the House of Commons. The obvious fairness of that proposal will, I think, be clear to your Lordships. There may be many Peers who may not be chosen, or who, for reasons of their own, may prefer to stand for the House of Commons. And it would be a very great hardship to prevent them. My three noble friends who sit behind me [Lords Curzon, Selborne, and Midleton] have all of them been in their day strong advocates of the proposed opening of the doors of the House of Commons to the Peerage, and they may perhaps regard with satisfaction the fact that the policy of which they were the pioneers should, in our view, be allowed to prevail. But I hope they will allow me to add that, so far as they are personally concerned, I trust that they will regard the idea <i>mutatis animis,</i> for it would be dreadful for us on this side of the House to contemplate their simultaneous migration to another place.<lb/>
The only other clause which I need mention is one under which we propose that after the passing of this Act it shall not be lawful to confer the dignity of a hereditary Peerage on more than five persons in any one year. I indicated the other day our reasons for making this proposal. All I need now add is that we propose to make an exception in favour of Cabinet or ex-Cabinet Ministers, whose presence may be indispensable in this House, and whom the Government of the day may desire to appoint in excess of the limit of five. That is in outline the scheme of the Bill. We believe that it would produce a Second Chamber, efficient, with unimpeachable credentials, and constituted fairly between the two great Parties.<lb/>
We have been generally told whenever we have discussed suggestions of this kind that we were careful to keep this House as what is generally called a "Tory preserve." I remember Lord Crewe, the Leader of the House, in one of those phrases which he turns very aptly, telling us across the Table that he gathered that we wished our victory to be more creditable but equally certain. I should like to ask any candid member of this House whether with a House of Lords such as I have endeavoured to describe our victory would be equally certain. The composition of the House would, of course, necessarily and
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0120"/>
<col>231</col>
properly fluctuate according to the fluctuations of political opinion. But let us see how this scheme would work, supposing, for the sake of argument, it were applied at once. I will take the first category&#x2014;Peers elected by members of this House. In that section we should of course have a large majority. I think it may probably be taken as a majority of something like four to one. But that is on the assumption that every Unionist Peer makes up his mind to choose only Conservative stalwarts, and that I must say is an assumption which I for one should be very slow to make. I am strongly under the impression, particularly with the limited choice before them, that this House would choose many Peers who would not only be amongst the ablest, but also amongst the most independent members of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
May I give an illustration of my meaning? I would rather not talk about people who are here present. But I will mention the name of one who is no longer with us&#x2014;the late Duke of Devonshire. I will undertake to say that if this system were in force, and if the late Duke of Devonshire were still with us, his name would probably figure on the list sent in by nearly every member sitting on this side of the House. The Duke of Devonshire was a man who never allowed Party considerations to outweigh the high principles for which he was so conspicuous; and it would not be very difficult to think of other members of this House who in the same circumstances would probably act in the same manner. Let us, however, take the hereditary section elected by this House as giving 20 for the Government and 80 for the Opposition. The nominated section, if it be nominated with reference to numerical strength of the Parties in the other House, would give the Government 59 and the Opposition 41. And if, which is not unfair, you take the same proportion for the section of Lords of Parliament chosen by the electoral colleges, that would give you, unless I am mistaken, 72 to the Government and 48 to the Opposition. That leaves us with a majority of 18&#x2014;not, I venture to say, a very large majority for a body whose duty is admittedly the duty of revision and delay.<lb/>
And, my Lords, are we quite sure that we could always depend on that majority? I doubt greatly myself whether there would be anything which could be fairly described
<col>232</col>
as a standing Party majority in such a House. I have known this House for a great many years, and I am inclined to believe that with a House reconstituted as we propose&#x2014;a smaller House carefully selected, evenly balanced, with heavier responsibility&#x2014;you would find that what I may fairly describe as the Cross-Bench mind would very often prevail. And not only so. Are you quite sure that our majority of 18 would always endure? The composition of the House would, of course, vary with fluctuations in the strength of political Parties, and if you remain long enough in office, and with sufficiently large majorities, our majority, under conceivable circumstances which might arise, may even disappear altogether. I press this point because I wish to convince the House and above all to convince noble Lords opposite that we have endeavoured to draw our scheme as fairly as may be between the two Parties.<lb/>
I add one other observation. Supposing that we retain a majority, and supposing that we use that majority, as you may say, perversely, and for the purpose of obstructing the other House of Parliament, the remedy lies ready to your hand. You can fall back upon conferences of which you are all in favour, for I notice that noble Lords opposite and their friends invariably speak with the highest approval of procedure by conference. In the Campbell-Bannerman Resolutions there were conferences at every stage, and the only reason, we understand, why you do not now propose conferences in your Bill is that you think they can be sufficiently provided for without special legislation. That is not all. There are also Joint Sittings, of which you are also in favour in principle, but which the Prime Minister has explained to us are now impossible because of the unwieldy proportions of the unreformed House of Lords. That is the obstacle in the way; we remove that obstacle and the Joint Sitting becomes a perfectly practicable and easy way for dealing with the ordinary class of difference which may arise between the two Houses. And finally there is the Referendum&#x2014;the Referendum which the Prime Minister is careful to explain he does not exclude in cases&#x2014;I forget what the exact expressions are&#x2014;in rare and exceptional cases. It is, however, only for such cases that we desire to see the Referendum used, and therefore we are agreed
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0121"/>
<col>233</col>
that that also is a conceivable solution. Therefore, our small majority need inspire you with no alarm. If it presumes too much, if it runs counter to the deliberate view of the House of Commons, if it opposes the will of the country, you have ample means for wheeling it into line and securing that the judgment of the people shall prevail.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00584"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: May. I ask whether there are in the Bill any proposals for the Referendum, or concerning Joint Sessions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00585"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Not in the Bill, certainly; but the noble Viscount will remember that we very clearly explained our views upon another occasion in regard to those important subjects.<lb/>
We submit our scheme for the consideration of the country, but first and foremost we lay it before your Lordships' House; and we realise what a serious demand it is that we are about to make upon you. We are under no illusions as to the gravity of the change which a Bill of this kind will bring about. It will bring about a complete transformation of this House as we know it&#x2014;a drastic interference with the privileges of individual Peers. To some I am afraid these proposals will come as a rude shock; by others, I am afraid, they will be deeply resented. To some they will almost present the appearance of a betrayal. But I do hope that many members of your Lordships' House will recognise that in the interest of the stability of our institutions, never threatened as they are at this moment, in the interest of the proper balance of our Constitution, never before in a condition of such unstable equilibrium, some changes of the kind which we recommend have become inevitable. Some members of the House who are unable to attend regularly to our business may, perhaps, find in proposals of this sort something in the nature of an extrication and a relief; others, again, more enterprising and ambitious, may welcome a change which will open for them the prospect of a seat obtained not by the accident of birth, but due either to the choice of their fellow Peers, or to the selection of the electoral colleges, or to the recommendation of the Leaders of their own Party. But in spite of all this, this Bill, were it to become law, would beyond doubt be a death-blow to the House of Lords as many of us have known it for so long,
<col>234</col>
and I say unfeignedly that I could have wished that it had fallen to the lot of one who owes less than I do to the indulgence of this House to lay these proposals before you. At any rate, this is our contribution to the solution of the momentous Constitutional question which the country has to solve. It may be an imperfect solution&#x2014;I dare say it is. It may be open to criticism. We shall welcome criticism. But it is not a negligible contribution. It certainly does not lie in the mouth of noble Lords opposite to describe it as a negligible contribution.<lb/>
May I remind your Lordships of words which fell from the Leader of this House when in November last my noble friend. Lord Rosebery moved his second series of Resolutions. Lord Rosebery asked us to agree that for the future this House should consist of Lords of Parliament (1) chosen by the hereditary Peers from among themselves and by nomination by the Crown; (2) sitting by virtue of office and qualifications; (3) chosen from outside. Upon this Lord Crewe made these observations&#x2014;
<quote>"I think there is a great deal to be said in support of all the propositions advanced by my noble friend, and I think it is exceedingly probable that when the House of Lords is reformed some or all of them may become elements in its new constitution."</quote>
It is abundantly clear, therefore, that Lord Crewe&#x2014;and he was, no doubt, speaking for his colleagues&#x2014;had in his mind not a purely elective Second Chamber, but a composite House constructed somewhat upon the lines which we have indicated.<lb/>
I trust, therefore, that when the noble Viscount opposite follows me he will not merely cavil at our scheme, but give us some enlightenment as to the proposals which His Majesty's Government would desire to put in its place. We should like to know what kind of a Second Chamber the Government have in their minds. It is surely time that they contributed something to the discussion of this question. How much longer is this conspiracy of silence to be prolonged? We have had no contribution up to the present unless it be the speech of His late Majesty to which I referred a moment ago, or the Preamble of the Parliament Bill, a Preamble which should, I think, be read by the light of a recent statement made by one of the noble Viscount's colleagues to the effect
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0122"/>
<col>235</col>
that House of Lords reform was a very unimportant matter except as a means to an end&#x2014;the passage of Liberal measures through Parliament. That has been their contribution, coupled with a few hazy pledges given by different Ministers that at some convenient time, not to be particularly specified, they intend to take up the question of House of Lords reform.<lb/>
But I own I am a little more hopeful to-night than I should have been a few days ago, for I notice that only on Saturday night the Prime Minister informed his hearers that His Majesty's Government intended, if time permitted, to deal with this question of House of Lords reform within the limits of the present Parliament. Well, if that is the case, if they really do intend to deal with House of Lords reform within the limits of this Parliament, surely they must have some ideas upon the subject; surely their minds cannot be in that condition of absolute blank which one might have supposed from their total failure to grapple with the subject. His Majesty's Government are experts in Constitution building. They have provided some of our great Dominions beyond the seas with Constitutions of which they are notoriously proud. Can they not bestow a little of their knowledge and ingenuity upon the reform of the Constitution of these islands? Can they not impart to us even the barest outline of the principles upon which their measure of reform is likely to be founded? I say at once that if this silence is maintained we shall tell you that the reason you do not disclose your plan is that you have no plan to disclose; you do not ring the bells because the steeple is empty; and we shall believe that you are still hesitating between an elective Second Chamber, which would be inevitably entitled to co-ordinate powers with the House of Commons, and a composite Second Chamber of the kind which we favour and with the limitations which we are ready to accept.<lb/>
The production of this Bill should at any rate have this one effect&#x2014;it will deprive you of all excuse for keeping the country any longer in the dark as to your proposals. The Prime Minister, in the speech to which I referred a moment ago, went the length of saying that he was unaware of the views of the Opposition upon this question of House of Lords reform. His Majesty's Government will now be fully aware of the views of the Opposition. It is a
<col>236</col>
singular complaint, I think, for the Prime Minister to make, because if any one had to make a complaint it was surely for us to complain of the reticence of His Majesty's Government rather than for His Majesty's Government to complain of our reticence. Our scheme is now before His Majesty's Government and before the country. We have accepted your challenge; surely it is time for you to accept ours, and to lay your proposals alongside of ours before the Parliament and the people of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00586">Moved, That the Bill be now read 1<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;<i>(The Marquess of Lansdowne.)</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00587"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that we all congratulate the noble Marquess upon his restoration to our counsels, and we cannot but admire the way in which he has, to use an expression of my own the other night, done justice to the proposals which he had to lay before your Lordships. The field is enormous; the complexity and intricacy of the details are very marked; and yet the language of the noble Marquess has been precise, lucid, and apt; and we owe him a great debt for placing the scheme before us in this way. I do not go for a moment into the point&#x2014;a point mentioned by the noble Marquess himself&#x2014;whether he was pursuing the counsels of tactical prudence in producing a Bill at all; still less do I follow him in his difference from my noble friend on the Cross Benches (Lord Rosebery) as to the propriety or impropriety of a member of the Opposition coming forward with proposals of this magnitude and importance instead of leaving it to the Government. These things are really of secondary consequence.<lb/>
The real thing, and what makes to-night a most remarkable date in the history of our Constitution, is what the noble Marquess himself said in that very impressive conclusion of his speech, that he regretted that it had fallen to him, of all members of this House, to deal a death-blow to the existence of the House of Lords as he and others have known it. I thoroughly understand and respect and to some extent sympathise with the noble Marquess. I find no fault whatever with him for bringing forward this Bill. I think he has taken a bold course, and a frank course, and one that may prove to be, as he desires it
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0123"/>
<col>237</col>
should be, a helpful course. The noble Marquess expressly assured us of the good faith in which he has brought forward these proposals. I, for one, have no doubt whatever&#x2014;and I believe all who sit around me will feel the same&#x2014;of the good faith of the noble Marquess in doing his best by the framing and production of this Bill to preserve&#x2014;to create&#x2014;a body representing what he would call the steadying elements in our national character, national life, and national institutions. I give him entire credit for that. I am sorry, however, that the noble Marquess began with what I must call, with all respect to him, one of the worst bits of history it has ever been my fortune to come across. The noble Marquess asked what had created this situation&#x2014;the situation which had compelled him to deal a death-blow to your Lordships' House. It was created, he said, by the conduct of His Majesty's Government. Can he really, in serener moments&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00588"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid I must interrupt the noble Viscount. I was explaining why we had thought it necessary to bring forward a Bill, which I said was an unusual course for the Opposition to take. I said we found it necessary to do so because we could not get His Majesty's Government to come to close quarters with the question of House of Lords reform.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00589"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Then I misunderstood that point in the noble Marquess's speech, but I think the inference drawn from what he said by most of those who heard him was, and would be, that somehow or other His Majesty's Government were responsible for the death-blow being dealt to the House of Lords. My Lords, that is not so. I do not wish to go into history at all, but I want to remind your Lordships of what happened in November, 1909, when this House took the step of rejecting the Budget. Immediately after that&#x2014;it was not any action on the part of His Majesty's Government&#x2014;my noble friend on the Cross Benches and other members of your Lordships' House got up and told this House and the country that this House was unwieldy, that it was too numerous, and so forth, and was, in fact, not fit to perform the duties which the Constitution had entrusted to it. It was not we who did that; it was your own spontaneous verdict upon the conditions of your own Assembly. When I recall the
<col>238</col>
language used by my noble friend on the Cross Benches in the year 1894, and, I think, in 1895, when he was at the head of the Government, when I recall those proceedings and the deliberate judgments passed by my noble friend at that time, I say it is beyond the truth of the case to say that it is our action since the year 1906 which has precipitated this tremendous catastrophe.<lb/>
If I may be allowed to speak personally, I should have liked that after the mistaken policy of November, 1909, and from that date until now, you should have waited and allowed the Parliament Bill to go its way and have left us to do what the noble Marquess is now challenging me to do to-night, which challenge I shall certainly refuse for reasons which I shall soon show, and have left us face to face with that difficulty, instead of your shouldering this intractable problem. I think it is a tremendous mistake that you have made. If I may say so without presumption, it has landed the Party opposite, the country, and both Houses of Parliament in most tremendous perplexities, as to which this Bill, and I am sorry for it, does not bring us one atom nearer a solution.<lb/>
I am not going to attempt, any more than I would attempt after a Budget speech had been made in the House of Commons, immediately to get up and deal with all the proposals, provisions, and resolutions of the Budget, to follow the noble Marquess in regard to the details of this Bill. It would be impossible now to criticise to any good or competent effect the proposals that he has brought before us. I must reserve that for the Second Reading. I would say that there is no desire on the part of His Majesty's Government to burke discussion upon this important subject, but it cannot be supposed for a moment that we can possibly accept this Bill as a solution of the vast difficulties that confront both Parties. That cannot be. The noble Marquess said, for example, that there would not be a single man in the reconstituted House of Lords who would owe his seat to the hereditary principle alone. Well but there are to be one hundred members, being Peers, who are to be elected by the general body of Peers. No one is eligible who is not a Peer, either to be elected or to be an elector. The man selected will be a Peer, he will be chosen by Peers, he will sit here as representing Peers, and I cannot
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0124"/>
<col>239</col>
for the life of me understand how you can contend, that being the state of the case, that there would be nobody in the reconstituted House who would owe his seat to the hereditary principle alone. The country will, I think, regard that as rather farcical. Then the noble Marquess referred to the Referendum. I would like to see, under Lord Balfour of Burleigh's Bill, which I may remind your Lordships is still under the consideration of the House, a body of the electors going to the office of the returning officer to "inspect" &#x2014;that is the word used&#x2014;the noble Marquess's Bill. How many hours will it take any one of us to study the text and the provisions of this Bill? If such a Bill as this were referred, as I presume it would be under the noble Marquess's doctrine, to the Referendum, I cannot imagine anything more calculated to bring the whole principle and method of the Referendum into disrespect.<lb/>
My Lords, I submit, without disrespect to the noble Marquess or to his Bill, that the contents of the Bill do not excite public curiosity and public anxiety nearly so much as the position to be decided by your Lordships as between Lord Lansdowne's proposals to-day and the Bill from another place which it will be my duty, I think, to present to your Lordships probably this day week. That is what is the real object of curiosity and anxiety. The noble Marquess's Bill may or may not be a good Bill; an adequate and sufficient Bill in itself and on its own merits. It may or may not prove to be a possible supplement or complement to the Parliament Bill, but there is one thing which it cannot be. It cannot be a substitute or an alternative for the Parliament Bill. That is the definite position. As I ventured to tell the House when I was replying to the noble Marquess's request for our assent to an Address to the Crown, nothing can stand in the way, so far as His Majesty's Government have the power, of our pressing the Parliament Bill with all our force as soon as we possibly can, and so far as the forms of the House will permit, upon the attention of your Lordships.<lb/>
The noble Marquess dealt, as I thought, rather too shortly with the position as to whether powers or reconstruction and reform ought to be considered first. The noble Marquess and his friends have decided and maintained all through these long controversies that powers are secondary to reconstitution. They say, It is absurd to
<col>240</col>
propose limits of powers, functions, and duties, as you propose to do in your Parliament Bill, until you know the ultimate form of the body which is to exercise those powers, 'functions and duties. We say, do the other hand, it is just as absurd&#x2014;we say it is more absurd&#x2014;to call into existence a new body until you have settled what it is to do, within what limits and with what aims it is to work, and exactly how it is to stand in relation to legislative power with the House of Commons. I submit than when these two arguments are placed before the country, it will be thought that ours is at least as tenable as the one which the noble Marquess seemed to think was unanswerable. We may argue on these two points as to which is the more absurd until the Day of Judgment, but look at the practical situation which settles whether it is to be powers first or reconstitution first. There have been, as we all know, two elections, and, whatever else those two elections may or may not have done&#x2014;both our principle and our plan having been fully before the electors in the course of those two elections&#x2014;they expressed the decision of the electors that your Lordships' Veto should be made suspensory instead of absolute. And, further, the foundation of our doctrine of powers coming before reconstitution is this, that the policy of the Parliament Bill is the withdrawal of the absolute Veto from the House of Lords whether it is reformed or whether it is unreformed. We hold that that, at all events, whatever else may be said about the last two elections, was the conclusion to which those two elections pointed.<lb/>
This is the policy which the noble Marquess asks us to-night to abandon, to drop, or, at all events, to suspend until the two Houses have come to some agreement as to the reform and reconstruction of the machinery of the Constitution. We cannot assent to that, and what I have to say is that we shall persist in pressing the Parliament Bill along until we have got some security by Statute that the supremacy of the House of Commons is to be unimpaired and unimpairable. The noble Marquess used some words about single-Chamber, and I suspect that that phrase will be very hard worked during the months that are to come. I do not object to its being hard worked if there is any one who feels an interest in using that as an implement for attacking the Government; but I would ask the House to bear in mind the exact
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0125"/>
<col>241</col>
position, according to the admission of all, or nearly all, the members of your Lordships' House, which you assign to the House of Commons. It has been said again and again&#x2014;I have several passages for the noble Marquess here&#x2014;that you have no intention whatever to dispute the predominance of the House of Commons. To-night one or two phrases slipped from the noble Marquess which did not seem quite consistent with that, but they were not seriously and deliberately produced, and never can be. The most emphatic statement on the supremacy of the House of Commons made during this controversy has been made by whom? By Mr. Balfour, who, speaking on the eve of the election, I think at Nottingham, on some day in November last, said&#x2014;
<quote>"It is not the Second Chamber that should be the dominant one. It is the so-called popular Chamber, it is the immediately representative Chamber; it is the House of Commons which is now, and which for generations has been, and which, in my opinion, ought to remain, in that co-partnership the dominant element."</quote>
Of course that is quite true, and the reason why I should desire a Second Chamber is, not that it should interfere with the dominance of the House of Commons, but that opportunity should be given for consultation, for revision, for delay, for suspension for a time, and so forth. It is admitted that that is required, but in much of the language that is used, and in some, at any rate, of the provisions of the Bill&#x2014;and I think I shall find it proved when there has been time to study the Bill&#x2014;I seemed to detect a determination, or a strong inclination, while using smooth words about revising power, to retain in effect, indirectly, the supremacy which in general words you surrender.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, said the other day&#x2014;
<quote>"You will see, on Monday, a fair proposal for the reconstitution of the House so that never again can it be said that there is not a fair representation of both political parties."</quote>
I listened with all the attention I could give to the scheme as explained by the noble Marquess, and I ask myself is it conceivable that under this scheme, under any probable operation of this scheme, there is a probability, I might say a possibility, of circumstances under which there would be a Liberal majority in the House. If not, how can such a scheme be called fair?<lb/>
<col>242</col>
I will not detain the House longer. We shall take the Second Reading of the Bill at whatever time may be agreeable to the noble Marquess. Between now and then we shall have time to study and consider the Bill, and he and his friends will have time to inform themselves of the feelings which his proposals may awaken amongst noble Lords who sit around him. It will require a certain time, not an excessive time, I hope, for full examination of the working of the clauses, and it is an immense gain to have what has hitherto been an academic discussion brought into the practical shape of clauses in a Bill. The steps which we may think fit to take, with the consent of the House, in respect of the Parliament Bill will be a matter of arrangement, but we shall not willingly consent to, and I do not think the noble Marquess will think it reasonable to ask that we should, take all the stages of his Bill before proceeding with the Parliament Bill. I think every consideration of public convenience points to proceeding with the Parliament Bill as soon as it can possibly be done without injustice to the scheme of the noble Marquess.<lb/>
The noble Lord said at Glasgow&#x2014;
<quote>"I take it upon myself to say that it ought not to be beyond our powers, with a little good will on both sides, to fill up an outline of that kind [that is, the Bill he was then sketching] in a satisfactory manner, and to create upon that basis what I should describe as a well-balanced Constitution."</quote>
I thoroughly agreed when I read that. With goodwill on both sides something might be made of proposals of this kind, but I confess I have listened to these proposals with profound misgivings. I do not cavil with them so far as I understand them yet. I go much deeper than cavilling. I think they are inadequate. I think they are illusory in many respects, and I think they do what it was not necessary to do at all in my view&#x2014;they destroy the House of Lords instead of closing the door to this great set of difficulties, I am afraid, speaking without the full consideration which such a Bill demands, the Bill is not likely to advance the questions which the noble Marquess desires it should, and we, His Majesty's Government, at all events, can commit ourselves to no approval of any portion of it as it has yet been presented to us.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SMALL HOLDINGS (TENANTS ACQUISITION) BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00605" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00606">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00607"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Bill to which I am going to ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading to-day is designed to meet a grievance which I think clearly attaches to small holders under the administration of the Small Holdings Act, 1908. It has reference to one case and to one case only&#x2014;namely, the case of land which has been purchased by a county council and leased by them to tenants, or which is leased with an option of purchase by instalments. When county councils purchase land for the purpose of small holdings, they usually do so by loan, and it has become the practice to charge to the tenant, even though he be a yearly tenant, an annual instalment which is ultimately to recoup to the county council the loan which they themselves have made. Therefore it may happen in this way that a tenant may give up his tenancy, and that all the time he may have been paying, not merely the rent of the land which he has held, but also an instalment for the payment of the purchase of the land, the ownership of which will remain after his departure with the county council. It surely cannot be just that that sort of thing should take place&#x2014;that a man should actually pay for that which he does not receive. That really is the substance of this Bill. That this is the habitual practice there is no doubt, because two years ago a question was put in the other House to Sir Edward
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0128"/>
<col>247</col>
Strachey, who replied that he believed all county councils charged these recoupment instalments to their tenants.<lb/>
I will now ask your Lordships to look at the clauses of the Bill. The first clause provides that in fixing the rent to be paid for any small holding purchased by a county council&#x2014;and it refers to small holdings purchased by the county council only&#x2014;under the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1908, the county council shall determine the proportion of such rent which is attributable to the sinking fund intended to recoup to the county council the cost of the acquisition of the land and its adaptation as a small holding, and shall keep a separate account of all such part of the sums received on account of rent as are so attributable. In this Bill that is referred to as the "recoupment account." It seems to me that any tenant who is required to repay a portion of the loan with which the land is purchased ought to have the right, if he sees fit, to give notice to the county council, and within a certain time to pay up the balance of the loan which remains due, so that he may become proprietor of the land of his small holding.<lb/>
Your Lordships will find in Clause 2, subsection (2), a provision that a tenant&#x2014;this is, of course, a tenant who is repaying instalments besides rent&#x2014;of a small holding may at any time during his tenancy give to the county council six months' notice in writing of his desire to purchase his holding, and if within such period the tenant pays to the council the difference between the total amount of the sums paid by him in respect of such small holding and credited to the recoupment account and the total amount necessary to recoup to the county council the cost of the acquisition of the said land and its adaptation as a small holding, then the council shall transfer the land to the tenant. That seems to me a fair and reasonable arrangement. Although a yearly tenant he was called upon to pay instalments of the purchase money just the same as if he had been purchasing it, and the land having been purchased by the county council it seems only fair that the tenant should, if he thinks fit, call upon them to enable him to pay off the difference and become the owner of the land.<lb/>
The third subsection of Clause 2 provides that when the total amount of the sums paid by a tenant and credited to the recoupment
<col>248</col>
account is equal to the total sum necessary to recoup to the county council the total cost of the acquisition of the land leased to that tenant and the adaptation thereof as a small holding, the county council shall transfer such land to the tenant in fee simple. In other words, the tenant, having paid the whole sum, shall be entitled to have the article for which he has paid&#x2014;namely, the land. I believe that under the law as it stands there is no provision at all for enabling a purchasing tenant in this way, or any tenant, to have land transferred to him. There are other matters in the Bill, but they are subsidiary matters more suitable for Committee, and I will not trouble your Lordships at this moment by going into them. They are really matters of detail, and I think your Lordships will find it more convenient to deal with them in Committee. I beg to move that the Bill be read a second time.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00609"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very glad that the noble Earl has brought this matter before your Lordships' House, because it is causing a great deal of controversy in rural districts. There are certain objections against the Small Holdings Act which one hears discussed at almost every farmers' meeting, some of them well founded and some of them the reverse. But I do not think there is any part of the Act which has caused so much mistrust and dissatisfaction as what appears to us to be the extraordinarily unjust provision that a man should buy his holding and yet not own it. I am inclined to think that when the section was passed upon which this provision is founded it never occurred to anyone that such an interpretation would be placed upon the words of the section.<lb/>
Section 7, subsection (3), of the Act of 1908 provides that&#x2014;
<quote>"a county council shall not acquire land for small holdings save at such price or rent that, in the opinion of the council, all expenses incurred by the council in relation to the land will be recouped out of the purchase money for the land sold by the council, or in the case of land let out of the rent."</quote>
I do not think any one could have believed that in those expenses would have been included the actual price for the purchase of the land, yet that is the official view
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0129"/>
<col>249</col>
taken both by the Treasury and the Board. That being their view, it follows as a matter of course that the ultimate purchase price of the land must be paid by the small holder himself by way of some annual instalment of the sinking fund in addition to the rent. If I may, I should like to take up a moment of your Lordships' time in recounting the steps which led to a remarkable Treasury Minute on this subject. Under Section 6 of the Act of 1908 it is provided that, if a county council incurs a loss in carrying out any small holding scheme, the whole or any part of that loss may be remitted to them by the Board of Agriculture with the approval of the Treasury; but when the matter was being discussed in another place the Chancellor of the Exchequer instructed the Minister in charge of the Bill&#x2014;I think the First Commissioner of Works&#x2014;to say that only one-half of the loss would be remitted to the county council, and in a Treasury Minute of December 31, 1907, it is laid down with scrupulous exactness on what terms that half may be remitted. The Board has to certify to the Treasury that certain conditions have been fulfilled. I think they are seven in number. One of them only refers to the matter with which we are dealing. It is laid down that the Board of Agriculture must certify that they are satisfied&#x2014;
<quote>"that the county council have in the case of holdings let used their best endeavours to obtain rents fixed at amounts which might reasonably be expected to be sufficient to recoup to the council all expenses incurred in the acquisition of the land (including repayment of capital where the land is purchased) or in the adaptation or subsequent management of the land."</quote>
That is the Treasury view of the matter. But the Board of Agriculture shortly after that issued an interim Report of the proceedings under the Act.<lb/>
They appear to have questioned either the validity, or, I hope, perhaps the morality, of such conditions, and they referred the matter to the Law Officers of the Crown, who supported the view which the Treasury had taken. But in view of the fact that in the previous Act of 1892 such a condition had not been observed and that the Law Officers of the Crown of the previous Government had given contrary advice, the Board stated that they would not object to the county council excluding instalments of sinking fund from the amount of rent, provided that they&#x2014;the
<col>250</col>
county council&#x2014;were prepared themselves to suffer the loss. Those are points which I should like particularly to impress upon your Lordships&#x2014;that the Treasury, being somewhat frightened of the losses that they might be required to recoup under this measure, decided that they would not pay more than half of the loss; and, further, that they imposed the condition, which seems to us to be exceedingly unjust, that a tenant should pay year by year a certain annual instalment of the sinking fund towards the purchase of the holding, in course of time purchasing the holding and yet never becoming the owner. And then the Board gave this advice to the county councils, that they would not object if the county councils did not behave in the manner which they evidently considered unjust to the tenants in imposing this condition. I do not suppose your Lordships can imagine it possible that any landowner, under our present system of land tenure, could put into his lease or into any condition of the tenancy a provision that in addition to the gross economic rent the tenant should pay a sum which should gradually recoup to the landlord the price of his land and yet the landlord should always remain in possession of it.<lb/>
Those are the chief points to which I desire to direct attention. But I think there is a very curious spirit underlying this advice of the Board of Agriculture. They seem to say to county councils, If you find that you have met with a loss under your small holdings schemes and at the same time have imposed a condition which we believe to be unjust, then in that case the Treasury will repay you one-half of the loan; but, on the other hand, if you have not imposed that unjust condition, then you will have to bear the loss yourselves. That is what we wish altered. I hope the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture will consider it fair that this question should be raised, and that he will meet it in a way which will remove the feeling of discontent to which this provision in the Small Holdings Act has given rise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00610"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can assure noble Lords opposite that we consider it quite fair that this question should have been raised. We are very glad that it has
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0130"/>
<col>251</col>
been raised, and we shall try to argue the case in an absolutely fair way and entirely on its merits. This is the third time within a week that the land policy of the Government has been attacked. I need not recapitulate what happened on Tuesday and Wednesday of last week, when two noble Lords opposite brought forward Land Bills and dipped their hands to some tune into the taxpayers' pocket. Now when my noble friend opposite, in the third and last of these Bills, returns to the charge, he is more modest and goes for a contribution from the rates instead of out of Imperial taxes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00611"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Earl's pardon. I do nothing of the sort. All I say is that when a man has paid for a thing he shall be allowed to have that for which he has paid.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00612"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl rather anticipates me. I am coming to that. The Bill is entitled, "An Act to provide for the acquisition by tenants of small holdings in respect of which a rent in excess of the gross annual value is received by county councils." Your Lordships will see exactly what the noble Earl's meaning is from the title of the Bill, and at the risk of being thought inquisitive I should like to ask what is the meaning of the words "gross annual value" of the holding. As far as I can make out, the gross annual value of a holding is the amount it can be let for&#x2014;that is, the rent; and so it is rather difficult to see how there can be holdings in respect of which a rent in excess of the gross annual value is received by county councils. But the noble Earl has explained his Bill very clearly, and it is obvious to all of us what is really meant. What he means is that the practice of charging rents sufficient to cover the sinking fund is an injustice and ought to be remedied.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00613"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00614"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: There are four obvious propositions that I should like to lay before your Lordships. The first is this, that when county councils let land which they have bought for small holdings the interest and the sinking fund together which they charge is 3&#x00BE; per cent. Nobody would say, I think, that the &#x00BC; per cent.
<col>252</col>
sinking fund charged is an excessive return to the county council for pledging their credit. That is what it comes to. The county council pledge their credit, and for that they ask &#x00BC; per cent. If the rents did not cover the sinking fund charge, who would pay it? The noble Earl said it would not fall on the rates. Where else would it come from? It must be paid by the county rate; there is no other source. Therefore the present ratepayers would have to find the money for the benefit of the ratepayers who live after the term of eighty years has expired. I may be told that that is always done, and that in every important case the ratepayers have to pay for the benefit of people who come after them. But I would point out that the ratepayers in those circumstances get something for their money. Take the case of an open space, or a wider street, or the pulling down of slums; the ratepayers do get some enjoyment out of that, and though they have to pay for what ought to fall on people in days to come, they, at any rate, get something out of it. But in this case the ratepayers would get nothing out of it at all.<lb/>
Lord Clinton put a very good point. He expressed his doubts on the question of legality. I really cannot be responsible for the opinions of lawyers. We have all suffered through lawyers, and nobody has suffered more than I have. The noble Lord will recollect the terrible hullabaloo there was on the question of sheep in Scotland. One lawyer said one thing was meant and another lawyer said another thing was meant. Therefore the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture have, I think wisely, left this an open question. Both views cannot be right, but I suppose one of them is right and the Departments treat the necessity for rents sufficient to cover the sinking fund charge as an open question. County councils may charge this sum or they may not, and there are two county councils&#x2014;the Glamorganshire County Council and the County Council of the West Riding of Yorkshire&#x2014;which very generously do pay this sum on the understanding that in eighty years the land will belong to them.<lb/>
The average cost of the land purchased by county councils in England is about &#x00A3;30 an acre. The sinking fund on that, which has to be repaid, as noble Lords
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0131"/>
<col>253</col>
know, in eighty years, is, after all, only 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> an acre. Therefore you see that any gentleman who is in the enjoyment of Mr. Jesse Collings's three acres and a cow would have to pay 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> more a year than he would have to pay if he had the luck to be farming as a tenant of one of your Lordships opposite. But then the tenant under the county council has this great advantage. After all, it is only a matter of insurance. If a tenant is on the Cara bas estate, the Marquess of Carabas may find it convenient, for reasons best known to himself, to put the property into the market&#x2014;everybody knows how it is done and why it is done&#x2014;and the unfortunate tenant finds himself within a very few months deprived not only of his livelihood but of his home. Tenants under a county council run no risk of that sort. They run none of the risks that are run under our much vaunted and well-beloved patriarchal system, which, from recent evidences that we have had, seems to be rapidly approaching to its last legs.<lb/>
I ask the House to take the point which the noble Earl so lucidly put before us. He told us that Clause 1 of his Bill provides that, in fixing the rent to be paid for a small holding purchased by a county council, the county council shall determine the proportion of such rent which is attributable to the sinking fund, and shall keep a separate account of such sums. There is no earthly reason why they should not do that. Clause 2, subsection (1), enacts that if the county council give notice to the tenant to quit the council shall repay to such tenant all sums paid by him in respect of the holding which have been credited to the recoupment account. I would point out to the noble Earl that this provision draws no distinction whatever between loans for purchase and loans for short-lived improvements. There are other criticisms which I should like to make, but they are not necessary at this stage, and I shall reserve them for a future occasion if the Bill goes into Committee.<lb/>
The second subsection of Clause 2 provides that the tenant of a small holding may, by giving six months' notice, buy his holding from the county council. Consider for a moment what that means. He can do it by paying off the remainder of the sinking fund, <i>plus</i> the cost of acquisition and adaptation of the holding. That
<col>254</col>
means that if the land goes up in value the tenant buys and pockets the profit. I will give an instance of what. I mean. Where I live in Buckinghamshire there is a beautiful bit of country which lies between Uxbridge and High Wycombe. That land years ago could have been bought for from &#x00A3;15 to &#x00A3;20 an acre. The Great Central Railway Company run a trunk railway&#x2014;the shortest route to Birmingham&#x2014;through that land, and the result has been that the country all round has developed. Land which was formerly worth from &#x00A3;15 to &#x00A3;20 an acre at once went up to &#x00A3;200, &#x00A3;300, and &#x00A3;500 an acre, and in one instance I know it went up to &#x00A3;1,000 an acre. What would be the inevitable result if there had been a farm here which had been cut up and given in small parcels of land to the people in the village? Why, every one of these people&#x2014;who are supposed to be the bulwarks of society, and, as Lord Wantage said, pistols against every socialist&#x2014;would at once have bought their land under the noble Earl's plan at the price, <i>plus</i> the cost of acquisition and adaptation, of &#x00A3;20 an acre, and would have sold it at once at &#x00A3;200, &#x00A3;300, or whatever they could get. That would be the inevitable result of the noble Earl's proposal in a case where the value of land went up. I next take subsection (3) of Clause 2, which provides that when the total amount of the sums paid by a tenant to the recoupment account is equal to the total cost of the acquisition and adaptation of the holding, the tenant is to have a free gift of the land.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00615"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Not a free gift; a transfer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00616"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Well, he is to be given the land when the total sum has been paid. Well, how long do your Lordships think it would take such a man to get the land? It would take this wretched man 400 years to acquire this "magic of property." We have heard of Methuselah; but I really do draw the line at providing tenants with the magic of property which will take them 400 years to acquire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00617"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Why 400 years?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00618"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Noble Lords may think I have made a mistake, and
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0132"/>
<col>255</col>
that it would only take eighty years. Not at all. For every &#x00A3;100 the tenant pays 5<i>s.</i> a year&#x2014;namely, a &#x00BC; per cent. If the noble Earl intended to put in compound interest, which would allow a man to obtain his land in eighty years, why on earth didn't he put it in the Bill? But he evidently expects these advantages to be acquired by some one in the very dim and distant future, for if you refer to subsection (4) of Clause 2 you will see that he brings into the field the legal personal representatives of the agriculturist deceased. I quite admit that it is rather a clever thing to bring in this sort of Bill, and I do not for a moment say that it is not a good electioneering cry. It is a capital platform advertisement, and it is exactly the same sort of advertisement as I think Lord Willoughby de Broke told us would exist in the case of the Referendum. He said it was a most admirable thing on the platform, but that it was not of very much practical use. If this Bill is to be used for that purpose, I have nothing more to say.<lb/>
But I should like to point out that there is no real demand for purchase. I am not going into what I have said before as to the persons who wished to purchase numbering only 1&#x00BD; per cent. of the total applicants for land throughout England. I would, however, point out that up to the end of 1910 there were only fifty-two acres acquired by seven small holders, and I received a letter from one of them the other day-one of the first pioneers of these small proprietors&#x2014;who said he had been in occupation of his holding since Michaelmas, 1908. He complained that he was now in a very sorry plight, that he had exhausted all his capital and had spent over &#x00A3;200 of his friends' money, and he concluded, in touching but somewhat homely language, by saying that he was afraid it would not be many weeks before "he would have to go pop." That is the case with one of the leading pioneers of this great and most beneficent scheme.<lb/>
If the noble Earl who has introduced this Bill could show that our policy had hampered county councils in getting land or in letting that land for small holdings, or if he could show that it is the accepted wish of the ratepayers that the cost of recoupment of the sinking fund should fall upon them, the remedy, of course, would be that the charge should not be
<col>256</col>
included in the rent. That is obvious enough. But I strongly object, it being included in the rent, to a provision enabling tenants in some cases but not in all to recover payment, or to claim the land on payment of a sum which need have no relation to the true value of the land. If noble Lords opposite wish to give a Second Reading to this Bill, and if there is any reason why for future service the Bill should be passed through the House of Lords, of course we have nothing to say; but on its merits His Majesty's Government oppose the Bill, and though, of course, we should not take the trouble of forcing your Lordships to a Division, yet we object to the Bill and most earnestly hope that the noble Earl will not carry his Bill to a Second Reading, but will be satisfied with having brought what he considers this great grievance before the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00619"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I heard with regret the uncompromising hostility to this Bill with which the noble Earl ended his speech, for I certainly thought that in one of the earlier passages I noticed an admission on his part that there were points in my noble friend's proposals which could be appropriately examined in Committee, and I think that is the case. The noble Earl seems to me to have somewhat misapprehended the general scope and purport of my noble friend's Bill. The noble Earl represented this as another frontal attack on the land policy of His Majesty's Government, and he went on to say that, whereas other critics of that policy had been content to make an attack on the pockets of the taxpayers, my noble friend meditated an attack on the pockets of the ratepayers. As I understand my noble friend's proposal, it does not involve any attack upon the pockets either of the ratepayers or of the taxpayers.<lb/>
What is, stated in the simplest possible words, the proposal which we understand my noble friend to lay before the House? These county councils, under legislation for which the noble Earl the Minister for Agriculture is responsible, are in the habit of letting to small tenants farms which they have themselves previously purchased, and when they come so to let these farms they are in the habit of charging to the tenant for the use of the land a sum containing two constituent parts. There is, in the first place, what may be regarded
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0133"/>
<col>257</col>
as the ordinary rent of the holding, and to that is added an additional sum for the purpose of recouping to the county councils by instalments the principal money which they have advanced. I do not think there is any doubt about it, because it is laid down in a Treasury Minute that in all such cases the council are to obtain rents fixed at amounts which might reasonably be expected to be sufficient to recoup to the council all expenses incurred in the acquisition of the land. That is a clear intimation that the rent charged is to be something more than the ordinary agricultural rent, and is to include an addition for the purpose of recouping the local authority. What, then, is my noble friend's proposal? He proposes that these two elements should be, as it were, dissected and separately shown, and an account kept on the one hand of the ordinary rent and on the other hand of the addition to the ordinary rent on account of recoupment, and be it observed the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture said there was no difficulty in keeping a separate account of that kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00620"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I said there would be no objection.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00621"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: That is quite sufficient for my purpose. My noble friend behind me makes two proposals. First, that any one of these tenants, at any time after giving six months' notice, may purchase his holding out and out on condition that he repays to the county council the whole cost of the acquisition of the land and its adaptation as a small holding. There is no loss to the county council. They are fully indemnified for every farthing they have spent. The only effect is that it enables a tenant who desires to exchange his present position as a mere occupier under the local authority for the position of an owner to do so upon terms which seem to me absolutely fair and just between the parties. What is the second proposal? It is that when one of these tenants has paid on this recoupment account, as distinct from ordinary rent, enough to recoup the county council completely, he then becomes, if he chooses, automatically the owner of his farm. There, again, the noble Earl has not shown us that there is any iniquity in a bargain of the kind. He mentioned, I think, one case where agricultural land had immensely increased in value owing to the advent of a railway, and he asked, Why should the
<col>258</col>
farmer who happens to rent one of these farms have the advantage of that great increment of value? That obviously must be a case of a very special nature, and one which might be provided for by some Amendment in the Bill. But the main proposal of my noble friend seems to me, I must say, to be a very simple and businesslike one.<lb/>
One word with regard to these alleged attacks upon the Government policy. His Majesty's Government, we are well aware, regard the solution of this agricultural question as bound up in the creation of small tenancies. We, on the other hand, are disposed to look rather to the creation of small occupying ownerships. I do not want to dogmatise upon this subject. I am quite content to admit that there may be advantages in both systems. I think it is possible that there may be localities where tenancy may be preferred, but I am quite sure there are other localities in which actual ownership would find the preference, and I am not at all convinced by the noble Earl's statement that up to the present time only a very small number of small holders have chosen to become the actual owners of their farms. Is the noble Earl quite sure that the explanation of the fact&#x2014;and I dare say it is a fact&#x2014;is not to be found in this, that the terms which His Majesty's Government have offered to those tenants who have selected tenancy are so much more attractive than those which they have offered to the tenants who prefer actual ownership, the scales being, as it were, unevenly weighted, that only a small number have decided in favour of ownership and a comparatively large number in favour of tenancy? What I feel about all these questions is that we ought to introduce as much elasticity as possible into our arrangements, and I should like to see those who desire to become small occupiers of land given, on absolutely fair terms, the choice whether they will own their land or whether they will rent it. My noble friend's Bill seems to me to have this great merit, that it does introduce a new element of elasticity inasmuch as it enables a man who has set out on his journey as an occupying tenant to convert that tenancy, on terms which seem to be just and equitable, into ownership of the land which he tills. I therefore give my support to my noble friend's Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0008P0I0134"/>
<col>259</col>
I am not sure that the noble Marquess opposite has done full justice to the argument of my noble friend behind me. The basis of that argument is to be found in the policy of the Act of 1908, which the Bill of the noble Earl opposite proposes to amend. The principle of that measure was that State assistance should not be brought in for the purpose of enabling small tenants to become either lessees or owners of their land unless in the interest of the State there was some control. For that purpose county councils were enabled to acquire land and either let it or sell it. If they let it, they did so on certain statutory terms, and, if they sold it, by Section 12 of the Act statutory terms obtained also. It was not open to a person enabled by the State to become on favourable terms the owner of his land to use the land just as he pleased. He could not make himself a nuisance to the neighbourhood, but had to conform to certain statutory conditions which were to obtain for a certain time. These provisions were conceived to be necessary in the interests of the community by those who accepted the principle that small holdings would be a great advantage. The small holder was not to till or own the land at his own sweet will, but had to conform to regulations which seemed desirable in the general interests. What does this Bill propose to do? It proposes to repeal that policy by a stroke.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00624"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Look at subsection (2) of Clause 2.

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00626"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: That does not make the smallest difference. The policy of the Act of 1908 is being repealed by this clause. The noble Earl's clause as he has just described it enables the small tenant to acquire the land in fee simple, which, of course, means free from all conditions. There is nothing in this Bill keeping alive the provisions of Section 12 of the Act of 1908, and, if this Bill passes, the man who had become a tenant under the Act of 1908
<col>260</col>
would be able to turn himself into a fee simple owner, free from all the restrictions which the policy of the Act of 1908 imposed upon him. The policy of that Act may have been right or wrong, but it was a policy deliberately adopted by Parliament, and this Bill, so far from conforming to that policy, repeals it at a stroke. Your Lordships have already within the last few days given a Second Reading to two Bills which would be fatal to that policy if they became law. Those two Bills have gone to a Select Committee, where the whole matter is to be inquired into. If your Lordships desire to add a third Bill and to send this measure to that limbo, then I do not think it is a matter worth while making a fuss about. This is a third Bill very much of the same nature as the other two, equally fatal to the Government's policy, and so far as I am concerned, though I should not desire to divide against the Motion for the Second Reading, I wish at the same time to reserve in the strongest possible manner liberty of action to the Government to preserve the policy deliberately enacted in the Act of 1908.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Viscount who has just spoken has made the point that this Bill does not provide for a continuance of the restrictions which constitute part of the policy of the Government in this matter. The noble Viscount told us himself that those restrictions were only for a limited period.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00629"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: That is a reasonable point to raise in Committee, but I wish to draw your Lordships' attention to this. The noble Earl the Minister for Agriculture, when he was dealing with the Bills that were before your Lordships last week, made all the fun of which he is a known master of the very restrictive clauses, taken from the Irish Land Acts, which were put into those Bills. That was one of the main points taken by the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture. But now the noble Viscount comes forward and puts the very restrictions which were derided last week as the reason why he objects to the Bill of my noble friend. I

<col>261</col>
hope your Lordships will support the Second Reading of this Bill, and if there is anything in the point as to restrictions&#x2014;and I am quite prepared to admit that there may be&#x2014;let us go into it in Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00630"><member>LORD JOICEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should be sorry to be considered an opponent of the Government's land policy because I do not agree with them in regard to the course which they propose to take upon this Bill. I live in a district where there are a great many small holdings, and I think that the one object of those small holders is to become the actual owners of the holdings they occupy, and I cannot see that it is against the interests of the State that we should have some means of increasing the number of landowners in this country. I think it rather strengthens the policy of the Government if we give power for a small holder who holds under a county council to purchase his holding if he happens to have sufficient money to do so. I am anxious to see a much larger number of people upon the land, I care not whether by ownership or by occupation, and I should be sorry to put any obstruction in the way either of a person occupying a small holding or becoming the purchaser. It is decidedly in the interests of the State that we should have as many occupying owners of land as possible, and while I do not tie myself to all the details of this Bill I do think, so far as its principle is concerned&#x2014;that is, that men should be assisted to become owners of their holdings&#x2014;that it is a very good principle indeed. Besides, if you allow existing small holders to purchase their holdings it will liberate a certain amount of money and enable county councils to purchase other small holdings and increase the number of occupiers. I do not see why, because a county council acquire a certain area of land and divide it into small holdings, they should put every occupier of that land in the position simply of a lessee. I believe in removing all the restrictions you can with regard to the occupation of land. The tenant who has freedom to cultivate in the way that he thinks best, who is at liberty to do the very best he can for his property and for the object that; he has in view, is more likely to succeed than a man who is tied by restrictions. I care not who puts the restrictions on the land, whether the landlord, or the county council, or any other body. I think it is a mistake on the part of the Liberal Party&#x2014;and I speak as
<col>262</col>
a Liberal&#x2014;to prevent any extension of the principle of ownership in this country. We should rather assist than discourage this tendency, and on that ground I am bound to say I thoroughly sympathise with the principle of the Bill, though I do not agree with all its details.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00631"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ILKESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having been engaged in this matter since 1883, and being President of the Allotments and Small Holdings Association which I had the honour to form in conjunction with Mr. Jesse Collings in 1883, I naturally feel somewhat the aspersion that the policy of the Liberal Party is against the creation of ownership. It always has been part of the policy of the Liberal Party to put men on the soil, whether as owners or tenants. I would recall to your Lordships the fact that the Small Holdings Act of 1892, which was passed by the Unionist Government and which had a large amount of support from the Liberal Party, was based on the principle of putting owners on the soil as small occupiers. That was the basis of that Act, and the Act which followed it was brought in because that policy had absolutely failed. The Act of 1892 was a serious failure. We found it did not put people on the soil. One of the great difficulties of small holders is lack of capital. The small holder does not want to spend his capital on buying his holding, but on the cultivation of the land. That being so, His Majesty's Government brought in the Act under which we are now working, and which the noble Earl opposite seeks to amend. This Act has been in force for three years, and during that time it has created almost as many thousands of small occupiers as were created in hundreds by the former Act. I think I am understating the real facts of the case. At all events, we have some 9,000 persons placed on the land under the Act of 1907 as small occupying tenants; and the most remarkable part is this, that while active county councils all over England, north, east, south and west, have been asking people to come forward and become small holders of land, they have hardly had any people asking to become owners. If you take the whole country through, I think the figure works out at about 2 per cent. of the applicants. That shows that there is no great and universal desire to become small owners, but that there is a very much larger desire to be occupying tenants under county councils.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0136"/>
<col>263</col>
As to the point raised by the noble Earl opposite, I am bound to say that my sympathy is to some extent with his Bill. He wishes to take away what is on the surface a grievance on the part of those people who pay for laud through a sinking fund and at the end of the period do not become the owners. I have been familiar with that grievance for a great many years. It was a grievance among allotment holders in various parts of the country before the Small Holdings Act was passed. But it must always be remembered that in order to get a county council to move in these matters you must, as far as possible, secure them against loss and pay them for their trouble and for pledging their credit. You are giving them the minimum amount of money in this case which could be expected to make it worth while for a county council to undertake very serious and grave labours for the provision of small holdings. I myself would gladly see the provision in this Bill made law. I have no objection to it. It is a matter which requires to be threshed out very carefully, more carefully than I think could be done in Committee of the Whole House. Therefore I feel that the suggestion which was made by my noble friend the Secretary of State for War is one worthy of consideration. The whole land policy has been referred to a Select Committee in connection with the two Bills which your Lordships read a second time last week. Why should not this Bill also go to that Select Committee to be considered with the other two Bills, so that a general policy can be framed, not only with reference to ownership generally, but with reference to this small grievance connected with those who hold land under the system of the Act of 1907? I would assure noble Lords opposite that as regards the Liberal Party generally there is no desire to oppose the creation of small occupying ownerships. On the contrary, we regard that as one of the methods by which people can be placed on the land. It is, however, not the only method, and in my opinion it is not the easiest or the best method in which to create small holdings.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00632"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lords who have spoken from the other side of the House seem to think that this is a measure for opposing their great land policy. This Bill will in no way affect the policy of the Government's Act of 1908. The tenancy system will go on just the same whether this Bill is passed or not;
<col>264</col>
but what this Bill does propose to do is, as my noble friend Lord Joicey said, to give a man who has taken land on tenancy and done well upon it an opportunity of becoming the owner if he so desires. The Bill distinctly states&#x2014;if it does not state it in terms satisfactory to the Government it could be amended&#x2014;that that shall be done without any loss whatever to the county council or to the Treasury. Therefore this is a very small point, and it is a point which I should have thought no one would have regarded as worth while contesting. It is the simple point that a man who is now a tenant can, by payment of a certain sum, become the owner. I had al ways thought that it was the great Liberal policy&#x2014;at any rate it was in old days when there was a sane Liberal policy in this country&#x2014;to have as many owners of land as possible.<lb/>
With regard to the other point, if the Government desire to keep up restrictions there is nothing to prevent words being put into the Bill in Committee to guard against any infringement of the restrictions contained in the original Act. I therefore hope that my noble friend will take a Division on the Second Reading if necessary, and that he will keep the Bill in this House to be dealt with in the ordinary way rather than allow it to be sent to what the noble Viscount opposite described as the limbo of a Select Committee. If my noble friend adopted the noble Viscount's suggestion, the Bill would probably not get out of the Select Committee in time for anything to be done this year. I hope that in the short time there may be at the disposal of my noble friend he will be able to get his Bill through Committee altered in such a manner as to make it acceptable even to His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00633"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I find some difficulty in replying to the speech of the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture, because, although he went into a variety of circumstances more or less interesting and amusing, there was hardly one of them which had any reference to this Bill. The noble Earl said that all that the county councils charge to these tenants is &#x00BC; per cent. for the advantage of their credit. This Bill has nothing to do with the question of what they are charging. This Bill simply has reference to the case of the man whom the county council call upon to pay an instalment of the purchase money
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0137"/>
<col>265</col>
apart from the rent of the land. Throughout this debate, at all events on the other side of the House, the real position has been ignored. I look at this matter entirely from the point of view of a tenant who is cultivating on an annual tenancy, and who is made to pay, in addition to the rent, a sum in respect of the purchase. Is not that a very great hardship? The noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture and in a lesser degree the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, seem to think that this is an attack upon the land policy of His Majesty's Government. It is nothing of the sort, and it never was so intended. In the administration of the Act of 1908 a great hardship has arisen, which I do not believe the noble Earl the Minister for Agriculture or anybody else ever contemplated would arise, and it is solely to deal with that hardship that this Bill is introduced. It has been suggested that I should move that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee. This Bill has nothing to do with the policy of land purchase, with which the two Bills to which your Lordships gave a Second Reading last week dealt, but simply with the particular case in which a tenant has been called upon to pay money in respect of the purchase of the land. This Bill does not in any way attack the policy of His Majesty's Government. It is owing to the regulations of the Local Government Board and the Treasury that this difficulty has arisen, and it is to meet this difficulty that I have introduced this Bill. In these circumstances I do not feel at all disposed to send the Bill to a Select Committee to be taken together with other Bills which have nothing in common with it. Therefore if the Bill receives a Second Reading I shall ask your Lordships to commit it in the ordinary way to a Committee of the Whole House. I am well aware that in two or three minor details my Bill does require alteration, and I myself shall propose certain Amendments in Committee, and I shall be glad to receive advice and assistance from any one in regard to amending the measure. In the meantime I ask your Lordships to give the Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<title>IRISH LAND STOCK.</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00636"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government whether in sales under the Irish Land Act, 1909, a portion of the purchase price is retained by the Land Commissioners for the redemption of Government and other charges; and whether it is the case that the stock so retained is habitually sold by them at a price considerably below the market quotation of such stock; and whether arrangements cannot be made which will not entail this heavy additional loss on landowners.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00637">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Question which stands in my name is a rather technical and complicated one, and I must therefore trespass for a few minutes on your Lordships' time while I endeavour to make it clear. Those of your Lordships who are interested in Irish land legislation may remember that by the Act of 1903, which is commonly known as Mr. Wyndham's Act, the vendor in disposing of his property received cash, but this was altered by the Act of 1909, which enacted that in future payment should be made in Stock. When the Act of 1909 was in Committee in this House a proposal was made that what was sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander, and that if the Government thought, it sufficiently good to pay landowners in depreciated Stock all superior interests, such as tithe rent charge, repayment of loans from the Board of Works, and other superior interests, which, of course, have to be redeemed when an estate is sold, should be paid in the same Stock; but this did not commend itself to the Treasury, which demanded its pound of flesh. Consequently when an estate is now sold it is necessary to sell sufficient of the depreciated Stock to enable the superior charges to be repaid in cash.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00638">Perhaps your Lordships will allow me to show how this works. I will take an estate with which I am familiar which was sold for &#x00A3;17,000, and on which the superior charges amounted to &#x00A3;7,700. Under the Act of 1903 the landowner would have received &#x00A3;9,300 in cash, but in order to realise &#x00A3;7,700 in cash to pay off the superior interests it is now necessary, at the price at which Irish 3 per cent. Stock is quoted on the Stock Exchange&#x2014;namely, 91&#x2013;92&#x2014;to sell &#x00A3;8,468 of Stock. Thus only &#x00A3;8,532 of depreciated Stock is handed over to the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0138"/>
<col>267</col>
landlord who sells, as against &#x00A3;9,300 in cash under the 1903 Act. I am not making a hardship of this because it is the law. But what I do complain of is that, instead of obtaining the price at which the 3 per cent. Stock is quoted in the market, the Estates Commissioners when they sell to redeem superior charges obtain a nitwit lower price.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00639">I have a case in point. I need not quote the case in this House, but I shall be happy to give details to my noble friend who will reply on behalf of the Irish Office if he wishes to have them. In this case the Stock was sold at 87 on March 2 for the payment of these charges, whilst the price of Irish 3 per cent. Stock was 91&#x2013;92. That makes a difference of at least 4 per cent. I dare say my noble friend will tell me that the Stock which is sold is not the same Stock as that which is quoted at 91&#x2013;92, and he will be perfectly right, because the Stock which is quoted at 91&#x2013;92 is mature Stock carrying with it interest to the purchaser, whereas the Stock which is sold by the Estates Commissioners is immature Stock and does not carry interest except from the next Gale Day. But the interest on 3 per cent. Stock for six months is 1&#x00BD; per cent.; therefore this fact ought not to make a difference of more than 1&#x00BD; per cent. in the price, whereas this particular Stock was sold at 4 points below. And I would point out that this difference of 2&#x00BD; per cent. makes a further loss to the landlord on the sum I have quoted of &#x00A3;232.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00640">I know that the reply to this is that this immature Stock is only put on the market in very small quantities, and consequently there is no market for it. It has to be sold through a Chancery broker, of whom I believe there are only eleven, and these gentlemen take it in turns to sell, with the result that there is no market and they virtually fix the price of the Stock. Another answer that has been suggested to me is that it will be said that the Estates Commissioners realise this Stock at once in order to pay off charges on the estate which are bearing heavy interest and which would continue to accrue to the next Gale Day if they were not paid off. But even supposing the charge to be 5 per cent. on the sum I have mentioned, there is still shown a considerable loss to the landowner over the difference if the Stock were kept until it became mature Stock.</p>
<col>268</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00641">It is not enough for me to make a complaint as to ibis. I think that a remedy which might meet the case ought to be suggested if possible. Two or three remedies have been thought of. One is that the Estates Commissioners should retain sufficient Stock to be ample security allowing for variations of price till the next Gale Day, and should then sell it as mature stock and hand over the balance, if any, to the vendor. But I think there are difficulties and objections to this course. It has also been suggested that the landlord should find sufficient cash to pay off these charges and then the difficulty would not arise. But we must remember that Irish landlords as a rule are not rich, and that many of their estates are in trust. Consequently the Stock when realised would belong to their trustees and not to them. It would, therefore, be impossible for them to obtain an advance in cash from any bank as they have no security to offer.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00642">But it seems to me there is a solution to this question which would be fair to the landlord and would not damage the tenant or the Treasury. It is this, that instead of issuing immature Stock the Estates Commissioners should issue mature Stock, and in making payments to the landlord should deduct the interest that has accrued from the last Gale Day to the date on which the Stock is issued. It seems to me that this is a mere matter of book-keeping, but it would have this result, that the Stock would be quoted on the market as mature Stock and would consequently rank with the other Stock for which there is a market. I hope this suggestion may recommend itself to His Majesty's Government. As I have pointed out, the loss incurred by landlords under the 1909 Act is already a very heavy one, and I feel sure that His Majesty's Government have no wish in any way to increase that loss unless it is absolutely necessary. I beg to ask the Question standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00643"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have in the first place to thank my noble friend for having kindly postponed this Question from last week. As the noble Lord has told your Lordships the Question raises a very complicated point, though I think not one of very great magnitude. Perhaps I might state to the House the exact position of affairs. When advances for land purchase are made in Stock, the Stock so advanced
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0139"/>
<col>269</col>
carries dividends from the dividend day next after the day of issue. The person to whom the Stock is issued receives personally a fractional dividend for the period between the sale and the date of the advance and the first dividend on the Stock. Such Stock until the dividend day next after the date of issue has passed is commonly called immature Stock to distinguish it from Stock which carries the ordinary rate of interest. The true difference in value between mature and immature Stock, no matter when sold, is, therefore, half a year's dividend&#x2014;that is to say, in the case of 3 per cent. Stock the difference would be &#x00A3;1 10s. per cent. Thus mature Stock sold to-day carries half a year's dividend payable on July 1, whereas on immature Stock sold to-day the first half-year's dividend would be payable next January.<lb/>
In practice, however, I admit that the difference is somewhat greater. This difference is due to the fact that there is a very restricted market for the sale of this Stock. The purchaser is usually the stockbroker, and seeing that the Stock is of no value until it has matured he has to stand out of the money until that day arrives, and naturally he expects something for that consideration. In cases arising since the Act of 1909 the advances are made in 3 per cent. Stock, and in cases which were already pending at the time of the passing of that Act, amounting to upwards of &#x00A3;50,000,000, the advances are still made in cash unless the vendor elects to take a part or the whole in Stock. But we are only considering cases where the vendor is paid in Stock. The existing Treasury rules on the subject precisely follow the rules that were in existence when all advances were made in Stock&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00644"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member><membercontribution>: But Stock at that time was at a premium. Now it is at a discount, which is a very different thing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00645"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: My point is that the method in question has been in operation for a long time. Now let me describe the method of procedure. When an advance is made in Stock the Stock is inscribed to the credit of the estate, and as soon as legal requirements are complied with the advance is distributed by the Judicial Commissioner. Upon such distribution the necessary amount in Stock is sold to realise whatever charges there may be on the estate, and if the Stock has not become
<col>270</col>
mature it has to be sold as immature Stock. But this is the real point. The date of the distribution depends chiefly on the vendor himself. It is within his option to decide whether it shall be sold at once or whether it shall be kept till the next Gale Day, when it would rank as mature Stock. The Land Commissioners do not press forward the distribution if the vendor, in order to avoid the loss of which the noble Lord complains, desires it to be retained until it has become mature. In general vendors are anxious to pay off their obligations because in many cases they bear very heavy rates of interest, and they are anxious to realise the residue, including the bonus, and very often it is to their advantage to sustain the loss which they may have to encounter on the sale of immature Stock in order to get a prompt settlement of their existing charges. But it is always very largely, if not entirely, within the discretion of the vendor himself as to which course he will adopt.<lb/>
The losses sustained by vendors owing to this transaction are nothing like so large as the noble Lord's speech might lead your Lordships to suppose. Up to the present the sales of immature 3 per cent. Stock have amounted to only &#x00A3;18,900, or 4 per cent. of the total advances. With regard to 2&#x00BE; per cent. Stock, the sales have amounted to only &#x00A3;151,000, or less than 6 per cent. of the total. That shows that the grievance is not a very extensive one. The noble Lord has alluded to the difference between the theoretical and the practical price of this Stock being as much as 4 per cent. I think he has given your Lordships a rather exaggerated impression on that point. I may say that the last simultaneous sale of 3 per cent. mature and immature Stock took place on March 29 last, when the former fetched 91&#x00BE; and the latter 89&#x215C;&#x2014;a difference of 2&#x215C;; but the true difference being 1&#x00BD;, the excess of difference is only &#x215E;, which is not a very large sum. In fact, on the &#x00A3;18,900 the difference in money only amounts to &#x00A3;180. The greatest difference in the price of these Stocks occurred in a small transaction of immature Stock on March 6, when the difference in price was 3&#x00BE;, or 2&#x00BC; in excess of the true difference.<lb/>
Now I come to the 2&#x00BE; per cent. Stock. The last simultaneous quotation of mature and immature Stock occurred on May 2 last, when the difference was 23/16ths; the true difference was 1&#x215C;, and the excess of
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0140"/>
<col>271</col>
difference, therefore, was 13/16ths. If you apply that to the total sums of immature Stock which has been sold, you will see that the loss to the vendor owing to this disability amounts to only &#x00A3;1,400; so that, taking the two Stocks, in one case you get a loss of &#x00A3;180, and in the other a loss of &#x00A3;1,400, and that is the extent of the loss to which vendors have been subjected. I think the question is a very small one having regard to the small extent of these sales of immature Stock. Again, as I have said, it rests entirely with the vendor to decide whether the sale shall be pushed forward or whether he will wait until the Stock has matured and can be put on the market as mature Stock. The fact of the matter is, there is practically no method of remedying the grievance of which my noble friend complains. This immaturity from which the Stock suffers is inherent in it, and nothing you can do will remove the disability. It is for the vendor to decide, having regard to his own special circumstances, whether he will anticipate the maturity to which the Stock will grow in course of time, or whether it suits him better to incur the loss which he must suffer if he sells immature Stock. It is a case in which the vendor is able to make such a decision as will be most advantageous to him in the circumstances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00646"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has made a clear statement, but I confess that I cannot feel that he has at all met the case which my noble friend brought forward. I think he labours under some extraordinary delusion with regard to the main point that has been put before the House. The noble Lord the Paymaster-General told your Lordships that the whole of this question rests as a matter of fact with the vendor. That is not only not the case, but I should have said it was exactly the reverse of the fact. If any of your Lordships who own Irish land and had gone into Court months ago and years ago were now to go to the Commissioners and say, "When will my case be settled?" the answer would be, "It may be some time in the next three months, six months, or a year." Then many of these landlords who have to be paid in Stock are men who have mortgages on their land, and unless they are to have this money lying at the bank in the names of their trustees and bearing a low rate of interest, they have to give notice to the mortgagees. They have to give notice when they have had their land inspected on the chance that they will be
<col>272</col>
paid on a certain date, and therefore the matter does not rest in their hands at all. Indeed the Commissioners are most careful not to attempt to give any real guidance as to when they will be able to conclude any particular operation, and many men who have given notice to their mortgagees have had to wait for months and for an even longer period. Therefore, they are entirely in the hands of the Commissioners.<lb/>
This matter is not dealt with under an Act of Parliament but under Treasury rules, and those Treasury rules, I venture to say, are not only unjust but shortsighted. I am not going to dispute the figures which the noble Lord has given, but he himself admits that between the class of Stock which is sold by the Treasury in order to pay these charges and the ordinary Stock of which it forms a part there had been a difference on one occasion of, I think he said, 3&#x00BC; per cent. That is a very large difference in Stock which is already depreciated, and which is already doing duty for &#x00A3;100 when it is not &#x00A3;100. I confess that I thought that an extremely weak argument. I also submit that financially and economically there cannot be a more deleterious doctrine for the Treasury than to create two classes of the same Stock, one which is to carry dividends under certain conditions and the other which carries its ordinary and proper dividend, and then to take the least desirable of those and fling it on the market in small quantities and get a lower price.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00647"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I do not think that is what happens. The Treasury under the Act of Parliament have to realise sufficient money to pay off the charges. The moment at which that realisation is made depends mainly on the vendor himself. If the vendor prefers to have the Stock sold when it is immature he will suffer loss, but he can wait until the Stock is mature, if he is prepared to wait for a period of not more than six months. The immaturity, as I have said, is inherent in this Stock, but if the vendor waits he then gets the full benefit of his money.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00648"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: It would be very useful to the vendor to have this option if the option were given to him in sufficient time, but the noble Lord has not seen the working of the matter and does not realise the difficulty. If the unfortunate vendor were told at the beginning of January that
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0141"/>
<col>273</col>
he would be paid on the 1st of July, he could exercise his option and implore the Treasury not to sell his Stock at a moment when it is likely to produce a difference of 2 or 3 per cent. But he has not that option. He is told of the matter at the last moment, and he has then to decide whether he will keep the mortgagees waiting or accept a depreciated price for the Stock.<lb/>
I should like to put it on much broader grounds. The state of these Stocks has given rise to a growing feeling of perturbation in the City. All Government securities have suffered considerably within the last few months, and I do think that the Treasury should take care that the rules they make do not involve depreciating that security which they themselves will have to issue in large amounts in the next few years. Every sale at a lower figure&#x2014;at 87&#x00BD; when the proper price ought to be 91&#x2014;tends to depreciate the Stock. It figures in every book as being the lowest price fetched during 1911, and it has the effect of driving down instead of driving up that Stock, of which the Treasury may have to issue &#x00A3;50,000,000, &#x00A3;60,000,000, or &#x00A3;70,000,000 more. There-
<col>274</col>
fore it is not only a question of injustice to the landlord, but it is a question of very serious loss to the State if we continue on this unfortunate system.<lb/>
I have seen these figures only in connection with the question put by the noble Lord. I have no personal interest of any sort or kind in the matter. But I would urge upon the noble Lord that he should communicate to the Treasury the fact that these proceedings are not only resented by the class who have already been given depreciated Stock in place of their &#x00A3;100, but that they are disadvantageous to the Treasury itself in dealing with this very large class of security. I hope that when other cases come forward an effort will be made as far as possible by the Commissioners to give such notice as will enable landlords, to many of whom this is a matter of great importance, to make such dispositions as will prevent a sale being carried out under circumstances likely to lead to further loss of their securities.</membercontribution></p>

<title>EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN ACT (1903) AMENDMENT BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00671">Amendments <i>reported</i> (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00672"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member> moved to add the following new paragraph to Clause 2 (Construction of principal Act and Acts referring thereto):&#x2014;"(<i>a</i>) As if in section 3 of the principal Act the following subsection were inserted, A boy under the age of fifteen years shall not be employed in or carry on street trading."'</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00673">The most rev. Primate said: My Lords, some explanation or excuse may be looked for on our part for re-introducing at this stage a discussion which in some form took place when the Bill was in Committee a fortnight ago. But the simple explanation is this, that a good many members of your Lordships House felt that the matter which was provisionally decided on that occasion had not really received the consideration on the part of your Lordships to which it is entitled. The point that I raise in my Amendment is a perfectly simple one, though the incidental questions are not altogether simple. If we passed the Bill as it has now gone through Committee we should have said that it was obligatory that a child under fourteen should be prohibited from street trading, but after the age of fourteen a boy would be capable of being allowed to carry on such trading. I desire to make the age fifteen, and not fourteen, and I will give your Lordships my reasons for feeling very strongly that this change is a most desirable one.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00674">I admit at once that the question is one of considerable difficulty, and that in all these cases we ought to be exceedingly careful how far we interfere with the natural laws of supply and demand, and how far we try to prevent what seems to be a legitimate mode of employment. All the restrictions which we introduce in a Bill of this kind require, in my judgment, to be very carefully watched, and those who advocate them are rightly subjected to severe criticism as to whether or no they can show that what they are advocating in the way of additional restriction or prohibition is really necessitated by the facts of the case. Therefore I feel bound to endeavour to show why the proposal for the change from the age of fourteen to fifteen is one which ought not to be lightly set on one side. I
<col>278</col>
hope that I shall not be met again to-night by the argument, of which we heard something on the Second Reading and in Committee, that restrictions of this kind are wholly mischievous because even if it is a bad thing that money should be earned in an undesirable way it is a worse thing that it should not be earned for the home at all. If your Lordships will refer back to the discussions which used to take place fifty years ago on factory legislation, chimney-sweeping boys, coal pit boys, and other legislation of that kind, it will be found that the proposals for making it impossible for young boys to be thus employed were met by the argument that you would be interfering with the legitimate earning of money, and that the families were so poor that you must allow the money to be earned <i>coute qu'il coute.</i> I hope we shall not hear that argument pressed at this stage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00675">It is true that, speaking for the individual family, it seems hard upon them at the moment to prevent this money being earned, but taking it as a whole, and looking to the future of the boys who will be the wage earners in these cases, I am absolutely certain that we are on the right lines when we make these restrictions, provided we can do it with reasonable fairness. It is a matter of degree. All the restrictions we desire to introduce ought to be carefully challenged, and we should be bound to show cause for them. I am prepared to show cause why the restriction which we have already agreed to&#x2014;that a boy shall not be allowed to do street trading before he is fourteen&#x2014;should be made to apply until he is fifteen. The reasons why I desire to have fifteen instead of fourteen are these. Most boys leave school about the age of fourteen. The critical year for them is the year that immediately follows. Upon the start that they make, whether that start is to be a bad or a good one&#x2014;upon that start the future of the boy is very likely to depend. If we submit a boy to the temptation in that particular year to start some employment otherwise undesirable but which will produce quick returns, we are subjecting him to a temptation of the gravest possible kind.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00676">Boys leave school, as I have said, ordinarily at the age of fourteen, but every effort, by educational authorities, philanthropic authorities, and the rest, is being directed now to getting hold of those boys after they have left school. Boys' clubs, boy scouts
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0144"/>
<col>279</col>
and brigades, all the various agencies of that kind, of the recreative sort, and on the other side evening classes and all that belongs to their possibilities for a lad to-day, are modes which are put into operation for the direct purpose of keeping a hold on the boy just when he is leaving school and starting life. But let a boy undertake street trading, which in five cases out of six means newspaper selling, the evening hours during which he will be employed prevent him from taking advantage of the opportunities we are offering in useful ways. We want to make it easy, and not difficult, for boys to take advantage of the opportunities that we are offering when they leave school. The moment they are in touch with those who are endeavouring to help them in those kinds of ways, whether they be the voluntary agencies or the juvenile labour exchanges, they are in the way of being set on the right road to a suitable mode of earning a livelihood of the right sort. But let them start wrongly, let them be kept outside the possibilities of availing themselves of these agencies, and you are putting these boys in a position of extreme difficulty.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00677">To allow boys to start street trading at fourteen is, in my mind, to run into a danger so grave that it is hardly necessary to refer to it. If any of your Lordships doubt it, refer to the two Reports which are in your hands&#x2014;the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee which dealt with wage-earning children, and the Report upon the half-time system&#x2014;and you will see recognised by every educational and philanthropic authority the peril that belongs to the first year after leaving school. We desire that such boys shall go to work, but that the work shall be of a kind which will lead on to something else; and if any of your Lordships suppose that the kind of occupation which begins with street trading of the sort that this Bill refers to is going to lead on to useful and desirable employment in the years that immediately follow, I would again refer you to those Reports for the answer. Or if, instead of taking these Reports, any of your Lordships would spend an hour one evening outside any great railway station in our large cities and get into touch with the boys who are there and find out what they are expecting to do, you will gain a lesson which will be brimful of interest.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00678">If the boy has left school at fourteen and is prohibited from this particular outlet for
<col>280</col>
his energies during the first year, he will start upon some other line&#x2014;a line which may lead him on to a better kind of employment in the days ahead. There are boys to whom such a risk is comparatively slight, who will make the best of any occupation they are put to and it will lead them on to something higher. I have a letter here which I received yesterday from a clergyman, who must be sixty-five or sixty-six years of age, who says he began his career by selling newspapers at the time of the Crimean War, and that the money he so earned enabled him to go to Oxford and take a degree and led him on to the honoured position he now holds. To generalise from such an instance of courage and perseverance would be foolish. I venture to believe that that particular lad would have found an outlet for his energies in some other department if this particular opening had been closed to him.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00679">But the point I want to press is that it is this one year that really matters. It will make all the difference whether we say fourteen or fifteen in the legislation we are now laying down. I admit the hardship in certain cases, but I am absolutely sure that in the long run we are right if we make this restriction in the way proposed. I venture to hope that we shall have support in this matter from authorities who can speak with the administrative experience which can be afforded by either the Board of Education or the Home Office. I hope we may to-night learn what is the view taken in those quarters of the proposal contained in my Amendment&#x2014;a proposal about which I am absolutely fearless in saying that it is one that ought to be carried if we are intent upon making a good job of the task we have taken in hand in regulating the employment of children at this critical age.</p>

<image src="S5LV0008P0I0145"/>
<col>281</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00683"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think I ought; to make some allusion to an observation which fell from the noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, when this Bill was in Committee. The noble Marquess appealed to Lord Beauchamp, who was then representing the Home Office, to render some assistance to the Committee and to indicate what the Government view on particular Amendments might be. The Home Office are quite prepared to render any assistance they can to the House, and in so far as it is in my power I shall be glad on any Amendment to give whatever assistance the Home Office is in a position to advance. But it must be understood that this is not a Government Bill. The Government are by no means unsympathetic to the principles and the objects contained in this measure; but it is not a Government Bill and the Government cannot be responsible for it. I may point out that there are many provisions, especially those with regard to the regulations which local authorities are to be required to frame, which do not meet with the approval of the Department. I will not anticipate what I shall have to say on that question later, but I should like it to be clearly understood that, although we are prepared to give whatever assistance we can, we are not prepared to take any responsibility for the Bill.<lb/>
The most rev. Primate also made an appeal to us to indicate what the Home Office view was of the Amendment he has just moved. Before I come to that may I say that, as far as my recollection serves me, when this Bill was in Committee a compromise was reached, and that compromise was that fourteen should be the age for prohibition, and I do not know whether it is quite fair to your Lordships&#x2014;although I am quite certain that the most rev. Primate would be the last person to put forward any suggestion which had a semblance of unfairness in it&#x2014;to at this stage reopen that controversy. With regard to the merits of the Amendment itself, the most rev. Primate, of course, speaks with great authority on this subject. He knows as well as any of your Lordships what the dangers are to which boys of this age are exposed, and how important it is that during the early years after they leave school they should be spared the temptation of indulging in street trading. He has argued that point with great ability, and I am sure he will have made a considerable impression upon your Lordships' House.<lb/>
<col>282</col>
At the same time I think it must be borne in mind that the dangerous age is not only between fourteen and fifteen. It is between fourteen and seventeen, and the most rev. Primate only goes a short way in covering that period. I think it is possible to defend the compromise of fourteen which was arrived at the other day on the ground that up to fourteen the lad is really a child, whereas from fourteen to seventeen he is more of a youth and more able in a way to take care of himself. It seems to me that only to go as far as fifteen is not to really grapple with the problem. Either it ought to be seventeen, or else. I think it would be better to keep to the compromise that was reached the other day and leave the age at fourteen. It is, of course, for the House to decide. The Home Office will not commit themselves on this particular Amendment, largely because they cannot commit themselves on the Bill as a whole, and your Lordships must decide whether in the circumstances it is better to stick to fourteen, or whether it would be desirable in the interests of these boys to substitute the age of fifteen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00684"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: With the indulgence of the House I should like to explain that when the matter was discussed the other night it was said, Let it come up again on Report. It was on that distinct understanding that I agreed not to press the matter further then. I was party to no compromise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00685"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to remind the House that when this matter was discussed in Committee it was not so much a question as to whether the age should be fourteen, but the real issue between the noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, and the framers of the Bill was the balance of responsibility between the local authority and the national authority, and whether this should be a matter of prohibition in an Act of Parliament or whether the local authorities should be required to make by-laws dealing with it. The noble Lord who has just spoken, while he washed his hands of the Bill, yet discouraged the House from including this valuable year from fourteen to fifteen. I wish to say that I strongly support the Amendment of the most rev. Primate, and that I consider the year from fourteen to fifteen considerably more important than any other period. This would give to the boy on leaving school a fair chance to start in a decent
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0146"/>
<col>283</col>
employment which would lead to something better, and would exclude him in a great many cases from entering what are called "blind-alley" employments; and if he goes into decent employment at the age of fourteen, he is not likely to break away from it in after life. Those whose position compels them to look at the social, moral, and spiritual welfare of the rising generation feel very strongly the value of this Amendment, and I hope your Lordships will agree to insert it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00686"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not in a position to say what the opinion of the House was when the Bill was in Committee as to any compromise, but I certainly think it was understood that the age should be fourteen. Until a boy is fourteen he is of school age and bound to attend school. The fact that he cannot then devote his entire time to any employment renders him particularly susceptible to take to this particular occupation in the interval between his school hours, and by the time he leaves school he has got accustomed, as it were, to these employments. Therefore the school age of fourteen was agreed to. But when the boy has left school and is free to employ his entire time in one avocation, it is for him to make the selection; and it may seem to many a little hard that he should be debarred from this occupation entirely, when, perhaps, circumstances may lead it to be the only avocation that he can at the time engage in while waiting for some further opportunity. It was with that view that those who urged the age of fourteen acted. It is going into a totally different principle when you prohibit entirely certain occupations from a lad, who has the whole of his time free and is at liberty to take to any occupation he likes. If the principle of the school age&#x2014;namely, up to fourteen&#x2014;is to be given up, I prefer the provision in the original Bill of the noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, with the age of seventeen. If you are going to ban this occupation from boys at the moment they leave school, then I think you had better ban it entirely instead of limiting it for one year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00687"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD REAY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no hesitation in supporting the Amendment of the most rev. Primate. The age of fourteen, when a boy leaves school, is the critical age, the turning point in his career. The object of the Bill is not to prevent
<col>284</col>
him from earning his livelihood, but to guide him into the proper channel of earning it, and it is of the utmost importance that he or his parents should be given this guidance. I speak in this matter with some personal experience, and I think the great value of the Bill will consist in the insertion of this Amendment. Without the Amendment I think the value of the Bill would be very slight.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00688"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who speaks on behalf of His Majesty's Government commenced his statement by assuring the House that he desired to afford us all possible assistance in dealing with this somewhat difficult subject, but I confess that as his speech proceeded I did not gather from it that amount of enlightenment which I had hoped for at first, because what he really most leaned upon was that this was not a Government Bill and that consequently His Majesty's Government could take no responsibility for it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00689"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: The principal assistance we can give the House is to get the Bill into shape. It had got into some confusion owing to the different Amendments proposed, and the Home Office have gone through them with the object of getting the Bill into the shape desired.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00690"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Nevertheless, the noble Lord said very distinctly that the Bill was not a Government Bill and therefore His Majesty's Government took no responsibility for it. But may I venture to suggest that, although it is not a Government Bill, the question is one of policy, and one which His Majesty's Government have much better opportunities for examining than we have on this side of the House. It is quite clear that there is a balance of considerations. On the one hand, we none of us desire to deprive these lads of the opportunity of legitimately earning a little money and thereby contributing to the slender resources of the family. On the other, we do not desire that they should be exposed to the undoubted risks and perils of employment of this kind at a very young age. I venture to think that those are exactly the kind of considerations which the official experts who advise His Majesty's Government should be able to weigh in such a manner as to be able to tell us to which side in their opinion the balance ought to really incline.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0147"/>
<col>285</col>
Being left without guidance, we must decide for ourselves, and I must say I am moved by the arguments of the most rev. Primate and by the arguments which have fallen from other noble Lords who have addressed us, and I am not in the least moved by the argument of the noble Lord on the Front Bench opposite, that if you raise the age to the limit of fifteen you ought logically to go on and raise it to the age of seventeen. There may be a certain amount of logic and consistency in the idea, but it is quite clear that as a question of practical politics you gain something if you can protect these lads from the risks which attend street employment during the first year after they leave school. For these reasons, though I do not profess to have studied the question very carefully, I shall, if the most rev. Primate goes to a Division, certainly give him my vote.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00691"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: With the indulgence of the House may I say, on the question of the alleged compromise, that I had not the honour of representing the Home Office when the Bill was in Committee, and therefore I may have been led to a misunderstanding. But I think some noble Lords were under the impression that there was some compromise.<lb/>
On Question, Amendment agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00692"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member> moved the addition of a new paragraph to Clause 2 with the object of prohibiting the employment of a girl under the age of eighteen years in street trading.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00693">The noble Earl said: The next Amendment deals with the question of girls. During the debate on the Second Reading and also during the discussion in Committee, whatever difference of opinion there might have been as regards the age limit up to which a boy should be prohibited from street trading, there was practical unanimity that girls any rate rate should be prohibited altogether, and for that reason I have put down this Amendment. The effect of my Amendment will be that girls will be prohibited altogether from street trading anywhere or in any place. We are dealing in this Bill with street trading because it is one of the worst of the many occupations that children are engaged in, and we think that as a movement towards a higher standard all round this useless employment might at any rate be excluded in the case of girls altogether. Your Lordships will notice
<col>286</col>
that by an Amendment lower down on the Paper my noble friend Lord Clifford of Chudleigh seeks to deal with the question of girls by means of by-laws, and he restricts those by-laws to municipal boroughs and large towns. It may be better to do this by means of by-laws, but I think that if we are agreed that, so far as girls are concerned, street trading is really an evil, we had much better be done with it altogether and lay down by Statute that it shall be prohibited in their case. My noble friend Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, as I have said, suggests that we should leave it to be dealt with by by-laws, but if we do this we exempt by proviso (2) of Section 3 all girls who are trading with their parents. These are serious inroads on the principle we want to establish. I think we had better accept this Amendment, and let the by-laws deal with boys over the age of fifteen. I hope your Lordships will accept this Amendment, because it is to my mind the simplest way of dealing with the question.</p>

I do not know whether the noble Earl has considered the case of the <i>bona fide</i> costermonger. The Minority Report drew attention to this case. I quite understand the noble Earl's desire to prohibit street trading by girls even with their parents, unless it is a necessary part of their vocation. But in the case of the costermonger, where the family live all together, it is a sort of inherited business. However, this is again a matter for the House to decide.

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00699"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: The next Amendment deals with words which were inserted in the Bill during the Committee stage. The noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, who I am sorry is not in his place to-day, carried an Amendment providing that "street trading does not include the sale of agricultural produce in recognised markets." It is now found that those words would include all the great markets in the large towns. It would include Billingsgate Market, Covent Garden Market, and other markets of that kind. I do not think the noble Marquess intended that. In moving the Amendment the noble Marquess said&#x2014;
<quote>"There is a practice of children living in rural districts being sent by their parents to sell local produce at the markets. That would be street trading within the meaning of the Act. It is a matter of convenience to the parents, and no one can say that it does any harm."</quote>
Of course it does not, but if you extend this provision to recognised markets the intention of the noble Marquess would not be carried out; nor would it be in keeping with the principle of the Bill. I therefore suggest that the words "a rural district" be inserted in the place of "recognised markets." That, I think, would have the effect of carrying out the noble Marquess's intention.</membercontribution></p>

I was present at the Committee stage, and I remember that Lord Salisbury's point was that children living in rural districts do go into markets to sell their produce. It does not in the least follow that those markets are in rural districts. The probability is that they are not. I am not sufficiently a lawyer to know whether the phrase "recognised markets" may not be too large and may not cover a great many places in which it is undesirable that children should go; but I am told that the phrase "a rural district" would probably be construed to mean places over which there is jurisdiction of a rural district council, and if so construed these words would cut out market towns like Shrewsbury, Stratford-on-Avon, Guildford, St. Albans; in fact almost every single market which Lord Salisbury intended to embrace.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00702"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: The term "a rural district" would exclude anything like a small country town. If the noble Earl merely wishes to exclude London markets and other markets in big towns, the words he has proposed to insert in this Amendment would be hardly suitable. At any rate, the Amendment as it stands would have a sweeping character.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00703"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My view is that if the grievance is to be set right it should be done in some definition of what is street trading. Raising the age to eighteen with regard to girls in rural districts may possibly lead to a hardship which was never intended It is the practice in rural districts for small farmers to take into market butter, eggs, and small produce and leave their daughters to sell such produce, or, it may be, to go round the town in many cases. No one would for a moment contend that a practice of this sort amounts to street trading, or carries with it the evils which are attendant upon street trading as we generally know it. But unless some alteration of the definition is made the effect of this Bill as now amended, with the total prohibition in it, would be to prevent that practice. This would be a great drawback, particularly to small farmers. It would also involve some difficulty with regard to children who were going round with their parents, and I think the better way to meet the point would be to make some definition of street trading. Under the Amendment standing in my name later on the Paper it would be entirely in the hands of the local authority to make such by-laws as they thought proper with regard to this practice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00704"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: It seems to me necessary that the two points should be kept distinct. The first question is what this Amendment would do. I think this is a striking instance of what the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition pointed out as the desirability of having a draftsman to deal with this matter who would have behind him the experience of the Home Office. It would not do to adopt the Amendment in its present form, for the reason that the words "a rural district" would practically exclude all the small markets in small towns that are supposed to be protected. I am certainly of opinion that the words "recognised markets" as they stand in the Bill require some further definition, for otherwise they would give an
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0149"/>
<col>289</col>
exemption which seems to me contrary to the scope of the Bill as originally designed. Perhaps some words such as "in market towns" might be inserted to indicate that the great markets in populous towns were not to be places in which this trading could be carried on by children. By adopting the Amendment we are excluding the very class of sale which Lord Salisbury desired to protect, and by adopting the words in the Bill we include a number of cases where this trading ought not to be carried on.</membercontribution></p>

I had some little experience as representing the Home Office in this House, and I cannot call to mind any case where that position was taken up by the Department. In the case of many Bills which they did not support and for which they were not responsible, they insisted that those Bills should leave the House in a form as regards drafting which at any rate carried out the objects aimed at.

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00731"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> moved the insertion of a new clause providing that the Bill should not extend to Ireland. The noble Lord said: The Bill as it now stands amen led is very different from the Act which exists on the Statute-book. The main feature of the Bill as it now appears is its compulsory character. The legislation of 1903 was entirely permissive. By-laws under the Act of 1903 were made at the discretion of the local authorities; by-laws under the Bill now before your. Lordships <i>must</i> be made by the local authorities, no discretion being allowed to them in the matter. That seems to me to be the first broad and salient characteristic of this Bill. But there are other important differences. The Act of 1903, as your Lordships know, excluded children under the age of eleven, and made all girls and boys between the ages of eleven and
<col>294</col>
sixteen liable to take out a licence before they could practice street trading. On the other hand, the Bill now before the House prevents girls under the age of eighteen and boys under the age of fifteen from street trading, and compels boys between fifteen and seventeen to take out a licence before they can practice street trading.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00732">I submit that the Bill as it now stands is a Bill for a rich country, for a country in which primary education is largely developed and is compulsory. It is a Bill which contemplates the existence in the country of large industrial enterprises. I am the last person to doubt that the provisions which your Lordships have now approved are the best that could be adopted in the interests of England. I quite accept the view of the most rev. Primate upon that point. But one of the greatest sources of our ill-success in the government of Ireland is the application to the two countries of the same principles of legislation. Some time ago I read a speech of Mr. Disraeli's which enforced the proposition that if by your legislation you desire to acquire the goodwill and the loyalty of the people of Ireland you must adapt your legislation to the local circumstances.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00733">It was my business for many years to travel constantly between Dublin and London, and I never took that journey without being struck by the great contrast between the poor and squalid streets of Dublin and this grand metropolis. A journey such as that would satisfy any one that laws affecting labour and the means of subsistence could not be equitably applied indiscriminately to both countries. In Ireland the struggle for existence is far more severe than in England, and although I do not contest the accuracy and the applicability of the most rev. Primate's references to this Bill in its application to England, I do think that certain qualifications should be made in its application to the sister country. There are only three towns in Ireland to which this Bill can really apply&#x2014;Dublin, Belfast, and, in a less degree, Cork. I am not one of those who think that the moral dangers in a great town are much less in Ireland than they are in England, taking towns of equal population and of similar circumstances. But from my own knowledge of and observation in Dublin I do think that the dangers which this Bill properly
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0152"/>
<col>295</col>
provides against are appreciably less in Dublin than in, say, London or Liverpool.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00734">The question of the compulsory character of the educational system must also be taken into account. In Ireland education is not compulsory, except in a few isolated localities. If this Bill is applied to Ireland you will not be able to send the children whom you take off the streets to school; still less will you be able to employ them in industrial schools, because it is a sad fact that even in Dublin there is no such thing as a day industrial school. The efforts of many philanthropic people in Dublin were wasted during a series of years in the endeavour to provide an industrial school with the special object of taking boys off the street and sending them there, but all their efforts failed through what I think was the unsympathetic attitude of the Treasury. Unless provision is made so that education shall become compulsory and that industrial schools shall be provided in Ireland, the condition of these children, should such a law as this be enforced, will be worse than before. At present during their day's employment, at all events, they are subject to public notice. If they are exposed to the danger of contracting the habit of betting and so on, at all events they are under the observation of the police, and are kept from worse practices. But if you send them back to the alleys and the back streets from which they come and in which no observation can be kept upon them, these children will be exposed to damages from which they are now immune.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00735">For these reasons&#x2014;because I think that the circumstances of the two countries are entirely different; because I think that in Ireland the Bill can only apply to a very few towns; because in the rest of the country there is no justification for the Bill at the present time&#x2014;I think our policy in Ireland should be to adhere to the present law, to bring pressure to bear upon local authorities to make rules under it, and then see how those rules operate. The Irish circumstances are entirely different from those with which your Lordships are dealing to-night. I trust that the noble Earl who has charge of the Bill will take these points into consideration, and that he will agree to exclude Ireland from the provisions of the Bill.</p>

To begin with, the principal Act of 1903 was never intended to apply to Ireland. I believe it was only at the last moment that a Member of the House of Commons suggested that it should be made to apply to Ireland, and without another word his suggestion was adopted. I understand, however, that the Act has been a dead letter in Ireland ever since it was passed into law. Again, I know full well&#x2014;alas&#x0021;&#x2014;that in Ireland education is not so advanced as in England, Scotland, or Wales. There are no such things as evening schools in Ireland. There is no machinery like we have in England for guiding children into proper channels of employment, and altogether I do not think that Ireland is sufficiently advanced for legislation of this character. Therefore I am not going to oppose the Amendment. But I do hope that the time is not far distant when we shall be able to deal with this question of street trading in Ireland, and bring that country into line with the rest of the United Kingdom.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00739"><member>LORD AMBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say a word on this Amendment, partly because I am an Irishman, and partly because I find myself unable to accept all that was said by Lord Mac-Donnell. I agree that the circumstances of Ireland are different in many respects from those of this country, but the people are extremely intelligent, acute, and resourceful, and this may to some extent make up for what is said to be their want of education. I am sorry that in the description which the noble Lord gave of Dublin he used an epithet which I am entirely unable to accept. He spoke of Dublin as "poor, dirty and squalid." Why, it is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. Some of the streets of Dublin could compare with those of any city. I do not dwell on the Liffey. But we have Sackville-street, two noble Cathedrals, an old University and a new University, and a great park which is the admiration and

envy of many of the greatest cities in England.<lb/>
What strikes me in regard to this Bill is that it is much more likely to pass if Ireland is omitted from its scope than if Ireland is included, and that is a very practical way of looking at the question. I am in favour of many of the clauses in the Bill, and I think they might be applied to Ireland with advantage. But the Bill is, I believe, unpopular in Ireland, and from what I have heard it is most unpopular in that part of the country with which the noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, is best acquainted. In this matter one has to consider, not only the Bill, but its chances of passing into law. I am aware that Irish criticism is very resourceful, and if there is dissatisfaction about a Bill extending to Ireland rarely is that Bill received in silence; and I am disposed to think that, in accepting the Amendment, the noble Earl has substantially increased the prospect of the Bill passing in another place.</membercontribution></p>

It is a difficult thing for any private member of this or the other House to deal with drafting Amendments to a Bill which amends old Statutes, but it is a very easy thing for the Home Office, with the advisers they have at their command, to look through a Bill and put down on Third Reading the few Amendments which may be necessary to make the Bill consistent with itself.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE ROYAL NAVAL RESERVE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00747"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member> rose to call the attention of His Majesty's Government to the position of the Royal Naval Reserves, and to the new restrictions in respect to drill regulations which are imposed upon officers of the Royal Naval Reserve; to ask whether His Majesty's Government have taken into regard the serious obstacles which are now placed in the way of officers' of the Royal Naval Reserve putting in the requisite drills, whereby the efficiency of this force may be seriously impaired and the supply of officers considerably reduced; whether His Majesty's Government will now consider the advisability of revising the drill regulations so that reasonable facilities may be provided for officers of merchant ships performing their drills as officers of the Royal Naval Reserve; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00748">The noble Lord said: My Lords, according to the Navy Estimates we find that the anticipated total expenditure on the Royal Navy for the forthcoming year amounts to &#x00A3;44,392,500, being a net increase on the past year of &#x00A3;3,788,800. The steps which His Majesty's Government have taken in still further strengthening our Naval Service and the increased expenditure necessitated have met with opposition so small as not to be worthy of notice, and I am especially assured by the seafaring community of the country that more extensive provision for our maritime supremacy and safety on the high seas would have been received and welcomed with enthusiasm. But I do not propose to dwell upon the Government's arrangements regarding the Navy so much as to comment on the apathy they display in ensuring that that which is of quite equal importance&#x2014;a thoroughly efficient and numerically strong Naval Reserve&#x2014;shall be established and maintained as our first
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0154"/>
<col>299</col>
reserve for the depletion or probable lack of supply of men for our ships of war whenever the time may arrive when we shall find it imperative to put them into action.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00749">As I have mentioned, we are spending approximately forty-four and a half millions on the maintenance of our Navy. Our Royal Naval Reserves represent five different factors&#x2014;first, the Royal Naval Reserve; second, the Royal Fleet Reserve; third, the Royal Naval Volunteers; fourth, the Reserve of Retired Officers; and, fifth, the Auxiliary Royal Naval Sick Berth Reserve. Upon the whole of these we are spending the comparatively small sum of, approximately, &#x00A3;388,000 per annum, and presumably the Government are satisfied that the requisite increased efficiency in these several forces will be met by the increase on the past year of &#x00A3;15,500, which, in a comparative sense, means no increase at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00750">I am aware that it is a favourite argument with many who are connected, in one way or another, with the Royal Navy, that as a matter of fact there is no real need of the existence of any Naval Reserves whatever; in fact, during the late First Sea Lord's period of office it was commonly said that, provided he had his own way, he would have abolished the Royal Naval Reserve. If such an opinion is correct; then why in the name of logic do we throw away even the comparatively small sum of &#x00A3;388,000 when there is no necessity for doing so? But, my Lords, I hope that such a preposterous notion will not be entertained for one moment. Should it so happen that a naval vessel be sunk or captured in action, then, obviously, it means the loss of the services of a number of men; and there are many unforeseen emergencies in time of war where there is certain to be a considerable depletion of officers and men who may either be killed or set aside by wounds, injuries, or the overwhelming physical strain imposed upon them. Again, a naval action might be fought successfully and yet it would by no means follow that it would terminate the war. So far as I am able to judge I am considerably in doubt as to whether, even at present, the Royal Navy possesses its full numerical strength of men. But assuming that it does, it would soon require many more when once a naval war was waged by this country.</p>
<col>300</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00751">In the ships of our mercantile marine we have an immense amount of splendid material which is quite unavailed of by the Government. In addition to keeping up the present Royal Naval Reserves it is imperative that steps should be taken in strengthening those forces in any and every possible way, and every effort should be centred in the direction of availing ourselves of the services of qualified British merchant shipmasters, officers, and men who, given the necessary facilities and encouragement, would be only too glad to loyally co-operate and give what services and assistance they could in adding to the stability of the naval position of the Empire. I would most certainly commend these proposals to the serious consideration of His Majesty's Government, for, otherwise, they will discover when too late what a terrible mistake has been made. In war time there would be no Reserves of any strength to draw upon in filling up the gaps, and no means of securing the ready services of a great number of men whose practical seafaring experience would be of the greatest value in the hour of peril to the nation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00752">Coming to the second part of my Question, I propose, in as few words as possible to bring before your Lordships the new regulations which have been adopted by the Admiralty in connection with the drills which must be performed by those officers of our merchant ships who hold commissions as officers in the Royal Naval Reserve. As no doubt you are aware, under the old system there were certain stationary naval ships, mostly of the old wooden type, at the different leading seaports, which were set apart for the purpose of drill ships for Royal Naval Reserve officers and men. For instance, there were such ships as the "President" in London, the "Eagle" in Liverpool, and other ships at Bristol, Dundee, and elsewhere. It was on these ships that the Royal Naval Reserve officers were able to put in their drills whenever the opportunity arose. But these ships were notoriously obsolete, though this was not of the greatest consequence, except for the fact that the appliances which were provided by the Admiralty for the purpose of training the officers and men were also hopelessly obsolete. And besides this the appointment of a naval officer to the command of these drill ships was invariably a sort of polite hint to him that, on the completion
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0155"/>
<col>301</col>
of his term, the Admiralty would have no further use for his services on the Active List of the Royal Navy. Fully aware of this, the Admiralty themselves might have had the sense to know that under such circumstances an officer was not likely to throw that zeal and enthusiasm into a most important command which otherwise he would have done, so it is not surprising that in certain cases these commands have merely amounted to a sinecure, as is well known by only too many Royal Naval Reserve officers who have performed drills of late years. I cannot understand why the Admiralty have not followed the practice of the War Office, who transfer to positions of this kind in connection with the Territorial Forces young and ambitious officers who know that the results of their energy and specialised training in ensuring the efficiency of the men of the Auxiliary Forces with which they are connected will likely have considerable effect on their future promotion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00753">Returning to the new regulations, the position is that the old stationary ships have now been abolished, and officers of the Royal Naval Reserve must put in their drills on board ships in commission attached to the home Fleet. Looking at the matter in a superficial light it would appear that, so far as efficiency is to be considered, such a form of drill and training is immeasurably superior to drilling on obsolete vessels permanently stationed at one port or another. Personally speaking, even though a stationary vessel may herself be obsolete, I cannot see why training of the most excellent character cannot be provided on board of her&#x2014;that is, if she is furnished with all the latest and most up-to-date naval equipment and appliances, and commanded by an officer on the Active List of the Royal Navy who is not about to retire, and whose further advancement rests largely on the efficiency of the material which he is able to turn out of such a ship. But even admitting what appears to be the opinion of the Admiralty, that, training in a ship attached to the Home Fleet is much more advantageous, still I contend that the new regulations are utterly mistaken and wrong. In matters of this kind it is not only the Navy itself which must be considered, but the special circumstances arising in the merchant service and the particular positions in which the officers of our merchant ships are placed. It is a very difficult matter indeed for these officers
<col>302</col>
temporarily to relinquish their positions, even for a few days, and though our ship-owners are expected to loyally and cordially co-operate in promoting the efficiency of the Royal Naval Reserve, and are actuated by the best desires&#x2014;a spirit which, I am sorry to say, is getting less and less common&#x2014;they are frequently unable to make arrangements to suit their officers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00754">Under the old system of stationary drill ships, particularly so when they were stationed in large seaports, such as London, or Liverpool, it was not such a very difficult matter, especially if things were done as systematically as is possible where ships are concerned, to arrange that officers should temporarily leave their ships to put in drills on the Royal Naval Reserve drill ship. Whilst there they were always within call of their owners, who, realising this, were able to grant officers permission or temporary leave to put in drills, when, as the position stands now, they certainly would not do so on the ground that their officers would be quite out of call. Then again the officers themselves have a natural reluctance to go away to put in drills when there is a possibility that they may at any moment he required for promotion in their company, or some arrangements may be made in their absence which may not admit of their returning, on completing their drills, to the positions they have occupied.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00755">I am in possession of a statement signed by very nearly thirty commissioned officers of the Royal Naval Reserve, many of them holding the highest positions in the merchant service, and I am assured by the Imperial Merchant Service Guild and by others that it represents the views of practically the whole of the officers of the Royal Naval Reserve. This statement has been placed in my hands by the Guild, who, naturally, have a strong interest in this great question, and I think the Admiralty would be exercising a very wise discretion were they to consult with the Guild before deciding upon important changes in connection with the Royal Naval Reserve, which is, of course, confined to merchant service officers and men. These officers of the Royal Naval Reserve, in their statement, comment upon what they term the "extreme difficulties" they have to contend with in order to perform the annual or biennial drills under the new system of drill&#x2014;i.e., that of drilling on a sea-going ship attached to the nearest naval dep&#x00F4;t.
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0156"/>
<col>303</col>
In the case for instance of Liverpool, the nearest dep&#x00F4;t would be Chatham, which is a place very far removed from our great northern seaport. These officers urge that owing to the circumstances of their employment it is absolutely impossible for the majority of them to find an opportunity to do twenty-eight consecutive days' drill at any time, whilst only on rare occasions can they obtain sufficient leave of absence from their employers in order to drill the minimum period, which is fourteen days. They point out, very properly I think, that this cannot tend to efficiency. They also wish to point out that, although they are allowed travelling expenses and messing allowance, there are many incidental expenses which make the new system much more expensive than the old, when with few exceptions they lived at home and performed their drills during the day, between the hours of 9.30 a.m. and 3.20 p.m. They suggest that the Admiralty should provide officers of the Royal Naval Reserve with seagoing drill ships to be stationed in the vicinity of certain of our large seaports, the officers drilling to be allowed the option of living either aboard or ashore out of drill hours. Such an arrangement, they believe, would tend to raise the standard of efficiency in the Royal Naval Reserve and would certainly enable many more officers to perform their drills regularly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00756">Some years ago, after being for a long time in a moribund state, the Royal Naval Reserve became "all the rage" in the merchant service, and many of the leading shipping firms took pride in their officers being also officers of the Royal Naval Reserve. Nowadays it is far different. Our shipowners have no real encouragement from the Admiralty; they have experienced the greatest difficulty in enabling their officers to put in their drills and their service in the Navy; and, as matters stand at present, the letters "R. N. R." count for nothing like what they did in years gone by. This is not only unfortunate, but a very unhealthy sign. There seems to be nobody at the Admiralty who will make a speciality of the importance of our Naval Reserves, and who will initiate a firm and vigorous policy which will, once and for all, eradicate what at present constitutes a grave national weakness. I would certainly urge that under the new <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> at the Admiralty some immediate alterations should be decided upon in respect to the present Naval Reserve drill regulations,
<col>304</col>
and I move that His Majesty's Government lay on the Table what Papers are at their disposal containing the reason or reasons for instituting such great changes when they are so very injurious to our national interests.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00757"><i>Moved,</i> That there be laid before the House Papers relating to the position of the Royal Naval Reserve, and to the new restrictions in respect to drill regulations which are imposed upon officers of the Royal Naval Reserve.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Muskerry.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00758"><member>LORD INVERCLYDE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with a great deal of what the noble Lord has said I agree, but on one point I cannot follow him, and that is with regard to drill for officers of the Royal Naval Reserve. We in the mercantile marine value very highly indeed any opportunity we get for employing officers and men who have been in the Royal Naval Reserve. Our feeling is that these men, by going to sea and serving in fleets along with officers of His Majesty's Navy, are very much improved in the way of discipline and smartness. Unfortunately, in the merchant service we have not much legal power in regard to discipline, and on that point alone I do not agree with the noble Lord in regard to drill. But on the whole subject I say with him that we in the merchant service would be only too pleased if we could get more Naval Reserve men to employ than at present. The company with which I am connected are searching now for officers in the Royal Naval Reserve, and we will employ any young officer in the Naval Reserve whom we can get; and if His Majesty's Government could see their way to increase the number of officers in the Royal Naval Reserve it would be very greatly appreciated in the merchant service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00759"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has brought this subject to your Lordships' notice this afternoon has dealt very severely with the policy of the Admiralty. In fact, he told us that one First Lord went the length of wishing to abolish the Royal Naval Reserve altogether.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00760"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member><membercontribution>: What I said was that that was commonly stated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00761"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: I can only say that I can imagine nothing further from the wish of any First Lord, for there can be no doubt that the Admiralty fully
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0157"/>
<col>305</col>
realise the great advantage of this Reserve. It is possessed of splendid material, and the men are a valuable adjunct to our naval strength. The noble Lord took strong exception to the new regulations which the Admiralty have seen fit to issue with regard to the training of these officers. As the noble Lord pointed out, in the past these drills were carried out in obsolete ships and on what were called Royal Naval Reserve batteries. It can hardly be contended that the training on these batteries and on obsolete ships, even with the most modern appliances, can be in any way comparable to the training which is now given to Royal Naval Reserve officers on board sea-going ships of one of the divisions of the Home Fleet; and I contend that the new regulations are not more onerous and difficult for intending Royal Naval Reserve officers. For under the new regulations what do we ask these officers to do? We ask them during their first three years of service to do twenty-eight days in a sea-going ship.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00762"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member><membercontribution>: Each year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00763"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: Yes, each year during the first three years. But if they are able to get a test certificate before that time we only ask them to comply with the second condition, which is that they should do fourteen days every alternate year; and I may say, in passing, from information given to me by the Admiral commanding the Coast Guards, that this period of fourteen days is further reduced when any officer gives good and sufficient reasons for not being able to do the whole fourteen days. In those conditions we only ask them to do seven days, provided that during that period they requalify for the test certificate. I do not think it can be denied that the training given to the officers now is much superior to that given in old days.<lb/>
It is all very well for the noble Lord to say that officers living ashore should do their drills on obsolete battleships lying up in harbours, but what the Admiralty want is thorough efficiency. They want an officer of the Royal Naval Reserve to be able, in case of war, to take his place with the Regular officers of the Royal Navy, and I do not think that that condition of efficiency could be arrived at unless those officers were thoroughly trained in the general routine of a man-of-war. For these reasons the Admiralty do not see their way to modify in
<col>306</col>
any way the regulations which they have made. I may say, on the question of officers, that I have been in communication with the Admiral commanding on this point and he tells me that there is no shortage of officers of the Royal Naval Reserve in consequence of the new drill arrangements; in fact, the Admiralty can get as many candidates for commissions as officers in the Royal Naval Reserve as they want. One great advantage of the new scheme of drill is that the Regular naval officers have been able to gauge the efficiency of each Reserve officer on board ship; and the Admiral commanding tells me that the efficiency as a whole has been uniformly satisfactory, and that under the old system it was quite impossible to arrive at this goal.<lb/>
As to the remarks which were made by Lord Inverclyde, the Admiralty recognise that all the great companies, such as the company with which the noble Lord is connected, have done everything in their power to foster this scheme of Naval Reserve officers, and I am sure it would be the wish of the Admiralty that I should return their grateful thanks to the shipowners for their efforts to make the Royal Naval Reserve the success it is to-day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00764"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is quite clear that the conditions with regard to the training of the Royal Naval Reserve officer are somewhat harder now than they used to be, but the new conditions tend to greater efficiency. Formerly these Reserve officers had no opportunity of acquiring knowledge of the internal economy of a warship. It is, of course, desirable that they should, when called upon in case of emergency, be able to step on board ship, take command of men, and be useful at once. This, again, is not possible unless they have become acquainted with the internal economy of a ship and the manner in which duties are performed, and that cannot be obtained without a residence for some days on board a sea-going ship. I am glad to hear from the noble Earl that the number of Naval Reserve officers is not being reduced. I am afraid the harder conditions will tend to reduce them, but I hope the Admiralty will be able to deal in a spirit of liberality with the question of the additional expense to which these officers are put. I am informed that there are a number of incidental expenses not included in their travelling or messing allowances.
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0158"/>
<col>307</col>
I therefore hope the Admiralty will be able to deal liberally in these matters with the officers whose duties they have now made more difficult.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00765"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no one will dispute for a moment that the best training for these officers is on board sea-going ships; but the question is, Can you get the men there? The noble Earl tells me the men can be got, so that is satisfactory. In the circumstances I withdraw my Motion for Papers.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MERCANTILE AUXILIARIES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00767"><member>LORD BRASSEY</member> rose to call attention to the protection of trade by auxiliary cruisers manned by British seamen. The noble Lord said: My Lords, the subject with which I propose briefly to deal especially calls for consideration in view of the recent discussions on the Declaration of London. Among the objections urged by the Chambers of Commerce to the Declaration none was more strongly insisted upon than the increased danger to British shipping from the conversion of foreign merchant steamers into cruisers. We have a vast shipping to protect. The steamers over 2,000 tons on Lloyd's Register number 2,600 under the British flag, as against Germany, 270; France, 97; the United States, 38. For the protection of our vast mercantile marine we look chiefly to the standing Navy. Behind the Navy we need a reserve of merchant cruisers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00768">The policy I desire to commend to your Lordships is not new. It was advocated long ago by the first Lord Inverclyde in an article contributed by him to the <i>Nautical Magazine,</i> and in other very able papers. I cannot put the policy more effectively than by quoting a short passage from Lord Inverclyde's article. He wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"There never was a time in the history of this country when the subject of the efficiency of the Royal Navy occupied a position of greater importance than it does at present."</quote>
This was written many years ago, and it still continues to be the case. Our risks lie in the fact that the fleets of other nations are fast becoming more powerful, and whilst no navy can numerically approach that of this country, yet there are nations in Europe whose fleets combined would
<col>308</col>
undoubtedly give us enough to cope with. How, then, can we strive ahead as the greatest maritime Power and hold our own against the fleets of the world? Not by being satisfied with increasing the strength of the Navy proper, which, owing to the prodigious cost of modern war vessels, can only be done to a comparatively small degree. Other means are ready to hand&#x2014;namely, by utilising the vessels of the mercantile marine.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00769">In former days when I had the honour of serving at the Admiralty the opinion of the naval Lords was strongly in favour of the policy of creating and maintaining a Reserve of mercantile auxiliaries. That policy was highly approved by Sir Frederick Grey, Sir Cooper Key, Sir Anthony Hoskins, and Sir Spencer Robinson; and among naval constructors by the late Sir Edward Reed, and by Sir Nathaniel Barnaby and Sir William White. It was approved by leading shipowners, including, as I have said, Lord Inverclyde. Sir Donald Currie was also prominent on the same side. In the United States the Civil War showed the injury which might be done by a few feeble vessels. As the best means of defence the Secretary of the United States Navy recommended the establishment of lines of ocean-going ships of high speed, capable of conversion into vessels of war. More recently, for the naval operations during the Spanish-American War, auxiliary cruisers were taken up and rendered excellent service.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00770">I may refer to a personal experience. I was serving at the Admiralty at the time of the Penjdeh incident. In view of the possibility of an immediate declaration of War with Russia the Admiralty was compelled to take up vessels at home and abroad. We were severely criticised, but the expenditure was inevitable. The reasons were given by an eminent shipowner, the late Mr. Ismay, in evidence before a Royal Commission. He stated that at the commencement of the Russian scare great temptations were offered to the owners of the White Star steamers running between San Francisco and Japan. Our whole commerce in the Pacific, he added, would have been transferred to the flag of the United States if that offer had been accepted. The lessons of the Russian scare were not lost on our successors at the Admiralty. In 1887, when contracts for the mail service to New York were being
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0159"/>
<col>309</col>
renewed, the Admiralty addressed a letter to the Treasury. They recalled the recent heavy expenditure in retaining fast vessels taken up to prevent their being available for any hostile Power, and they urged that the steamers subsidised to carry mails should be engaged for service as cruisers. In pursuance of the recommendations of the Admiralty a number of vessels were enrolled. When the Atlantic Combine was formed, we had no hold on the ships for which subsidies had been paid. It was resolved to discontinue subsidies and to rely on the power in emergency to take up vessels. The change of policy was ill-judged. Auxiliary cruisers are required, and care should be used in arranging the terms and conditions under which subsidies are granted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00771">The opportunity for supplementing our Navy cruisers with auxiliary vessels will generally offer in connection with contracts for ocean mail services. We have to secure that the subsidised vessels shall be at the disposal of the Government when required. Conditions should be insisted upon as to construction. The subject has on many occasions been discussed at the Institutes of Naval Architects and Civil Engineers. Our ablest constructors have taken part in those discussions, and have been unanimous in the view that auxiliary cruisers may have effective protection. As to cost, in 1903 a Committee was appointed, over which Lord Camperdown presided, to reconsider the principles on which subsidies should be given for mercantile cruisers. The ships were to have a speed of not less than twenty knots, and to be capable of carrying a light armament. For twenty-knot ships the Committee estimated the annual subsidy at &#x00A3;9,000. Cost progresses rapidly with increasing speed. For the defence of commerce extreme speeds are not required. Mail steamers over twenty knots number eight under foreign flags, as against six under the British flag. In steamships of speeds ranging from twenty to seventeen knots, we have an immense preponderance. In conclusion, we have increased the Estimates to an amount never approached in time of peace. Cruisers have absorbed a large proportion of the Shipbuilding Vote, and still they are few for the protection of a commerce which extends to every sea. Our policy should be not to rely on the Navy alone, but to organise a Reserve consisting of the vessels subsidised for swift communication with the States of the outer
<col>310</col>
Empire and for opening up new lines of trade.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00772"><member>LORD INVERCLYDE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I take the opportunity of thanking Lord Brassey for his kindly reference to my father. With what Lord Brassey has said I agree almost entirely. But I think that one cause of the trouble is that the mercantile marine of this country is increasing at such a tremendous rate that His Majesty's Navy are not able to keep pace with it. It is our intention as shipowners, as long as we are able to do so, to maintain our mercantile supremacy. We are perfectly ready to have our ships fitted to meet the requirements of the Admiralty and to be paid for the services we render. But we do not ask to be subsidised. Personally I am not much in love with subsidising lines of steamers. His Majesty's Government already have a call on a number of fast ships, and if it is desired to extend that number I am quite sure that shipowners would endeavour to meet the wishes of His Majesty's Government. I am glad that Lord Brassey has brought this subject forward, as I think it is one of considerable importance towards the maintenance of the commerce and trade of this country on the ocean.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00773"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is one point that has not been considered, I think, by the Admiralty. Where are the armaments of these ships to come from? Are the light guns necessary to repel torpedoes in existence or not It would be extremely wrong for vessels like the "Lusitania" or the "Mauretania" to be sent to sea utterly defenceless against torpedoes and at the mercy of any torpedo vessel which could get near. I think all shipowners who have large and valuable ships should have them so fitted that the guns could easily be put on board. I do not think it necessary for them perpetually in time of peace to carry a large quantity of war stores, but they ought to be originally built to mount guns up to 4in., or at any rate long 12-pounders, and be able to defend themselves from the attack of torpedoes. I doubt very much, however, whether these small guns are in existence, and I think it is a point which might well be considered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00774"><member>LORD INVERCLYDE</member><membercontribution>: As the noble Lord who has just sat down referred to the "Lusitania" and the "Mauretania," I may say that they are fully fitted, and that the guns are in store and could be put on board at very short notice.</membercontribution></p>

<col>311</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00775"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has introduced this subject is well qualified to speak upon it, for from his earliest days he has had the interests of both the Royal Navy and the mercantile marine at heart, and in addition he has held office at the Admiralty in days gone by. When this matter was first brought forward in 1887 the conditions were very different from what they are to-day. There were then on the Atlantic trade two ships, the "Etruria" and the "Umbria," which were known as ocean greyhounds. Their speed was nineteen knots, and there was no regular cruiser with a speed under natural draught of more than sixteen or seventeen knots. The "Etruria" and the "Umbria" had a very large coal capacity, and in addition were free from capture by any regular cruiser owing to their speed. To-day our regular cruisers and those of foreign Powers attain a speed approximating to twenty-five knots per hour, and the only ships in the mercantile marine which exceed that speed are the "Mauretania" and the "Lusitania," of the Cunard Company. It therefore follows as a natural sequence that any armed merchantman that did not exceed the speed of the fastest regular cruiser must, in the course of time, fall a victim to the cruisers.<lb/>
The price paid as subsidies to the Cunard Company some years ago&#x2014;I am speaking from memory but I think my figures are correct&#x2014;exceeded &#x00A3;150,000 per annum, in addition to an advance of over &#x00A3;2,000,000 on advantageous terms. The whole question was gone into by Lord Camperdown's Committee in the year 1903, and that Committee made several suggestions with regard to subsidies; and Mr. Arnold-Forster, who then represented the Admiralty in the House of Commons, stated in reply to a question that the Admiralty would not consider the subsidy of any merchant vessel with a speed of less than twenty-two knots. That I may inform your Lordships is the policy of the Admiralty to-day. The question of paying large subsidies becomes a very expensive one, and if we are to subsidies vessels whose speeds would be comparable to that of cruisers to-day the
<col>312</col>
expense, I venture to think, would be out of all proportion to the results we should receive. If you ask a shipping company to build a ship whose speed is above that of commercial requirements, the Government must pay for it.<lb/>
It may be said that armed mercantile cruisers would be of very great use in parts of the ocean where there are no hostile fast cruisers. I do not think that can be in any way denied; but the Admiralty contend that we have a sufficient number of these vessels at our disposal to-day. Under an agreement with the International Marine Company we have a right of pre-emption for the hire or purchase of British vessels owned by that company, and the Admiralty cannot see their way to enlarge their subsidies any further. As to the observation of Lord Ellenborough, I am glad to be able to inform him that the armaments are ready for all the ships controlled by the Board of Admiralty under the International Marine Agreement.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00822">Amendments <i>reported</i> (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00823"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in asking your Lordships to agree to the insertion, in Clause 2, of the words "and it shall be the duty of the police to remove such offender," I should under ordinary circumstances regard it as my duty to apologies to the House for reviving a discussion on a point on which a Division was taken the other night in Committee; but I venture to think that that Division was taken under rather peculiar circumstances. In the first place, before the House went into Committee I think very few noble Lords were aware that the noble Lord in charge of the Bill intended to agree to, or to move, the omission of these words&#x2014;not, as he explained to the House, because he was anxious to see the words removed, but in consequence of what I think I am not going too far in saying were the orders or threats of the Home Office that unless he consented to this they would prevent the Bill passing into law. We were not favoured on that occasion with any argument whatever on the part of the Home Office. I do not, of course, complain of the words that fell from my noble friend Lord Allendale, who represented the Government on that occasion with the courtesy which he always exhibits, but he told us himself that he represents in this House the Local Government Board and not the Home Office, and that the instructions of the Home Office were to say that they would not have this.<lb/>
The Committee were placed at some disadvantage owing to the unfortunate absence through illness of the noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, who had been Chairman of the Select Committee appointed to consider this Bill; and we were at, perhaps, a still greater disadvantage owing to the equally regrettable absence of Lord Onslow, who could have spoken, from his own knowledge of the countryside, of the nuisance caused by gipsies and van dwellers. There was a third disadvantage that we who supported the original Bill were under on that occasion, because the Second Reading debate took place as long ago as May, 1909, and I think the objects of the Bill were not very fresh in the memory of many members of the House who were present when the Committee stage was taken a few weeks ago. I am not going to weary your Lordships by going into the whole history of this legislation, but I think all parties in your Lordships'
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0163"/>
<col>317</col>
House agreed that there was a considerable evil existing which required legislation. Not only were great inconvenience and loss caused to private individuals in the neighbourhood of open spaces where van-dwellers are in the habit of encamping, but there were far more serious evils of a public nature&#x2014;evils in regard to sanitation and arising from the fires which were lit by these people&#x2014;and I think that all parties were agreed that it would be a good thing that there should be some legislation on the subject.<lb/>
Consequently a Select Committee of your Lordships' House was appointed, of which, as I have said, Lord Salisbury was chairman. That Committee made two recommendations of a concurrent nature. The first was that county councils should be empowered to provide camping grounds where proper sanitation could be enforced, and the concurrent recommendation was that the police were to be authorised, where such camping grounds had been established, to, in the words of the Amendment which I am now submitting to the House, remove offenders when found "squatting" elsewhere. Those were the joint and concurrent recommendations of the Select Committee. In Paragraph 11 of their Report the Select Committee say that wherever a county council consider that van-dwellers are in such numbers as to involve the evils which the Committee describe, they shall be empowered to provide camping ground for them under such conditions as might be prescribed by the Local Government Board; and the Committee go on to say that it would, of course, follow that where this power was exercised and camping grounds provided, the encampment of these people on other places would be prohibited, and that it would be the duty of the police forthwith to see that that was observed. I think the House will agree that these recommendations were of a two-fold and concurrent nature&#x2014;that if camping grounds were to be provided by the county council powers should be given to the police to remove these van-dwellers from other places. Without giving that power the Bill would be absolutely nugatory.<lb/>
Consider for a moment what would be the effect of leaving out these words. Van-dwellers would be offered two alternatives. They might, on payment of the fee mentioned in the Bill, use the county council camping ground, or they might
<col>318</col>
"squat" <i>gratis</i> elsewhere; and is any noble Lord going to suppose for a moment that these people would take the first of those alternatives? Without this power given to the police to remove them, I think I am justified in saying that the Bill would be absolutely useless. I may be told that the Bill as it stands provides a penalty in the event of these van-dwellers not using the county council camping ground. Yes; but the penalty provided by the Bill would not be of the slightest effect. Clause 6 provides that&#x2014;
<quote>"any person guilty of a breach of any order or regulation made under this Act shall on summary conviction be liable to a fine not exceeding forty shillings."</quote>
Summary conviction sounds very attractive, like "justice while you wait," and like the advertisements of quick lunches for City clerks; but from what I know of the law of England there is nothing summary in it.<lb/>
The majesty of the law is a lengthy and slow process, and I believe that as a matter of fact all summary conviction means in this case is that under Clause 6 a summons can be taken out against the person guilty of a breach of the enactment. The summons would be returnable at the next petty sessions, which might be three weeks off, by which time the van-dweller would be sixty or seventy miles off; and it has been demonstrated over and over again that there is immense difficulty in getting these people, even if summonses are served upon them, to turn up at the petty sessions to answer those summonses. These are an exceptional class of persons. They are nameless and homeless "Egyptians," and there is just as much difficulty in serving a summons upon them as there would be in serving a summons on a weasel or any other slippery animal, and when a summons has been served on them there is immense difficulty in getting them to appear. That is why this legislation has been brought in. This power which it is proposed to give to the police is, of course, a little exceptional, but as I have said, this is an exceptional class of people, and the concurrent remedies that were devised by the Select Committee are those which I must venture to ask your Lordships now to re-establish. As the clause at present stands, one remedy has been taken out. Only the camping ground remains; and I respectfully ask your Lordships to re-insert the concurrent remedy provided in the Bill before it was amended in Committee.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00825"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as a member of the Select Committee by whom this Bill was considered, perhaps your Lordships will allow me to say a word on this point. I do not know that I can add very much to the arguments of the noble Lord who has moved the Amendment, because they go to the root of the whole matter. The matter is an extremely simple one, and I do not think you can gainsay my noble friend's argument that if you take away the power of the police to act in this way you destroy the efficacy of the whole Bill. It is not desired in any way to act harshly towards these van-dwellers. The Report of the Select Committee states that the policy of driving van-dwellers off the face of the earth does not commend itself to the Committee. They say that wherever a county council consider that these van-dwellers are in such numbers as to involve the evils described the council should be empowered to provide camping grounds where it would be possible to enforce regulations; and if the regulations were not observed, then that the police should have power forthwith to prevent these evils happening. I know it is said that before the police step in there should be a decision of a legal tribunal. But I would point out that in certain cases, for instance in the regulation of traffic and matters of that sort, where very clear rules are laid down for the public guidance, if any person is caught obviously infringing the rules the police can at once interfere for the general convenience and the general good. I earnestly hope that your Lordships will take that point into consideration, and will support my noble friend's Amendment giving the police power to interfere where necessary for the public convenience and the public good.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00826"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel that, representing the Home Office, I ought to make a few observations on the Amendment which Lord Hylton seeks to reintroduce into the Bill. Your Lordships will remember that these words were cut out in Committee as the result of a Division. I do not know whether the noble Lord who has moved this Amendment and the noble Lord who has just sat down quite appreciate the
<col>320</col>
importance of the provision which they seek to insert. Its effect would be to create a new liability to arrest without warrant, and that is entirely contrary to the modern practice of Parliament except in cases of very serious crime; and I may say that in the case of all Private Bills where such a provision exists the Home Office on behalf of the Government always object to the insertion of such a clause. Further, Parliament itself has steadily refused to put into any recent Act such a provision as the noble Lord here seeks to introduce. So that when Lord Zouche said it was a very simple matter I venture to think he did not fully appreciate how serious a principle this Amendment would affect. In this case the objection is intensified because you do not seek to discriminate against a particular class of crime; you discriminate against a particular class of individual&#x2014;namely, the van-dweller&#x2014;and to do so seems to me not only most undesirable but most unjust. The noble Lord who moved this Amendment imagines that without the insertion of these words the Bill would be nugatory.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00828"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I think, however, I shall be able to show the noble Lord that that is very far from being the case. In the first place, the police would, of course, co-operate with the local authorities in enforcing this law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00829"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: May I ask the noble Lord how?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00830"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I will explain in a moment. They will, as I say, co-operate, and this offence will be one which is punishable on summary conviction. That in itself is a great advance on the present state of the law in regard to trespass. But observe what this proposal means. I would remind your Lordships that it applies not only to public land, but also to private land. By Clause 2, subsection (2), it is made applicable to any land in private occupation where camping takes place without the permission of the occupier of such land, so that the proposal cannot be defended on public grounds alone as if it applied only to public commons. The noble Duke asked me in what way the police would be able to assist local authorities in carrying out this law. I would draw his attention to the fact that the police
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0165"/>
<col>321</col>
habitually assist in enforcing the provisions of by-laws made by county councils. I have before me a list of county council by-laws in common form. They are very numerous, and include a great variety of subjects. For instance, they deal with music near houses, music near churches, noises by excursionists, noisy hawking, touting, street betting, shooting galleries, threatening language, fighting, nuisances contrary to public decency, wilful jostling, loitering at church doors&#x2014;there are a host of things which form the subject of county council by-laws, and in these cases the police habitually assist the county councils in seeing that proper effect is given to the by-laws, and of course it would be their duty in this case to perform a similar office.<lb/>
This Bill, as I said just now, marks a very great advance upon the present law of trespass. How great your Lordships will know, because under the present law it is extremely difficult to get any legal assistance in removing trespassers. I believe that the owner has to do the removing himself, and all that the police can do is to see that there is no violence and no breach of the peace. Anyhow the position of the private owner, and, indeed, of the public authority at the present moment, is not a very strong one. This Bill strengthens it immensely, for it will be possible for an occupier, whether a private individual or a local authority, to obtain a definite remedy at petty sessions.<lb/>
One word with regard to Lord Hylton's objection on the ground that these individuals were by the very character and nature of their calling difficult to get at. He used language to the effect that they were "here to-day and gone to-morrow." Well, if they are gone to-morrow the object is attained. That is exactly what we seek to achieve, and I think as far as that is concerned we shall not suffer very much from the omission of this provision. But, of course, all migratory persons come under the same category, and it is one of those difficulties which are inherent in the case. But I do appeal to the noble Lord very strongly not to press this Amendment. The Home Office take a very serious view of it. It has been the practice of Parliament for many years to object, with the greatest regularity, to the insertion of any such provision, and I think this case is hardly sufficiently serious to warrant Parliament in making a new departure in principle.</membercontribution></p>
<col>322</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00831"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: Do the Home Office really contend that these are not an exceptional class of people? Why, this is exceptional legislation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00832"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, whether you insert this provision or not is a matter entirely for your Lordships. I only rise to correct a mistake which was made by the noble Lord who spoke on behalf of the Home Office. The noble Lord said that this Amendment would justify arrest without warrant. It does nothing of the kind. It simply enables the police to move people on. These words would give them no additional power of arrest. If this had been a proposal empowering arrest, there would have been a great deal in the objection. I do not say whether the provision is necessary or not, but certainly it does not affect the power to arrest.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00833"><member>LORD FARRER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would remind the House that the Select Committee who considered this Bill, and of which I was a member, were unanimously of opinion that some power of this sort is necessary, and that the police are practically the only people who can preserve our commons, which are so essential for the health and benefit of the inhabitants of London, from this evil. The evil is really worse on those great stretches of common that surround London, and the Select Committee were very much impressed with the growth of the evil of recent years. I can say from my own experience, living in Surrey, that I cannot now allow my own children to go out on the Downs. My poorer neighbours are equally unable to let their children go alone on to these wastes and commons, and I look with the utmost apprehension to the loss of these great playgrounds around London. Every coroner in the county in which I live has called attention to this great evil. Only a month ago a child was burned to death in one of these vans, and the senior coroner of the county said&#x2014;
<quote>"These people who encamped on commons were a perfect curse and nuisance to the community. He had over and over again made strong remarks as to the way in which these roving classes were allowed to occupy tents and caravans without any supervision whatever. They lived under most insanitary conditions, and he thought it was a national matter to see whether something could not be done to stop this state of things."</quote>
The matter came up at the meeting of the Surrey County Council on Tuesday, and
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0166"/>
<col>323</col>
I believe the council were unanimous in thinking that the police are the only persons who can deal with this matter. Unfortunately, owing to a technical objection the particular motion could not be carried, but I have a letter from the chairman of the county council, in which he says that I am more than justified in stating that the council were practically unanimous in favour of having the police as the regulating authority in these particular cases. As has been pointed out by the Lord Chief Justice, the words do not refer to arrest but to removal. All we are anxious for is that there should be some power to remove these people. Before you can serve an injunction these people are away, and the only method of effectively dealing with them is to remove them off the common. Therefore I hope the Government will consider whether some words cannot be inserted which would at any rate give power to the police to co-operate in a more definite way than they do now.</membercontribution></p>

It is bad enough to be governed in this country by bureau, but at least they might know something about their business. Is it the opinion of the Home Office that if an owner or the commoners can move on people occupying the common the whole object is attained?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00837"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: They have their remedy at petty sessions. Summary jurisdiction acts in this case.</membercontribution></p>
<col>324</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00838"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: I will come to that in a moment. The noble Lord says that if the power existed of moving these people on the object would be attained. Therefore the Home Office appear to be perfectly unaware that the state of things which exists in counties like the county of Surrey is that you have a continuous stream of these people coming often daily and trespassing in this way. I will tell the noble Lord of a case in Surrey. A gentleman affected told me that the whole of the area near his house was made positively insanitary by the number of people who "squatted" there all the winter in succession. If the object were attained by moving these people on, we should never have had a Movable Dwellings Bill at all.<lb/>
The noble Lord who represents the Home Office next said that these persons could be summoned at petty sessions. That is something like telling a farmer that he can prevent damage from sparrows by putting salt upon the birds' tails. These people whom you are going to summon to petty sessions are off before you can catch them. Do you think it is practicable to track them all over a county and bring them before petty sessions for punishment? Moreover, the object is not the punishment of these unhappy people. The object is the correction of their mode of life, and the gradual conversion of their present nomad habits into something of a more permanent character. The whole feeling of the Select Committee was, as Lord Hylton has already said, strongly against hunting these people from place to place, and the object we had in view in recommending the formation of encampments was to avoid having to hunt them from place to place. I would impress upon the House that the recommendations of the Committee are useless unless you give some power of this kind.<lb/>
I do not know what the noble Lord meant when he referred to the action of the police under by-laws passed by county councils. If the police can under the by-law of a county council move these people off the land&#x2014;if the noble Lord will tell us that that power is given to the police, then it will meet our point. But we believe that whatever assistance the police may have to give to county councils under their by-laws, it will not include the power of removing these people from the ground on which they
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0167"/>
<col>325</col>
are, and that is the one thing which alone can make the provisions in this Bill operative. The original form of the Bill was that all these dwellers or the habitations which they occupy should be registered, and that is the strong feeling of a great many of the magistrates and those most acquainted with the subject in the counties. The Select Committee came to the conclusion that, however desirable, this was not possible for various reasons with which I need not now detain your Lordships, and we fell back upon the system of encampments as an alternative.<lb/>
Encampments are awkward things for those who live in the vicinity. We did not conceal from ourselves that fact. I know perfectly well that landlords will be reluctant to give ground for encampments, and I am certain that the tenants of those landlords will be even more inclined to oppose encampments. Therefore a landlord will not only have to get over his own reluctance, but he will have to overcome the reluctance of his tenants before county councils are granted land for these encampments. But if van-dwellers are to have the same opportunity as now of occupying the roadside, the commons, or waste lands, and private land, and we are to fall back on the only remedy which we have at present, then none of these encampments will be formed and the Bill will become nugatory. I must say I think it is making fools of the members of a Select Committee of this House if they are called upon to sit and consider a question all round and hear the evidence of the Home Office, and are then to be told that they are to be over-ridden by the dictum of a bureau which is evidently totally unacquainted with the conditions of the subject. If this Amendment cannot be adopted, or something equivalent, I for one shall vote against the Third Reading of the Bill, for I will not be a party to putting an absolutely useless measure on the Statute book.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00839"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot help thinking that the noble Duke proves too much. No doubt it would be an extremely convenient thing for us all if our private rights could be enforced at our request by the police on demand, but that is not the law of this country, and if it were the duties of the police would become overwhelming. I think it was a sense of that truth that led your Lordships in Com-
<col>326</col>
mittee to come to what seems to me to be the wiser decision of omitting the words in this Amendment.<lb/>
It is no doubt true, as the noble and learned Lord opposite said, that this is not technically and in terms a proposition to confer upon the police a right to arrest for trespass, but it comes to very much the same thing if you look at the clause. Under the Bill it is proposed to create a new offence. If a county council has provided sufficient land for a camping ground, then anybody who encamps, contrary to that provision, upon other ground, upon either a common or waste land or upon the land of a private proprietor, commits a new offence which is created under this Bill, and for that offence the Bill proposes to exact a penalty. But before you can tell whether sufficient land has been provided and establish that an offence has been committed, you have to go in the ordinary way before a Court of summary jurisdiction. Otherwise, who is to tell whether an offence has been committed? Who knows whether sufficient land has been provided or not? The matter is <i>in dubio.</i> You have the ordinary remedy which you possess in all other cases. You may establish that an offence has been committed, and then the penalty is exacted. But the proposition here is to get the police in aid of the right which every one has to remove trespassers if he can do so without a breach of the peace. It is the right of a private owner of land to remove trespassers, but he is not entitled to call in the assistance of the police except where he is threatened with a breach of the peace in the exercise of his right to remove.<lb/>
But this Amendment goes far beyond that: It proposes that while the matter is <i>in dubio,</i> before it is established that an offence has been committed and simply because people have "squatted" upon the ground, the police may be called in to enforce the provisions of the by-law. The Home Office have always taken up the ground that it is very undesirable to cast new duties of this kind upon the police. This has been the settled practice of the Home Office under successive Governments for some years. It was upon this that in Committee you came to the decision that the words should not be inserted, and I venture to suggest to your Lordships that the decision you came to in Committee on the 2nd of this month is the wise course, the sound course, and the one which is in accordance with the common
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0168"/>
<col>327</col>
law of the land. We should not, merely on the ground of sentiment, disturb what is the settled practice in our legislation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00840"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry I cannot concur with my noble friend who has just addressed your Lordships, because I think he has completely answered his own objection. What is quite true is that for the mere prevention of civil trespass you cannot call in a constable, whose duty is to preserve the peace. But the noble Viscount has answered his own objection, because he has said that this particular Bill makes trespass by these people an offence, and if an offence is committed in the sight of a constable he has a right to interfere. It seems to me that the Home Office have not sufficiently considered what they are doing when they set themselves against the preservation of the law and the preservation of the peace by the police. I confess that when I see what the attitude of the Government is&#x2014;and their view apparently is that they do not want to have these duties fastened upon the police&#x2014;I rather doubt the wisdom of insisting upon this Amendment, because if it is insisted upon I am afraid that in another place the Government would prevail upon their supporters there to refuse to acquiesce in this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00841"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the history of this Bill is rather peculiar and interesting, and as all your Lordships have probably not read the proceedings of the Select Committee fully I would like to dwell upon them for a moment. The Bill was introduced two years ago by Lord Clifford of Chudleigh. It was then a Bill which provided for every sort of inconvenience in the matter of the registration and licensing of these unfortunate people, and I have a recollection that the Second Reading of the Bill as it then stood passed this House with general approval, and, so far as I can recall, mine was the only voice which vas raised in opposition to it. Then a Select Committee was appointed on which I had the honour of sitting, and while on the one hand the Select Committee as a whole came to the conclusion that there was not a sufficient case for the extremely drastic provisions of the Bill as then introduced&#x2014;the provisions as to registration, licensing, and so on&#x2014;on the other hand every member of the Committee was convinced that there was some case for legislative interference, and that there was a distinct nuisance with which
<col>328</col>
Parliament was entitled to deal. As a result of these deliberations, the Select Committee put forward a series of recommendations and amended the Bill in the form in which it was re-introduced this year.<lb/>
It is perfectly true to say, as was stated by the Duke of Northumberland, that the right to remove is really an essential part of the scheme of the Committee as put before this House, and that if you take that right away you destroy the scheme of the Committee. The mischief which was represented to the Committee as existing was that these people moved up and down the country committing various offences and were generally a nuisance, and that you could not deal with them by the ordinary law, because, in the first place, if you took their names and addresses they would probably prove false; in the second place, you probably could not serve a summons at all; and, in the third place, if you did there would be no appearance at the petty sessions. The Committee, being satisfied that there was a mischief, had to devise some kind of remedy that would inflict less hardship and less annoyance on these people than registration and licensing. They therefore came unanimously to the decision that encampments should be established where people could properly encamp under efficient supervision and sanitary conditions. But it is an obvious and necessary correlative to establishing these camping grounds that you should prevent unauthorised camping elsewhere. It is not a matter of sentiment.<lb/>
Let us consider what the facts are. You have a piece of waste land, say, in Surrey, and on a certain night A and B arrive there in caravans and camp upon the land. The policeman is not to remove them, but to take their names and addresses. He has to chance whether they are correctly given. Having taken the names and addresses he is to go away and get a summons. The people arrived at six o'clock at night, but when the policeman returns to serve the summons at eleven o'lock the next morning they will have gone.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00842"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: How could he remove them any quicker?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00843"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: But though they have gone they have done the very mischief
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0169"/>
<col>329</col>
you want to avoid. They have camped there for the night, and may have been engaged in picking up stray chickens, &amp;c., and behaving in an insanitary manner. This Bill proposes, not that people who camp on unauthorised camping grounds should be arrested, but that power should be given to the police to remove them&#x2014;that is to say, a policeman when he comes up will say "Off you get." That surely is the obvious way of dealing with these people; for, otherwise, on the next night on the same ground you would have C and D camping, and you would have the same futile procedure over again. It is said that it is the duty of the owner to remove trespassers, and the general law of trespass is appealed to. Of course that is so, and there may be something to be said for exempting private land from this provision, although I can quite understand that a farmer does not care to summon his farm labourers and take upon himself the removal of a gipsy encampment with the possibility of a <i>fracas;</i> he would very much rather have that done by the police, and would be perfectly willing, no doubt, to assist them.<lb/>
But the real evil that this Amendment is directed against is camping on commons. The difficulty, without the power proposed in the Amendment, would be to find the owner of the common and get him to move. It may be said that when there are proper camping grounds these people will go to them; but the worst class whom you most wish to have under supervision will be the people who will defy the law. The noble and learned Earl, Lord Halsbury, said it was little use persisting in this Amendment because of what might be its fate in another place, but I think the balance of argument here has been in favour of the Amendment and in another place the same thing might prevail even against His Majesty's Government. I believe these vagrants themselves would infinitely prefer a provision of this kind to the provisions regarding registration and licensing which were in the Bill as originally introduced and which we have succeeded in getting out of the way. I venture to think that they themselves would prefer that there should be a power to remove them from camping grounds on which they have no right to go. I therefore hope that the Amendment will be inserted, and that His Majesty's Government will see their way, on reconsideration of all the circumstances, to accept it.</membercontribution></p>
<col>330</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00844"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, speaking on behalf of an area peculiarly troubled by gipsies&#x2014;the New Forest&#x2014;I strongly support the Amendment. The noble Earl opposite, Lord Russell, has ably put forward the case with regard to commons, where the difficulty is to find the owners. The same argument applies to the New Forest, where there is divided management. It may interest the noble Lord who represents the Home Office to know that some years ago in the Crown Lands Bill a special clause was inserted which gave the Crown power in regard to the New Forest to remove gipsies and visit them with penalties if they did not so remove to certain stated grounds, largely on the lines proposed in this Bill. These people are the greatest possible nuisance, not only to those owning land adjoining, but to the poor people and small holders of land in the neighbourhood, who suffer greatly through the depredations of these gipsies. It is not a question of private parks and private owners of land. I speak in this matter on behalf of over 3,000 commoners of the New Forest who desire that these encampments should be regulated. I hope the Government will carefully consider the necessity for this provision. In my opinion, the Bill would be absolutely nugatory in the case of the New Forest unless the police were given this power.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00845"><member>LORD BELPER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the House goes to a Division I should like to say one or two words on this subject. It is very important that, having occupied such a large portion of the time of the House, this Bill should, when the terms of it are settled, be a Bill that is likely to be a settlement of the question, and should deal with the matter from a commonsense point of view. In the discussion this evening there have been differences of opinion as to the legal effect of this provision, and it has struck me, in looking through the Bill, that there might also be a difference of opinion as to whether the Amendment as it stands will have the effect that its promoters desire. Clause 2 of the Bill deals entirely with the occupier of the movable dwelling. It provides that where a county council has, with the approval of the Local Government Board, provided sufficient land for camping grounds under the section, the occupier of a movable dwelling may encamp upon any such ground upon payment of the authorised fee, but the occupier
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0170"/>
<col>331</col>
of a movable dwelling shall not encamp within the county upon any land in private occupation without the permission of the occupier of such land. And then this Amendment goes on to say that in certain circumstances the police may remove him.<lb/>
I understand that the occupier could not be arrested. What, then, is to be done if the moment the police have gone he goes back again? And does this power to remove the occupier cover also a power to remove his cattle, his movable dwelling or van, and his family? As the clause stands, only the occupier is referred to; and the occupier is defined in Clause 10 in this way&#x2014;
<quote>"The expression 'occupier' in relation to a movable dwelling means the person occupying or having for the time being control or charge of a movable dwelling."</quote>
Therefore I take it you could not remove the family, and I very much doubt whether you could remove the man's cattle or his movable dwelling. If that be the case, it would appear that the clause as it stands is not efficacious for the purpose desired. It certainly seems to me that some further power would be necessary in this case. I should have thought there must be some means of devising arrangements, of which the Home Office could approve, for taking care that, if the law said a man was not to go on particular land, you could have some power to move him off and keep him off.<lb/>
I am sorry the matter has got to this point, as the success of the Bill in its later stages may be interfered with. This Bill has been promoted by the County Councils Association. My noble friend Lord Clifford has taken charge of it, and has taken a great deal of trouble in regard to it. Our only object is to meet the difficulties which have arisen in particular counties, and to do that without unreasonable provisions or provisions of too onerous a character. As the Bill stands, it would appear necessary to insert further Amendments at a later stage, but perhaps some noble Lord experienced in the law will answer the question I have put&#x2014;whether this provision would give power to remove not only the occupier, but all his properties and his family as well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00846"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am in a somewhat curious position with regard to this Amendment. As originally introduced by me the Bill contained no provision of the nature proposed
<col>332</col>
in this Amendment, but there was Amendment but there was an elaborate system of registration, by means of which, when an offence against the Bill had been committed, there was a possibility of tracing the offender and bringing him before petty sessions. When the Bill was referred to the Select Committee this system of tracing the offender was removed. The Committee objected to the system of registration on the ground that, if it was to be of any use at all, it would have to extend over the whole country. They therefore substituted this remedy, which would enable the authorities to get rid in a rapid and efficient way of persons who camped upon ground forbidden by the by-law approved by the Local Government Board. In this matter I think the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, hardly did the Bill credit, because he supposed that it was to be used for the benefit of every private owner. It is only to be used in regard to such places as may be specified in the order; those places may be public places, they may be commons or they may be private property, but in the latter case the particular proprietor has to be mentioned in the order. Therefore it is not generally to be used for relieving private owners from trespass.<lb/>
The principle of registration having been rejected by the Select Committee, when I introduced the Bill this session I introduced it in the form approved by the Committee. But the position taken up by the Home Office was such that it would have considerably jeopardised what I regard as an extremely useful, I might almost say necessary, measure&#x2014;it would have jeopardised the chance of doing anything to remedy what the Committee found to be a very considerable grievance if this power to the police to remove offenders had remained in the Bill. In those circumstances I felt bound to move in Committee an Amendment deleting this power to the police, and to that Amendment, of course, I strictly adhere. I therefore regret that I must oppose the Amendment to reinsert these words.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00847"><member>LORD AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it may be that the county of Surrey and the New Forest are districts more chiefly affected, but to some extent at any rate we in Kent also suffer in the same way, and I think we should generally be strongly in favour of this Amendment. Lord Belper expressed a doubt a moment ago whether the insertion
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0171"/>
<col>333</col>
of these words would carry out the object with which they are moved. He understands this matter much better than I do; but I would point out to him that he did not quite follow the wording of the clause. He said that any occupier would be guilty of an offence under the Bill and might be removed, but he doubted whether members of his family could also be removed. If he will look again at the clause he will see that it is not confined to the occupier. It says that if "any person" acts in contravention thereof he shall be guilty of an offence. Therefore it is clear that a member of the family would be a "person" and might be removed under the provisions suggested. I hope that, on further consideration, the Government may be induced to give way in view of the very strong feeling in favour of this power being given, not only in this House but also generally throughout the districts which are affected by the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SMALL HOLDINGS ANT) ALLOTMENTS BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00860" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00861">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00862"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I respectfully ask the House to be good enough to give a Second Reading to this Bill, which I hope will not take up much of your Lordships' time. The object of the measure is to repeal subsection (3) of Section 41 of the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1908. The subsection proposed to be repealed runs as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"No holding of 50 acres or less in extent, or any part of such holding, shall be authorised by an Order under this Act to be acquired compulsorily for the purpose of small holdings and allotments."</quote>
Your Lordships will no doubt remember that this provision was not originally in the Bill, but was put in on account of fears&#x2014;rather groundless fears I venture to think&#x2014;that one small holder might be ousted from his land in order to find land for another.<lb/>
I have seen it stated in the Press that there is some sinister design at the back of this Bill, and that it ought to be resisted. It is stated that there is a sinister design to cut up farms and to injure existing small holders. I can assure the House that nothing is further from the thoughts of the Government than to do any such thing, and I might, in passing, say that it would be futile to try to do so, because if you injured or took away any portion of a man's land in an improper manner, all the tenant would have to do would be promptly to call upon the county council to find him some more land, which they would have to do. As noble Lords know, small holdings range
<col>336</col>
from one acre up to fifty acres, and that would be an expensive and inconvenient process.<lb/>
The sole and only reason for proposing the repeal of this subsection is that it has had in its working results which were neither contemplated nor desired. There have been the inevitable legal difficulties, which seem to crop up on every possible occasion. We have had an object lesson to-night. The noble Duke opposite seemed to me to be unnecessarily hard on my noble friend Lord Ashby St. Ledgers when he said that my noble friend had been badly coached in regard to his Bill and had been rebuked on a question of law by the Lord Chief Justice. I am sure your Lordships will agree that there is no member of the House who is more painstaking about his Bills than my noble friend Lord Ashby St. Ledgers, or who explains them more plainly or lucidly, and I think it was a little hard upon him that he should be found fault with on account of the inability of legal luminaries to agree on a particular point.<lb/>
There have been, as I say, the inevitable legal difficulties in this case. Lawyers have differed&#x2014;I suppose it was necessary they should&#x2014;as to what is and what is not a holding, and this has been found very seriously to impair the fair and reasonable working of the Act. I will not trouble your Lordships with many examples, but will state two or three. It is held on the highest authority that if a farm of 200 acres is let by five different agreements to five different persons, or even to the same man, they are five different holdings, though they are cultivated as one farm and under one management. With all respect I do think that this is the misapplied subtlety of legal ingenuity. If I had time I could give numerous instances of the result of this decision. But I may be allowed to quote one, and I only quote it on account of the sequel. It is a case in the county in which I live, where a lady, held in high respect, had a 274 acre farm. The County Council of Buckinghamshire wanted eighty acres for the poor men in the district, all of them hard-working, respectable, solvent men, just the sort of men your Lordships would desire to have as tenants on your own estates. So this estimable lady set to work to defeat the county council by cutting up this farm into six different holdings of under fifty acres each, and she let them to six members of the family, five of whom were women. Of course, that knocked all
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0173"/>
<col>337</col>
the men out. There was no possibility of getting land for the men in the district, and the Act which your Lordships in your benevolence passed two years ago was openly set at nought.<lb/>
Now I come to the sequel. There is a very large and useful body called the Farmers' Union of England. It has 15,000 members, and they passed a resolution at the general executive committee, in which they said&#x2014;
<quote>"The general executive committee of the National Farmers' Union, having regard to the case of the Buckinghamshire County Council and Miss&#x2014;would urge the Board of Agriculture not to proceed with the compulsory order that they made on this land with a view to making it a test case."</quote>
The County Council of Buckinghamshire were openly defied, and we had determined to make a test case of it to see whether or not it was legal for this good lady to do as she had done. I agreed with the union. I thought it would be better not to make a test case of it at all, but to ask the House of Lords, which, after all, is one of the fairest tribunals in the world, to stop a repetition of such an open scandal; and that is one of the reasons why I ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading to this Bill.<lb/>
There is another hard case. A holding must not be a separate holding at the time an order is made&#x2014;that is, of course, some months before the land is procured for the men. This creates some of the hardest cases that the county councils have to deal with. Where small holders are given notice to quit, either at the end of the lease or because people want to get rid of them, the county council very often would be glad to get hold of that piece of land and keep the tenants in possession, but they cannot do so on account of this subsection. The tenants are given notice to quit, and are deprived of the land which we all know is of such benefit to them.<lb/>
The third case, and perhaps one of the worst, is what is called in the agricultural world the case of a "by-take." Your Lordships know that many farmers take small bits of land as what is called a "by-take." They take a field or a bit of land some distance from their farms; in many cases it is not a great advantage to the farm itself, but it is a convenience. This subsection as it stands prevents our getting a portion of a man's farm that is necessary for the benefit of the neighbourhood
<col>338</col>
because it is a separate "take," and because it is under fifty acres. I will give an instance of that. The Buckinghamshire County Council wanted to get land for the people at Marlow. It was quite impossible. Nobody would let them have a flower plot. There was a field close to Marlow which was very convenient; it belonged to one of my tenants, and was certainly a mile and a-half or two miles from the homestead itself. I went to the County Council's Small Holdings Committee and met the men, and everybody agreed that it was an ideal place for the men to have. Curiously enough, my tenant came by in his gig from the market at the time, and I stopped him and said, "Will you let us have that field?" He replied, "Yes, with the greatest possible pleasure." I said, "Would it be a great inconvenience to you?" His reply was, "It would be a great 'bore' to give it up, but I have no objection. You can have it if you like." We went to the Oxford College authorities, to whom this field belonged, and they at once doubled the rent because it was to be let to poor people, but the men said they could manage that. Then, ten days after, the tenant changed his mind and said, "You cannot have this field." I am speaking under correction, but I believe that up to this moment the men at Marlow have no land whatever. It is to stop a case of this description that I ask your Lordships to give favourable consideration to this Bill. These are technical difficulties which were never contemplated.<lb/>
I have heard that there is some objection to the way in which this Bill is drafted. I tried to substitute other words which would meet these cases, but "English as she is spoken" is a most difficult language. I had the best legal advice it was possible to get, and it was found quite impracticable to find words in the English language and string them together so as to meet the case. Therefore the only thing to be done was to ask that subsection (3) of Section 41 of the Small Holdings and Allotments Act should be repealed. I think that the tenants of these holdings may sleep comfortably in their beds. They know that county councils are, after all, human beings, and have a certain sense of what is right and what is wrong. They do not want to strain the law to injure their fellow-creatures. Moreover, every order is carefully considered by the Board over which I have the honour to preside, and every application to take land
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0174"/>
<col>339</col>
in this way is always most carefully gone into. I may add that in many cases the views of objectors to an order have been met by the Board, and the wishes of the farmers and landowners have also been met. I honestly think that if this Bill is not allowed to go through these great hardships will continue, and if a test case is taken and the law maintains that it is possible to defeat the legislation of 1908 in the way I have described, then the Act will be practically a dead letter, and the real good that we are doing will be most seriously impaired. Therefore, with great respect, I ask your Lordships to be good enough to give a Second Reading to this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00863">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Earl Carrington.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00864"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I confess that when I saw the Bill of the noble Earl I considered it a most extraordinary infringement of the Act which was passed a few years ago, and I expected that in the speech which he would make in proposing the repeal of this subsection we should have heard some arguments put forward which would have carried real weight with your Lordships. I would speak in the most respectful way of the noble Earl's speeches, but I cannot see one argument in his speech this afternoon which should induce your Lordships to repeal this most important section of the Act of 1908. Remember for what that Act was passed. The Act was passed to give county councils compulsory powers to acquire land from large farms in order to make small holdings. It was, however, a colleague of the noble Earl's&#x2014;Mr. Harcourt&#x2014;who moved this subsection, which was perfectly right, that holdings of fifty acres, which are considered small holdings, should be excluded, and that county councils should not have power to take them.<lb/>
The proposal now made is not only entirely contrary to the Act, but to my mind it is absolutely contrary to the spirit of the Act; because by enabling county councils to take these small holdings, for fifty-acre farms are small holdings, you take away the main principle of the Act of 1908, which was the creation of small holdings. The object of that Act, as I understood it, was to extend the principle of small holdings. Now, as far as I can gather, the intention of the noble Earl is to change the class of existing small holdings. I fully
<col>340</col>
anticipated that the noble Earl would have gone fully into it, and explained the reasons for proposing to repeal this subsection, which was meant to safeguard the men who were holding small holdings. The noble Earl quoted certain cases, and for the sake of a few cases he asks us to alter the principle of the Act, which seems an extraordinary thing to do.<lb/>
One particular case he quoted was the breaking up of a farm into five different portions. He maintained that that was not legal; that one person had no right to break up a farm into five different portions, and give to five persons a small holding under fifty acres. That surely is a matter of opinion. At any rate, it does not break into the noble Earl's principle of making small holdings, because every one of these holdings is a small holding, and the main object of the Act, was, as far as I can gather, to break up large farms. It seems to me that the lady in question has really been carrying out the spirit of the Act which the noble Earl introduced, and I think there should be a great many more instances given to us to prove the necessity for the repeal of the subsection before the noble Earl asks us to pass this Bill.<lb/>
There is another point which has been overlooked. I think it is very hard that a man who has a small holding of his own should have it broken in upon, a thing he never anticipated, by a still smaller man who wishes to have a part of that holding. Surely that never was intended when the Act was passed. It seems to me a very odd way of promoting the desire of people to obtain small holdings that a man who has obtained his small holding voluntarily, who has, perhaps, expended the sweat of his brow and his capital upon it, should have part of that holding taken away from him because the county council think it right to break it up. I am told that this would not be the general course pursued by county councils, and that they would not do this without the sanction of the Board of Agriculture, but I think we have seen recently that the Board of Agriculture is a somewhat squeezable body. I think that if county councils are urged to break up these small holdings, the Board of Agriculture would be found very squeezable, and I could not envy the position of these small holders in hoping that their holdings would be kept for them by the Board of Agriculture.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0175"/>
<col>341</col>
While I am on the subject of small holdings, I would say how glad I was to see that the noble Earl wrote a letter contradicting the false statement that the Duke of Portland, amongst other landowners, had not done his best to promote the system of small holdings. As far as my experience has gone since that measure became the law of the land, I know that it has been the object of the owners of property to make the Act a success. I should like to hear from the noble Earl whether he considers that the whole system of small holdings is working well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00865"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Yes, I do.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00866"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: I know what the noble Earl means. But I saw in one of his speeches the statement that "the thing is going like wildfire." That meant that small holdings were being taken up, and that is satisfactory. Perhaps it is early in the day to ask the question or to get a reply, but are these people who have taken up those holdings satisfied with their bargains? Are there any cases in which they have not been able to make as much out of them as they had hoped to do? I am not asking this question in any spirit of controversy, but we should be glad to hear how the Act is working. At the same time I do think that to break into an Act which the noble Earl tells us is working well and to alter it materially as is now proposed, as far as I can see without rhyme or reason, is very inadvisable, and in view of the hardship which this might inflict on small holders I think the step proposed would be very naturally resented by them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00867"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill, but I do hope that before it becomes law your Lordships will insist upon very much better reasons being given than we have received up to the present moment for passing it. I notice that when the noble Earl gets into a difficulty he always begins by abusing the lawyers, saving present company. Having done that, and having proposed his Bill, he always says to your Lordships, "I respectfully ask you to pass this little Bill. It is only a little one." Two or three days ago the noble Earl recalled your Lordships' attention, for some reason best known to himself, to the great muddle he made, with the assistance of his legal advisers, about the question of Scottish sheep stock. He
<col>342</col>
said on that occasion exactly the same as he said on this.<lb/>
Let me point out to the noble Earl that he does not seem to realise in the least the importance of the Bill which he is now proposing. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"It is only to repeal a subsection of the Act of 1908 which was not inserted by me but by somebody else."</quote>
To a certain extent that is true. But let me remind him of what the real history of the clause was, because he gave it to us imperfectly. This clause, I believe, originated in the Standing Committee of the House of Commons. When it went down to the House, it was debated and altered. Then it came to this House, and Lord St. Aldwyn had it altered here. Then it went back to the other House, and was again debated, and so this clause was thoroughly considered in both Houses, and in that form passed into the Act. On this occasion the noble Earl is striking at this very clause. The other day he blamed me, very unfairly as I think, for what he called attacking the principle of his Act. What is he doing to-night himself? I do not refer to the particular set of circumstances which have arisen in the course of the administration of the Act. But what is he proposing to do to-night? He is proposing to tear up one of the most important clauses in his own Act. And what reason has he given us for that? If this Bill had been brought forward by somebody on this side of the House I should like to know what the noble Earl would have said. He would have said, "Dear me, you touch my small holders, the children whom I have created," and there would have been any amount of indignation with the wicked Unionists for attacking the principle of his Act. But it is quite a different thing when the noble Earl tears it up himself.<lb/>
Just let me consider what this clause is. It was passed by Parliament as a protective clause, to protect the small tenants who would be created under the Act, and also to protect existing owners of small properties, who represent a large number of people. The noble Earl says the reason for tearing up this clause is that there is an estimable lady in Buckinghamshire. By the way, I notice we always go back to Buckinghamshire whenever we talk about small holdings. I suppose it is natural. The noble Earl thinks a good deal of his own home. Apparently this lady has six admirable daughters&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0176"/>
<col>343</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00868"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: No, not daughters. Tenants, I said. She is the landlady.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00869"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Six tenants. I am afraid I did not catch correctly what the noble Earl said. But he did say that all the men were turned out, and I naturally supposed it was because the women were in. The noble Earl says that these tenants can sleep in their beds at night, for the Board over which he has the honour to preside watches over all the arrangements that are made with regard to them. However great may be the confidence which these tenants repose in the noble Earl, I think the man of fifty acres would prefer the protection of an Act of Parliament; and if I were one of those men I should be extremely angry&#x2014;and I expect they will be angry&#x2014;with the noble Earl for proposing to take away this protection. I ask your Lordships to consider what would be said by a tenant of a small holding of, say, forty acres, which he had cultivated, when he was told, "It is quite true you have been protected up to the present time, but now we have taken away your protection. There is very little chance of your land being taken, but, if it is taken, all you have to do is to go and ask the county council to give you other land." I am sure small holders will by no means bless the noble Earl for this proposal. It is really cutting at the root of his own Act; and why in the world he proposes to do it I cannot imagine.<lb/>
The noble Earl says it has been stated in some of the newspapers that there is a sinister design on his part in bringing forward this Bill. I do not think anybody would suspect the noble Earl of doing anything from sinister motives. They might possibly imagine that his proposals were not always very wise. And certainly unless the noble Earl can produce for it some better reasons than he has done, I think a Bill of this kind ought not to be allowed to pass into law. Just consider the reasons that have been given to-night, if you can call them reasons. The noble Earl quotes a case where a big farm has been divided up into a number of forty-nine acre holdings. The noble Earl wishes to crack an egg, and what does he do? He comes down on it with the biggest steam hammer he can find. He wants to prevent this old lady from dividing up her farm, and in order to do that he absolutely does away with the whole protection at present
<col>344</col>
enjoyed by small owners and small tenants in the kingdom. I must confess that up to the present time the noble Earl has said nothing to make me in favour of the Second Reading of his Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00870"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it must be a little surprising to your Lordships that the speeches which have been delivered on this side of the House have not been thought worthy of reply by any of the noble Earl's friends. Apparently he stands alone on that side of the House as the champion of this measure. Now let me assure the noble Earl that nothing is further from my thoughts than to impute to him what he calls a sinister design in connection with this Bill. I am quite certain he has no sinister design. But I do desire to call his attention and the attention of the House not to the design that may or may not lie behind the Bill, but to the effect which this Bill produces.<lb/>
This Bill, beyond all question, destroys a safeguard which was deliberately inserted by Parliament for the protection of a very important and a wholly blameless section of the agricultural community. Your Lordships will not have forgotten the grave apprehensions with which the farmers of this country regarded the proposals to allow county councils to cut up their farms for the purpose of creating small holdings. That feeling was a perfectly natural one, whether the farmer was a large or a small farmer. A farmer can become deeply attached to a large farm, just as he may become deeply attached to a small one. We were, however, all of us in favour of extending small holdings, and we realised that unless some sacrifice of this kind were made there was no chance of the policy being successfully applied, but when we sanctioned that policy we made an obvious exception in favour of those who were already small holders, whether owners or occupiers of their farms. That class of agriculturist is numerically very important. The noble Earl will correct me if I am wrong, but I am under the impression that in England alone there are something like 248,000 of these holders of less than fifty acres of land. What this Bill does is to throw the whole of those holdings open to the encroachment of the county councils. That is a very serious matter indeed.<lb/>
Another small point which I think has not been noticed is this. I understand that
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0177"/>
<col>345</col>
under the law as it now exists if these small holders happen to be the owners of the land they occupy they are not entitled to more than the bare price of the land. His Majesty's Government last year, and I am bound to say not of their own accord but at our instigation, did provide a measure of protection for those small holders who happened to be occupiers of their holdings, but that protection, unless I am misinformed, does not extend to the small holder who is owner of the farm which he tills. What is the justification for this really momentous change? The noble Earl produces two cases, and I have no doubt he was correct in his statement of the facts. There was the case of the ingenious person who subdivided his farm into five holdings. I confess it surprised me to hear from the noble Earl that no means could be discovered, with all the legal assistance which he has at his command, for rendering a practice of that kind unsuccessful. But do let me remind the noble Earl of the homely old adage, which after all contains a great deal of wisdom, that "hard cases make bad law." The noble Earl says that in this and other cases the law was openly set at naught by these people. Surely it should be possible to discover some means of preventing flagrant evasions of the law such as he described.<lb/>
Let me, before I sit down, add one word more. I will tell the noble Earl why this new departure of his inspires me with a great deal of alarm. It seems to coincide with the adoption of a somewhat more vigorous and aggressive policy on the part of his Department in connection with this question of small holdings. We all recollect how at a certain moment it was thought necessary to appoint Small Holdings Commissioners, whose duty is was to travel about the country, and&#x2014;the expression is not my own; I think it was used by the noble Earl or one of his colleagues&#x2014;to "ginger"&#x2014;[Several NOBLE LORDS: It was the Home Secretary]&#x2014;whose duty it was to "ginger" the local authorities and stimulate them to increased exertions in augmenting the number of small holdings. We gather that the noble Earl is now going to appoint six more of these roving Commissioners, whose business it will be to apply a further stimulus to such county councils as have up to the present disappointed the noble Earl's hopes. I confess I regard these appointments with a good deal of suspicion. In the first place,
<col>346</col>
I regard with suspicion any multiplication of the number of new public appointments. The record of His Majesty's Government in this respect is certainly an extraordinary one. I have no recent figures, but I remember coming across a Return which showed that up to the end of the year 1909 His Majesty's Government had been responsible for no less than 1,164 new salaried appointments, and they evidently intend to go on multiplying appointments of this kind.<lb/>
But there is another thing. These officials are appointed for the deliberate purpose of applying coercion to the local authorities&#x2014;local authorities elected by the people of this country and possessing an amount of local knowledge which no gentlemen sent down from a bureau in Whitehall could possess. I have not a word to say against these gentlemen, but if I am to choose between their judgment and that of a properly constituted small holdings committee of a county council, I prefer the judgment of the committee. I should like to quote to the House a statement I happened to come upon the other day which rather impressed my mind. This is from a report of a meeting of a small holdings society&#x2014;
<quote>"Mr. F. Verney addressed the meeting. He said he was an enthusiastic advocate of small holdings, but he recognised the possibility of pursuing the policy to the injury of tenant farmers and even landowners, and he urged that they should not be forgetful of these."</quote>
The speech of Mr. Verney was followed by one from Mr. Fordham, a gentleman well known, I think, to the noble Earl. Mr. Fordham&#x2014;
<quote>"bemoaned the squeamishness that had been shown about disturbing tenant farmers to make room for small holdings, and he hoped that a more aggressive policy would be adopted in the future."</quote>
It is against this proclamation of an aggressive policy that I hope the noble Earl will set his face. I trust that this question of small holdings will be dealt with without any addition to these aggressive and somewhat incendiary elements. Both political Parties are committed to the policy of small holdings. Both political Parties desire to do what lies in their power to bring back a large number of people to the land. But it is when you introduce these elements of quarrelsomeness and aggressiveness that, in my view, you most imperil thesuccess of your policy; and I hope we shall learn from the noble Earl that he, at any rate, deprecates the introduction of elements of that kind, and desires that the policy which he has so
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0178"/>
<col>347</col>
much at heart should be followed out in a temperate and conciliatory spirit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00871"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the concluding observations of the noble Marquess about the spirit in which the Act must be interpreted if the system is to be worked successfully I find myself in entire agreement. The system cannot work if the Act is carried out aggressively or arbitrarily. It can only be made a success if consideration is shown in the selections made of land for allotments and for small holdings which are submitted for confirmation by the Board of Agriculture. But that is not the root of the difficulty at the present time. There may be good reason for it, but in many cases the Act is not working with the celerity and smoothness which one would wish to see, not because of any desire to work it in an incendiary way, but because there are parts of the country where it has not been taken up in the spirit of which the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition would approve.<lb/>
The noble Earl opposite asked us to tell him, the Act of 1908 having been carefully considered while it was in this and in the other House of Parliament and this provision deliberately adopted, why it is now proposed to alter it. For a very good reason. It very often happens that in initiating legislation you start off by providing against something which seems to be an object of terror, and which turns out not to have been justly so regarded. Nobody desires, and I do not think even the keenest critics of the system as it is going on have ever alleged, that there has been any disposition to seize the land of the small holder, the man who has fifty acres, and annex it. Nobody has said so, and I am sure that neither on the part of the county councils nor of the Board of Agriculture is there the slightest disposition to institute any such policy.<lb/>
But something else has turned up, not perhaps to any great extent, but to an extent which requires to be recognised and to be dealt with. This Act puts a legal restriction against taking a holding of fifty acres or a less extent. That is a simple legal proposition. And to that extent the holding cannot be taken, no matter what its genesis was, or how created or acquired. If you put into an Act technical provisions of that kind, it is always certain that there will be some people who will use them, not as a barrier
<col>348</col>
against the evil which you intended to guard against, but for some other purpose. My noble friend Lord Carrington has given cases in which this restriction has been used as a technical instrument for defeating a portion of this Act. It is perfectly obvious, if you leave the words as they stand, that they may be used to create a plurality of holdings of fifty acres or less virtually under the control of one holder, in whose nominees they stand vested as tenants, and in this way that owner is enabled to defeat the purposes of the Act. I do not say that happens often or is a common case, but if it happens half a dozen times it is amply sufficient for asking whether you cannot correct the machinery of the Act by getting rid of what your Lordships and the Legislature never intended should be placed in its way.<lb/>
In the particular section of the Act which contains this restriction there is an immediately preceding subsection which shows that it is the duty of the Board of Agriculture and of county councils not to take away the land of a person who will be treated oppressively. I am only paraphrasing, but it says you are to look at the question of the rest of his holding before you take any land from him. Speaking for myself, after the experience we have had of the working of the system, I would infinitely prefer to rely upon the way in which the county councils and the Board of Agriculture are carrying out the duties imposed upon them in making these selections and exercising the discretion which is left to them, than rely upon the legal provisions of the three subsections which create the technical difficulties of which I have spoken, which enable things to be done which were never intended to be done, and which give room for a far more elastic application of the Act than would be the case if this Bill which the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture has introduced were passed into law. It is absolutely certain that neither the county councils nor the Board of Agriculture will abuse this provision.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, said he preferred an Act of Parliament to anybody's discretion. I agree as a general rule. But there are a great many cases with which you cannot deal on any rigid principle in an Act of Parliament, and there are countless instances where it is necessary and prudent to give discretion to some responsible body. In a case of this kind
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0179"/>
<col>349</col>
I submit that it would work far less injustice to rely upon that procedure, which is a perfectly safe one, than to leave in existence a subsection which it turns out is used for a purpose never intended, and may in a few cases prevent the working of a system in which the noble Marquess said not only the authors of the Act upon this side but noble Lords on the other side of the House are interested.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00872"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think if it is intended to take this restriction away we ought to see what is the object of the restriction. In the case which was mentioned just now one of two things happened. Either it was a <i>bona fide</i> subdivision of the farm, in which case the person was doing no harm; or it was a single and solitary case in which this person fraudulently evaded the law by taking a farm of 250 acres and cutting it up into five holdings. In that case surely what you want is to amend the law in a way which would prevent that taking place, and not to take away the protection of the small owners. See what would happen in this case. You are going to set up two different classes of small occupiers. Those under the county councils will be protected by the law, but not so the other small occupiers of fifty acres and below, whose farms may have been held in their families years before ever Mr. Jesse Collings's "three acres and a cow" and long before the Small Holdings Act introduced by the noble Earl were heard of. Any farmer who holds a small holding of fifty acres directly from a landlord can have the very best field or the whole farm taken away from him if this protection is removed, whilst those who hold under county councils are protected by the law. I oppose this Bill because I prefer the interests of the 200,000 or more small holders who now enjoy the protection which the Act gives them, and who ought not to be deprived of that protection because of some case of evasion in Buckinghamshire. If the noble Earl were willing to limit the removal of this protection to Buckinghamshire I for one would have no objection. Funny things happen in Buckinghamshire that do not happen in other counties. I do not think any case has been made out, beyond the one or two cases in Buckinghamshire, why this protection should be taken away. I shall therefore oppose the Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<col>350</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00873"><member>EARL FORTESCUE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is, I think, some slight justification for this Bill. It is not unknown for a farmer who has a considerable farm under one landlord to take perhaps a field or two of the glebe, or a field or two from another landlord. These detached cases are technically "small holdings," and under proper safeguards there may not be any hardship in allowing fields of that character to be taken for the purpose of making what I may call genuine small holdings. I think if this Bill were altered so as to apply only to cases of that sort there would be very little objection to it. The case put forward by the noble Earl, Lord Carrington, as justification for this Bill seems to me a very flimsy one. He told us of a lady in Buckinghamshire who had cut up a farm of 250 acres into five holdings. If she has done that in order to get the better of the county council, I think her act is very likely to bring in due time its own punishment, for her tenants are not likely to die together, and unless they do she will be left with people holding detached fields, which will make it exceedingly difficult for her to let the farm or deal with it in any way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00874"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who has just spoken has put the matter on a very different footing from that stated by the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture; and after the speech of the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War everybody must have realised that if he had drawn this Bill it would have been in very different terms. Your Lordships listened to the cases of hardship put forward by the noble Earl opposite, but the noble Earl's method of warfare has been on previous occasions very much as it has been to-night. He puts down a very wide provision. He then expatiates, as Lord Camperdown said, on the fact that he is there, that the whole matter is an individual matter, and that we can rely on no hardship being done. It is true the noble Earl is there, but none of us know how long be may be spared to that sphere of usefulness. We are certain that under his superintendence no hardship will be done, but we cannot legislate in that way.<lb/>
If this Bill is allowed to be read a second time it can only be on the clearest understanding that, when we go into Committee, the noble Earl will be prepared
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0180"/>
<col>351</col>
to furnish us with a list of these cases of evasion, so that your Lordships and the country may know what are the circumstances which cause a Minister to run counter to the express policy of Parliament and endeavour to undo what was deliberately done, after careful consideration between the two Houses, three years ago. I feel very strongly on this matter. I think the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition put no undue stress on the appointment of these Commissioners to continue the course, which this Government has been pursuing relentlessly in the last two or three years, of bullying the local authorities. The Board of Education has earned a most unenviable notoriety in this respect, and the Local Government Board has done it constantly to a degree never before known in the history of that great Department. They are in continual worry and trouble with local authorities all over the country, and the Board of Agriculture is not without some experience of the same kind. This policy of driving local authorities, who are representative and responsible to their constituents, to take action when they are not desirous of taking action, makes us look with some suspicion on the wide powers of this Bill.<lb/>
If your Lordships are willing to allow this Bill to have a Second Reading with the object of meeting such cases as Lord Fortescue has spoken of&#x2014;genuine cases of hardship and difficulty in obtaining land&#x2014;I think that so far as my noble friend behind me (Lord Lansdowne) is concerned, he will be prepared to assent to that course and to vote for it. But it must be on the clearest understanding, as I said on rising, that the noble Earl will be prepared to show us categorically what are the cases of hardship and difficulty with which he wishes to deal, and that he will be prepared also to accept such restrictions of wording as will limit the Bill to those cases. Your Lordships should not be put in the position of withdrawing in 1911 the protection which was deliberately given in 1908 to the very class whom this Act was intended to benefit.</membercontribution></p>

straightforward way in which all Unionist Ministers have discharged their responsibilities. The noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, told us about this clause having been very fully considered by Parliament. That is perfectly true; but what has happened was not contemplated, nor is it desirable. I shall be prepared, of course, to substantiate my claim. I had, of course, a great many other instances to give, but I did not wish to weary the House. I will do my best to adduce categorical cases, because the only object of this Bill is to remedy these cases of hardship.</membercontribution></p>

It is really a very small matter, the object being to give the Board of Agriculture power to deal with the traffic in live poultry, so as to secure its being carried under more humane and sanitary conditions. This Bill has been brought forward under the auspices of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and will reach people bringing in live poultry from other countries and dealers who collect birds for market. They have rather a rough way of dealing with live poultry, which causes a good deal of unnecessary suffering. I am sure the House would be as anxious to prevent that in the case of chickens, turkeys, and so on, as in the case of cattle. These fowls are tied by the legs for long periods and are somewhat roughly handled and thrown about. I dare say some of your Lordships have seen them lying about on different railway station platforms, and you will have noticed that frequently they are packed without sufficient room or ventilation. The Board of Agriculture have power, under the Diseases of Animals Acts, to deal with the traffic in cattle, and it is desirable to extend the protective provisions to poultry. I do not think there is anything controversial in the Bill, and I hope your Lordships will approve of it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00900"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member> moved to omit the word "unpaid." The noble Lord said: I have to apologise to your Lordships for rising to move an Amendment which has not been printed and circulated, but my excuse is that the time since the Second Reading has been so short that it was scarcely possible to get a properly considered Amendment printed. However, it is in itself a very simple Amendment, and I think I can rely on making it so plain that there will be no misunderstanding as to its meaning. This schedule deals with the reconstruction of the Lunacy Commissioners. The number of Commissioners is increased, and there are certain new regulations in respect of the conduct of their business. There are to be certain paid Commissioners and certain unpaid Commissioners, the former being professional persons, either medical or legal. The unpaid Commissioners, of course, have no such qualifications. The point has been raised as to whether it were possible to appoint a woman to be an unpaid Commissioner. The Lord Chancellor thought it extremely desirable that women should be associated with the work of the Lunacy Commissioners, considering the immense number of women lunatics and the tact, judgment, and knowledge which women would bring to the work of the Lunacy Commissioners. He therefore proposed to remove the legal ambiguity felt by the Law Officers of the Crown, so that it would be possible for him to appoint a woman to the position of an unpaid Commissioner. Those who are interested in this matter and have been working for this change for a long time are very grateful to the Lord Chancellor for proposing this change.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00901">But the question arises whether the same discretion should not be allowed to the Lord Chancellor in respect of the appointment of paid Commissioners. The paid Commissioners, as I say, have to possess certain qualifications. They must be medical persons or barristers-at-law of a certain standing. Women are not eligible for the law, but there are medical women
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0182"/>
<col>355</col>
who now take high rank in their profession, and all the arguments which are so forcible in favour of permitting women to act as unpaid Commissioners in co-operation with male unpaid Commissioners to look after the case of women lunatics, would operate also, I submit, in respect of the appointment of paid women medical Commissioners. I therefore suggest that the discretion which the Lord Chancellor proposes in the fifth section of the First Schedule should apply also in the case of vacancies among the paid Commissioners. If the word "unpaid" is omitted, that is all that is necessary to be done. The Lord Chancellor would then be empowered in case of a vacancy to appoint a woman as a paid Commissioner. I am sure the noble and learned Lord will be sympathetic with the object of this proposal, and we shall be glad to hear from him that he will be able to agree to it. If he desires further time, no doubt the Amendment could be brought on again at a subsequent stage, but I propose it now for the purpose of eliciting an expression of opinion upon it.</p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00903"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think it would be easy to overstate the importance of having women associated with the care of the insane in this country, because we all know that in those sad and depressing cases where women are insane there is a great difference in the handling, treatment, and control of them by women. Therefore I unreservedly assent to the principle which my noble friend has advanced. As I said on the Second Reading, I did nominate and obtain the assent of one lady to act as an unpaid Commissioner, and I was most disturbed when the Law Officers advised, on a ground which is rather an open question, that it could not be done, and therefore I could not proceed further then. Now I have proposed that in the case of unpaid Commissioners a woman may be appointed, and if I have the good fortune to get this Bill through I shall certainly use the power of appointing women.<lb/>
But my noble friend Lord Courtney of Penwith proposes to go further. The only reason why I am afraid I cannot entertain his proposal at the present time is this. This Bill is purely of a temporary character,
<col>356</col>
recommended by the Royal Commission as of a temporary character, until a larger scheme, more ambitious and more useful, is embraced in a longer Bill for the organisation of the whole matter and dealing with the qualifications of those who have to serve in this connection. I am afraid this is not an apt time for entering into the big question of what ought to be the qualifications of the paid Lunacy Commissioners who travel round the country and visit the asylums. It is too big a thing to touch now, and it would lead to a good deal of disturbance in connection with what is merely a temporary difficulty. But I have a very strong feeling, as I said before, that in this particular kind of work and in other kinds of work women ought to be associated, and I hope it will be so as soon as possible.

<image src="S5LV0008P0I0183"/>
<col>357</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00910">3. Whether the surplus of the Regular Reserve above the requirements of the Expeditionary Force of 28,130 mentioned by the Secretary of State for War on the 4th May last refers to 1910 or to 1913, and is it calculated on establishment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00911">4. What is the standard of age below which non-commissioned officers and men will not be considered qualified to serve abroad with the Expeditionary Force in India and elsewhere.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00912">5. In view of the fact that the twenty-seven fourth battalions of the Special Reserve are not available for foreign service, are there any other troops available to discharge the duties abroad which they will be required to perform in connection with the Expeditionary Force when on active service.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00913">6. Whether the Secretary of State for War would cause Table I, War Establishments, dated 8th April, 1907, to be laid upon the Table of the House in identically the same form as when first issued, but corrected up to date; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00914">The noble Duke said: My Lords, these Questions arise out of the discussion which took place in your Lordships' House last week. The point in the first Question is this. Are the men whose period of Colour service has expired and who have come home and been transferred to the Reserve estimated as forming a part of the Reserve for the year in which they return? If so, when you deal with the figure&#x2014;the number of the Reserve in that year&#x2014;you find included in that figure the total number of the drafts who have returned home in that year and who cannot be also counted with the Colours. Hence my Question.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00915">In my second Question I ask the noble Viscount whether men in the 2nd class of the Army Reserve are considered fit for the fighting line of the Expeditionary Force. Last week the noble Viscount gave me a caution, and a very proper one, not to underrate or underestimate the value of our military forces. I admit that both in writing and speaking I have always dwelt upon the fact that the men of the 2nd Class of the Army Reserve are not fit for the fighting line, basing my statement, as the noble Viscount is aware, on the evidence of Lord Methuen and General Sir Kelly-Kenny. If I am wrong I hope the noble Viscount will
<col>358</col>
correct me, because nothing is further from my wish than to make any misrepresentation as to the true value of any particular part of our military forces.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00916">I come to my third Question. The noble Viscount last week gave figures dealing with the year 1910, and then passed on to 1913. He left me in doubt as to whether the surplus of the Regular Reserve&#x2014;28,130&#x2014;referred to the year 1910, or whether that figure is the estimated surplus of 1913. I also ask him whether he calculates that surplus on establishment. Then in the fourth Question I ask the Secretary of State for War what is the standard of age below which non-commissioned officers and men will not be considered qualified to serve abroad with the Expeditionary Force in India and elsewhere. Last week the noble Viscount informed me that it was no longer necessary to be so particular as to the standard of age at which men were sent abroad.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00917">With regard to my fifth Question, I would remind the noble Viscount of the duties he assigned to these twenty-seven fourth battalions of the Special Reserve. In dealing with the Army Estimates he said "they would be available in the event of an outbreak of war to proceed abroad at once for duty on lines of communication," etc. I think the noble Viscount would admit that at the present moment none of these battalions are in a condition to proceed abroad. I am glad it is the intention to increase their establishment, but how is the noble Viscount going to get his officers and men? He is probably aware that he will want about 6,000 more men to bring them up to the due establishment, and there is I believe at present a decreasing intake into the Special Reserve.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00918">My last Question refers to the 1907 Table. I put this request to the noble Viscount last week, and be kindly said he would consider the possibility of reproducing the 1907 Table corrected up to date. If I may say so, I think the 1907 Table a most admirable Return, giving all the information that could possibly be required. I am not asking for any new Return, but merely whether we can have this 1907 one brought up to date. I cannot help thinking that it must exist in the corrected form at the War Office. I
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0184"/>
<col>359</col>
hope the noble Viscount will see his way to produce it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00919"><i>Moved,</i> That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty for further Papers relating to the Army Reserve, &amp;c.&#x2014;(<i>The Duke of Bedford.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00920"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have to thank the noble Duke for deferring his Questions until to-day, which has given me the opportunity of looking into them more closely. His first Question relates to men returning from abroad on the expiration of their term of Colour service, and he asks whether they are shown in the strength of the Reserve or with the Colours. The answer is that men are not shown, according to the figures which I have given, in the strength of the Reserve until they have actually been transferred to the Reserve.<lb/>
The second Question is whether men in the Second Class of the Army Reserve are considered fit for the fighting line of the Expeditionary Force. I have never understood why the noble Duke speaks of the Second Class of the Army Reserve. We do not know that term in connection with these men. There are the men in Section D. I grant that a man who has been a long time away from the Colours is not so good as a man who has been only one or two years away. But in Section D no man of the Infantry, Cavalry, or Royal Artillery is now allowed to enter who has been more than five or at any rate six years from the Colours, and there are men who have been away a shorter time. No doubt in Section D there may be men not as fit as others for fighting, and the longer a man is away from the Colours the less fit he is; but I am advised that the greater proportion are well fitted and suited to take their place in the fighting line. There are, as I say, some who are not suitable, but we can use those who are fit, and of these there is an abundance.<lb/>
In his third Question the noble Duke asks whether the surplus of the Regular Reserve above the requirements of the Expeditionary Force of 28,130 mentioned by me on May 4 last refers to 1910 or to 1913, and whether it is calculated on establishment. The answer is that I took the figures of the noble Duke in his Questions. Where they referred to 1913 my answers referred to 1913, and where he was referring to the 1910 Return or the 1907 Return I took those figures. They followed the
<col>360</col>
Questions put by the noble Duke. I wish, however, to make a correction in the figure which I gave. It should be 27,000. The next question is as to the standard of age below which non-commissioned officers and men will not be considered qualified to serve abroad with the Expeditionary Force in India and elsewhere. Since the year 1899, from the time of the noble Marquess Lord Lansdowne, it has been customary, while not sending drafts to India under twenty years of age, to count in, under certain services, men of nineteen as fit to go there or to any other part of the Empire with the Expeditionary Force. Those services are the Royal Artillery, the Army Service Corps, the Royal Army Medical Corps, the Army Ordnance Corps, and the Royal Engineers. We do not send, and have not sent, men under twenty years of age abroad in the Cavalry or the Infantry, but for the Artillery they have been considered fit for the last twelve years. My advisers have no reason to alter their opinion that provided a soldier has attained nineteen years he is fit for these services; but for the other combatant arms the age of twenty obtains.<lb/>
As regards the twenty-seven fourth battalions, referred to in the fifth Question, they are, of course, available for foreign service just as much as any others, as they are enlisted and organised for that purpose. As the noble Duke correctly said, their primary purpose would be for lines of communication, or to relieve units abroad which are to proceed to war. They would get opportunities for additional training before being called upon to take an active part in the fighting line, which they might have to do later on. As regards the particular numbers, the new system recently adopted has not been long enough in operation to enable us to judge. The establishment of 750 has to be obtained by bringing a couple of hundred ex-Regulars into the battalion. We do not know yet how that is going to work. I am glad to say that recruiting both for the Regulars and for the Special Reserve was very much better during the past week than during the preceding week. I dare say all these things are being affected by emigration just now, but last week the figures jumped up. I cannot tell for some little time how this experiment of adding 200 men, a good many of whom will be ex-Regulars, to the twenty-seven fourth battalions will succeed, nor can I tell yet whether the Officers
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0185"/>
<col>361</col>
Training Corps is going to be fruitful. All one can say is that it promises well, but one has got to see.<lb/>
Now, I come to the last Question. The noble Duke asks whether I will cause Table I, War Establishments, dated April 8, 1907, to be laid upon the Table of the House in identically the same form as when first issued, but corrected up to date. I said the other day that I would consider that, and I have done so. My advisers think, and I am bound to say I agree with them, that there is a considerable difference between the state of things in 1907 and now. In 1907 we were only giving our plans of the way we proposed to make up the war establishment. In 1910 things got very much further on, and as I stated the other day, one Cavalry Division and six Divisions could now be mobilised, four of them within ten days and the remainder within twenty-one days, and we hope all will be capable of being mobilised within ten days shortly. But that involves, even now, certain arrangements being made. There are certain special enlistments, and certain changes which the introduction of mechanical transport is bringing about. If I were to lay on the Table a War Establishment Paper as in 1907 we should be giving information as to mobilisation of a much more practical kind than that given in 1907 when things were still in the air, and my advisers think we ought not to do that to-day. Certainly in no foreign Army would it be done, and I think the time has come when we should proceed a little carefully in these matters. But I know the noble Duke's great interest in this subject, and I have seen the Director of Organisation, who will be prepared to place at the disposal of the noble Duke any information he desires. The noble Duke will, of course, keep the information confidential so far as details are concerned. But that will not preclude him from making criticism so long as he does not make use of the <i>ipsissima verba,</i> which it is not desirable in the public interest to publish.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00921"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: I am very much obliged to the noble Viscount for his answers, but I am not quite able to follow him yet on the point of the transfer to the Reserve. If you make an estimate of the number of your Reserve it seems to me that you must include in that estimate those drafts that come home and are due to pass into the Reserve. I gather that you do
<col>362</col>
not count them in the Reserve until they are actually transferred, but it seems to me they are included in the estimated strength of the Reserve. They cannot be in two places at one time, and as they are estimated for in the Reserve, you cannot count the men with the Colours as well. Again, I am not quite certain what the noble Viscount means by including ex-Regular soldiers in his twenty-seven extra battalions. Does he mean the men who have been through Section D?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00922"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: As the noble Duke knows, we propose to enlist a certain section of veterans&#x2014;of course, not veterans in the ordinary sense of the word&#x2014;of any age up to thirty-one or so who have passed through a period of Reserve service but have not entered Section D. There are numerous men passing every year through the Reserve out of the Army altogether. There are some who serve in Section D, but we have reason to believe that there is another section of men who, if they could get the training, would join the battalions. That is the experiment which the Adjutant-General is now making.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00923"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: But surely the noble Viscount has taken Section D for the Expeditionary Force. Now he is going to divert them and send them into the twenty-seven fourth battalions.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00960"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, by permission of the House I should like to make at this stage the Motion which stands in my name on the Paper. It concerns the appointment of a Chairman of Committees. Your Lordships were aware some time ago that Lord Onslow did not feel himself able to go on discharging the duties in the way which he thought essential, and I am quite sure the whole House have recognised for a long time that those duties have been efficiently performed. Lord Onslow's place was very kindly taken for a short time by Lord Balfour of Burleigh, and the term for which he was good enough to say that he was
<col>368</col>
willing to serve has come to an end. After making inquiries, and, of course, after consultation with the noble Marquess, I think that I shall do what is most agreeable to your Lordships in proposing that Lord Donoughmore be appointed Lord Chairman. I believe the House will agree that he will be a very competent, a very assiduous, and an entirely impartial Lord Chairman, and if the noble Marquess opposite associates himself with me in this, I will then make the Motion standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00961"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it gives me much pleasure to second the Motion which the noble Viscount has laid before the House, and I hope I may also be permitted to concur in all that he has said in regard to Lord Onslow's retirement. We have never known a Chairman of Committees more attentive and more assiduous in the performance of his duties or more unsparing of himself; and I believe I am saying what is known to many when I say that Lord Onslow's illness, which we so deeply regret, was certainly aggravated by the manner in which he persevered with his official duties at a time when he really was scarcely fitted for their discharge. I am sure Lord Onslow carries with him into his retirement the cordial good wishes and the sympathy of every member of this House. I also desire to express our agreement with what fell from the noble Viscount as to the debt which we owe to Lord Balfour of Burleigh, who at a moment of difficulty&#x2014;a moment which might have been extremely embarrassing to us&#x2014;came forward and placed at the disposal of the House his unrivalled knowledge of Private Bill legislation.<lb/>
With regard to Lord Donoughmore, I will only say that in my opinion a more fortunate or promising choice could not have been made. Lord Donoughmore has for a good many years past taken a conspicuous part in the business of the House, and I think most of us are satisfied that he possesses in an eminent degree the qualities which are likely to render him a successful Chairman of Committees. I feel little doubt that, whether at this Table in the House or in connection with the heavy business which the Chairman has to transact outside of this Chamber, Lord Donoughmore will be found able to maintain the high traditions of your Lordships' House and of the office which he is about to be invited to take up.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HOUSE OF LORDS RECONSTITUTION BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00967" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00968">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00969"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I trespassed at such inordinate length on the time of the House a few days ago that I may well spare myself and your Lordships this evening anything like a long statement or explanation in making the Motion which stands in my name. But I do desire to touch briefly upon one or two points, and in particular upon one or two of the observations which fell from the noble Viscount in the speech with which he followed me on Monday last. The noble Viscount left us in some doubt as to the kind of reception which this Bill was likely to meet with at the hands of noble Lords opposite. I say that without in any way making it a subject of complaint, because the noble Viscount, of course, had not seen the Bill, and it was only natural that with nothing before him except perhaps my imperfect explanation of it he should desire to be somewhat guarded in his comments. No doubt owing to this circumstance, the noble Viscount's speech was somewhat
<col>370</col>
oracular. Towards the beginning of it he let fall some remarks which, I must say, filled me with hopes. He told us that he regarded the course which we had taken as a bold, frank, and possibly helpful course, but as he went on his comments became less encouraging and damped not a little the expectations which he had created in our minds. As the noble Viscount addressed us I asked myself whether we could be quite sure that he had really apprehended the intentions with which this Bill has been introduced, whether he exactly perceived the place that we think this Bill might take in the scheme of Constitutional reform. The noble Viscount said&#x2014;
<quote>"This Bill may or may not prove to be a possible supplement or complement to a Parliament Bill."</quote>
But he went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"It cannot be a substitute or an alternative for the Parliament Bill."</quote>
and finally he said that he regarded the Bill as unacceptable as a solution of the vast difficulties which confront both Parties.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I desire to say to-night that we who are responsible for this Bill have never suggested that it should be considered as, by itself, a solution of the vast difficulties which confront both Parties. We never for a moment allowed ourselves to believe that its introduction would relieve Parliament of the necessity of dealing by legislation with the question of the relations of the two Houses. Therefore, our reply to the noble Viscount is that we do not intend this Bill as a substitute or alternative for the Government's Parliament Bill; but we do intend it as a complement or supplement to a Parliament Bill&#x2014;a Bill dealing with the relations between the two Houses, and a Bill conceived, I hope, in a very different spirit from the Bill which His Majesty's Government have introduced in another place. I dwell upon that point because it is, in our view, fundamental that these two great questions should not be divorced, and it is because His Majesty's Government have failed altogether to address themselves to one of those questions that we have thought it our duty to present the Bill which now lies upon the Table.<lb/>
I would make another observation. I trust that during the discussion which commences this evening we shall be careful to avoid the use of misleading language as to the facts of the case, and I direct that observation at a passage in the speech of the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0190"/>
<col>371</col>
noble Viscount, a passage in which he told us that His Majesty's Government were determined to insist upon the withdrawal of what he called the absolute Veto of the House of Lords, no matter how it is composed. These words "absolute Veto" are very precise words with an unambiguous meaning, and I ask leave to-night to say on behalf of those who sit near me that we have never claimed for the House of Lords, and do not claim under this Bill, anything which can be correctly described as an absolute Veto. We have never claimed such a Veto, and we have, indeed, made it clear in our speeches that we recognised and did not contest the ultimate supremacy of the other House of Parliament. And that this is so was shown by the noble Viscount himself, because he went on to quote a passage from a speech made by Mr. Balfour, I think he said at Nottingham, in which Mr. Balfour observed that in the co-partnership of the two Houses the House of Commons must in his view remain the dominant element.<lb/>
My Lords, I sometimes ask myself whether, so far as the great principles which we are discussing are concerned, we are, after all, so very wide apart. What did the noble Viscount tell us the other evening? He told us that in his view the Second Chamber should have opportunities "for consultation, for revision, for delay, for suspension for a time, and so forth." I rather like that expression "so forth" because it gives an air of elasticity to the formula. We ask for opportunities for consultation, but we do not desire that the consultation shall be a parade movement; we desire opportunities for revision, but especially opportunities for effectual revision; and we desire the occasional interpolation of delay&#x2014;a delay sufficient to enable the country to ascertain whether or not the House of Commons really has the opinion of the electorate behind it. I will not pursue this subject further. I should not, indeed, have touched upon it but for the observations of the noble Viscount, and I will only repeat that we do not claim for this Bill that it covers the whole ground of Constitutional reform, but that we regard it as a Bill which must necessarily be supplementary to other legislation governing the relations of the two Houses. And, lastly, I would say nothing is further from our thoughts than that this Bill should form the subject of a kind of transaction between the two Parties in which the conditions
<col>372</col>
would be that you would accept our Bill and that we in our turn would accept the Bill which you have introduced in another place.<lb/>
I should like, passing on, to notice another expression which fell from the noble Viscount. He rather took exception to my argument when I said that in the preparation of the Bill the dominant factor&#x2014;I think that was the phrase I used&#x2014;had been the Resolution which this House accepted on the proposal of my noble friend on the Cross Benches (Lord Rosebery)&#x2014;I mean the Resolution that, in our view, the possession of a hereditary Peerage should not of itself entitle any Peer to sit and vote in this House. Well, said the noble Viscount, how can you contend that there will be nobody here who would owe his seat to the hereditary principle alone when you will have no less than 100 Members of this House Peers themselves and elected by Peers? And he went on to say that the country would regard that as a "farcical" proposition. I venture to say that the country will be well able to understand the effect of the proposal which we are making and to perceive that under that proposal there would not be in the reconstituted House one single Peer who owed his right to sit and vote to the possession of a hereditary Peerage alone. Under our scheme every one of the Lords of Parliament who would enter this House in that particular class would have to be armed with double credentials&#x2014;in the first place, the possession of certain specified statutory qualifications, and, in the next place, the election of his brother Peers; and I venture to say that both in letter and in spirit that proposal amply makes good the pledge which was implied in the Resolution of my noble friend.<lb/>
Then the noble Viscount asked whether it was conceivable that under this Bill there could, either probably or even possibly, be a Liberal majority in this House. I answer that question unhesitatingly. It is perfectly conceivable, and, given the kind of majority that the Party opposite had in the House of Commons in 1906, it would not only be possible, but the result would, as a matter of fact, inevitably ensue. But I desire to make two observations upon that point. In the first place, I would ask the noble Viscount whether it really shocks him very much to suppose that there should perhaps not unusually be in a Second Chamber, the duties of which would be those of revision,
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0191"/>
<col>373</col>
of reservation, of suspending measures for a time, a preponderance, not perhaps a very large one, of persons of moderate opinion, persons who would represent what the noble Viscount himself last week called a "steadying element in our national life." The other observation which I should like to make is this. Is it really necessary that, in considering the results of legislation of this kind, we should minutely count heads and determine beforehand that the members of the new House must necessarily be grouped in accordance with a particular Party grouping? I cannot help hoping that both by the new House itself and by those who will be called upon to choose the members of the new House, these questions will not be left entirely within the domain of the Whips and the wire-pullers. I, for one, certainly hope that both the members of this House and the members of the electoral colleges when they make their choice, and the Party leaders when they address themselves to the question of the nomination of one section of the reconstituted House of Lords, will exercise their right of selection in a spirit other than the spirit of pure partisanship. We, at any rate, believe that we have provided a House qualified to deal in an independent and a judicial spirit with the questions which will come before it, and we anticipate that it will address itself to its work in a spirit of that kind.<lb/>
I wish to say one word before I sit down upon the question of the Schedule. There have been a very large number of criticisms and comments upon the Schedule, both upon that which it contains and upon that which it omits. We, of course, frankly recognise that the Schedule offers a very fair field for discussion, and that it may be possible very materially to improve it. But what I do beg noble Lords to bear in mind is this, that the mere fact of a Peer finding his name upon the Schedule does not give to that Peer a right to sit and vote in this House. It gives him a right only to present himself for election by his fellow Peers. That seems to me to make the whole difference; and that is, I think, the answer to the kind of argument which is very often addressed to us. We are told that in this Schedule we have left room, let us say, for an ex-Member of Parliament whose Parliamentary career has not been a particularly distinguished one; for an ex-Ambassador who has not added to the reputation of the diplomatic profession; or perhaps for a General who has not succeeded in gathering
<col>374</col>
many military laurels. We are told that we have included these, and that, on the other hand, we have excluded extremely meritorious Peers who have taken an honourable and useful part in the business of this House, and very likely a not less honourable and useful part in the affairs of the part of the country in which they reside. I think the answer to that is that the ex-Ambassador, the General, the ex-Member of Parliament would almost certainly not be elected by their brother Peers, while, on the other hand, the meritorious and hardworking Peer who had made a reputation for himself either in this House or in his own part of the country would stand an uncommonly good chance of being either chosen by the new electoral colleges or nominated by the leaders of his own Party. And it should not be forgotten that that chance would, under this Bill, be a constantly recurring chance, because, as the House will remember, of the 220 Peers elected, by the electoral colleges and nominated by the Prime Minister one-fourth would retire at triennial intervals.<lb/>
There is one other point I would like to mention. I have received a good many remonstrances from critics who complain of us because we have provided in this Bill for the retention of a certain number of Lords Spiritual while we have not found room in the new House for representatives of the other great religious denominations. We thought it our duty to retain a certain number of Lords Spiritual because they are already in this House; they are an integral part of it, and as we desire that under our Bill the present House should receive adequate representation, we thought we should have been to blame if we had not included a certain number of right rev. Prelates. The case is, of course, wholly different when you come to the other denominations. As to these other denominations, let me say that I believe that all House of Lords reformers have' earnestly desired to discover some means of securing the representation of those other Churches in the Second Chamber. When the matter was being dealt with by Lord Rosebery's Committee the question came before us then, and we took a good deal of trouble to examine it, but, my Lords, we were reluctantly compelled to report that, although we should gladly have seen within this House representatives of other great Churches in England, Scotland and Ireland, we had not been able to formulate any
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0192"/>
<col>375</col>
proposal with that object. The difficulties are, undoubtedly, of a very serious character. In the first place, if you begin admitting representatives of the other Churches to this House, where are you to stop? There are a great number of denominations, and I doubt extremely whether it would be possible to devise a list which would give general satisfaction. There is another difficulty. In a great many cases the distinguished men who are at the head of the great denominations hold their office for one year only. I take the case of the Moderator of the Church of Scotland. Under our Bill, as noble Lords will remember, we contemplate that the tenure of a Lord of Parliament should be a twelve years' tenure, and it really would be impossible to bring into this House, <i>virtute officii,</i> any one who held that office only for twelve months. You could not bring in twelve Moderators in the course of twelve years, nor could you well bring in a single Moderator for twelve years because he happened at a particular moment to fill that office. But, my Lords, while I greatly regret that these difficulties should present themselves, I certainly do not despair of being able to bring about that which is desired by those who offer this particular criticism. Here, again, I desire to remind the House that one of the great advantages of the system of nomination, one of the advantages which led us particularly to insist upon including it in our proposals, is that it does give you the opportunity of recognising conspicuous service and conspicuous merit in any branch of public life, and there should be no difficulty in recognising such merit when it is to be found in the persons of those who have been at the head of the other great religious denominations in this country.<lb/>
That is really all I desire to say this evening. We submit this Bill to the House, as I said before, not as covering the whole field of Constitutional reform, certainly not as a measure so perfect as not to require close and minute criticism; but we do present it to the House as a serious attempt to improve our Parliamentary system, a serious attempt to deal with defects which have been freely admitted by both political Parties, and which, let me say in conclusion, if we had had our way, would certainly have been dealt with long ago, not by one political Party alone but by the co-operation of both Parties in this House.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00971"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess very good-naturedly reproached me for being rather oracular on the occasion when he introduced this Bill. On the whole, I do not think it was at all to be wondered at&#x2014;not the least from any want of lucidity or fulness in the noble Marquess's exposition, but really from the large field to be travelled over and the enormous mass of details in which it abounded. To-night the noble Marquess used some language which seemed to me to be more hopeful than the language he used on the last occasion, and certainly more hopeful than the language used by the noble Lord of active and powerful mind who now sits next to him. The noble Marquess says, Are we so wide apart after all? But the other night the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, said at the Albert Hall&#x2014;and I read it with sincere regret&#x2014;
<quote>"It is only by some form of agreement or co-operation that this question will ultimately be settled."</quote>
Nothing could be more admirable. But what follows?&#x2014;this is the noble Lord's contribution to agreement and co-operation&#x2014;
<quote>"Our attitude towards the Parliament Bill is one of unchanged and unchangeable hostility, and we regard it as tainted by every political vice."</quote>
That indicates a tremendous distance apart. I pass that by, however, and I fervently hope that the spirit indicated by the noble Marquess may animate the discussions on the Bill which I shall have the honour to present to the House either to-night or to-morrow afternoon. The thing is far too important, the issues are far too deep, to be made the mere battledore and shuttlecock of Party recrimination. No one feels that more deeply than I do.

advance in our direction. The noble Marquess referred to a passage I read from Mr. Balfour to the effect that he himself and others of his colleagues have never denied that the other House must be predominant, and this is the language, that the noble Marquess himself used quite recently&#x2014;
<quote>"We certainly do not claim for our Second Chamber full co-ordinate rights in all respects with the House of Commons."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00974"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00975"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Then Mr. Balfour said&#x2014;
<quote>"I do not want the Second Chamber to claim the right to determine who shall be the advisers of the Crown for the time being. I do not want it to have any control&#x2014;</quote>
I ask the House to mark these words&#x2014;
<quote>"over the Executive of the country."</quote>
I quote those words again, because we shall hear a great deal about a Single Chamber, and I want your Lordships to recognise the difference between what you are going to call a Single Chamber and that predominant Chamber which you all agree must be the character of the House of Commons&#x2014;a difference which is far less considerable and far less vital and organic than many noble Lords opposite seem to suppose.<lb/>
The noble Marquess has asked me whether it shocks me to think that in the new House to be constituted there should be a preponderance of what is called a steadying element. It does not shock me at all. That is exactly what you would expect a Second Chamber to be and what you would expect them to do. My own view is that the sin of this Bill is that it is based on Party machinery, and a Party majority seems inevitable under this machinery. That may be disputed, but it is my own impression after a pretty careful study of the proposals. We are discussing this Bill under a great disadvantage, I admit, because we do not know how the noble Marquess is going to settle the difficult questions of the relations and powers of the two Houses, which after all are the foundation and starting point of the whole controversy. We are not now setting an academic Constitutional problem in the air; we are dealing with a definite practical emergency. These differences between the two Houses are not the work of mere Party quarrelling or Party recrimination; they
<col>378</col>
come from far deeper sources and foundations than that. They have been inevitable, in one sense, since the Reform Act of 1832, but in the immediate sense that concerns us they have become more and more vital and inevitable since the Franchise Bill passed by Mr. Disraeli in 1867 and completed by the County Franchise Bill of 1884. It was those tremendous additions to the mass of new voters which made the cleavage between your Lordships' House and the other House. It was these new voters who were first beginning to acquire the possession of actual political power which made what is perplexing us to-day inevitable.<lb/>
But, though inevitable, I deplore the way in which this particular emergency has been brought about and has been handled. It is almost incredible the position in which we stand to-night, and to think that we are only eighteen months off the time when your Lordships thought fit to challenge the House of Commons. By the rejection of the Finance Bill in November, 1909, you challenged the House of Commons. What has come of that challenge? The Budget, of course, has become law. I am not going through the particulars of the present Bill with the view of throwing taunts at the noble Marquess. I am well aware of the enormous cost to themselves to which the noble Marquess and those who support him have brought themselves to frame the present proposals. I give them full credit for that. The noble Marquess said on the First Reading&#x2014;
<quote>"We cannot in those circumstances hope to satiety all views."</quote>
So far from satisfying all views, I am afraid this Bill satisfies none. I did hear, however, a subdued chorus of applause&#x2014;from whom?&#x2014;from those who in 1909 shouted loud hallelujahs at the defeat of the Finance Bill. Those are the supporters, very moderate in number and in tone, that I can discern of the noble Marquess's Bill. Can we wonder that Conservatives and Unionists who form a vast majority in this House, are amazed when they recall the words of Lord Curzon, who said in 1909 that the instinct of self-preservation, if nothing else, would prevent this House from using its powers unfairly or frivolously? He actually claimed the right of Dissolution. What has been the result? We used to hear a great deal in 1886 of the miraculous conversion of Mr. Gladstone to Home Rule; but I declare, looking back upon that and remembering
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0194"/>
<col>379</col>
it well, that the miraculous conversion of the Party opposite to a scheme like the Bill before us beats Mr. Gladstone's case hollow.<lb/>
Where do you stand? This Bill gives a shock to the Prerogatives of the Crown, to the Scottish Act of Union of 1707, and to the Act of Union with Ireland. It shakes down the legislative powers of the Lords Temporal as such. About 400 of your Lordships, and therefore a majority, are by the Schedule not eligible. I do not know why in that case your Lordships should not have been allowed to choose your representatives at your own will and discretion from your own numbers. How very awkward the position of the ineligible Peer will be if he desires admission to the new second House by either of the other two gates, nomination by the Prime Minister or election by the electoral colleges, or if he uses the powers which are given, and I think most rightly given, under this Bill, to stand as a candidate for the House of Commons. The fact of his being called ineligible by the House to which he has a natural right would make him a most desirable opponent. If I were a Parliamentary candidate I should be glad to have such an opponent. And a Prime Minister when nominating his hundred Lords of Parliament would, in my opinon, think twice before he selected a man characterised by his own order as of the ineligible sort. These changes are enormous; but, at the same time, from our point of view this Bill represents an enormous stride in advance compared with the proposals of Lord Rosebery's Committee. The changes are tremendous. The Peers elected by their brother Peers were then to be 200, but they are now reduced to 100. The <i>ex-officio</i> members who figured in my noble friend's scheme have gone.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00979"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: The Peers are reduced from 200 to 100 and the rest are to come in, indirectly no doubt, but in essence dependent on the House of Commons. One hundred are to be chosen by a Prime Minister who is himself chosen by the House of Commons, and the others are to be chosen by members of the House of Commons. It comes to this as the end of this grand move in November, 1909, against the House of Commons, that two-thirds of the members of the new House are to be in fact and in essence dependent on that House which you then defied. I think that is the sober truth of the matter.<lb/>
The noble Marquess referred to the Lords Spiritual and made some judicious remarks on the difficulty of finding representatives of other Churches. But looking at it from the conservative standpoint it is a considerable alteration to reduce them from twenty-six to five, apart from the two most rev. Primates. There is a very curious provision in one of the clauses where the Lords Spiritual are to elect their members by proportional representation. I know what proportional representation means when applied to politicians, but what does it mean when applied to Lords Spiritual? Proportional to what? In the debate of 1909 the Archbishop of Canterbury based his action on the principle of leaving to C&#x00E6;sar the things which are C&#x00E6;sar's, and the Archbishop of York said that they had nothing to do with Party politics. Therefore they are not to have regard to Party politics, to Whig or Tory. What, then&#x2014;High Church, Low Church, Latitudinarian? The greatest Conservative who ever wrote in this country talked of the Church of England exalting her mitred front in Court and Parliament. The Church of England in the matter of front is reduced to this very modest proportion, and with all the machinery of electoral colleges and so forth does not strike me as half so inspiring a vision as that which appeared to the Conservative I have spoken of.<lb/>
The members of the new House are to be 350, which by the way is exactly the number of noble Lords who voted on the Budget Bill. It seems to the Government that 350, or even 200 I would say, is far too large a body for what is sincerely desired&#x2014;tranquil, deliberate, competent, calm revision. If you have a body of 350 nothing on earth can prevent a body of that dimensions becoming a fighting
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0195"/>
<col>381</col>
phalanx, a Whig and Tory phalanx. I cannot conceive how any manipulation of machinery such as is proposed in the Bill would prevent it. If you want any real deliberation, would not any one of you choose 100 rather than 350? You would then have a chance of obtaining a competent revising body; but does anybody dream that with a House of 350 members all interests would be so banished from it that a Licensing Bill, for example, would have a better chance of getting through than through the present House? I do not think so. Look at another point. I am not going to refer to it from any Party reason, for in truth neither Party Came out of it with flying colours. On the Trades Disputes Bill the noble Marquess used some strong language, so strong that I feel inclined to quote it for the purpose of my argument. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"This Trades Disputes Bill will bring rain, bodily suffering, and mental anguish to individuals. It is fraught with danger to the community, and is likely to embitter the industrial life of this country. We must before risking conflict with the House of Commons choose ground as favourable as possible to ourselves."</quote>
Consider in your own minds what sort of an Assembly you are going to get under the noble Marquess's Bill? Does anybody believe that the Assembly so got would be a bit more likely to show that independence which is one of the great objects of having a Second House? Does anybody believe that the independence of a House so chosen on a question of that kind where the popular mind was thought to be so eager would be a bit more independent, a bit more likely to resist that evil influence than your Lordships' present House? I confess I think it is a complete illusion to think anything of the kind.<lb/>
Then there is the principle of indirect election. I am aware that it is on all fours with the system in the Union State of South Africa, but I cannot conceive of any benefit being derived from electoral colleges which could not be obtained by the House of Commons as a whole. As to the language in the Bill about the new Lords of Parliament being chosen like members of Select Committees in the House of Commons, that is a most extraordinary proviso. As everybody who has sat in the House of commons is aware, these Committees are appointed by more proceedings than one. How is it managed? The Whips of the four Parties select names;
<col>382</col>
those names are submitted to the House after due consultation, and they are then appointed. Is it contended, as it seems to be contended in the Bill, that the Prime Minister, having got a quantity of names selected by this process through the Whips, and having got the consent of the House to them, is then to submit those names for the approval of the Crown? No; the Prime Minister will do nothing of the kind. The plan of the Bill is really unworkable. What the Prime Minister, I take it, would do would be to make a list of persons approved, and then, on his own responsibility, recommend those men to the Crown for creation as Lords of Parliament.<lb/>
There are one or two questions I should like to ask the noble Marquess as to the men chosen by groups of members of Parliament. It may be said, "If you have them chosen by the whole House of Commons you will have a tremendous area of wire-pulling, intrigue, and manipulation." Does the noble Marquess suppose he will avoid wire-pulling, intrigue, and manipulation by taking county groups of members? I want to know how a candidate is to recommend himself to one of these groups&#x2014;not, mind you, bodies of electors, but groups of members of Parliament. Plato said the only man who is fit to be entrusted with power is the man who will not accept it. There are many other difficulties. Suppose a Lord of Parliament chosen in this way should have the mischance of dying, how are you going to fill up the vacancy? The same applies to nomination. The men you have nominated may change their politics. The Cabinet may change its mind, or in the House of Commons you may have a new Prime Minister. The point of all this is that you want two things, I submit, in any great scheme of this sort. You want stability and you want simplicity. Tell me what stability there is in such a system as this. What stability is there for Parliamentary life? What stability is there under these constantly varying conditions for government, for continuity of purpose and policy? The Bill is open to the gravest objection on both those grounds.<lb/>
Everybody I have spoken to, competent to have an opinion, and who has taken the trouble to form one, insists that the figure given by the noble Marquess the other night as to the probable superiority of Unionists in this House is ludicrously small. It could
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0196"/>
<col>383</col>
not possibly be so small as eighteen. It must be a great deal more. The lowest figure I have heard from any expert analyst of the figures is a majority of forty-five. You cannot really determine this aspect of the Bill unless you know what is going to be, as the noble Marquess promised to tell us by and by, the solution of the relations, between the two Houses, because the numbers of the new House would depend naturally upon the system of relations between the two Houses. You could not settle the question of Joint Sittings unless you had settled numbers on a firmer basis than the noble Marquess indicated.<lb/>
I do not think I can reasonably detain your Lordships longer. The whole point is what the relations of this Bill, or any other Bill brought forward by noble Lords opposite to the same purpose, are to be to the Parliament Bill. The noble Marquess last time challenged me to produce our scheme mentioned in the Preamble of our Bill. We have to solve a definite problem&#x2014;namely, how, as we carry on from day to day, to get back to the old position of co-operation and accord which used to mark the whole relations between Lords and Commons. We cannot carry on unless your Lordships give up the absolute Veto which has hitherto been claimed. We therefore feel bound, after one election upon another&#x2014;elections, mind you, in which larger numbers went to the poll than had almost ever been the case before, in which feeling had been steady and persistent&#x2014;we feel bound not to go further until we have secured for the House of Commons that predominance which the noble Marquess and his friends have admitted is the Constitutional position of that House. Whether any future development in the noble Marquess's Bill may bring us nearer to that it is not for me to say. I myself should make no complaint if he altered, developed, enlarged his Bill. But let me be quite frank. Alter it, develop it, change it as much as he may, our first business as a Government is to secure the Parliament Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00980"><member>THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the speech which we have just heard from the noble Viscount the Leader of the House fills one with considerable amazement, and certainly leaves one's appetite considerably dissatisfied. In the earlier part of his speech he made an eloquent
<col>384</col>
defence of your Lordships' House which must have brought satisfaction to the oldest Tory present. It was an eloquent defence of this ancient institution which it was somewhat surprising to hear from the noble Viscount, whose antecedents and political views we know so well. At one moment he appeared to think that we had made a great mistake in attempting in any degree whatever to interfere with the constitution of this House. He then went on to deal in a somewhat critical spirit with certain of the proposals contained in the Bill now before the House. His criticisms were certainly interesting, but they were, if I may say so, far more appropriate to the Committee stage of the Bill. Upon the real principle underlying the Bill I venture to say we have not heard a single word.<lb/>
We are necessarily to-day confronted with a position of extreme delicacy, and obviously in dealing with any one of these proposals we cannot close our minds to other proposals which must be taken in conjunction. One would hardly have thought that the noble Viscount is a distinguished member of a Cabinet which, as he said, has a clear mandate to carry through the House of Commons the Bill which is now, I believe, being discussed on Third Reading in that House, and which Bill contains a Preamble in which it is stated that the question of a Second Chamber is to come up again. What light have we had to-day in regard to that? The only hint we have had was the statement of the noble Viscount that the number of 350 is too big. A membership of 350 too big for a deliberative Assembly&#x0021; The noble Viscount has not so very long left the House of Commons. I do not know whether his opinion is that 670 is an unwieldy number for a deliberative Assembly.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00982"><member>THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: I can only say that the statement of the noble Viscount that 350 is too large a number is the only hint that we have had as to what is in the mind of His Majesty's Government. Not one single word have we heard as to whether the newly constituted House is to be a composite House; whether it is to elect itself, or whether it is to be elected from outside. We have heard detailed criticisms of electoral colleges. Have the Government something definite in their
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0197"/>
<col>385</col>
mind as to what they are going to place in the position of a Second House? I give them credit for that. Are they going to establish a purely elected but small body? I hope that in the course of this debate we may be let a little more into their secrets.<lb/>
In certain quarters it has been asked, What is the reason for bringing this Bill forward at the present moment? My noble friend the Leader of the Opposition, in the speech which he made this evening, again clearly showed, I think to entire satisfaction, that we were absolutely bound in honour to bring forward these proposals in a definite and concrete form in consequence of the Resolutions which we passed at the end of last year. Personally I am bound to say that I do not think I could have again stood on a political platform unless some such measure had been brought forward by the Party of which I am a member. We promised by everything one can adhere to in political life that we meant business over these Resolutions, and that we intended to put them into definite and concrete form. This question is not one which can be considered merely from the point of view of how it might affect individuals, or as to what either this or that Party might be able to get out of it if it became law. The question which I venture to say your Lordships have now to consider is whether you are going to have a Second Chamber in this country at all, and, it you are going to have one, whether you have now got the most efficient Second Chamber, or whether it is possible to improve it. Unquestionably much may be said for the course which this House has taken in the past, and its willingness to adapt itself to what it believes to be the real, fixed, and well ascertained opinion of the country.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, at the beginning of his speech, dated the difference between this House and the people&#x2014;a difference which I do not admit exists&#x2014;to the result of the franchise legislation culminating in the Act of 1885. It is a remarkable thing that in the six-and-twenty years which have passed since then the Party represented by noble Lords on this side of the House have been responsible for the Government of the country for seventeen years, which does not show, I think, any such very great cleavage as was in the mind of the noble Viscount. The noble Viscount went on to say that we threw
<col>386</col>
down a challenge by the rejection of the Budget in 1909. It is certainly true that we gave the country an opportunity of expressing its opinion upon that Bill. As a result of that election I admit that you were able to induce a majority in the House of Commons to vote in favour of it. I do not wish to enter into recriminations, especially when every now and again appears something in the nature of an olive leaf, and I do not wish to go back into past history. It would be interesting to know the history of the negotiations which took place between January, 1910, and the somewhat belated appearance of the Budget which had received, according to noble Lords opposite, such enthusiastic welcome in the country. The Budget which we were told was to appear within a few days of the reassembly of Parliament did not, for some mysterious reason with which the future historian will be able to deal, make its appearance until May of that year. How far the newly-elected House of Commons were honestly in favour of that Bill, or whether a condition of affairs had arisen in which inducements may have been put forward to certain members of the House of Commons who strongly disapproved of the Budget before the election to vote for the Budget after the election, we do not know. These matters may some day be unravelled, but at any rate I think I can claim that the proceedings which took place in the rejection of the Budget constitute no authority whatever for His Majesty's Government and noble Lords opposite to claim that they have a right to reduce this House to impotence for ever and for all time.<lb/>
This question is one which most essentially must not be taken by itself. It will be within the recollection of every member of your Lordships' House that in the discussion upon the Resolutions last year my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition fully and categorically outlined the views of himself and his friends regarding the relations of the two Houses. The proposals that we are discussing to-day are only part and parcel of a general scheme which we are prepared to lay before the House for readjusting the relations between the two Houses. One measure has already been placed on the Table by Lord Balfour of Burleigh. It may not be a perfect measure, it may not deal with the subject in all its aspects, but at any rate it is, as
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0198"/>
<col>387</col>
this Bill is, a serious and genuine attempt to deal systematically with the relations between the two Houses. Another proposal which was supported by the Resolutions of last year was that of Joint Sittings. Obviously it would not be advisable on the Second Reading of one Bill to discuss at any length other proposals, though they do hold a distinct place in the whole of our proposals; and I cannot help thinking that, in any readjustment which must&#x2014;and I think we all admit it&#x2014;take place between the two Houses, if there was machinery recognised and provided by Parliament for Joint Sittings of the two Houses, the very fact that that machinery existed would probably prevent undue obstruction by either House, and I believe the same to a very great extent might apply to the case of the Referendum.<lb/>
It is absolutely necessary, before any great fundamental change is made in our Constitution, that we should endeavour to ascertain as far as possible what the real opinion of the country is. I do not wish to refer to subjects beyond the immediate scope of this Bill, but I will take two prominent instances to show the deep divisions which there must be in the minds of the electorate, how extremely difficult it is to ascertain what really are the views of the country upon these matters, and the obvious necessity of having a more definite scheme for ascertaining what the real wishes of the country are. The two questions I take are Home Rule and Tariff Reform. The conclusion has been borne in very strongly upon my mind that the majority of the country want neither. I may be wrong. I only give this as an expression of my own opinion. I do not say whether the country is right or whether it is wrong, and the so-called process of education must be continued still further in both categories. I honestly believe that if the country was polled to-day and everybody entitled to a vote was requested to say whether or not he was in favour of Tariff Reform and Home Rule, a considerable majority would reply in the negative in both cases. But that is merely a matter of opinion. I believe that if we had an election it would be almost impossible for a Government to be returned which would have what is now called a clear and categorical mandate. I do not wish to appear cynical, but one cannot help having the belief forced upon one that Governments are elected not because they are popular in themselves, but
<col>388</col>
mainly because their predecessors are unpopular; and one cannot help thinking that it would be easier for the work of the Government as a whole, whether time Party of noble Lords who sit on this side of the House or that of noble Lords who sit opposite are in office, if there were means found by which the opinion of the country could be better expressed on given questions. It would save a great deal of trouble in dealing with matters which the country did not want, and the Government would be able to turn their attention to matters which the country did desire dealt with.<lb/>
There is one other reason why I think we welcome the proposals laid before the House by the noble Marquess. The Parliamentary machine is a complex one, and we are bound, I think, to admit that it is one in regard to which we can never aim at getting absolute finality. There must be elasticity in our constitution to enable it to adjust itself from time to time according to the needs and requirements of the country. In the same way the constitution of the House of Commons cannot be fixed and stereotyped for all time. It has been admitted, I think, on all sides in politics that from time to time the machine has to be overhauled. I need not go through the dates, but at certain stated intervals, beginning with the year 1833 and going up to the year 1885, periodical adjustments have been made; and there are many of us who now think that a readjustment is considerably overdue. I do not like to look at it merely from the point of view of an advantage which we might gain, or an advantage which noble Lords opposite might gain, but at any rate the constitution of the House of Commons to-day represents a series of anomalies which it is impossible to defend; and although I know it is somewhat wide of the scope of this Bill, one cannot help hoping that the introduction of this Bill and the discussion of these and kindred proposals in both Houses of Parliament and the country, will impress upon the minds of all concerned the absolute necessity, not only of adjusting, as far as we possibly can, the relationship between the two Houses, but of producing the most efficient working of both Houses. That this Bill does go a long way is admitted on all sides. It is necessarily open to criticism, and I feel confident that my noble friend who is responsible for the introduction of the Bill is perfectly ready and willing to listen to fair criticisms for the improvement of it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0199"/>
<col>389</col>
There is nothing more difficult than the fixing of numbers. Anybody who has had experience of the House of Commons will know that the moment a number is chosen, whatever it may have been before, it invariably leads to difficulty, and people immediately have a large number of reasons to put forward showing why another number than the one selected should be adopted. But I cannot accept the criticisms which have been made by the noble. Viscount opposite with regard to what I may call the nominated section&#x2014;the 100 members who are to be chosen in accordance with the composition of the House of Commons. He knows as well as I do and as well as any other noble Lord who has sat in the House of Commons that there is a perfectly well understood principle, which has held good for a considerable time, by which the members of Committees, whether it be a Grand Committee or a Select Committee, are selected. The Committee of Selection meet at the beginning of every Parliament and strike a balance, as far as they possibly can, between the various sections of the House in the selections they make. That applies whether the Committee is a big one or a small one, and it applies, I believe, equally where you have to add numbers. It is a perfectly well-known and accepted principle. I remember that on one occasion when an effort was made to depart from it, so strongly was the principle recognised, so many officials having been at work on its details, great opposition was put forward to departing from such a well-established practice. There is not the slightest difficulty in working that principle, and I cannot see that the objection which noble Lords have raised to it is in the least degree insuperable. I know there may be and there will be many questions of detail in such novel proposals as these that are bound to be criticised. It is inevitable that that must take place. But looking at the underlying principle of the Bill we are determined, in fulfilment of the pledges which we gave in this House and which our responsible leaders gave during the course of the General Election, to go forward with this Bill as an honest, genuine, and sincere attempt to make our Parliamentary machine work as efficiently and smoothly as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00983"><member>LORD ST. DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Duke who has just spoken laid down as one of his propositions that in considering this Bill we ought not to let ourselves be
<col>390</col>
influenced by how it may or may not affect individual members of this House. Need we go quite as far as that? It seems to me that it would be a very relevant thing in considering this or any other Bill for the reconstitution of this House if we had to come to a conclusion which would lead to the exclusion from this Assembly of many who have hitherto been among the most useful and most honoured of its members. We have in considering this Bill one very great advantage, if I may say so, in the way in which it has been submitted to us. I had for many years the opportunity in another place of hearing important Bills introduced by the leaders of both political Parties, and I must say that I never heard any Bill introduced as clearly and concisely as this Bill was introduced by the noble Marquess opposite.<lb/>
In speaking on the Second Reading of a Bill you are generally dealing only with the principle contained within it; but in this particular case you have what is very rare, an extremely important Bill introduced by the Opposition. Therefore when you have a Bill like this introduced by a political Party who admittedly are at the moment not in a position to carry their Bill into law, I think we are bound to consider, not only the Bill as it is, but what the Bill is going to be before, if ever, it comes before Parliament in a final shape with a majority behind it in both Houses. Before that can come to pass we must all admit that a General Election will be necessary, because the noble Lords who introduced this Bill have not got a majority in the Commons, and the Government do not accept their Bill. If this Bill, therefore, is ever to become law it must be after a General Election. We all know the process of a General Election. Political candidates throw a good deal overboard before they come out of the contest. Supposing the Conservative Party go to the country some day with this Bill as their main plank at a General Election, one of two things must happen. Either they are beaten&#x2014;in that case you do not hear any more of it&#x2014;or they are successful. If they are successful, what is going to happen in the case of this Bill? I think a good deal of it will have gone by that time. And I think noble Lords who are going to vote now for the Second -Reading of this Bill, believing that this is actually what they are going to get some day in the way of legislation, had better think twice or three times before they
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0200"/>
<col>391</col>
record their votes. To get a majority in this country you must carry more than a political Party. If every Liberal and every Tory voted for the respective Parties, there would not be a majority. You must get a large share of the votes of the man in the street; and, first of all, to get a majority a political Party must be unanimous among themselves.<lb/>
I am far from saying that you cannot get a majority on this Bill in some shape or another after it has been altered, but you have not got a solid political Party behind it to-day. You certainly have not judging by the Tory Press. I am not a voracious reader of newspapers, and I do not pretend that my reading of papers of the other side is by any means exhaustive, but I have observed that there is a very large, and I think I may say influential, section of the Tory Press which is absolutely against any retention of the hereditary principle in this Bill. I will give as instances the <i>Observer,</i> which has been calling upon noble Lords opposite to throw the hereditary principle overboard altogether, and the <i>Pall Mall Gazette,</i> which has been taking the same line. When you have your own Party not solid with regard to a Bill, I think you will agree with me that that Bill cannot become law except with Amendments. I read only this morning in a newspaper that has been most strongly advocating this Bill that the Bill "is fair, or can be made fair, as between political Parties." If I were going to vote for this Bill thinking it might become law as it stands, I should regard that as a most ominous sentence. As I say, you may some day get a majority for a Bill for reconstituting this House, but you are going to the country with clauses which give special representation to right rev. Prelates. In going to the country&#x2014;I am not talking of Liberal candidates and the views they may take, but of the view the successful Tory candidate is going to take&#x2014;the Conservative candidate will perhaps take the view, with the greatest respect for the right rev. Prelates and the greatest admiration for their work, that they will be possibly somewhat out of place in such a body as is proposed. It is not to be a body such as this body is to-day. It is not to be a body where there is a great mass, as there is in this House at all times now, of independent opinion, but a body where the political Parties will be very evenly balanced, and contests will be fought on fierce political lines. That is what the
<col>392</col>
House of Lords is going to be in the future if you pass this reconstitution scheme. Therefore the constitution of the House under any scheme of reform is a very relevant consideration in discussing this Bill. As I have said, you have your Party divided. How are you going to get it so united as to get a majority? In my view you can only get a majority by throwing a number of these clauses overboard.<lb/>
I saw something that bears on this in an interview that was given to <i>The Times</i> newspaper by a gentleman who I believe assisted to draft this very Bill, Mr. F. E. Smith. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"It may well be that the alternative to the composite proposal which we have formulated may prove to be an elected Second Chamber."</quote>
He does not say whether it is his own Party, as the result of a General Election, or whether it is the other Party who will bring it forward, but he is actually contemplating in an interview in which he is praising this Bill&#x2014;as he may well do if he is one of its authors&#x2014;an elected Second Chamber. That is really what we have to consider to-night. This Bill comes before us with all these fancy franchises. When you have gone through a General Election, as you will have to do to carry such reforms as you have in your mind, will not a large number of these fancy franchises have disappeared, and shall we not be face to face, as Mr. F. E. Smith says, with an elected Senate? I think there is a great deal in this Bill which is very ingenious, and as regards the election of Peers by members of Parliament, and Lords of Parliament to be nominated by the Crown in proportion to the strength to the House of Commons, I must say there is a great deal to be said for it, and one's heart rather does turn to any proposal that would not involve repeated General Elections such as elections of a Senate in this country would inevitably involve.<lb/>
But I want your Lordships, if you will bear with me for a few minutes, to consider what the position of this House is to-day compared with the position it must be in supposing this Bill or any other Bill for its reconstitution were passed. There is one thing to-day that the House of Lords is certainly not&#x2014;that is, a paid body. Another thing is, we are in no way local. Members of Parliament represent some particular district, usually the district of the county where they live. We do not represent here
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0201"/>
<col>393</col>
the district we live in any more than any other district. Then we are not in any way stringently subject to Party Whips. Noble Lords who have been as I have in the House of Commons will know what the difference is here and there as to that state of things. Again, a very large and influential part is taken in the proceedings of this House by what you may call the more casual attendants. I mean that a very large part of the work is done, not by noble Lords who attend here almost every day or every week, but by noble Lords who are experts on particular subjects. I do not like to mention names, but you will all have such instances in your minds. A part is taken by noble Lords, experts in some particular subject, who do not come here very frequently, perhaps, although when they do come they take a leading and influential and most admirable part in our proceedings. That is distinctly a feature of this House.<lb/>
It is quite certain that when you have your Reform Bill through, whatever it may be now&#x2014;I do not want to consider in detail the Bill noble Lords have brought in which they think will improve the constitution of the House&#x2014;one or two general principles will have to be considered, and one of them is surely this. When the new House is formed it must be something like fair as between the two political Parties. The noble Marquess opposite contemplates&#x2014;I am sure he will bear me out&#x2014;that some day there will be a Liberal majority in this House. I think he has taken considerably too favourable a view of the prospects of the Liberal Party in this House, but he and his friends are contemplating, at any rate, a House which will be something like equal in numbers as between the two political Parties. They are also contemplating a House in which there must be many poor men and working men, just as there are in the House of Commons; because the two sections of this Bill which provide for Lords of Parliament being elected by members of the House of Commons and the nomination by the Crown of members of this House in proportion to the respective Parties in the House of Commons, must lead, if fairly carried out, which I have no doubt they would be, to the presence in this House of numbers of working men and poor men. At the present moment the House of Commons is not paid, but it is an open secret that it is likely to be paid before very long, and it seems to me that when this
<col>394</col>
House is reconstituted, whether under this Bill or any Bill like it, you will have to have some provision here, I do not say for paying all the members, but for paying those members who need it. I think that will follow whether you like it or not. I am not in the least expressing the opinion that it is desirable. I am only saying that if you are going to bring a number of men such as miners and trade union representatives, men of all sorts, here, as you are contemplating under this Bill, and these men are being paid if in the House of Commons, it will be rather hard, should their services be called upon for this House, whether they are nominated by the Crown or by a Prime Minister, if they are not to be paid. If these men are paid in one Assembly they will fairly think they ought to be paid in the other. I do not say for a moment that noble Lords will be compelled to take salaries whether they like it or not, but I do say, and I think the country will say, that these people ought to be offered salaries.<lb/>
What does this mean? It means, first of all, that you are going to have Parties nearly evenly balanced here. I am talking about your own Bill. You will then have a large number of men, not as we are now representing no particular district, but men representing particular districts. You are going to create different constituencies. Yorkshire, I suppose, will be divided into one or two constituencies, and other great divisions of the country will return so many Lords of Parliament. What does that mean? It means that. Peers in this House for the first time will have local calls upon them concerning their attendance in this House which they will not be justified in disregarding. A Peer who sits here as representing, say, Yorkshire, or Kent, or any other division in the country, will be told by his constituents, when there is anything under discussion in this House which affects time interests of that particular part of the country, that he is expected to be in Parliament and attend the proceedings in the House of Lords. Lords of Parliament in the new Assembly will be pressed not only by their own constituents to attend Parliament, but they will have a great deal more pressure put upon them by their own political Parties. Noble Lords who have been in the House of Commons will bear me out that the "whipping" in this House is ridiculously light as compared with the "whipping" in another place. The reason is perfectly obvious. It makes practically
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0202"/>
<col>395</col>
no difference to anybody whether there is one Conservative more or one Liberal less in any particular Division in your Lordships' House; it only means that the majority of noble Lords opposite is one greater or one smaller. It never enters the imagination of man that this side of the House could be in a majority, and therefore there is no pressure. But directly you make the two sides of this House in something like equal numbers&#x2014;make no mistake about it&#x2014;the present condition of things will not exist for a day; you will have strong pressure from the Whips of both political Parties, and any noble Lord who happens to be a member of the new House will be pressed every day to come here at the beginning and stay until the end of the proceedings, and to vote in every Division unless he happens to be paired. My Lords, that is the change you are going to make in this House.<lb/>
The noble Duke who spoke just now suggested that we ought not to consider the <i>personnel</i> of the House in talking about these changes, and that we ought not to think of how they affect individuals. Ought we not to? After all, it is not, perhaps, entirely upon political partisans that the great political glory and prestige of this House has rested. I think all noble Lords will agree with that. You have men in this House, and happily we have always had men here, whose lives have been lives of great achievement in different spheres&#x2014;great soldiers, great sailors, great diplomatists, ex-Viceroys&#x2014;and statesmen the summer of whose lives has been spent in another place, and who only come here when the stress of elections and of work in the House of Commons is too much for them. All those men have brought honour to this Assembly, and I am sure all of us wish to see them here. But if you are going to build up in this House an Assembly something like the House of Commons on a smaller scale, if you are going to build up an Assembly in which the two Parties are of something like equal number, where there will either be a small Conservative majority or a small Liberal majority, then you are going to make the life in this House a very strenuous one, and surely you are in danger of driving the very people whom both sides would like to see members of this House out of public life altogether.<lb/>
You may say, of course, that a great man who is not a very strong partisan and would
<col>396</col>
not wish to come here day after day and support one political Party or the other, can do good work, even in politics, without being a member of this Assembly. But will it be quite the same position? Take the case of a noble Lord who has had a great career as Governor of a Province, or who has done great service to his country in war as a General. A man like that in his old age, if he is no longer a member of this House, may, it is true, go to the country and lay down his views in any emergency on a political or other platform; but, after all, the advantage of this House as a pulpit for such a man to speak from is this: On a platform you cannot be answered; your speech cannot be debated; you are making it largely to a number of people who are only partially educated; you are not making it among men who can criticise it and answer it on the moment. Therefore I say that you are placing difficulties in the way of the very class of men we want to have in this House, and for whom this House is the right place, and making political life for them impossible.<lb/>
My Lords, I have purposely not spoken on the details of this Bill. I have not wanted, as a very new member of this House, to criticise adversely the details of any plan put forward for the improvement of the Assembly in which we sit, but I do think, in spite of what the noble Duke who spoke last said, that it is very relevant indeed to any plan that we should consider what effect it will have on individuals if those individual members are among the most honoured and most famous in our body. Those considerations are, I think, very material, and I hope noble Lords will bear them in mind before they go to a Division.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00984"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think your Lordships will realise, after the speech of the noble Lord who has just sat down, that there is even another point of agreement, which we are always so fond of insisting upon on this side of the House, between ourselves and the Party opposite. At any rate I believe there is between the noble Lord and myself a point of agreement, because he evidently thinks, as I do, that the present House of Lords is absolutely the best House of Lords that you could possibly get, and it is the only House of Lords that will ever do any good under our present system. This is not,
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0203"/>
<col>397</col>
as I think the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, said just now, an occasion for anything like levity. It is, indeed, the saddest debate that we have ever had in this House. The noble Marquess who moved the Second Reading of this Bill, in proposing the House of Lords which he desires to see, said that he could not invent au umbrella large enough to cover both Lord Halsbury and myself. I think he will recollect that in the earlier stages of the consideration of the reform of this House I had the honour to stand under the same umbrella as Lord Halsbury, and I was very proud to stand there. I shall go to my grave with an unquenchable belief in all the virtues and none of the vices of the hereditary Peerage, and I do not think, to be serious, that there is a single Peer on either side of the House who does not really believe, like Lord St. Davids evidently does, that we have got now the best House of Lords that we could possibly get. There is one thing that noble Lords opposite will not tell us. They will not tell us what kind of a House of Lords they have at the back of their minds which they think would be better than the present one.<lb/>
A very common line of argument with Radicals, both those who are Lords and those who are not Lords, is this. They say to members of the Unionist Party, "You are always saying what a fine thing the House of Lords is and how well it has done in the past; then why in the name of goodness do you wish to alter it?" A Radical, much less a Radical Cabinet Minister, ought to be the last man in the world to ask a question of that kind. By means of mixing prejudice against the land laws of this country with a certain amount of platform sophistry and unscrupulous calumny upon individual members of the House of Lords, Cabinet Ministers and their Party have misled large audiences in this country with regard to the individual membership of this House. The noble Viscount expresses surprise. I will give him an instance of the kind of thing I mean. He said that we ought not to indulge in recriminations, that this matter was far too serious for that. I do not wish to rake up the whole gamut of vulgarity in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has indulged in the speeches he has delivered in the country. This is the kind of thing that is calumnious and unscrupulous. It is calumnious to suggest to the public that the Duke of Westminster is a blackmailer. It is done
<col>398</col>
to mislead the public and gain capital against the House of Lords as a legislative institution. The Chancellor of the Exchequer goes down to the country, and in reviewing what he calls backwoodsmen&#x2014;I am not quite sure what he means by "backwoodsmen"&#x2014;he says, "Who is Lord St. John of Bletsoe?" Lord St. John of Bletsoe has, perhaps, not taken a very prominent part in the debates in this House, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer displays a very lamentable ignorance of English history when he asks such a question. He ought to know that Lord St. John of Bletsoe was considered good enough by Queen Victoria to be a Lord Lieutenant of his county, and good enough for noble Lords opposite to go to when they wanted anything done with regard to the Territorial Army. I am not sure that he is not the Chairman, at any rate he is a prominent member, of the Territorial Force Association.<lb/>
This kind of platform talk, a very old stock-in-trade of the Radical Party as practised by the street corner orator, when adopted by Cabinet Ministers holding responsible positions in the country becomes a very serious matter, and has to be dealt with. There are two ways of dealing with this situation. One is to treat it with the contempt which it undoubtedly deserves. I do not wish to detain your Lordships at any length with my family history, but I was brought up in a sound Tory household and reared in the belief that the British Constitution was <i>res judicata</i> on the part of the Conservative Party and ought not to be departed from in any kind of way&#x2014;not from motives of sentiment, but because we believe that it is the best vehicle you can get for expressing the political liberties of the people and improving the social welfare of the inhabitants of these islands. Personally I should have liked to see the noble Marquess get up and deny that there was a Constitutional question involved at all, and tell noble Lords opposite to go to perdition and enjoy the inevitable fate that awaits people who go there. I venture to say, with great respect, that it was a very bad day's work for the Tory Party when they coquetted with my noble friend Lord Newton's Bill for the reform of this House in the first instance, and I am very proud indeed to have been one of the very few when it was first introduced who ventured to oppose its principle being seriously adopted.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0204"/>
<col>399</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00985"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord voted for the Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00986"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: I am not aware that there was a Division to send the Bill to a Committee, but if there was I certainly did not vote for it. I was one of the three people who stood up in this House and opposed it. I do not know whether the noble Lord is referring to a subsequent occasion when the band of seventeen followed Lord Halsbury into the Lobby on the question of the hereditary principle. That is an occasion on which I shall always regret that I did not vote with Lord Halsbury, but took the pusillanimous course of walking out of the House. Lord Newton's Bill and the whole proposal coming at the time it did was, in my humble opinion, with the deepest respect to the noble Marquess, a dangerous gambit at the beginning of a long and difficult game, and we parted with a very valuable asset to the Conservative Party in throwing over, or disintegrating, shall I say, the hereditary principle. I do not believe that we should have been in the position in which we are now if we had declined to depart from it in any single particular.<lb/>
There is the other way of dealing with this situation which I think has been described as "bringing the British Constitution into harmony with the spirit of the age." As to that, I sometimes wish that those who preach this doctrine would employ their great talents and their magnificent powers of speech in endeavouring to bring the spirit of the age into harmony with the British Constitution. Be that as it may, I for one, who have been opposed to this in the past, am perfectly ready to look the situation in the face as it presents itself at the present moment, and. I say, whether you rightly abandon the hereditary principle or whether you wrongly abandon it, the duty of the Unionist Party if they are really anxious to find a national solution of this problem, and the duty of the Radical Party too, is to find a House of Lords that could discharge the duties appropriate to all circumstances. It is quite impossible, of course, for anybody to be enthusiastic about the reform of the House of Lords. Nobody except the most inveterate philistine, or the man who enjoys the frame of mind, described by the late Lord Beaconsfield, which is never enthusiastic unless giving away some great principle, can really be rabidly enthusiastic about the reform of the House of Lords. I am going to refrain on this occasion from any further
<col>400</col>
vain regrets and idle tears, and I shall support the noble Marquess in this portion of his attempt to find a House of Lords which shall be so based upon public confidence that it can&#x2014;with the full assent of the vast majority of the people of this country&#x2014;discharge those duties which a Second Chamber ought to be able to discharge.<lb/>
The real point of difference, as it seems to me, between us and noble Lords opposite, after all this talk about the Constitutional question has been thoroughly sifted, is whether the Second Chamber is going to have some means of referring a question to the people before the Bill is passed into law. You may talk about this Bill or about the Parliament Bill as long as you like, but that is the point, that separates us at the present moment, and, as far as I understand, will continue to separate us. We on our side do not intend to give up this point, until we have persuaded a sufficient majority of our fellow-countrymen to think as we do, and until we can get a Bill passed into law securing this power for the Second Chamber&#x2014;a power which can either be exercised by a wholly hereditary House of Lords, or a composite House, or an elected Senate. I do not know exactly what sort of House of Lords Lord St. Davids really does want. I think he had a strong preference for the House of Lords as it is at the present moment. I am very glad that he finds it such a pleasant place. His principal objection to altering the House of Lords was that the new Peers would have to be paid when they came here. That is an objection which I can quite understand the noble Lord opposite and his friends view with a considerable amount of alarm.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00987"><member>LORD ST. DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid the noble Lord is misrepresenting me. I was not thinking of whether it was or was not desirable that they should be paid. I was trying to point out that you were creating under this Bill a class of poor Peers, and that if they came here and expected payment and received payment you would then have attendance in this House much more compulsory than it was before.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00988"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: The point I was going to make was not with regard to a poor class of Peer, but that if you are going to create a body of 500 paid Peers it will make a very serious inroad on the national Exchequer. That is what I could not help thinking the noble Lord had
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0205"/>
<col>401</col>
at the back of his mind when he looked with such horror upon the possibility of those who were elevated to the Peerage in future demanding a salary. I have heard it said that in some cases the boot was on the other leg, and people have been unkind enough to suggest that you were not paid to come up to the House of Lords but that you actually paid in order to get into it. The noble Lord and his friends opposite have created so many Peers lately that any suggestion I may have to make about that is entirely superfluous. They are admirable judges of this sort of transaction.<lb/>
If I am not wearying your Lordships, I should like to say, with regard to the Bill of the noble Marquess, that I will not this evening follow it into all its details. When it gets to the Committee stage no doubt we shall be able to go into them. There are one or two things I should very much like to see done. I hope the noble Marquess will seriously consider whether he cannot get over the difficulty, which we fully appreciate, of reserving some places in the new House of Lords for the heads of religious bodies other than the Anglican Church; and I also hope that it will be laid down once and for all in black and white that the House of Lords acting as a Court of Appeal is not the House of Lords acting in its legislative capacity. In all the platform confusion and misconception created by people who do not know their constitutional history so well as the noble Viscount on the Front Bench does, nothing has been more regrettable than the confusion that exists as to the acts of the House of Lords in its judicial capacity being synonymous with the acts of the House of Lords in its legislative capacity. I know that that confusion had a very determining influence with the people in the decision it is said they have come to with regard to the Second Chamber, and it would not be a very great exaggeration to say that if in the General Election this misconception had not been tacitly agreed to by Cabinet Ministers, because I have never heard of a single one of them making any attempt to correct it, their friends and themselves would be very dangerously near not possessing the portfolios they possess at the present moment.<lb/>
I desire, with great respect to the noble Marquess, to say one word with regard to the possibility, alluded to by Lord St. Davids, of an elected Senate in this country. I myself am perfectly prepared to follow the noble Marquess now or at any other time supposing he finds it necessary to propose
<col>402</col>
an elected Senate. I have arrived at this conclusion because I think that an elected Senate may some day or other&#x2014;sooner than we perhaps think&#x2014;come within the region of practical politics. I have not arrived at it from any sense of panic, because I have been at the greatest pains to discover, whenever I have had the honour of going to a political meeting, what the people themselves really think with regard to the Second Chamber. There are two clear cut opinions on this matter. There are those who do not want any House of Lords at all, who want nothing but the House of Commons. That is a perfectly intelligible and honest proposition, which compares very favourably with some of the views put forward by Radical Cabinet Ministers. Then there are those who hold the opinion that this country should have a Second Chamber which is not in any degree inferior to the Second Chambers of His Majesty's Oversea Dominions or the Second Chambers of other countries. They are perfectly willing that our Second Chamber here should exercise the same powers as those Second Chambers exercise, but they invariably say that, supposing they agree that our Second Chamber shall have those powers, then they would like to elect the members of their Second Chamber themselves.<lb/>
In considering this I desire to ask the great mass of those who are now being asked to give up their seats in the House of Lords under this Bill whether it would not be fairer, if we are to regard it from the point of view of personal privileges at all, that we should be allowed first of all to go down to the country and contest our right or capacity to sit in this Assembly before our fellow-countrymen, and let anybody stand against us for a seat in the House of Lords who cares to put up. I would prefer to do that, and to fight for my right to sit in this House before my fellow-countrymen, than to be turned out by my fellow Peers. If I am to perish at all, I am not sure that I would not rather perish at the hands of the electors than at the hands of your Lordships' House. Of course, I am very sorry to be obliged to agree with anything that fell from noble Lords opposite, but I do agree with the proposition that a Peer who has been turned out of the House of Lords by his fellow Peers does go down to contest a constituency for a seat in the House of Commons under a certain disability, and it would be much fairer to everybody if all Peers some day or other were placed as
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0206"/>
<col>403</col>
other men are, and could either stand for the House of Commons or for the House of Lords, or not stand for Parliament at all.<lb/>
This debate has had one very great result. It has unmasked publicly beyond any shadow of doubt what is the attitude of the Radical Party towards this question, and that is why I venture to think that any prolonged debate about the composition of the new House of Lords will be absolutely fruitless. Their attitude shows that it is absolutely certain that they do not mean now, or at any other time, to restore to this House, or any other House of Lords, the powers that all other Second Chambers possess, and the powers that the Party on this side of the House intend to fight for. We do not need to come forward and take a hand in this Constitutional struggle <i>in forma pauperis.</i> We have behind us a majority of the people of England, and you cannot settle this question entirely in your own way without consulting those who command so many legions as the noble Marquess has at his disposal. You have an opportunity now of showing a disposition to come to some reasonable settlement of this great Constitutional question; and my Lords, speaking entirely as a private member of this House and of the Unionist Party, I should like to say that your rejection of this Bill will leave us with an absolutely free hand in the future to settle the matter in such a way as will seem good to us when we have the power. We shall not consider ourselves honourably bound by anything that has been said in the past towards the reconstitution of the House of Lords or towards the remodelling of its powers. I repeat that the rejection of the suggestions that are put forward now will leave us with an absolutely free hand in this matter, and it seems to me that, looking forward into the near future, our course with regard to the Parliament Bill is clearer than ever it was before. We have nothing to hope for or to gain by any kind of surrender to noble Lords opposite with regard to the principle contained in the Parliament Bill. Noble Lords opposite will, I am sure, realise far better than I can tell them that, if they do go through with their own idea of what a settlement should be without listening to the suggestions of noble Lords on this side, they will be forging a very formidable weapon indeed, a weapon which we on our side shall not hesitate to turn against them when the proper time comes.</membercontribution></p>
<col>404</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00989"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL BATHURST</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after the brilliant and witty speech of my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke, I fear that the few words that I may say will not be deserving of your attention, and I would not address your Lordships unless I felt most deeply the importance of the Bill which is now before your Lordships' House. I wish to protest with all my strength against the course which the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition is asking you to take in giving this Bill a Second Reading. The noble Lord who has just sat down rather twitted the noble Lord opposite in believing that this House was the best possible institution of its kind that could be found. I am one of those who feel with the noble Lord, Lord St. Davids, that this House is the best possible House which could be devised by human beings as a Second Chamber for this country. I contend, first, that any reform of the House of Lords would be most disastrous to the country and Constitution, and that it is absolutely unnecessary and is not required by the majority of the people. I contend that a really strong House is not required, and would not prevent conflict with the other House; neither would it have the elasticity of the present House, and it would not be very long before another reform was demanded.<lb/>
I think most people will agree that this House up to now has never made any serious mistake. Those Bills which have been rejected by this House, such as the Education Bill and the Licensing Bill, returned to the other House and nothing more has been heard of them. Your Lordships' judgment has been confirmed by the electors on more than one occasion. I would refer to the Home Rule Bill. That Bill was rejected by this House, and your Lordships were confirmed by a large majority of the electors at the next election. Why should this House be reformed? I have not heard any good reason why it should be reformed. This House has gone through many periods of storm and stress. A cry has been raised before now against the Lords, very much worse than any that is raised at present. I will not allude to the time of Cromwell, but I would like to refer to the year 1780, when Lord George Gordon got up the "No Popery" cry and a mob of thousands of disorderly people marched to the Houses of Parliament to present a monster petition. Many members of your
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0207"/>
<col>405</col>
Lordships' House who came down to the House were suspected of being Papists and were assaulted by that large and violent mob; they were dragged from their coaches; they had their wigs torn off; they were robbed of their watches; they saw their carriages broken up, and they arrived in this House in a most dishevelled condition. Has anything like that occurred owing to any violent feeling in the country at the present time? Luckily, better order is kept in our streets to-day and our methods of protection are much better now. But have you, my Lords, ever seen any demonstration of that kind against this House? Have you ever been hooted down on a public platform; have you ever been insulted; have you ever seen any demonstrations which looked as if the people were suffering oppression from a tyrannical Chamber; have you ever seen any organisation against this House which approaches the enthusiasm of the Suffragettes? I do not think, from outside appearances at any rate, that any one could argue there is any very strong feeling in the country against this House as it is at present.<lb/>
The noble Viscount who leads this House said that the rejection of the Budget by your Lordships in 1909 was the cause of all this agitation against your Lordships' House. I submit that the Budget had nothing to do with it. If we had passed the Budget on the first occasion we could not have prevented this demand for reform as now presented. This is an agitation which has been well engineered and entirely engineered for Party purposes, and is the result of advertisement and talk consequent on the Resolutions which have been before now introduced in your Lordships' House. The Government then saw their opportunity. The Irishmen who wished for Home Rule said, "Now is our opportunity; we shall never get Home Rule until the House of Lords is crippled." The Welsh members saw their opportunity, and they said the same thing with regard to disestablishment; while we all know what the opinions of the Socialists are, and their demands for a Single Chamber, which I am sure is not desired for one moment by the majority of the people of this country. While all these different schemes of reform were being taken up and discussed in the newspapers, Conservative Parliamentary candidates said, "Now is our opportunity to sweep the country at the next election by advocating a scheme for the reform of
<col>406</col>
the Upper House." They therefore proceeded to put great pressure on our Parliamentary leaders, who adopted the policy, and, as I think the noble Marquess rather hinted, this scheme was most distasteful to him when he presented it to your Lordships' House. The leaders of the Opposition succumbed to all this pressure from candidates and found themselves committed to bringing in this scheme of reform. They are obliged to redeem their pledge by this Bill. The scheme of reform you have seen to-night, and I can only compare the way the leaders of the Opposition seized on this scheme of House of Lords reform with what happened when Mr. Balfour produced his scheme of the Referendum. He produced it on the eve of the election, and every candidate, whatever he thought of the scheme, had to put it before the electors on the chance of getting a few more votes and so winning the election. When the Government first introduced their Parliament Bill, I believe they had no intention whatever of going any further with the real scheme of the reform of your Lordships' House; they did not want a stronger House, they only wanted Veto-curtailing powers. But they have been so pressed with questions in another place, so goaded with inquiries as to when this great scheme was going to be produced, that Mr. Asquith felt obliged to say that the Government would bring in a measure of reform after the Veto Bill was passed. I ask, What is the good of reform when the Veto Bill is passed? What is the use of a strong House when it is bound in chains which render it powerless? Reference has been made to the proportion of Peers to be elected under this new scheme should it be passed. But if you throw out the Veto Bill, we are told that 500 Peers will be elected, and those 500 Peers supporting the Government will upset the whole of the calculations that have been made.<lb/>
I have tried to make my reasons clear for refusing to vote for the Second Reading of this measure. I consider that this Bill would be disastrous to the country and would destroy the Constitution. It is not wanted by the majority of the electors, and if it is passed it will be useless and would of a certainty be rejected in another place. I have spoken to a good many noble Lords as to their opinion of this Bill, and so far I have not met one who really in his heart of hearts approves of the measure. At the same time a great many noble Lords may
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0208"/>
<col>407</col>
think that they cannot go back on the Resolutions of last year. I want to try and prove to those who feel that they cannot vote against this measure that they are perfectly free to do so. In order to do that. I should like to quote from a speech that the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition made in his place on that memorable night when only seventeen Peers were found to vote against those Resolutions. The noble Marquess said&#x2014;
<quote>"I want if I may, before we go to a Division, to say one word with regard to the scope of the Resolution itself. I agree with my noble friend Lord Lytton in thinking that there is a certain amount of misunderstanding with regard to the effect of the Resolution. We have already resolved that a strong and efficient Second Chamber can best be provided by the reform and reconstitution of the House of Lords, and we are now asked to go one step further and to say that it is a necessary preliminary to such reform and reconstitution that the possession of a hereditary Peerage shall not of itself&#x2014;and I lay great stress on these words&#x2014;give a right to sit and vote in your Lordships' House. That Resolution has been represented as if it were equivalent to a repudiation of the hereditary principle. My Lords, I do not at all so read it&#x2014;</quote>
this is the important part&#x2014;
<quote>"I will even go the length of saying that it would be possible for one of your Lordships to vote for this Resolution with the full intention of afterwards proposing that this House should consist entirely of hereditary Peers. All that we are really invited to do by this Resolution is to say that a hereditary Peerage by itself is not to give the title to sit and vote."</quote>
When you read those words of the noble Marquess it is clear that the debate on the Resolutions was nothing more than an academic one. He asked you, first to say that if a really strong House was wanted it was a necessary preliminary that the possession of a hereditary Peerage should not of itself give a right to sit and vote. He then told you that you might vote for the Resolution and yet on a future occasion be perfectly free to vote as a supporter of the hereditary system. I contend, with that before you that every noble Lord who was present at that debate and voted for the Resolution is perfectly free to vote against the Bill which is before us to-night.<lb/>
We all know the great influence which the noble Marquess has in this House. We acknowledge him to be a very great leader; we acknowledge that he has rarely made a mistake; we remember his many triumphs and the skill and tact he has shown in leading his Party through many a difficult pass. There are a great many noble Lords who would be most unwilling to vote against
<col>408</col>
him. They consider that he is a safe man to follow, and that they cannot go wrong in voting as he directs them to do. But, my Lords, the noble Marquess in introducing this measure, which in my opinion will destroy the Constitution and abolish this historic House for no adequate reason except as a tactical measure for securing the support of some electors while at the same time appeasing those who desire, not reform, but single Chamber government, is taking a responsibility upon himself which for my part, think a most dangerous one and cannot support. I hope noble Lords who hold my views will stand firm to their opinions and will vote, not according to how they are recommended by their leader who has brought in this Bill, but according to their own consciences and as they think best for tire good of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00990"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ST. LEVAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is within my recollection that when the Resolutions proposed by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches were discussed in your Lordships' House the noble Marquess who has brought in this Bill expressed a wish that Back Bench Peers would take part in the debate, and I also think I am right in believing that the noble Earl, Lord Crewe, expressed a similar wish during the short discussion which took place when the Veto Bill was introduced in your Lordships' House last year. It is as a Back Bench Peer, which I think your Lordships will agree is a totally different thing from a "backwoodsman," that I venture to address your Lordships to-night. It appears to me, after the acceptance by your Lordships of the Resolutions of the noble Earl, that some such Bill as we are now discussing was inevitable, unless indeed those Resolutions were to be considered merely as a pious expression of opinion and not intended to be followed up, which is a view I have often heard expressed by some of my Radical friends. But, my Lords, I do not believe that was the case, and I do not believe it was ever meant to be the case. One result of those Resolutions and of the legislation which they foreshadowed was very plain indeed. It was that if anything came of them a considerable number of members of your Lordships' House would have to cease to occupy their seats in this House. This was well known and appreciated by a number of us who voted in favour of those Resolutions, and it was impossible, I think, for any of us who were
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0209"/>
<col>409</col>
forced to that conclusion to regard the prospect with other than feelings of dismay.<lb/>
A seat in your Lordships' House to my mind confers a very great and precious privilege, and the idea of having to give it up would mean to most of us that we should have to make a very great and serious sacrifice. That being the case, what was there to induce any one to contemplate the necessity of that sacrifice? I believe it was borne in upon us that to submit to this sacrifice would be the best way of ensuring the maintenance of an effective Second Chamber. By an effective Second Chamber I mean a Chamber which has the power of referring a disputed question to the voice of the people. The reason we thought it necessary for us to make this sacrifice was this, that, rightly or wrongly, the people of this country are not prepared to support a Second Chamber based entirely on the hereditary principle. The fact was emphasised by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, and also, I think, by Lord Denbigh, that there was a very strong feeling in the country against a Second Chamber based entirely on the hereditary principle. My Lords, I am bound to say that that accords with my own experience. I find that a number, on the Unionist side as well as on the Radical side, would prefer that the Second Chamber should not be entirely hereditary. The reason for that it is not necessary to go into to-night; it would take too long. But I will say I do not believe that anything the House of Lords has done has induced a change of mind in the people on this question, and I disagree with the noble Viscount opposite that any feeling of that sort can be traced to the rejection of the Finance Bill two or three years ago. I believe if we had not rejected that Bill the Government's majority would have been very much larger than it is now, that a great number of people voted for us who would not have voted for us if we had accepted the Finance Bill and all that it contained.<lb/>
We Unionists want a Second Chamber, and if we cannot get a Second Chamber based entirely on the hereditary principle, we wish to have a Second Chamber which has some other title to the confidence of the people, based on some modified form of the hereditary principle at least. We Unionists believe in a Second Chamber because we believe it is absolutely necessary to guard not only the interests but the liberties of the nation. On the other hand,
<col>410</col>
the Radical Party want a Single Chamber. I know noble Lords opposite do not admit that their proposals amount to a Single Chamber, but they want what we Unionists believe to be in effect a Single Chamber. We believe that to be a most dangerous and unstable form of government, that it would place the whole of the liberties of the people of this country at the mercy of a small oligarchy, and that is a position which I think no Englishman can contemplate with equanimity or satisfaction. Therefore it comes to this, that noble Lords who think as I do are faced with this alternative, either to give up their position, or risk the possibility of giving up their position, in your Lordships' House in order to have the security and the protection of a double-Chamber form of government, or to retain, I believe only temporarily, their places in your Lordships' House at the risk of being deprived of that protection. I think that when it comes to a question between our privileges and what we believe to be the welfare of the country, there is not very much room for hesitation. I am convinced that noble Lords who do not think as I do&#x2014;and there are, no doubt, several on this side of the House&#x2014;are acting in the most absolute good faith and honestly carrying out their convictions. But I believe that when we have to choose between a surrender of our places in this House and the welfare of the country, we shall not hesitate to prefer the welfare of the country; and therefore we are prepared&#x2014;I speak only for myself, of course, but I believe there are many others of the same opinion&#x2014;to make this very painful sacrifice.<lb/>
The noble Viscount opposite in his speech on the First Reading of this Bill, rather attacked the noble Marquess for unnecessarily destroying the House of Lords. I think that was the sense of what the noble Viscount said. I confess that that left me very cold, because my belief is that the Parliament Bill will most effectually destroy this House. I do not believe that a powerless Second Chamber such as is proposed can possibly exist for any length of time. It would not be of any real power; in fact, the only thing I can compare it to for the moment is the position of the Roman Senate during the decline of the Roman Empire&#x2014;the Senate which existed solely to register the decrees of C&#x00E6;sar. At any rate, this Second Chamber which is proposed will have, as far as I can see, no real power, and it will be so recognised and will inevi
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0210"/>
<col>411</col>
tably be swept away as a useless excrescence of the political body.<lb/>
This Bill as it stands is no doubt capable of amendment and reconstruction in various ways; but the noble Marquess said something to-night which I was personally very glad to hear&#x2014;namely, that it was not the case, as might be supposed and I believe has been supposed in some quarters, that the suggestion of increasing the Spiritual Peers by including among them representatives of other denominations had been lost sight of, and perhaps it is possible even now that a means may be found of overcoming the difficulties which he pointed out to us in that respect.<lb/>
Before I sit down I should like to say one word in reference to the position of the noble Marquess who has brought in this Bill. The noble Marquess made use of what I thought was a very curious expression when he moved the First Reading. He spoke of the possibility of this Bill being regarded as a betrayal. I have no notion what he meant. I certainly feel no sense of being betrayed myself, and I know of no one who has made any complaint of the kind. The difficulty of the position of the noble Marquess in bringing in this Bill has been generously acknowledged by the noble Viscount opposite. I should like the noble Marquess to know that there is one at all events, and I believe others, on this side who fully appreciates the difficulties he has had to face and the courage with which he has faced them. It is not an ordinary position in which the noble Marquess has found himself. He has had to indicate to his followers a course which in a sense does not apply to himself. It is one thing for a leader to say to his followers, "There is the road you have to follow; come along and I will show you the way," but it is a very different thing, and it requires a great deal of courage to have to point out a path which some of his followers may have to pursue but which circumstances prevent him from following himself. What I mean is this, that though a new order of things may result in a number of us losing our places, there is nobody in this House who could regard with anything but the greatest feeling of dismay the possibility that the noble Marquess could be excluded. In any new House the noble Marquess must have a place, and we hope and expect he will have a place; in fact, if this Bill meant that there would be a chance of his being excluded it would make me hesitate to vote for the Bill.
<col>412</col>
But, my Lords, this Bill is an honest and courageous endeavour to protect the country from what some of us on this side consider the calamity of single-Chamber government, and to secure the establishment of a Second Chamber so constituted as to be fair to all Parties and commanding the confidence of the people at large. The Bill ought to be most fully and thoroughly discussed, and after what I have said your Lordships will know that I intend to vote for the Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00991"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is no doubt that at the last election many votes were lost to us because the House of Lords in its judicial capacity was considered to be the same as the House of Lords in its legislative capacity. I suggest that this difference could be made clear to the people if the House of Lords in its judicial capacity were called the Supreme Court or given some such name. It is a name which is thoroughly respected in the United States and other countries, and the words carry their own meaning. I know very well that the noble and learned Lords, in pursuance of their judicial office, laid down the law in a particular well known case as it was, and not perhaps as they thought it ought to be, and there is no doubt that large numbers of people thought that it was the legislative body of the House of Lords&#x2014;the backwoodsmen and others&#x2014;who had laid down that law. I therefore think that before another election that point ought to be made clear.<lb/>
The noble Viscount talked about the absolute Veto. We have never claimed that. All we have claimed has been the power of delaying legislation until the opinion of the people has been ascertained, and if this House gives up its hereditary rights and powers it will also have to give up the power of delaying legislation and consulting the opinion of the people. The power of asking the opinion of the people must reside somewhere. It is very many years since the words <i>Le roi s'avisera</i> have been heard in Parliament, and I suggest that in lieu of using them His gracious Majesty should have the power of calling for a Referendum if he thought proper to do so, even without the advice of the Prime Minister. This power should be given by Statute, so that if used people should not be able to say that it was unconstitutional. I wish that the noble Marquess had put the Referendum in a more prominent place when
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0211"/>
<col>413</col>
this Bill was being read for the first time. I look upon the poll of the people as the only available remedy for the over-representation of certain portions of the population, and think that it ought to be made compulsory in the case of any measure that is intended to alter the Constitution. I hope that Lord Balfour's Bill may be either incorporated in the one now before us, or that it will be proceeded with <i>pari passu.</i> The two together would form a statesman-like and democratic solution of the great problem that is now before us.<lb/>
There is one other matter to which I wish to call your Lordships' attention. Under this Bill the only <i>ex officio</i> Peers in Parliament would be the Archbishops of Canterbury and York and Peers who have held high judicial office. In the latter category there are, I believe, seventeen, making a total of nineteen. I suggest the addition of six more <i>ex officio</i> Peers, which would bring their number up to five and twenty. It would, I think, be of great advantage to the public service if the First Sea Lord of the Admiralty and the Chief of the Imperial Staff always had seats in this House. Of course they would sit on the Cross Benches, and would not as a rule be expected to take part in discussions unconnected with their own Departments. They should, I think, be made Peers for life, after having held these offices for one year. This delay of one year would prevent any factious Government giving these appointments to officers for a short period, merely for the purpose of making them Peers for life. It is quite possible that these officers may not wish to have their duties and responsibilities increased in this manner. I am not, however, considering their personal convenience, but the advantage to the public of having naval and military officers in this House, able to explain their views at first hand, instead of having them filtered through the minds of civilians before being placed before the country. However industrious and talented these civilians may be, they cannot in a few months get that grasp of detail which is the outcome of the experience of a life-time. No amount of study in Whitehall can make up for the want of knowledge that can only be acquired by years spent on the ocean in company with other ships, or in camp life on land in different countries under varying circumstances. No poring over Blue-books within the four walls of a room can replace the open air study of naval and military problems,
<col>414</col>
and I think the efficiency of both the Services and of this House would be increased if the First Sea Lord and the Chief of the Imperial Staff were made <i>ex officio</i> Peers.<lb/>
I also think that whenever the Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs, the Home Office, the Colonies, and India, do not sit in the Second Chamber, those Departments should be represented by their Under-Secretaries. As these four additional Peers would be selected by the Ministry of the day they would be practically chosen by the majority of the House of Commons. Their presence here, their speeches, and their votes would tend to strengthen the Government of the day, and thus assist in keeping the newly constituted Chamber in harmony with the majority of those who sit in another place, and so have the effect of lessening the chances of disputes between the two Houses. I do not myself lay very much stress on this last argument but it is worthy of attention, especially when calculating the probable strength of Parties in the Chamber about to be constituted. I hear that Unionists look upon their majority in it as being about eighteen, and that the Liberals put it at about thirty-two. If my suggestion is adopted it will lessen those numbers by four. I hope that both sides of the House will seriously consider the points that I have raised, and that if Amendments are moved to give effect to them they will meet with approval.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-00993"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BRASSEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in a few words I will endeavour to place before your Lordships views as to the Bill now before us which I believe to be widely held by our kin beyond sea&#x2014;lords of the outer march. Those of us who have resided long in the Colonies know well how many are the ties which bind the Empire together. Loyalty to the Throne in an eminent degree is a bond of Empire. Reverence is felt for the homeland. As a Second Chamber your Lordships' House is rightly held in honour as the oldest legislative Assembly in the world. Many historic names are inscribed on its roll. It is a pillar of the Empire. Why is it proposed to put an end to this House as at present constituted? Is it because your Lordships are not in accord sufficiently with democratic aspirations?
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0212"/>
<col>415</col>
We shall not heal differences by establishing a Second Chamber on the elective principle but on a narrower franchise, and consisting of men chosen as specially qualified for the work of Parliament. The late Lord Salisbury said&#x2014;
<quote>"If this House were so altered that it consisted of determined politicians who attended all the debates and held resolutely to their own opinions, you would have pronounced the doom of the present system of government."</quote>
Is it desired, on the other hand, to create a Second Chamber with greater powers of resistance? What are the experiences in other countries? The Second Chambers in the United States and in Germany are strong as guardians of those rights of local self-government which States, federated for national protection, desire to maintain. Is the reconstruction of this House proposed with a view of offering resistance to the demands of Labour? Turn to the report of the Trades Union Congress held at Sheffield in September last, attended by hundreds of delegates representing all the skilled trades in the country. The proceedings were opened by Lord Fitzwilliam as Lord Mayor. He was warmly received. The chairman of the Congress made a speech distinguished for its moderation. Insurance against sickness and unemployment and the reversal of the Osborne Judgment were all that he asked for; of the gospel of plunder there was not a word. Is the change proposed because your Lordships are not equal to your task? In Parliamentary ability this House has never failed. I will not dwell on those reforms in the constitution of your Lordships' House which are possible without destruction of a venerable fabric that could never be replaced. They will be more fittingly considered when the Parliament Bill is before us. I do not see the necessity for so destructive a change as that contemplated in the noble Marquess's Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00994"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the speech to which we have just listened is certainly a strong encomium of the work done by your Lordships' House, but I fear that on both sides there will be general agreement that some vital changes are necessary. It seems to me that there is rather an omission in this Bill, and an occasion is lost for what I distinctly regard as an opportunity for strengthening this particular House of Parliament. In the Bill it is proposed to have many different changes&#x2014;the hereditary principle, the elec-
<col>416</col>
tive principle, the nominative principle, and the ecclesiastical&#x2014;but amid all these different elements there is one wanting, and that is the Imperial or Colonial element. I think this is particularly an occasion when it would have been desirable to incorporate some Colonial representation. Under the new conditions foreshadowed we are not any longer as a House to deal with financial questions, and therefore the difficulty of allowing Colonial representatives to be present who would not be responsible for finances is removed.<lb/>
Again, there is the question of strengthening this House by an infusion of the judicial element. For some time past there has been considerable dissatisfaction in the Oversea Dominions with the constitution of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. As long ago as 1901 Mr. Chamberlain stated that&#x2014;
<quote>"Her Majesty's Government are considering the terms of a Bill for enhancing the dignity and promoting the efficiency of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council by practically amalgamating it with the House of Lords, and providing for the permanent representation of the great Colonies in the new Court which it is proposed to create."</quote>
That proposal has not been lost sight of by our Colonial fellow citizens, because among the Resolutions to be proposed at the forthcoming Imperial Conference is one by the Australian Government, which runs as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"That it is desirable that the judicial functions in regard to the Dominions, now exercised by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, should be vested in an Imperial Appeal Court, which should also be the final Court of Appeal for Great Britain and Ireland."</quote>
That practically indicates that your Lordships' House is the proper House for the addition of Colonial and judicial representatives. I hope that in the course of the consideration of this Bill it may be found possible to devise means by which some Colonial representation would be gained. I do not for a moment suggest that any such infusion would be a solution of the question of a strong Imperial Council, with all the requisite powers and responsibilities, but it would be a step in that direction, and it would give some Imperial characteristics to the Second Chamber of this country.<lb/>
As regards this Bill, I look upon it as an earnest that we wish to give effect to the Resolutions which were passed last year,
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0213"/>
<col>417</col>
and also as forming a basis of negotiation with the Party opposite. More than that, it can hardly be inconceivable that we, who are declared to be not competent to deal with the ordinary legislation of the country and particularly in regard to finance, should ourselves promote a measure substituting a new Chamber for that which has existed for many centuries. I very much doubt whether any of us really know what the people of the country do demand, and I question whether the hereditary principle is really so unpopular as it is the fashion to make out. But whether it is or not, I should be sorry at this stage to commit myself to approval or disapproval of all the provisions of this Bill; and I rather agree with the remark made by the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, who said this afternoon that the Bill did lack simplicity. I think that is a fair charge to make against this Bill. I very much doubt whether in the rough and tumble of Parliamentary life these very nicely adjusted parts by which the future composition of this House is to be regulated would stand for long. It is also to be remembered that, whatever may be the merits of the Bill, it is inconceivable, when you are going to write down and define the principles constituting a Second Chamber, that that Second Chamber should always be at the mercy either of the Government of the day or of the other House. You cannot write part of the Constitution of this country. You must have a complete written Constitution; otherwise it is fairly obvious that it would be always liable to attack and to be changed according to the will of the other branch of the Legislature at the time. If you are going to put part of the Constitution into the melting pot you must put the whole in, and clearly define the relations of one branch of the Legislature to the other branch. If the Constitution is to lie written, it must be written as a whole and not in portions or parts; otherwise it could not stand for long. It would, as I say, be always liable to be changed, and that is a thing which would not be consistent with the strong Second Chamber which one would wish to see.<lb/>
I believe that this is a concrete scheme put forward with a view to arriving at some agreement upon the foundation of a strong Second Chamber, and one which will receive the consent of the nation at large. This is a proposal in that direction, and therefore some advance is being made
<col>418</col>
towards that settlement which we all desire to see. That is my view, and therefore I shall support this Bill on Second Reading, although I do not think anybody could commit himself to every proposal in the Bill as being absolutely sound or consistent with what the country demands. Whether there is any half-way house between the hereditary and the elective principle is rather questionable. It is impossible to forecast what the nation will demand, but I do think this is an honest attempt to solve a very difficult Constitutional question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00995"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think most of us, if we said what we really felt, would prefer to keep your Lordships' House in its present condition. It is a House of historic association; it is a House whose members have rendered heroic service to the State; it is a House of fascinating romance, and, after all, romance is a great asset to any nation. The members of this House are always to the front in time of peace and in time of war. They give of their best to this country. Some few&#x2014;and it will always be the case where human nature has to be taken into consideration&#x2014;have fallen away from the high ideals, and in doing that have done some little harm to the prestige of your Lordships' House. Again, as the noble Viscount who leads the House said this evening, education and the knowledge acquired by education by the working man has led to greater demands being made on your Lordships' House. The question before us is not what we prefer, but what we have to submit to. Opinion, so far as I can gather it&#x2014;and I had the opportunity of speaking in a great many big towns during the last elections&#x2014;is, for better or worse, against the hereditary principle at this time. I deplore it, but I think it is wise to recognise facts. If we are to change, I confess that I like the Bill that has been brought in by the noble Marquess. I had the privilege of sitting on a Committee appointed by Opposition Peers to consider schemes connected with changes in this House, and I confess that I like this Bill more than any scheme that was brought to the notice of that Committee.<lb/>
The first proposal in the Bill is that 100 Peers shall be elected out of a certain number of qualified Peers in this House, and I believe that the number of qualified Peers amounts to about 300. One feature that I like about the Bill is that no one is selected. In all the schemes that we had
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0214"/>
<col>419</col>
before us there were certain members of this House who had to be selected. Under this Bill no one is selected; they are all elected. The Liberals say, and with some amount of truth, that these 100 Peers who are in the first category will work rather hardly against them; that in point of fact out of those 100 Peers they would not get their due proportion of fifty. That may be so&#x2014;I think it will be so&#x2014;but they will have a chance of regaining that loss when we come to the second category in this Bill. I would say to your Lordships and I make rather a point of this, do not try to divide the matter equally, because I think all of us are of this opinion, that when we choose the 100 Peers we ought to choose the most efficient men in the whole House. I know that noble Lords opposite will not accuse me of any discourtesy towards them. A Liberal Peer is, of course, quite the equal of a Conservative Peer, but there are only about 100 Liberal Peers in the House and there are 500 Conservative Peers; and if you choose fifty Liberal Peers out of the 100, you are not likely to get as efficient men as the fifty Conservatives would be who were chosen out of the 500 Peers. Unless we move very carefully we must choose Peers because they belong to the Liberal or the Conservative faith. I do not want that. I think that would be wrong for the sake of the credit of this House. I want to get the best 100 Peers in this House whoever they may be.<lb/>
The second proposal is that 120 persons out of all England, I presume, shall be elected by groups of the House of Commons sitting as electoral chambers in different parts of the country. I like the freedom of choice given under this scheme. The best men can be chosen from everywhere, and I always like, if possible, to choose a man on merits. Another feature I like is that the electoral bodies are ready made. After fighting a good many elections for the House of Commons I have a distaste&#x2014;I suppose it is only natural&#x2014;to going through the paraphernalia of contests all over the country to get electoral bodies elected. Here we have a good scheme. We have the House of Commons, whom I am perfectly willing to trust, and this body will choose members from different country districts. There is another good feature. There are a good many members of your Lordships' House who do very good work as country gentlemen. They are not so well known in this House, perhaps, as they should be,
<col>420</col>
but if you get these electoral bodies scattered throughout England they will know these Peers who have done good service as country gentlemen, and these men will get an opportunity of being elected to the Second Chamber under this second category.<lb/>
The third principle is that 100 Peers shall be elected by the Crown in accordance with the strength of Parties at the time&#x2014;so many for the Liberals, so many for the Conservatives, and so many for the other political Parties in the State. I do not see that there is any objection to that. The noble Viscount opposite, Lord Morley, seems rather to find fault with that, but I cannot see that there is any difficulty about it at all. I think it is fair, and it will give a certain weight to the Party who are in a predominance. They will be able to choose their own friends, and so make the two Parties in this House very nearly equal. After these three categories are exhausted, it is open to any of your Lordships who have not been successful under any of those categories to seek a place in the House of Commons. It has been said that the Peer would not be a very strong candidate who, after failing to get into the House of Lords, sought a seat in the House of Commons. But why should that be so? There are about 650 in your Lordships' House now, and if the whole country comes into competition, except as regards 100, for seats in this House, I do not think it is very derogatory that a man should not be able to get in. After all, it depends upon a man's merits, and when he comes before a constituency you may be sure of one thing&#x2014;the constituency will know whether or not he is a good man for the House of Commons. I am not at all sure that it will tell against him if he has not been elected to the House of Lords. I have been more or less fighting politically for the last thirty years, and if I had the misfortune not to be elected to the House of Lords, I should deem it a misfortune but I should certainly try my best to get once more into the House of Commons.<lb/>
I think this Bill is a remarkably fair Bill. The possession of certain civic virtues, if I may so describe them, gives a qualification for the first 100. We must not forget that. Lords Lieutenant, Lord Mayors, Chairmen of County Councils, and Chairmen of Quarter Sessions are all qualified to be elected in the first 100 to this House. I think that is a good feature. It gives encouragement to your Lordships to seek to fill these kind of
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0215"/>
<col>421</col>
positions throughout the country, positions that many of you already fill with marked ability and success. I hope in the future that more of us will seek to fill such offices as Lord Mayor and Chairman of a County Council, because I think that would be undoubtedly for the good of the country at large. It is a good thing that a number of experienced Peers should be left in this House to leaven the mass of new Peers. Looking at it as broadly as I can, without any <i>arri&#x00E8;re pens&#x00E9;e</i> as regards myself, I declare this to be a bold and a brave Bill, and. I shall certainly vote for the Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00996"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether Lord Bathurst is in the House, but there was one part of his speech which struck me as being due to a complete misapprehension of the position which we take up on this side. I understood him to contemplate the possibility of the Parliament Bill becoming law in its present form, and this Bill for the reconstruction of your Lordships' House being passed as a complement or a supplement to it. If there are any noble Lords who for one moment think that that is in our minds, I would at once beg to relieve them of that misapprehension. This Bill is not put forward as a substitute for the Parliament Bill as it is, but it is put forward as a contribution to a fresh scheme of which a very different Parliament Bill would be a part. If the electors of this country decided that they desired the Parliament Bill in its present form to settle the relations between the two Houses of Parliament, then I can assure noble Lords on our side of the House that we would never ask them to pass this Bill merely as a supplement to the Parliament Bill. If that were the decision of the electors of this country, we would never ask them to pass this Bill.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke, in that brilliant speech which delighted your Lordships to-night, said that we, that is our Party, ought never to have recognised the existence of a Constitutional question. Lord Bathurst, following the same line of thought, said that no good reason had yet been adduced why this House should be reformed. The question of the reform or reconstruction of this House is one on which opinions do and must differ. I do not expect Lord Bathurst to take my view of the situation, but I have an argument which I would put to him and to my
<col>422</col>
noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke which I think, with them as with me, must be absolutely conclusive as to why we, the Unionist and Constitutional Party, should without hesitation, put our shoulders to the work of the reconstruction of this House. The one argument which seems to me to be absolutely conclusive is this, that, unless you reconstruct this House, you can never rescue the Crown from the position in which it now stands in respect of our party and political squabbles. It is not only a question of the intense devotion, based on the traditions of centuries, which we, in common with many who do not share our political opinions hold for the Crown, but there is much more than that. There is no one who knows anything of the Empire and the Dominions beyond the seas who does not know that the existence of the Empire depends upon the existence of the Crown. Without the Crown the Empire would not exist twelve months. There was a time when the Crown played its part, its Constitutional part, naturally and necessarily in the political questions of the day. But our Constitutional evolution has passed beyond that, and I say it is a grave menace to the most precious of all the parts of our Constitution that quarrels between the two Houses of Parliament, and between the two great political Parties, now in the last resort can only be settled by bringing the Crown into the arena of dispute. For that reason, and for that reason alone, I say that we as the Constitutional Party would not be doing our duty if we were unwilling, yes, at seine sacrifice, to assent to a reconstruction of this House for the purpose of removing for ever this the most grave menace, as I consider it, of all the menaces with which the Constitution is confronted.<lb/>
I have been told, though I have not heard any echo of the opinion to-night, that there may be noble Lords who would prefer the settlement of the Parliament Bill as it is now to the settlement which we here propose, of which the House of Lords Reconstruction Bill is only a part. Is it possible that there are any members of your Lordships' House who really hold that view, who prefer the shadow of an appearance in this House in undiminished numbers without power or any effective influence on the legislation of this country to an honourable surrender for the sake of the country, of the dignity they have inherited from their forefathers, to make a system under which this House, however reconstructed, will still be able
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0216"/>
<col>423</col>
to have an effective voice in legislation&#x2014;a House which will be a reality and not a pretence? I cannot believe that that opinion is seriously held by noble Lords on this side of the House. I have merely alluded to it because I have seen it indicated in the public Press as an opinion that is supposed to be shared by some of your Lordships.<lb/>
I turn to the speech which the noble Viscount the present Leader of the House delivered to-night, and first of all I would ask leave to allude to some of his minor criticisms on this Bill. He said, unless I misunderstood his words, that our Bill was based on Party machinery, and that it assured a Party majority. That was a definite and serious contribution by Lord Morley in his criticism of our Bill. I ask your Lordships to examine the eccentric nature of the remedies which he proposed. We propose that 120 Lords of Parliament should be elected by the members of the House of Commons grouped in constituencies. The members of Parliament, we will say, for Yorkshire, are to elect nine or twelve, or whatever the number might be, Lords of Parliament. Lord Morley's suggestion for eliminating the Party machinery and making a Party majority less assured is that these 120 Lords should be elected by the whole of the members of the House of Commons voting together in the House of Commons. I think that is a most singular contribution for the purpose which he indicated. If you wished to assure the predominance of the caucus and secure a Party majority you could devise no better machinery than that the 120 Lords of Parliament should be elected by the members of the House of Commons, not grouped in their geographical areas with all their historical and local associations round them, but acting, as we know from the mouths of members of the other House who have just left it, on the orders of the Party Whip according to a list already prepared in the Whip's room. Not only do we repudiate Lord Morley's suggestion as being likely to enhance the very danger which he thinks he sees in our scheme, but we claim a special merit for the local connection of these Lords of Parliament with the geographical areas for which they will be elected by members of the House of Commons. We attribute importance to this fact, and here I differ very much from Lord St. Davids. I think that in the reconstructed House it is greatly to the
<col>424</col>
benefit of this House and of the country that some of the Lords of Parliament should be definitely associated with geographical areas&#x2014;with Yorkshire, with Wessex, with Wales, with Scotland, or with Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00997"><member>LORD ST. DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: I am sure the noble Earl does not wish to misrepresent me. I did not say that would not be an advantage. I was merely pointing it out as an illustration that it would lead to greater pressure on members of this House&#x2014;that is to say, we should be acting with something like evenly balanced political Parties. I rather indicated that I approved of the proposal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-00998"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: I am very glad that on that point the noble Lord and I are not in disagreement. Now I turn to Lord Morley's second remedy. We propose that 100 Lords of Parliament should be appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, but the Prime Minister has to be guided in his recommendation by a certain principle. I was very surprised at what appeared to be Lord Morley's complete misapprehension of the nature of that proposal. I speak in the presence of a great number of noble Lords who are more familiar than I am with the procedure of the House of Commons. If there is one custom, one tradition more firmly rooted than another in the House of Commons it is the principle on which Select Committees are appointed. It has no force of law; I believe it has no force of Standing Orders, but it has the force of custom, which is stronger than law and stronger than the Standing Orders. I am told that at a time when I was not in this country this Government, in the plenitude of its autocracy, after the General Election of 1896, on one occasion did attempt to depart from the established custom, but the feeling in the House of Commons among their own supporters was so strong in support of the principle that their Whip at that time had to withdraw from the attitude he had assumed.<lb/>
Now, what is that principle? It is that a Select Committee is composed in due proportion to the members of the different groups of which the House of Commons is composed and that the nomination of the members representing each group for that Select Committee is left to the group itself to decide. To-morrow, we will say the Government Whip has to appoint a Select Committee. Take any number you choose
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0217"/>
<col>425</col>
&#x2014;a Committee we will say of seven. On that Committee my Party is entitled to three members. I assume that. I do not take the figure as of any value. It is merely for the sake of illustration. My Party would be entitled to three or two members. The Whip goes to the representatives of my Party and says, "Whom do you wish to have upon this Committee?" And when that Select Committee is moved those names, and no other names, are moved with the authority of the Government as the members of that Select Committee. That is the principle which we propose to apply to the Lords of Parliament to be nominated by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. The noble Viscount appeared to imagine that the House of Commons came into the transaction. The House of Commons does not come into the transaction at all. Where a Select Committee is appointed the House of Commons comes into the transaction, but here the Crown, and only the Crown, comes into the transaction for the appointment of these Peers. It is the principle of that method of selection which we have adopted.<lb/>
The Prime Minister has to recommend 100 Peers, we will say, for appointment by the Crown. These 100 are divided in their due proportion according to the numbers of the Parties in the House of Commons at that moment, and each Party&#x2014;the Irish Party or the Labour Party or my Party&#x2014;are entitled to say whom they want to represent them. When the list is complete, then the Prime Minister makes his recommendation to the Crown. That may be a good principle or a bad principle, but what is the noble Viscount's comment upon it? Not only did he completely misunderstand it, but by way of making the machinery less based upon the Party principle, and making a Party majority less assured, I understood him to propose that all these Lords of Parliament should be appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, guided, not by any such principle as I have described, but by his own individual judgment. That is entitled to fair consideration as a rival plan, but it cannot by any possibility be described as a plan for reducing the tendency towards a machinery based upon the Party principle, or for making a Party majority less assured.<lb/>
I come now to a point in the noble Viscount's speech that I must say caused me some surprise, because it was so completely
<col>426</col>
at variance with my personal experience; and in this matter, if in no other, my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke supported the noble Viscount. Lord Morley, in dealing with the proposal that 100 Lords of Parliament belonging to certain qualified classes should be elected by all the hereditary Peers, made a great point of the hard fate of a Peer, I presume a young Peer, who was not so qualified. He said, "You propose that he should have an opportunity of standing for the House of Commons," and the noble Viscount asked, "Is that quite a fair proposal?" How handicapped, he said, that unfortunate Peer will be by the fact that he will go to a constituency for election to the House of Commons with the stigma upon him that he is not qualified for election to the House of Lords. I do not think I ever heard a more perverse and inaccurate forecast of the position. Is there a single one of your Lordships who does not know that a young Peer who has become a Peer before he is twenty-one, who has had no opportunity of service in the Empire, who has never been in the House of Commons, enters this House under a very grave disadvantage? We who have had the privilege of serving in the House of Commons before we came to the House of Lords know there never was a more fortunate event in our political lives than that we were able to serve our apprenticeship in the House of Commons before we came to the House of Lords. It is of the greatest advantage to a young Peer who has not qualified in the past that he should have an opportunity of being first elected to the House of Commons before he comes to sit in your Lordships' House, whether unreformed or reformed. The idea seems to me purely fantastic that because a young Peer has never had the opportunity of qualifying in one of the ways enumerated in our Schedule he should be considered handicapped when he presents himself before a popular constituency. I believe that in that point there is absolutely nothing. Therefore I venture to disagree most emphatically, not only with my noble friend sitting near me, Lord Willoughby de Broke, but also with the noble Viscount.<lb/>
I cannot avoid an allusion to what I must describe as the favourite hobby of my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke&#x2014;that is, the elected Senate. I have not the remotest conception what the views are of noble Lords opposite upon that subject, or what kind of Second Chamber they really
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0218"/>
<col>427</col>
have in their minds. I congratulate them on having concealed that with the most complete success. I am sometimes a little tempted to doubt whether they have any conception at all in their minds, but I would assume, from the kind of faint tribute to democratic principles which is elicited from them when an elected Senate is mentioned, that they are in favour of an elected Senate. Let us look at this for a few moments closely. If you ask me whether I would rather have an elected Senate than the Parliament Bill. I would vote for an elected Senate with both hands. I would vote with both hands for any House of Lords that had power rather than for one that was a mere sham. But if you ask me whether I think an elected Senate is exactly the thing which this country requires, I say I honestly do not think it is, and I do not think it is for two reasons. You may hedge an elected Senate round with any safeguards the Party now in power think proper in order to insure the permanent supremacy of the House of Commons, but every one of those safeguards would disappear in the course of time. Why should a Senate with exactly the same mandate from the electors as the House of Commons be content with smaller powers? It would not be. It is not in human nature that it should be, and eventually it would claim and obtain the same powers derived from the same authority as the other House. But that has no terrors for me in comparison with the Parliament Bill. But that is not our position, because the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition has explained that we do not think that a Second Chamber with absolutely co-ordinate powers to those of the House of Commons is what the country requires.<lb/>
But I have another criticism. Such a Senate would be a small body. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, thinks 350 too large a number. I do not share that opinion. But for the purposes of my argument my case is better if I adopt his view and say that the 350 may be whittled down to 100 or 150. The noble Viscount knows the intense labour which now devolves on a Minister or on any public man in doing his duty by the House of Commons and his constituents. Nobody knows better than the noble Viscount that there comes a time when human strength is scarcely sufficient for this double labour. Is membership of the House of Commons and of the House of Lords to be confined to the young, the strong, and the inexperienced? to those who
<col>428</col>
have leisure but have no stake in the country by profession, and take no part in its great industrial evolution? If the labour, anxiety, and physical strain are so great in the House of Commons to-day with 670 members, the strain upon the members of a Senate, from 100 to 130 strong, would be absolutely intense. And where are you going to get a supply of men for both Houses, men of experience, of age, and other accomplishments, and with a stake in the country? I say that those who plead for an elected Senate have not thought out this problem, and do not see what is involved in it. That is the reason why I and my friends prefer another solution of the Constitutional difficulty. I say again, in older that there should be no misunderstanding of our position, we would prefer any second Chamber with adequate powers to a Second Chamber with powers which existed only on paper.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I come to a more important point which the noble Viscount made, and upon which I may say fairly that his whole speech turned. He endeavoured to show your Lordships that there was a radical inconsistency between the attitude taken by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition and the attitude taken up by Lord Curzon. There is no such inconsistency. What Lord Curzon said in the speech to which the noble Viscount referred represents the views of us all. When Lord Lansdowne said that we had abandoned the absolute Veto he stated what every one of your Lordships must have known for months and years past to have been the permanent position of the Party to which I have the honour to belong. Lord Morley stated in general terms, with which we do not disagree, the kind of Second Chamber that he thought was necessary for this country. The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition fastened on those words, and pointed out that if those words were interpreted by the noble Viscount as we interpreted them, then the difference between us was not large. The whole question turns upon the interpretation of those words.<lb/>
What is our position? It is almost incredible that even a political opponent should fail to understand our position in this matter. Without detaining your Lordships too long, I will endeavour to state it in concise language. We have our own opinions as to the best form of Second
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0219"/>
<col>429</col>
Chamber and as to the best methods for adjusting differences between the two Houses of Parliament. But those considerations in our minds are secondary. To us the fundamental and important thing is that the Second Chamber, however composed, should have adequate powers. What do powers consist of? Take the question of finance. I take that first because on that we have made a concession, and on that our position has been largely misunderstood. For many years past this House has never desired to interfere with the ordinary financial provisions of the year made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget. It has never desired to do so, and therefore we have had no hesitation in registering our willingness to admit in theory that which we have consistently performed in practice; but we have always explained to this House and on the platform in the country that this does not mean that the Second Chamber should have no hand in finance, no matter in what guise that finance might come. What we mean is this, that if some great revolutionary change of a political or social nature is proposed on which the electors have never been consulted and to which they have not given their approval, the fact that we renounce any wish to deal with ordinary Budget finance does not imply that this House should not have an opportunity of expressing an opinion on a scheme of that kind brought in under the guise of finance. You might disendow the Church by means of a Finance Bill, or nationalise the land or the railways. That is the kind of finance which we have always considered it should be within the powers of a Second Chamber to deal with.<lb/>
We accept the functions of a Second Chamber in the nature of revision. When the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, said that this House never claimed an absolute Veto, what he meant was that if the electors of this country should determine on a policy this House is never going to endeavour to put a veto on the final determination of the electors. That has been the consistent attitude of this House for a long period of time, and that is what the noble Marquess meant when he said we have never claimed an absolute Veto. What we do claim is that if a Second Chamber is to exist at all it should have the opportunity of allowing the electors of the country to pronounce an opinion on some great question on which they have never been consulted, or upon
<col>430</col>
which they have never expressed their opinion. Therefore there is no real difference of opinion between Lord Lansdowne and Lord Curzon. I would mention as an illustration the question of Home Rule. In 1886 the electors of this country were consulted on Home Rule, and they gave a verdict. In 1895 they were again consulted on Home Rule, and they again gave a verdict. Why are they not to be consulted in 1912? That is why we are taking our stand. We say that just as they had the final word in 1886 and 1895, so it is the function of any Second Chamber, if it exists, to give the electors the opportunity of the final word in 1912.<lb/>
The noble Viscount says that the plan included in the Bill introduced by Lord Lansdowne would not secure an independent Second Chamber. He laid great stress, as one of the essential characteristics of a Second Chamber really suited to this country, upon the fact that it should be independent. I ask your Lordships to consider what a very peculiar idea of independence the noble Viscount has. Apparently his idea of an independent House of Lords is one which could be abolished by a vote of the House of Commons alone repeated thrice, or which could be swamped, as this House can be, by the exercise of the Prerogative of the Crown in the creation of Peers on the advice of the Prime Minister. Those respective exercises of power by the House of Commons and by the Crown may be good or bad, but they are very peculiar illustrations of the independence of a Second Chamber. Again, the noble Viscount said that stability was required in a Second Chamber. We entirely agree, and that is why we have proposed that every Lord of Parliament should sit for twelve years. It is obvious that a Lord of Parliament elected for twelve years will be in a very different position from one who holds his tenure for a shorter time.<lb/>
The noble Viscount mentioned simplicity as another essential. I claim that there is great simplicity in the scheme of this Bill. You have only three classes of Peers&#x2014;those elected by the hereditary Peers, those elected by the House of Commons, and those appointed by the Crown. I altogether demur to the criticism of my friend Lord Lamington, when he rather agreed, with Lord Morley, that the element of simplicity was lacking in this Bill. He said "Why no provision for Colonial Peers? Why no provision for Judicial Peers?"
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0220"/>
<col>431</col>
But those can all be provided for in the Peers appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. Our answer in respect of the suggestion of Colonial and Judicial Peers is exactly the same as our answer in respect of the leading members of religious bodies other than the Church of England. It is no part of the scheme of the Bill to elect any particular class of people <i>ad hoc</i> but to give an opportunity for the appointment of the most important and influential people belonging to any class, whether Colonial, or judicial, or the leaders of religious bodies. How would it be possible to make a list of the Churches each of which would be entitled to a certain representation? I defy any noble Lord, however ingenious, to make a list which would be accepted. There are leaders of the Nonconformist Churches and great Prelates of the Roman Catholic Church who are recognised by their co-religionists and by the whole country; and this Bill is elastic and flexible enough to enable the Prime Minister to recommend all of them for appointment. Therefore this Bill really provides for all that is required in this matter.<lb/>
The noble Viscount calculates that by this Bill, if it came into law at the present moment, the Party I represent would have a majority of forty-five. We know that the noble Viscount would never make a statement in this House which he had not satisfied himself was reasonably accurate. I am altogether at a loss to know who could have been his calculator. I have seen no calculation and can imagine no calculation that would produce anything approximating to that result. I go further and say that under the Bill which we are discussing at the present moment such a result would be absolutely impossible. The fact is that if this scheme had been working for a certain number of years the two great Parties in this House would tend very largely to an equality. But whether that calculation be accurate or not, I must remind your Lordships of the point Lord Lansdowne made on the First Reading of this Bill, that it is absolutely essential to a proper understanding and appreciation of the proposals of the Bill that it should be taken only in conjunction with the scheme for the adjustment of differences between the two Houses which we have put forward&#x2014;the Referendum for great occasions and the Joint Session in normal differences of opinion. If your Lordships regard this
<col>432</col>
scheme in connection with the plan for Joint Sessions it becomes quite obvious that calculations whether one Party or another would have a majority of twenty or thirty are of very little importance.<lb/>
In his criticisms of this Bill the noble Viscount to-night wandered into a consideration of the attitude of my Party to the whole of this question. Nobody could help it. We cannot discuss this question in watertight compartments. It is all one. It is quite impossible to separate one part from the other, and therefore I make no apology for having wandered off the exact points of this Bill, as indeed the noble Viscount was also bound to do in his speech. But the noble Viscount does not really appreciate the point of our position. He and his friends take their stand on the necessity that the will of the electors of this country, those who on platforms are called the people, should eventually prevail. That is our position too. We accept democracy as the government under which we live. The point the noble Viscount fails to understand is that, whereas by the plan of his Government it is quite certain that the electors never can be thwarted in getting a measure which they desire, it may also happen that they may get a measure they do not desire. Under our plan not only are the electors sure in the long run to get a measure they desire, but they are secured against getting a measure which they do not desire. That is really the line that divides the two Parties at the present moment. The plan of the Government does not safeguard the electors against the passage of a Bill to which they have not given their assured and final assent. The stand which we take is on the necessity for a Second Chamber which will secure the electors against seeing measures passed into law which they have not finally and definitely approved.<lb/>
The noble Viscount reminded us that there had been two elections in 1910, in which, he said, larger numbers had gone to the poll than ever before. He is perfectly right, but he omitted to remind the House that half of those electors, roughly, voted for us. That is a point which the supporters of the Government conveniently forget. The whole of the extraordinary position in which we find ourselves dates from the General Election of 1906. Noble Lords opposite think that that election was a wonderful manifestation of popular
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0221"/>
<col>433</col>
opinion. As a matter of fact, it really was a wonderful manifestation of the amazing absurdity of our system of the distribution of seats. I have worked out the figures of the General Election of 1906. It was a very remarkable election, because there were in England, Scotland and Wales practically no uncontested seats&#x2014;I think there were only three. I do not count Ireland, because in Ireland the issue was not complicated. It was the same old issue. It is no disrespect to Ireland to say so. But the whole of this extraordinary Constitutional and Parliamentary position dates from the General Election of 1906. In that election the Government secured in England, Scotland, and Wales a majority of 289 seats, but if the votes cast had been divided in proportion between the two Parties what do you think their majority would have been? Not 289, but 89. I do not suppose that the caprice of the distribution of seats ever produced a more astonishing result and it is from that astonishing caprice that the whole of the present position has arisen. Yet the noble Viscount comes down and reminds us that the electors polled in larger numbers in 1910 than ever they did before, but he entirely forgets to mention the fact that half of those electors voted for us.<lb/>
The position we stand for is very simple, and we know we have this strength of the electors behind us. What we stand for is a Second Chamber having the same powers, generally speaking, as are possessed by the Second Chambers in all the great countries of the world, and in each one of our Dominions, including the Second Chamber in the Transvaal, which this very Government advised the King to set up four years ago. We should not forget that this very Government advised the King to give the Second Chamber in the Transvaal exactly those powers which we contend, for the safety of this country and of the Empire, it is essential that a Second Chamber in this country should possess. That is what we stand for, and throughout this matter conscious of the fact that we are supported by one-half of the electorate, we have never pretended that we can settle this question finally as we should wish to see it settled. It is only noble Lords opposite and their Party who are out for a Party settlement. We have stood, and we stand to-day, for a national settlement, a settlement that will once for all give stability to our Constitution, and it is because this Bill is brought
<col>434</col>
forward as a contribution towards that settlement, not as the whole scheme, but as part of the scheme which we support in substitution for the Parliament Bill, that I ask your Lordships to read the Bill a second time.<lb/>

The Bill is already in draft and the President of the Board of Education hopes to introduce it into the House of Commons the week after next. The Government consider it more convenient that the Bill should be brought in in that House, and this is more in accordance with the usual procedure as the President of the Board of Education is a member of the House of Commons. I hope the noble Lord will be satisfied with the assurance that the President of the Board of Education intends that this Bill shall have a speedy introduction.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HOUSE OF LORDS RECONSTITUTION BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01045">Debate on the Motion for the Second Reading <i>resumed</i> (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01046"><member>The LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose, to trouble your Lordships at any great length on this occasion, because I think that the discussion of this Bill would naturally and necessarily be matter rather for the Committee stage than the Second Reading. I desire to acknowledge most unreservedly the fine temper and spirit which have been shown by the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition and the manner in which he has dealt with this Bill; and, indeed, I think it may truly be said that throughout all the debates we have had on this and kindred subjects relating to Constitutional reform there has not been a single false note from any quarter of the House. I acknowledge that, my Lords, and I know that it must have cost a good deal to those whose ancient and ancestral connection with this House must have been prominent before their minds. It is necessary, however, to look the actual facts in the face. This Bill is not put forward as a solution. It is only the first chapter in a series of amendments of the Constitution, to be continued next year or later by proposals for a Joint Session or for a Referendum, or for both. It seems to be the natural condition of this Bill going any further that the Parliament Bill is to be destroyed or abandoned; and from what the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, said yesterday I gather that he contemplated yet another election in the year 1912, on what point or for what purpose I do not think he made quite clear. It seems there is to be a new House in place of this, with an independent and judicial spirit, the activity of Whips and wirepullers is to be deprecated, and probably disarmed, although I am afraid the noble Marquess can hardly
<col>442</col>
hold out any hope that powerful interests will cease to organise themselves and that the natural foundations of Party will disappear.<lb/>
Let us see what is the mischief that is sought to be remedied. No one questions the great talent and distinction in this House or its illustrious past. It is not the case that individual Peers are looked upon with dislike in the country; on the contrary, I believe they are popular and well liked all over the country. The people of this country are naturally very tolerant of authority, very tractable, and do not care very much whether there are hereditary duties or not provided that they secure what they think is fair play. We have been governed in this country by the Party system for 200 years. We are nearly all of us Party men. When one Party is in power there is, in fact, no Second Chamber. There is not an instance of a Bill pressed by a Conservative Government having been thrown out by this House for, I believe, 100 years. When the other Party is in power this House stands as an invincible obstacle to Liberal legislation, and wrecks our principal measures. No one now present questions the demand that has been made that the Liberal Party shall have fair play. It is admitted in theory, but I am afraid it is still withheld in practice.<lb/>
What sort of relief would be provided if this Bill became law to-morrow? It would indeed be, as the noble Marquess said, a deathblow to the House of Lords as it has been known hitherto. It reduces the House to a heap of ruins politically. Another House is to be raised in its stead, numbering 350, and there is to be in that House a permanent menace against the Liberal Party in the 100 Peers who are to be selected by the present Peerage, which I believe would be a handicap of 90 against 10. Added to that, the Prerogative of the Crown to create Peers, which has been, and is, the only resort available against the obstinancy or obduracy of this House, will disappear. The House of Commons would thereby be held as in a vice. There would be no escape except by means of the Referendum. I state frankly that I thoroughly distrust that specific remedy. It was discussed in this House for two days at the instance of Lord Balfour of Burleigh, one of the most capable and discriminating members of the House, and it ended in his Bill being withdrawn because it was felt
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0226"/>
<col>443</col>
that it would not be practicable to obtain the necessary support. I do not believe that the popular vote by Referendum is nearly so valuable as the present system, and I do not think myself that any Referendum ought to be set up unless by special Act of Parliament&#x2014;and it must be a very rare case&#x2014;making necessary and proper provision for the treatment of one particular subject.<lb/>
Supposing the Liberal Government were prepared to accept this Bill and the other Bills which are to follow, we should then be called upon to enter upon a long, difficult, and intricate examination which would last this year and next year before we should have the Bill, not only this Bill, but all the other Bills that are to follow. It would be an examination by the Liberal Government under the old conditions that are now universally condemned&#x2014;that is to say, we should be at the mercy of the present majority of this House. The last word would certainly be with this House. We should have no means at all of enforcing our wishes in the case of difference of opinion. In fact, what this Bill does, with the other Bills that are to follow, is this&#x2014;it invites us to surrender at discretion after we have obtained the victory. After the long, weary, tedious and exhausting struggles through which we have passed, what we are asked to do is to lay down our weapons and to accept the solution of our adversaries. Surely, my Lords, you cannot think that there is the smallest chance of our cutting ourselves adrift from our policy, our promises, and our honour in order to enter upon the arduous path of Constitutional reform with our hands tied behind us as they are so long as this House enjoys its present powers.<lb/>
The principles of the Parliament Bill were announced four and a-half years ago; they have been affirmed at two General Elections. The doctrine that was heretofore upheld in this House was that the House of Lords always yields to the will of the people whenever that will has been declared at a General Election. Was there ever a Bill more definitely approved than the Parliament Bill at the General Election? It was printed in July, 1910. It followed upon Resolutions which had been passed earlier. It was before the country six months before the people were asked to pronounce upon it, and the country returned a majority in support of it. Surely a candid examination
<col>444</col>
of the matter will show that the Bill has been fully considered by the country. In these circumstances is it possible for us&#x2014;even supposing we were so minded&#x2014;to accept this Bill on the terms of abandoning the Parliament Bill? We should be justly regarded as traitors and poltroons if, with all the omens in our favour, as they are now, and with our conviction that this is the only way of solving the problem, we refrained from pressing forward this measure for our own emancipation. When the Parliament Bill is on the Statute-book, when Liberal Members of the House of Commons are no longer constrained to submit to the humiliation of wearily tramping round and round the Lobbies of the House of Commons night after night for many months only to see, in the end, the result of their labours frustrated, then and not till then shall we be in a position to consider ulterior proposals for Constitutional reform. But when we are in a position to speak with our enemy at the gate, then I heartily hope it will be possible for us, on this and kindred subjects, to come to an agreement which will be satisfactory to all sides, and which will be all the more enduring because it will be founded upon consent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01047"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that all members of this House unite in respect and, if I may venture to say so, in affection for the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. We recognise and appreciate the high qualities of intellect and character which have enabled him to maintain as worthily as any of his predecessors the dignity of his high office and the honour of this House. We know that he is devoted heart and soul to the maintenance of the honour and reputation and the usefulness of your Lordships' House, and I am sure that all noble Lords who sit on this side will agree with me when I say that we are grateful to the noble and learned Lord for the words which fell from his lips in that respect just now. But with all this, even the humblest of us may venture to differ from the opinions expressed by the noble and learned Lord. Reason and conscience are no respecters of persons. This question which is before us is one on which all of us have an opinion&#x2014;an opinion formed in the constant discharge of duty. We all of us have a conscience in this matter&#x2014;a conscience begotten of heredity, of training, and of long association; and I think that from that point of view most
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0227"/>
<col>445</col>
noble Lords on this side of the House will agree with me that the speech to which we have just listened was singularly unconvincing.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord began with a remark which I confess surprised me immensely. He said that this Bill which is before your Lordships for Second Reading was naturally and necessarily a matter for the Committee stage as if, indeed, it were some Bill dealing with details of local administration. Surely, my Lords, if ever great principles were involved, if ever there was occasion for discussing a question from the point of view of abstract principle, it has been this occasion, and yet the noble and learned Lord tells us that it is a matter for the Committee stage. He then went on to say that this Bill was not put forward as a solution of the Constitutional problem. I cannot speak for the leaders on this Front Bench, but, as I understand, the Bill, if not put forward as a solution, is put forward as a better basis for solution and as affording common ground on which we could all meet and discuss this question afresh and come to a national agreement. "What is the mischief which is sought to be remedied?" asked the noble and learned Lord; and in doing so he paid a tribute, for which again we are grateful, to the individual ability and popularity of the more prominent members of your Lordships' House. But whilst anxious to refrain from any recriminations, I am bound to say that that was not the line which was taken by the members of the noble and learned Lord's Party when they stumped the country. This House was shamefully insulted, misrepresented, abused, and so far as my study of the Press went I did not discover a single case of noble Lords opposite raising their voice or holding up a hand of protest against these attacks on the House to which they belong.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord stated the mischief which is sought to be remedied in a manner which seems to me absolutely correct. He went to the very root of the matter. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"It is simply this, that the Liberal Party want fair play and must have fair play,"</quote>
and he also admitted, for which I was glad, that the Unionist Party have recognised that the Liberal Party must have fair play. But he proceeded to say that although we admit it in theory we deny it in practice.
<col>446</col>
He tried to show that this Bill will not give fair play. There is room for difference of opinion, as we have seen, as to what the actual balance of Parties in this House would be supposing for the sake of argument this Bill were to pass into law. But I do not think that it can be the intention of the Unionist leaders to insist that this Bill, every clause and line and comma of it, should pass unaltered through the House if it ever came to that. There is room for amendment, and it occurs to me at once that it would be very easy to make the balance of Parties absolutely even by allowing the Prime Minister of the day discretion to remedy inequalities when he makes his nominations in the second category. I can speak for nobody but myself, but I for one am sincerely anxious that the Liberal Party should have fair play in order that there may be an end once for all of these bitter and unprofitable quarrels, which stop all progress and prevent us from getting on to the settlement of vital questions for the benefit of the Empire. I for one would be perfectly willing to see this Bill so amended that there might be a Liberal majority in this House&#x2014;certainly that at the outset the Liberal Party should start with a majority in this House seeing that they have a majority in the country.<lb/>
But what seemed to me most unconvincing of all were the reasons which the noble and learned Lord gave for the desperate hurry with which this question is to be settled. I cannot for the life of me see why there is no room for delay, why it should be impossible to give Parliament and the nation time for calm, deliberate, and careful consideration of a matter which is to affect them for generations to come. The reasons which the noble and learned Lord gave were that if the question were settled now it would leave the last word to your Lordships' House, that the present Government would not be able to enforce their will, and, in effect, that the Party in power would have to give up the fruits of victory. As I conceive this question at the present stage, there is no question of giving up the fruits of a Party victory. Surely the situation has considerably altered. We have gone more than half way to meet our political opponents. Will anybody for one moment maintain that three years ago we should have dreamed of going as far as we have gone now? What can you see in that except a sincere
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0228"/>
<col>447</col>
desire to give our opponents fair play, and to try and find some common ground on which we can meet them? Surely, then, there is good occasion for them to shift their ground and not to stick to their present attitude of saying that the policy which they developed four-and-a-half years ago, in totally different circumstances when there was no question of House of Lords reform, must prevail. Surely without shame or inconsistency they can modify that attitude and come some little way to meet us.<lb/>
Your Lordships showed so clearly that you did not agree with the noble and learned Lord when he said that the Parliament Bill had been definitely approved by the country that I need hardly go into that subject; but I think it must have struck your Lordships that it was singularly inconsistent with the remarks which a few minutes before had fallen from the lips of the noble and learned Lord in regard to the Referendum. The objections to the Referendum, if I remember rightly, are that the electorate are not capable of deciding on a Bill, and I know that the noble and learned Lord's friends scoff at the Referendum because they say that every elector must necessarily have a copy of the Bill. Just think, they say, of the expense and trouble, and how ridiculous it would be, if you asked the ordinary elector to read a Parliamentary Bill. If that is their opinion, then surely they must see that since the electorate did not have copies of the Parliament Bill they can hardly be in a position to judge upon it. We are told that unless the elector has a copy he cannot possibly form an opinion. How, then, can the electors have formed an opinion upon the Parliament Bill, seeing that they had no copies? Apart from that, the Bill had not been discussed in Parliament, and that is how the electorate form their opinion. They form their opinion on what they read and hear of the discussions in Parliament, which are boiled down and peptonised for them by minor platform orators throughout the country.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord wound up by saying that when his Party were in a position to speak with the enemy at the gate, then the time might come for considering the question of reform. Our contention is that we are at the gate, that we
<col>448</col>
are ready to speak, and I do not think that the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition could have given a more sincere and more earnest proof of his willingness to parley and to compromise than he has done in the action which he has so courageously taken. I think that the outstanding feature of this debate is the sense of disappointment which was caused by the speech of the noble Viscount the Leader of the House. We had hoped to get some enlightenment on those great abstract and general principles which are concerned&#x2014;enlightenment which I think we had the right to expect from one, if I may say so with all respect, whose intellect is stored with the results of deep research into history and philosophy and statesmanship. But even the noble Viscount made no attempt to deal with principles or to give us any guidance. We hoped, of course, that he would at any rate state for our information and guidance what are the principles which His Majesty's Government have in view. His Majesty's Government are committed to reform. Surely they cannot be committed to a policy of which they have not even considered the principles. It would have been the greatest help to us if we had known what kind of reconstitution of this House His Majesty's Government have in mind. But instead of that the noble Viscount gave us a speech which, if I may say so, was a strange mixture of conciliatory suggestions with uncompromising criticism. It was a combination of those conservative instincts which come to all with riper years and the destructive temper of green Radicalism.<lb/>
The noble Viscount indulged in a few easy jeers at the details of the Bill, such jeers as are no doubt effective in regard to any measure on political platforms. For instance, he spoke of the "ineligible Peer," and I am sure that those criticisms must have seemed to your Lordships a somewhat unfair play with words, a question-begging misapplication of the term. There is no question whatever of ineligible Peers. Under this Bill no single member of your Lordships' House would be ineligible in one way or another for a seat in this House. Indeed, the Bill goes further, for no citizen of this country would be ineligible for a seat in this House. Therefore it is entirely out of place to talk of ineligible Peers, as if, indeed, there were to be a class stigmatised as inferior in character and capacity.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0229"/>
<col>449</col>
Then, my Lords, the noble Viscount said that the number of 350 was too large. The words he used were&#x2014;
<quote>"If you want real deliberation you must have fewer members."</quote>
But what about the House of Commons? Surely that is an admission that there is no real deliberation in the House of Commons. I wonder whether the noble Viscount associates himself with that member of the Labour Party in the other place who said that the best kind of Second Chamber would be one composed of twenty trades union secretaries. Of course, the noble Viscount referred to the rejection, as he called it, of the Finance Bill of 1909. That question seems to possess the mind of the noble Viscount as a sort of mental obsession. He said that we challenged the House of Commons. If I remember rightly, that is a phrase which I have heard him use on more than one occasion. If to challenge means to express a different opinion, where is the enormity? Up to the present your Lordships' House still enjoys the right, common to all Second Chambers in the world, of expressing a different opinion from the First Chamber; but if, in using the term "challenge," the noble Viscount meant that your Lordships' House provoked, or sought to provoke, the House of Commons, then I venture to disagree with his presentation of the facts. I venture to think that he is distorting history which is not only recent, but which must also be familiar to everybody who takes an intelligent interest.<lb/>
The Resolutions on which the policy of His Majesty's Government, the policy which underlies the Veto Bill, was framed&#x2014;the Resolutions proposed by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman&#x2014;saw the light in 1906, four-and-a-half years ago as the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack reminds us, long before there was any question of the Finance Bill or of the action winch your Lordships' House might take on that Bill; and if it comes to provocation, then I am prepared to maintain stoutly against anybody in this country that the provocation did not come from your Lordships' House. I have very vividly in mind the threat of the present Prime Minister, who said, long before the Budget saw the light of day, that finance was a flexible instrument which might be used for solving the Constitutional
<col>450</col>
question. Then there is the retrospective boast of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who said that a trap had been set for your Lordships' House which had succeeded admirably. It would be possible to multiply quotations of that kind, but there are the plain facts that the policy of the Veto Bill was conceived four-and-a-half years ago, and that the Finance Bill only saw the light two years ago.<lb/>
I disagree, of course, with the noble Viscount when he says that we made a fatal and irreparable mistake in referring the Finance Bill to the people, for I deny absolutely that this House rejected the Budget. I am among those who believe&#x2014;and, I shall believe it to my dying day&#x2014;that this House would have made a far greater mistake if it had not referred that measure, which was admittedly a great revolution, a tremendous social change, a thing that the people had never seen or heard of before, as the Home Secretary boasted&#x2014;if we had not referred that to the people of the country. Had we failed to refer it to the people I believe we should have forfeited their confidence, and we should have precipitated a far greater calamity than any which can possibly befall us at the present time. But in spite of those criticisms, winch were so disappointing to us and which damped our hopes of an agreement, the noble Viscount said that there was a definite problem, and his view of the definite problem was one which must commend itself to every member of this House. He said the problem was how to get back to that co-operation and accord which used to exist between Lords and Commons. None of your Lordships would, I am sure, dispute that that was a very good definition of what we are all aiming at; but I think there are very few, even on that side of the House, who would maintain with confidence that we can get back to that co-operation and accord by means of the Parliament Bill. I absolutely fail to see how you can get co-operation with those whom you have humiliated, insulted and deprived of powers which they have exercised with all the sanction of custom and authority and law for generations and centuries past. I do not see how you can get accord if you trample on the sentiments and convictions of half the nation. The results of no revolution can possibly be lasting and permanent unless supported by an overwhelming majority of the people.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0230"/>
<col>451</col>
I intend to vote for the Second Reading of the Bill because I believe that it marks out common ground for the settlement of a national question on national lines, and because I believe that until that question is settled we shall have neither peace nor progress nor the settlement of other important and pressing questions. I shall vote for this Bill because it seems to me to be a scheme for remedying the actual grievances of which complaint has been made, whereas the Parliament Bill does not touch those grievances. The complaint made by the Radical Party, and frankly admitted by the Unionist Party, is that the composition of this House is at fault, in that it has contained for some time an overwhelming Unionist majority. There has been no complaint against the powers of this House&#x2014;that is to say, no complaint on grounds of general principle. No speaker on the Government side, so far as I am aware, has gone about the country explaining what ought to be the composition and the functions of a Second Chamber from the general point of view of principle. The complaint, so far as it has related to the exercise of power by this House, has been a complaint against a permanent Conservative majority. The question, therefore, stripped of transient prejudice and superficial misrepresentation, is one of the composition and not of the powers of this House.<lb/>
Both great Parties in the State are agreed that there must be a Second Chamber, and neither Party can, on sober reflection, desire to have a sham or ineffective Second Chamber. It is not in the spirit of the British people to favour any sort or kind of sham. That is why I say we are on common ground when we attempt to improve the composition of this House instead of destroying its powers. Indeed, it is beyond dispute that both Parties are committed to reform. Why, then, not begin with the task which we all admit to be necessary, instead of with that of which half the nation utterly disapprove? There are some critics, critics of both Parties, who say that it is too late to consider reform&#x2014;that is, so far as the present controversy is concerned. Radical critics talk of our reform proposals as a death-bed repentance. Well, what if it were so? When has it ever been contended that a death-bed repentance is of no avail? My Lords, there is an old and homely saying that "It is never too late to mend," and if that is our position I am sure that we
<col>452</col>
are not ashamed to confess it. Some Unionist critics, on the other hand, say that it is too late from the point of view of Party tactics. To them I reply that Party tactics ought not to be considered for a moment in a matter of such vital national concern as this. It is never too late to do that which is right, and can never be too late to take steps to avert a catastrophe. In this matter I would rather the Unionist Party failed by doing that which is right than that they succeeded by neglecting to adopt a course which I believe to be absolutely necessary for the future welfare of the nation.<lb/>
There are some who so entirely misunderstand the situation that they fail to see that the course adopted by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition is one of courage and patriotism rather than of surrender and despair. They mistake his natural emotion for weakness, as if, forsooth, it were not open to a General to think with an aching heart of the men he is bound to sacrifice in the engagement to which he is leading them. It is, of course, possible to believe that it is right and necessary to do something and at the same time to regret the change of circumstances which imposes the obligation. It is thus that I regard the proposed reform, or, to use a less question-begging term, the reconstitution of this House. Just as men regret the partial demolition and reconstruction of ancient and splendid landmarks, such as church or castle, monuments of human skill and scenes of high and noble endeavours throughout past generations&#x2014;just as even the most unimaginative dweller in a rural district regrets the necessary lopping and propping up of some venerable and romantic tree, so, I think, must we all regret the necessity which we have now to face in regard to this national institution with its historic associations of eight centuries. But surely we must endeavour to preserve all that can be preserved, to buttress up that which is useful and sightly, to make our restoration as far as possible in harmony with the ancient design, and to pull down only that which cannot safely be left standing and to lop off those branches only which, though vigorous themselves, have outgrown the strength of the parent stem and may split the trunk to the very roots if carried away in some violent storm. I believe that it is in some such spirit as this that the noble Marquess has approached the task which has been imposed upon him by the highest
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0231"/>
<col>453</col>
sense of patriotism and public duty. It may well seem to him a thankless and distasteful task at the present time, but I am firmly convinced that, if his counsels prevail against the desire of those who would ruthlessly pull down and sweep away no less than those who prefer to take the risk of accidental and complete destruction rather than face the responsibility of guarding against it, he will in the days to come be amply vindicated and stand high in the roll of fame of the great men of this country who merit the enduring gratitude of succeeding generations. It is on these grounds that I unhesitatingly support this Bill.<lb/>
There is no possible means of preserving this House as it is at present. There is no possible means of preserving the existing privileges of its members. We may regret this from a sentimental point of view, but we need not regret it&#x2014;we ought not to regret it otherwise&#x2014;if we are convinced that this House as at present constituted is no longer effective as a national institution for making the laws and preserving the customs on which the welfare of the British people depends. Both great Parties in the State are committed to reform. It may be said that it does not follow that either of them will carry out reform. There is much to justify that doubt in either case. But there are stronger forces at work than the will of Party leaders&#x2014;the circumstances which actually exist and must lead in one way or another to consequences which are as inevitable as fate. Let us face the facts. It is no use blinking any of them. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that the Parliament Bill were to become law. Can it be imagined for a moment that this House will be allowed to remain as a mere cause of irritating delay, powerless either to reject or to refer measures to the people? Whatever the Radical Party leaders do, there will be an irresistible demand on the part of their followers for the abolition or reconstruction of so vexatious an institution. The people will not forget that the complaint which has been made has been that the composition of this House is at fault, that the Second Chamber ought not to be on a hereditary basis, that no man ought to sit and assist in making law because he is the son of his father. They will remember that, and will insist that their leaders should abide by the logical consequences of that which they have told them.<lb/>
<col>454</col>
Suppose, on the other hand, the Veto Bill did not pass into law and a Unionist Government returned to power. However much the Unionist leaders might wish to postpone or abate a fulfilment of their pledges, there would be an outcry from the rank and file, who undoubtedly attribute the loss of two General Elections to the prejudice excited against a hereditary House of Lords. Again, so long as this great disproportion between Parties continues there will be a grievance which will not cease to be used as a weapon of prejudice. So long as grievance and consequent prejudice continue there can be no cessation of the class warfare which is fatal to national unity, and without national unity there will be no true progress and no settlement of the great questions, social, Imperial, and international, which are even now being retarded. It is not our fault that there are so few Radicals in this House. If it were our doing, we should not be willing, as we are now showing ourselves, to remedy the grievance. The disproportion of Parties is due to circumstances and causes which it is unprofitable and unnecessary to review at the present moment. We are faced by the fact that the Unionist Party is in an overwhelming majority, and we know that something must be done to alter a state of affairs which is undoubtedly a grievance.<lb/>
But it is not only because of this disproportion in the composition of this House that reconstitution is necessary and inevitable. A deeper cause&#x2014;and the noble Viscount the Leader of the House told us that he looked for deeper causes&#x2014;a deeper cause of the necessity for reform is to be found in the change which has come over the House of Commons. It is because the House of Commons is becoming less and less a faithful reflection of national character and national will that this House must be brought into more intimate association with the electorate. It is not because this House is effete or out of date&#x2014;we have the testimony of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack to the effect that it is not&#x2014;but because the House of Commons is breaking away from those democratic principles on which the Government of this country is based; it is not because this House is grasping at predominant power in Parliament, but because the House of Commons is seeking to usurp the power which belongs to the people and which has hitherto been exercised
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0232"/>
<col>455</col>
on their behalf by King, Lords, and Commons, that reform of the Constitution is imperative. It is necessary to bring the Second Chamber into more intimate association with the electorate than in the past in order to counteract the growing tendencies of Cabinet autocracy and House of Commons despotism. These mischievous tendencies make it obligatory to have a Second Chamber which can perform its natural function of referring dubious measures to the people without its action being misunderstood or misrepresented as the self-interested action of a privileged class.<lb/>
There is no more preposterous claim than that the House of Commons, controlled as it is by an oligarchy with almost absolute powers, invariably represents the popular will. I say invariably, but I mean, of course, only when a Radical Government is in power, for even Radicals do not claim that the House of Commons represents the people when it is under the control of a Conservative majority. It is surely unnecessary to recall the many familiar instances when the decisions of the House of Commons have been contrary to the wishes of the people, for without going back to the Home Rule proposals of 1886 and 1893, we have the cases which are fresh in our minds of the Education and Licensing Bills and of the miscalled "People's Budget." Even when the control of the Cabinet is relaxed we see that the House of Commons can give votes which are absolutely contrary to the will of the people. Will any one dare to say that the people of this country are three to one in favour of Woman Suffrage? Yet only a few days ago the House of Commons voted in that proportion in favour of such a measure. How can that be explained? Surely, it is because politicians, even though they be the wise and high-minded men who are the chosen representatives of the people, are generally mere puppets in the hands of the wire-pullers of the Party system, a system which is often entirely out of touch with the feelings and aspirations of the great mass of men who keep aloof from it.<lb/>
The domination of the Cabinet oligarchy over the reason and consciences of its supporters has never been more flagrantly exemplified than in the recent discussions on the Parliament Bill, and to that extent I quite agree with the noble Viscount the Leader of the House that you cannot have
<col>456</col>
real deliberation in such an Assembly. We feel that change is necessary in order that we may preserve true democracy and avoid the worst of all tyrannies&#x2014;namely, that of an oligarchy which is now to be supported by paid politicians. We need change in order that the House of Commons may not usurp power which belongs to the people. If our Radical friends are sincere in their professions that they intend to reform this Chamber; if they are not merely paying lip service to the principles that in the end the people must decide and that we must have a Second Chamber in this country&#x2014;for those are the two great principles on which we are agreed&#x2014;then we are on common ground in attempting the reconstitution of this House as a solution of present difficulties. I fail to see why any false pride need deter our opponents from meeting us on that ground. When they first proposed their Veto policy they did so because they thought there was no other means of overcoming the rooted objections of this House to any change whatever, but we have pledged ourselves to reform and have gone more than half way to meet them. We have changed our attitude. That surely has changed the whole situation, and is a reason which would appeal to ordinary men for enabling the Government and their supporters to change their attitude in some small degree in order that we may arrive at a permanent and national settlement.<lb/>
The noble Viscount the Leader of the House said, on the First Reading of this Bill, that it "cannot be a substitute or an alternative for the Parliament Bill." That was the uncompromising conclusion of his speech. That may be his opinion, but I venture to say that it is not a matter which he or his friends can finally decide. It is one which only the people of this country can decide, and the people have not yet settled this question. All that they have settled on the arguments which have been put before them is that there must be fair play between Parties, and that the Second Chamber ought no longer to be constituted on a hereditary basis. They have still to settle which of the other two alternatives&#x2014;for there are only three courses&#x2014;they will adopt. That is to say, whether the Second Chamber is to be purely elective or formed on some composite basis. This Bill proposes a compromise between the hereditary system, which is discarded, and the elective system, and since it is only by compromise that differing parties can arrive
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0233"/>
<col>457</col>
at agreement, surely that is a <i>prima facie</i> reason for regarding it as a fair offer to meet on common ground. I for one do not hesitate to believe that sooner or later a system similar to that proposed by this Bill will be approved by the nation and become the law of the land, for it seems to me very certain that the people will not care to set up a Second Chamber which is wholly elective, and therefore necessarily a formidable rival and competitor to the popular and more representative Chamber. It is on those grounds that, without misgiving and with no more regret than is in accordance with natural sentiments, I unhesitatingly support the proposal of the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01048"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are two points in common between both sides of the House, though there are a great many more important points on which there is diametrical opposition. The points on which the House is now agreed are that this Bill by itself&#x2014;and I am quoting the words of the noble Marquess who introduced it&#x2014;is not a solution of the difficulties which embarrass both Parties and that the relations of both Houses still have to be dealt with by legislation. The noble Marquess went on to say that the Bill is a complement or supplement to a Parliament Bill dealing with the relations between the two Houses. In the course of the discussion of this question many reproaches have been addressed to the Liberal Government because they have only produced one-half of the scheme which they consider ultimately necessary for the settlement of this question&#x2014;that is to say, they have approached the question of the limitation of the powers of this House before attempting to touch the question of its composition. We have had bitter complaints of that, but if those complaints were justified we might very fairly say, "Why does not the noble Marquess act up to his precepts, and not according to our example?" Why has he not embodied in one Bill, not only the composition of the House but also the relations between the two Houses? We had a discussion on the Referendum the other day, but it was thrust aside. We have had the Referendum talked of; it was paraded before the electors, but when in this House, where if anywhere sympathetic treatment ought to have been extended to it, the Referendum was presented as a positive and definite settlement of the question, the noble Lord who brought it in did not go to a Division.<lb/>
<col>458</col>
The noble Marquess has presented sincerely what he considers a necessary step forward. There are other steps to be taken; but I have not understood from any of his speeches that he thought the proposals he now made were not, as far as they went, satisfactory proposals with a view to the constitution of a Second Chamber. I do not say the noble Marquess put all the details of his scheme as being final, for they are to be open to criticism in Committee, but the broad features of the scheme were supposed to be a settlement. Last night Lord Willoughby de Broke expressed much sympathy with the House as now composed, although he was willing to follow his leader into the creation of an entirely different House. The noble Lord mitigated the language of the hunting field into the language of this House and said he was sorry that the noble Marquess had not told his opponents to go to perdition. In substance he took up the attitude of the solicitor who says that the offer of the Bill is made "without prejudice," and that if the Veto Bill is to be forced through, this offer now before us will be withdrawn and he and his friends will be free to do whatever his Party please to find some entirely different solution. The noble Earl, LordSelborne, took up that line, and absolutely declared that this Bill would be withdrawn, abandoned, utterly discarded, if any attempt were made to tack on to it the Government Bill dealing with the powers of the House of Lords. The Opposition should make up their minds whether they agree with the noble Marquess, their leader, that the proposal now before us is introduced as a reasonable step towards a settlement, or whether they regard it merely as a provisional offer, made without prejudice, to be withdrawn unless it is coupled with some other proposal of theirs that they know will not be accepted. The noble Marquess repeated what he said in this House before this matter became so urgent and what has been said by other responsible Statesmen, that there is no claim made for absolute Veto, and that there is a recognition of the ultimate supremacy of the other House. But the impassioned declaration to which we have just listened paid very little regard to the other House of Parliament. On the contrary, the noble Lord asserted that, in spite of the large extensions of the suffrage, in spite of large redistributions to bring representation more in accordance with the population of the electorate, the House of Commons had deteriorated, had got further and further away from expressing the will
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0234"/>
<col>459</col>
of the people, and therefore this House ought to be strengthened in order to secure more truly that the will of the people should prevail. The suggestion is made that the Government Bill should contain a provision as to the constitution of this House. I might return the compliment and ask noble Lords opposite for their scheme as to limitation of powers. But we have had indications. The noble Marquess indicated a leaning to the Referendum, though afterwards that leaning became so slight that he seemed to stand in an almost perpendicular attitude towards it. We have also had talk of Joint Sittings.<lb/>
My Lords, the Bill of the noble Marquess is presented, among other objects, for the purpose of establishing a fair equilibrium between the two great Parties in the State, of securing, as the noble Lord who spoke last put it, fair play to the Liberal Party. I should like to analyse for a moment the proposed composition of the House and see what element of fair play it shows to the Liberal Party. I will not put it as high as did the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack when he said that in the initial stage there would be only 10 Liberals out of 100. Perhaps I am a little sanguine, but when I look at Dod and other books and see the members of this House to whom the word "Liberal" is attached&#x2014;although the word Liberal perhaps does not quite express the ingredients within&#x2014;I am willing to assume that we cannot claim more than one-eighth of the persons who would be entitled to vote as Peers in the selection of the 100 Peers. We are not going merely to have those Peers who sit in this House by hereditary right, but we are going to have&#x2014;and it is perfectly right and fair&#x2014;all the Irish and Scottish Peers. I take it that the aggregate will rim up to fully 700 persons entitled to vote, and I do not think even a sanguine estimate could rely upon more than one-eighth of those being Liberals. We would start with 87 Unionists, Conservatives, and non-Liberals, and perhaps 13 who might fairly be classed as Liberals, though I should be very sorry to have to go into action with all of them. My noble friends opposite are fond of commenting on the rapid change that comes over the temperament and disposition even of a Peer who has been appointed by or on the recommendation of a Liberal Prime Minister after he takes his seat in this House, and as to answering for the sons of the fathers I am sure he would be a very
<col>460</col>
rash man who attempted to do so; it is hard enough to answer for the father during his lifetime. I could not help thinking, when the noble Lord who spoke last was talking of the way his conscience was made up of pedigree and hereditary material, what the hereditary conscience of the house of Russell has been from the time it was first enriched by the spoils of the Abbeys, and when the members of that house were such a powerful factor in English history in the eighteenth century in the great Whig Oligarchy. It seems to show to me that the noble Lord must have sought for his conscience in the recesses of his own personality and not in the inherited dispositions of his forefathers.<lb/>
To proceed with the composition of the new House. I suppose you would certainly agree that if electorate after electorate were steadily over a long series of years to return a House of Commons in which there was a 10 per cent. majority hostile to the views which this House has hitherto entertained, it would be taken as some evidence of the settled opinion of the nation? But what would that 10 per cent. majority give? Assuming that majority to be constant, because if it is not constant then the Liberal Lords elected would diminish in number, the best case I can put for the Liberals as to the proportions in this House would be that you would get from the two factors of nomination by the Crown and election by the House of Commons a majority of twenty-two Lords of Parliament who would be Liberal, and against them you have to set the majority of seventy-four, the outcome of the choice by the hereditary Peers. Although the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, could not bring his mind to grapple with the problem of what a variation of opinion might mean among theologians, judging from the history of the action of the Bench of Bishops. I should be very sanguine if I expected to see one Liberal Bishop elected. This would give the Unionists a standing majority of from fifty-eight to sixty in the House of Lords even when the House of Commons over a long series of years was steadily Liberal. Is that what noble Lords opposite call fair play to the Liberal Party? On the introduction of his Bill the noble Marquess took as a basis an exceptional election&#x2014;the election of 1906&#x2014;when the catastrophe fell on the Conservative Party. In that Parliament the Party opposite only returned 23 per cent. of the other House. If the Liberals had brought in a
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0235"/>
<col>461</col>
Bill to reform the House of Lords on the lines suggested by the other side, and the Conservative Party had accepted that Bill, no doubt on that occasion the Liberals having a fresh start would have elected a majority in your Lordships' House. But you are going to dilute and average the composition of the House by spreading the re-election over twelve years. The upshot of it would be that assuming on the whole there is a tendency towards Liberalism against Conservatism on the part of the electorate, it could not outweigh the overwhelming loading of the dice provided by the representation of hereditary Peers.<lb/>
The fact is the Bill presented for the purpose of bringing about this object is perfectly idle and illusory. The noble Earl who spoke after dinner last night correctly commented on the disproportion which very commonly occurs between the representation of a Party in the House of Commons and its poll of the popular vote. But the noble Earl did not comment on how gross that disproportion was during the twelve years or so when his Party was in power, and when they took advantage of a Khaki Election to pass measures which were very unpopular in the country. But let that pass. With the present mode of election the popular vote is not properly represented in the constitution of the Rouse of Commons. There have even been cases where actually a minority of the electors have returned a majority in the House of Commons. Any one who has seen the working of proportional representation in Belgium and other countries will agree that if that system were introduced in this country the fluctuation of minorities and majorities would be brought within much narrower limits than at present. If that change were made, a majority of 10 per cent. in the House of Commons would be a very unusual and rare occurrence; but the closer you run the majority in the House of Commons the more absolutely necessary it is that you should not load the dice, as I said before, in the House of Lords. You ought to secure that the House of Lords is as absolutely fair a reflection of the general opinion of the people of this country as the House of Commons would be. But there is no suggestion of such a thing as that in this Bill. Noble Lords opposite give a very grudging welcome, if I can call it a welcome, to the Bill. I would rather use the expression of the noble Viscount who leads the
<col>462</col>
House when speaking of a great man in the French Revolution, and say this Bill is receiving "sombre acquiescence." But if the Bill were amended by securing that the Upper House were to be as true a representation of the prevalent feeling of the country as the House of Commons is, I am quite sure it would be entirely distasteful to your Lordships.<lb/>
The noble Marquess who brought in this Bill said it would not be unfair, seeing that he wanted the House to contain rather a steadying influence, that there should be usually a preponderance, although, perhaps, not a very large one, of persons of moderate opinions. I do not know what the noble Marquess's idea is of a not very large preponderance of persons of moderate opinions in this House, but by his own calculation, which I think is absolutely incorrect, he worked it out on the supposition that when the House of Commons is nearly three to two it would give a Conservative majority of 22 to 24 in a House of 300 odd. I do not look forward to the House of Commons usually being composed in the proportions of three to two. We have had ever since the great disturbance of Parties which followed Mr. Gladstone's introduction of Home Rule, in 1885 and 1886, much greater swings of the pendulum, much more abrupt changes and larger shiftings of majorities than we were accustomed to before; but those of us who look back to the days of Lord Palmerston, and the fifties and sixties, remember how happy Governments were when they had a majority of 40 to 50 in the House of Commons, and there is no reason why we should not go back to that again. But this Bill does not attempt to approach, not by an immense distance, anything like securing fair play or equal treatment between the two Parties in the State.<lb/>
I see no object whatever in the creation of electoral colleges up and down the country instead of at once giving the election to the House of Commons as a whole. Mind you, this Bill, while it has a suggestion which is quite unnecessary, because every Act of Parliament can be altered by Parliament at any time, provides that unless Parliament otherwise elects these colleges shall go on. I am in favour of bringing about a fair representation of the various shades of opinion in the country. I took the trouble to map out, on the lines indicated by the noble Marquess, what sort of colleges you might
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0236"/>
<col>463</col>
make, taking the limit of twelve. I suppose he had in his mind such great units as London and Lancashire and Scotland and Ireland. I made what I thought was a fair distribution of constituencies. I did not make out that there was any material difference in what the Parliamentary result would be between the great Parties whether the Lords of Parliament were elected by these colleges or by the House of Commons as a whole. But there would be this important difference in the representation of some shades of opinion. If you map out this country into electoral colleges the Labour Party would in no case be able to get a single representative, whereas if the House of Commons voted as a whole with proportional representation the Labour Party would get a very fair proportion. Again, take Wales, for instance, as a unit. Wales would return on the noble Marquess's plan about six members. In Wales, as a unit, not a single Conservative would have a look in; the whole of the representation of Wales would pass to the Welsh Party. In Ireland you would get about 2 Conservatives and 10 Home Rulers, and in Scotland about 2 Conservatives and 10 Liberals. Of course, if you were to break up Scotland into still further units the Conservatives would disappear more absolutely than ever. I do not think there is any difficulty in letting the House of Commons as a whole choose its representatives for the Upper House of Parliament, and I think it would be better in the sense that more shades of opinion would be represented than if you were to break the country up even into substantial units.<lb/>
To touch on another small point dealt with by the noble Marquess, I agree with his conclusion that it is quite impossible to represent in this House various shades of ecclesiastical organisation and opinion. I am quite sure we do not want to make this House, however constituted, any more like a Convocation or a Round Table of different ecclesiastical denominations than we can help, and I am well aware that the keenest of the Free Churches would repudiate any extension of the principle of the union of Church and State by allotting to them official representation in this House. It is quite true, as the noble Marquess said, that in the case of an eminent man of character and knowledge and public spirit, it would be quite within the power of the Prime Minister to offer him a seat in this House. That would be a different thing altogether, but to invite
<col>464</col>
any external organisation, whether Roman Catholic, or Jewish, or Nonconformist, or anything else, to nominate their representative and send him here would be a great mistake, and not, I think, popular with the great mass of those whom it was intended to please.<lb/>
I have touched on the most important points to which I wished to call your Lordships' attention. But I desire to press again that, if you put forward as part of your principles the recognition of the ultimate supremacy of the House of Commons, you must neither make such speeches as the noble Lord who preceded me made, full of contumely and contempt for the House of Commons, nor must you indicate your hope to call in some external force, such as a popular <i>pl&#x00E9;biscite,</i> to control and regulate and limit the powers of the House of Commons. Make the House of Commons, if you please, as fully representative of the nation as possible. I am not afraid of a complete and equal electoral system by districts. I should welcome One man one vote, and One vote one value. Your Lordships did not show any great desire to make the House of Commons more representative of the people when you rejected the Bill to prevent people voting two or three times. You cannot expect these professions of good faith and liberality not to come home to you at last. You cannot go about the country proclaiming your anxiety for democracy without its coming home to you, and whether they are sincere or not these professions will some day be embarrassing to you at the hustings. If you had a House of Commons elected with single voting, no plurality, no property qualification, and with equal electoral representation, we shall have no fear of the result. You may be quite sure that we as Liberals are not afraid of the effect on the composition of the House of Commons of bringing its members more in contact with the electors, nor are we afraid of shorter Parliaments.<lb/>
May I say one word before I sit down with regard to the mandate of members of the House of Commons? A Member of Parliament has a duty to his constituents, to fulfil the pledges and act on the professions he has made to them and not to depart from the fair and honourable understanding that exists between them as to the policy he should pursue in Parliament. I think it is democracy gone mad, and reckless folly on the part of a Con-
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0237"/>
<col>465</col>
servative body like your Lordships' House, to talk as if the Member was to go down and consult his constituents with regard to every clause and every little detail of every Bill with which he has to deal. In a country like this a member of the House of Commons must be a thoughtful and capable man ready and willing to use his own judgment with regard to the details of legislation, and if you undermine that sense of duty and responsibility you undermine the whole value of the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01049"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is one circumstance connected with this debate which seems to me to be somewhat remarkable&#x2014;namely, that from beginning to end, with but one exception, we have not heard a single remark as to the causes which have produced the situation&#x2014;the emergency the noble Viscount the Leader of the House called it&#x2014;in which we stand. I think it very important that somebody should call attention to the causes which have led to the present state of things, because it seems to me that only in that way can an answer be given to such a speech as was made last night by Lord Bathurst when he asked why this House should be modified in any degree in its constitution. The one exception to which I refer was the striking remark of a noble Lord who said that the present situation in which the two Houses of Parliament stand was rendered inevitable by the Reform Act of 1832. It was not any musty or rusty old Tory who gave vent to that sentiment, although it is a sentiment that reminds me very much of the utterances that we read of in the mouths of Tories of those days. The statement came from the lips of the noble Viscount, Lord Morley. As my noble friend below me said, there is no Peer in this House who by training, by study, by mental ability, is better able to take a philosophic view of political causes.<lb/>
And the noble Viscount told us further that, starting with the Reform Act of 1832, the Reform Act of 1867 and the Reform Act of 1884 had rendered the present situation not only inevitable but cogent. In other words, my Lords, with one very great and signal exception what has brought us to this pass is the domination of the Liberal Party from the year 1832 to the year 1884; and I could not help thinking, when I heard those remarks fall from the noble Viscount, what a proof it
<col>466</col>
was of what I have always held to be true, that the Radical Party had far greater foresight than the great Liberal Party that they knew where they were going, which the Liberal Party never did; and they have arrived at the goal to which they were tending. Although it is now the fashion to call ourselves democrats&#x2014;and I understand the leader of our Party in the House of Commons has dubbed himself by that title&#x2014;nothing was more abhorrent than democracy in the eyes of the old Liberal Party which dominated the country in the thirties and the forties and the fifties. Nothing was more abhorrent to such men as Lord Melbourne or Lord Palmerston. None of the powers of vituperation of that great writer and imaginative historian, Lord Macaulay, were called more into exercise than when throwing contempt upon democracy. But we have been landed in that condition, and when I said it was due to the Liberal Party I said there was one great exception, and there was. It was when Mr. Disraeli thought that he would try and dish the Whigs by passing a Reform Bill of his own and set the example to his Party of trying, if I may use a vulgar phrase, to go one better than his opponents, which I am sorry to say has been too often copied by the Party since. Well, my Lords, that has landed us in the present emergency, and I was rather surprised to hear the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, last night throw in the teeth of the noble Viscount, as if it were a very effective argument, the fact that since the passing of the Reform Bill the Unionist Government had been in power for many years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01050"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: I do not think I mentioned that subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01051"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: I certainly understood the noble Earl to say so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01052"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: It must have been somebody else.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01053"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: Then I beg the noble Earl's pardon. It was certainly said by some one. The argument was this, that it was not true that the Reform Bill had brought about the domination of the present Government and their Party because the Unionist Government had for many years been in power. In the first place, if you confer
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0238"/>
<col>467</col>
upon a class of persons who have no political education the right of the franchise, it takes them naturally some time to appreciate and to know how to exercise their power. Then it must always be remembered that Mr. Gladstone's adoption of Home Rule made a split in the great Liberal Party which carried with it an enormous majority of the country in the Liberal interest over to the Conservative, or the Unionist side, and so protracted the advent of the situation in which we now find ourselves. But I do most cordially agree with the noble Viscount opposite that the present situation is owing to three successive Reform Bills that we passed. I think it shows the prescience of the Radical Party. I wish I could think that they showed as much prescience now with regard to what is before them in the course they are pursuing.<lb/>
This succession of Reform Bills has brought about what we call a democracy. What is a democracy? A democracy is simply that kind of Government which invariably prevails in one form or another in the decay of a State. I see some noble Lords smile, others raise their eyebrows. I quite expected that. It is a very unpopular sentiment in these days. But I would like to quote from authority which perhaps will appeal to the two noble Viscounts opposite, because I know they both take a philosophic view of politics. I will not quote a politician at all. I will quote a man of science, a man well known to have given great attention to the subject of ancient civilisations&#x2014;I refer to Dr. Flinders Petrie, who has just published a little book, one of a series of "Harper's Library of Modern Thought." There is not anything very antiquated or musty about a library of modern thought, and in that book Dr. Flinders Petrie has treated the various periods of civilisation, showing how civilisations at different times have risen and then fallen; and I may say, in passing, that it is a curious argument by which he shows that these rises and falls have been universal all over the earth at different ages. But that is beside the mark. He treats civilisation from the point of view of art and literature and divers standpoints, and then he comes to stages of Government. The conclusion he draws at the end of his book is this, that in the early period of civilisation of a State strong personal rule exists and, is necessary to maintain unity, and that lasts from
<col>468</col>
400 to 600 years; that is followed by an oligarchy when the unity of the country can be maintained by law instead of by an autocracy&#x2014;he gives another period of 400 to 600 years for that. He goes on&#x2014;
<quote>"Then gradually the transformation to a democracy takes place; beginning about the great phase of literature in Greece, Rome, and Modern Europe-During this time, wealth&#x2014;that is the accumulated capital of facilities&#x2014;continues to increase. When democracy has attained full power, the majority without capital necessarily eat up the capital of the minority, and the civilisation steadily decays, until the inferior population is swept away to make room for a fitter people. The consumption of all the resources of the Roman Empire, from the second century when democracy was dominant until the Gothic kingdom arose on its ruins, is the best known example in detail. Such is the regular connection of the forms of Government, or the relation of classes, which is inherent in the conditions of the revolutions of civilisation."</quote>
I apologise for having read so long a quotation, but I think it is a somewhat remarkable one, coming as it does from the pen of one who is not interested in our political struggles and has no particular bias or animus for taking one view or the other. I confess that I adopt that idea of democracy. I do not think the noble. Viscount the Leader of the House will deny that we had at one time a Constitution which was the admiration of all the nations of the earth. Does he think so now? Does he hear from other nations, the educated opinion of Europe, the admiration of the Constitution of this country which we heard continually in old days and which no one has more studied than the noble Viscount himself?<lb/>
What is one of the principal signs of this degradation&#x2014;the one which necessitates our dealing with the questions which are now before us? Something has been said to-night about the deterioration of the House of Commons. Last year I ventured to trouble your Lordships with an expression of my feeling with regard to that. It is a disagreeable subject to deal with, and I am strongly of opinion that the more the two Houses of Parliament respect each other, and the less they use hard words in regard to each other, the easier it will be to come to a settlement, of their differences. Therefore I shall not dwell upon this subject further than to point out that when I first had the honour of a seat in the other House there was no closure; private Members had absolute power, as fully as we have in this House, of bringing forward any questions in which
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0239"/>
<col>469</col>
they were interested, and some of the most useful measures of legislation were introduced and carried through by them. There was no repression of discussion, no guillotine, no censorship of Questions put down, and it was not necessary to invest the officers of the House with a control, not only of the conduct of debate, but of the choice of the subjects to be debated. As you have extended the franchise and given more and more power to that part of the nation which has the least political education, has it improved the calibre of the House of Commons? I will say no more tan that.<lb/>
I cannot, however, help pointing out that, whether the House of Commons is improved or whether it is not, it has become absolutely powerless as a deliberative Assembly and absolutely powerless to modify or to control the conduct of a powerful Ministry. As I have said, I do not want to say anything hard or disagreeable of the House of Commons, but I can hardly be blamed for quoting what a Member himself says of that House. I have here a paper sent to me this morning from the House of Commons. It is signed "Henry Kimber," and is headed "Misrepresentation of the people." After pointing out the absolute inequality of the distribution of seats, and the number of electors in various constituencies, it says&#x2014;
<quote>"Should the constitution and powers of the other House be dictated by us who are ourselves misrepresentative and unreformed?"</quote>
That is the opinion of a Member, and I must point out that this helpless character of the House of Commons has been purposely fostered by the Ministry of the day. Mr. Asquith last year, on March 29, concluded a remarkable speech by these words&#x2014;
<quote>"The absolute Veto of the Lords must go before the road can be made clear for the advent of full grown and unfettered democracy."</quote>
That, my Lords, is what the Party opposite desire. Is it a statesmanlike desire? I have always supposed that the great object of all governments was that no part of any civilised State should be utterly unfettered; that the whole wisdom of Statesmen was the judicious contriving of checks on the various parts of the Constitution. And when a Statesman tells his countrymen that he desires any portion of the Realm&#x2014;Lords, Commons, or King&#x2014;to be unfettered, he is, I think, unfaithful to his trust.<lb/>
<col>470</col>
But it is not difficult to see why Ministers use this sort of language. In the first place, it is, of course, very convenient to flatter those who are in power. Flattery is the vice of all Statesmen, and whether it be a King we flatter, or whether it be a democracy, the same vice is seen; and probably there was no age in which the flattery of the democracy, now supposed to be the dominant element in the State, was carried on more freely or to greater depths of degradation than now. That is not the only reason. The real reason why the Prime Minister and his colleagues wish for an unfettered democracy is that it involves an unfettered Cabinet. That is really what we are face to face with, and, from a Constitutional point of view, that is the danger which the country runs. It has often been said that democracy always ends in despotism. In most States that despotism has arisen by some &#x00E9;<i>meute,</i> by some great and violent change. But in this country we have always done our revolutions by law; we have always, hitherto at any rate, carried out our revolutions by quiet and gentle means; and it is curious to observe that the despotism in which all democracies end is coming on this country in a different though equally effectual form&#x2014;in the form of the domination of the Cabinet.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I come to the reform of this House. I want a reform of this House because I, for one, want a check on the democracy. I am not afraid to say that although I know it is an extremely unpopular sentiment. The proper thing at the present day is to say that all wisdom lies with the people, and that a form of Government which you would never adopt in your own household or in any business company must be the best for the State. But I do not believe it, and I am not going to say it. I want a check on the democracy just as I should, if I had lived in the seventeenth century, have wished for a check on the power of the Crown; or, if I had lived in the eighteenth century, I would gladly have joined in breaking up the old Whig Oligarchy. I want a check on the democracy, and this House is, it seems to me, the only power in the country which, for the present at any rate, can successfully check the democracy. But in order to check the democracy your constitution must be such that it is understood of the people. I am not going to say one word against the present constitution of this House. I am quite willing to take the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0240"/>
<col>471</col>
line assumed by Lord Bathurst last night, that on the whole you have an Assembly which is superior to any other which you could put in its place. But it is not understood by the people, and you cannot get it into their heads.<lb/>
There is one thing, for instance, that the people cannot understand&#x2014;that is the old story of the "backwoodsmen." Last year I gave a challenge to the House which has never been taken up. I asked any member of this House to point to two Divisions which were decided by the vote of the "backwoodsmen." I do not quite know what a "backwoodsman" is. He may be anybody who does not sit on that Bench. It may be that I am included. My noble friend here tells me that I am one, but I would rather be allowed to cry off and perhaps consider myself an "undesirable." I have challenged any member of this House to point out any occasion on which any measure was ever passed, any Resolution ever come to, any Division decided, by the votes of the "undesirables." Of course we have seen many Divisions swelled by the "undesirables." I remember many years ago when the Second Reading of the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill was carried by ten votes, that that Division was carried by some members who do not usually attend this House&#x2014;I will not go further than that; but that Bill was thrown out on Third Reading. Even that was not a definite decision of this House carried by the "undesirables," if I may still use the term, and that is the only instance in my experience where the "undesirables" have ever affected the decisions of this House. But, my Lords, you cannot get the people to believe that; they do not believe it, and they will not believe it, and therefore it is very necessary to show them what the facts with regard to the "undesirables" really are. Another misunderstanding which requires to be cleared up is this. The British public believe that your humble servant and all my noble friends round me upset the decisions of the Judges. Nothing will get that out of their heads, and the consequence is that if you have voters of this sort of calibre of intelligence you must make them understand and show them that it is impossible for any one of your Lordships who has not had a legal training to take part in the judicial business of this House, or else you naturally have a House in which the people have no confidence.<lb/>
<col>472</col>
I come lastly to the hereditary principle. I am told sometimes that we have abandoned the hereditary principle. I do not quite know what that means. If it means that the hereditary principle as an abstract principle is abandoned, I do not think that those who say so know quite what they are talking about, because the whole of religion, both Christian and Jewish, is based upon the hereditary principle, and no man in the abstract can abandon the hereditary principle as a principle and remain either a good Jew or a good Christian. Therefore I do not suppose that those who use these terms mean that. What they do mean is that we have abandoned the hereditary principle as a means of giving a seat to noble Lords in this House. I, for one, have never done so. All I have ever assented to is this, that hereditary right alone without any qualification of any sort or kind should not give a seat to a member of this House. That is a very different thing from abandoning the hereditary principle. And in addition to that I am perfectly willing to consider any well-thought-out proposition for placing other members on these Benches who have not the hereditary character; but the hereditary principle, as a principle, as part of the considerations which should govern us in deciding upon the constitution of this House, I have never abandoned, and, as at present advised, have not the slightest intention of abandoning. I protest most strongly against the accusation which is sometimes made against some of us who supported my noble friend Lord Rosebery when he brought forward his Resolutions, that we thereby abandoned the hereditary principle. I agree with Lord Lamington, who said he did not believe the hereditary principle to be unpopular in this country. It is curious to observe how very differently noble Lords look upon this subject according to the part of the country they come from. I heard my noble friend Lord Faber say last night that he believed the hereditary principle was very unpopular. I heard Lord Lamington say that he did not believe it. I do not believe it. I only know this, that whenever an occupant of one of my cottages dies the first thing his relations are anxious to show is that the family have occupied the cottage for generations, that they have been tenants of my family for generations, and that that is an argument why they should not be moved. I do not believe while that is ingrained as it is ingrained in the hearts of the people of this
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0241"/>
<col>473</col>
country that they are against the hereditary principle. But, my Lords, the people who have not got political education cannot understand that the hereditary principle does not give what I call the "undesirables" the power of legislating for this country. Therefore you must, modify the constitution of this House so as to give the people confidence that those who are in this House are fairly qualified for their duties, and I agree that there should be a certain representation of those who cannot sustain the burden of a hereditary Peerage but who are chosen to sit here upon some other tenure.<lb/>
For these reasons I welcome in general terms the Bill which the noble Marquess has laid upon the Table of this House. I welcome it as an effort to solve a problem. I think myself that it will require much modification in committee, and I am not at all sure that it is not going in some respects in advance of public opinion. What I am now going to say I say with some hesitation, but I think I am known to your Lordships sufficiently well after all the years I have sat in this House to be allowed without offence to say something unpalatable. If this House has a fault it is that it is prone to act in a panic; it is prone to think that the country is more against it than it is; it is prone to think, if might humbly suggest, that the passing waves of feeling are to be taken as indications of the permanent feeling of the country. I will add one caution more. When I say passing waves, I often think that politicians do not sufficiently remember how long life is. Waves of feeling now are counted by months. Waves of feeling really should be counted by years; and, as I showed at the beginning of my speech, it is not at once that we see the evils which ensue from a particular line of policy. It has taken more than half a century to produce the consequences which the noble Viscount now sees ensued from the Reform Bill of 1832. It took seventy years to bring about those changes. So, my Lords, we should remember that we have to act in the way we think best for the country taking into review a long period of its history. Add while, on the one hand, we should be perfectly willing to sacrifice ourselves if it is merely a question of our seats or the right to express pour opinions in this House, we should nor act in a panic or be frightened by the big words which proceed from the government Benches.
<col>474</col>
In the present situation we should consider, as this House throughout its history has always done, independently and with the intelligence and training which it has, what really is best for the country. For that we ought to vote, for that we ought to endeavour to bring measures forward, and then, whether we succeed or whether we fail, we shall at any rate have the feeling that we have striven to do our duty, that we have not bent to a popular cry leading us to do things which we do not honestly think to be the best for the country in the long run, and if this House is to be abolished it will fall with the respect of the nation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01054"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have heard from the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack what in his opinion is the course that this House should take. I gathered that in his opinion the House ought to drop this Bill, accept the Parliament Bill, and leave it to His Majesty's Government to fill up the Preamble of their Bill as they think best and introduce what provisions they like for arranging difficulties that might arise between the two Houses. I have no doubt that, even on this side of the House, noble Lords have every confidence in His Majesty's Ministers, but I would point out to the noble and learned Lord that we are not dealing with a matter in any way personal to ourselves. This House, like the other House of Parliament, is merely a trustee of the rights and the liberties of the people. I think the noble and learned Lord will admit that the position of His Majesty's Government at present is in some respects a rather peculiar one. They are not, supported in the other House of Parliament by a homogeneous Party; their majority is composed of very divergent elements, and it can scarcely be said of them that they are really masters in their own house. In those circumstances, I can hardly think that the Lord Chancellor really sincerely meant that it would be advisable for the House of Lords practically to sign a blank cheque and give it to His Majesty's Government to fill in any way they pleased.<lb/>
This Bill has been, in one respect, received by noble Lords opposite in a spirit which I did not at all anticipate. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, on the First Reading described it as destructive of the House of Lords, and the whole tone of his remarks was regretting the destruction of the House as at present constituted.
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0242"/>
<col>475</col>
Then the noble Lord opposite, Lord St. Davids, literally showered praises upon the House of Lords as at present constituted, and I have noticed the same strange phenomena occurring outside. Speech after speech by noble Lords and their friends have been of the same tone&#x2014;that the House of Lords as at present constituted is about the most admirable Second Chamber that could be devised. If this House should ever be in want of a situation it has received from Lord St. Davids a character that will at once get it a situation with any community in search of a perfect Second Chamber. But he language used to the electorate at the last two General Elections was very different. Then the whole ground of attack was that the House as then constituted was not a fitting instrument to fulfil the functions of a Second Chamber. That view was forced upon the people in very strenuous language, in many cases with not the most strict regard for accuracy. What is the meaning of this strange change of tone? A few months ago nothing bad enough could be said for the constitution of the House of Lords; now no language is too good. I confess that I misdoubt me as to the meaning of the adulations now cast upon us. I do not understand why so much love is now showered upon the House and why noble Lords dissembled their love so very successfully when addressing the electorate. I have a suspicion that the object may be either that, if the House is, as it is, a very perfect instrument, there can be no particular object in filling up the Preamble of the Parliament Bill, or that, having found the constitution of the House of Lords such a very convenient ground of attack when desiring to stir up the prejudices and passions of the people, they may desire to preserve it in the same condition in order to use it at some future date in the same way.<lb/>
I am not going at any length into a description of the problem before the House, or into the main principle of this Bill. I think the House is discussing this matter under some difficulty. The noble Viscount opposite said that they were discussing the Bill under much difficulty because they did not know how the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition was going to fill in the difficult question of the relations between the two Houses. That I have no doubt is the case. We
<col>476</col>
also are discussing the Bill under the same sort of difficulty, because we have not the faintest idea how His Majesty's Government intend to fill in their Preamble. The position is undoubtedly difficult for the reason that this Bill deals with only part of the great Constitutional question. Your Lordships will not forget, though there is nothing said about it in the Bill, that propositions of a definite character have by Resolutions been made in this House suggesting means by Joint Sittings and otherwise of adjusting differences when they arise between the two branches of the Legislature, and also suggesting that in rare and well-defined cases, when all other means had failed, the matter in dispute might be referred to the ultimate source of all power&#x2014;the people. Your Lordships also will not forget that the Parliament Bill is in this House. As a matter of fact, there are three more or less distinct Bills in the House&#x2014;the Parliament Bill, dealing with the powers of the House; the Bill we are now discussing, dealing with the constitution of the House; and the Reference to the People Bill.<lb/>
I hope your Lordships, in discussing this Bill, will not be unmindful of the fact that it is really impossible to consider it without some reference to the Resolutions that have been passed with regard to Joint Sittings and the Referendum, and also the provisions of the Parliament Bill. The Bill of the noble Marquess was described by the noble Viscount opposite as destructive of the House of Lords. It seems to me that the Bill is of a distinctly constructive character. This House, the most ancient legislative body in the world, has gone through many vicissitudes, many changes both of constitution and political complexion; it has adapted itself to the changing circumstances of different times; and surely a Bill which aims at adapting the House to the conditions under which we now live, which aims at rendering it more responsive to popular feeling, and so on, is most distinctly a measure of a constructive character. The noble Viscount attributes the present Constitutional question to the gradual cumulative effects of the Reform Acts of 1832, 1867, and 1884. In his opinion the admission of great bodies of new electors caused a cleavage between the House of Lords and the other House of Parliament. I feel rather diffident in differing from the noble Viscount on a matter of that kind, but at
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0243"/>
<col>477</col>
the same time I cannot quite agree with him in that.<lb/>
The actual crisis, if I may so call it, that we are now in is due to some extent to the necessity that the present Government are under of endeavouring to legislate to satisfy all the peculiar fads of the various groups constituting their majority, to some extent to the exuberant character of their own legislative faculties, and to a very large extent to the congestion of business which is suffocating the House of Commons. This has led to the undoubted fact, which was pointed out by the noble Duke behind me, that the Cabinet not only absorb all the time of the House, not only exercise all the administrative functions, but really all the legislative functions also, and have become virtually masters of the House of Commons to the exclusion of the private Member, so that the House of Commons has almost ceased to be a deliberative Assembly. Even if it be true that the admission of large bodies of men to the franchise is the cause, surely the course adopted by the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, is a more statesmanlike course than that which noble Lords opposite would wish us to adopt. They would settle the difficulty by reducing this House to an absolute nullity&#x2014;to all intents and purposes doing away with it altogether as an effective check or balance. The noble Marquess, on the other hand, aims by his Bill at making the House more responsive to popular feeling, at making it vibrate more readily to changes in popular sentiment, and so bringing it more into touch with these great bodies of men who have been admitted to the franchise, and enabling it to fulfil its duty as a check and balance better than it can at present. Of the two I think the constructive scheme of the noble Marquess is wiser, more statesmanlike, and more effectual than the purely destructive principles of noble Lords opposite. Even were the Bill destructive, I confess I should prefer it to the alternative offered to us of accepting the Parliament Bill with a blank Preamble.<lb/>
I would sooner see this House absolutely absolutely than, as it seems to me, degraded. I honestly believe that if the great Statesmen who from this House governed the affairs of the Empire in the past could be here now, they would say, "Reform the House, reconstitute it, adapt it to the circumstances with which it has to deal,
<col>478</col>
or abolish it altogether; but do not inflict upon an ancient and honourable institution the indignity of being turned into nothing better than a sham." And that, after all, is what noble Lords opposite propose to do&#x2014;they would leave this House merely a sort of wax image of what it once was, a mere effigy with a wooden lance and a pasteboard sword and with no power worth considering if your. Lordships consider the way in which business is forced through the House of Commons&#x2014;I am not cavilling at it and I would not go so far as to say even that it is not necessary&#x2014;if you consider the application of the closure, surely it is absurd to suppose that the mere suspensory powers to be left to this House under the Parliament Bill would be worth anything at all as a check or a balance. Bills would be sent up here and if they were rejected or amended they would be brought in again in the House of Commons and passed through in the most perfunctory manner. Ministers would, say, "This Bill was amply debated and thoroughly threshed out a few months ago, and it would be mere waste of time to debate it again." The closure would be applied and the Bill sent up here again in quite a short space of time. The short suspensory powers proposed would have no real effect, and the House in those circumstances would be reduced to nothing better than an empty shell.<lb/>
I do not propose to go into the main principles of this Bill. They have been so amply and fully explained by the noble Marquess, both on First Reading and on Second Reading that that would be totally unnecessary. It is also unnecessary for the further reason that the Bill merely puts into concrete and definite shape within the four corners of a Bill the Resolutions which were accepted by the House some time ago by enormous majorities. The House admitted that the hereditary principle must be modified, that the mere accident of birth should no longer of necessity convey a right to sit and vote. The Bill provides for that, and provides for it, it seems to me, in the only absolute and adequate way. A Peer would not be eligible for election unless he had some qualification. The noble Viscount contended that that qualification would have a detrimental effect upon members of the Peerage who might wish to sit in the other House of Parliament, that the fact that a Peer was not qualified
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0244"/>
<col>479</col>
to sit in this House would be looked upon as a reflection upon his capability, would militate against his success in getting into the House of Commons. I cannot conceive that such a thing as that would occur. I cannot see why the fact that he had not been a Governor-General, Lieutenant-Governor, a Major-General, or whatever the qualification may be should in any way militate against him as a candidate for the other House.<lb/>
There are one or two details of the Bill upon which I would like to comment. The noble Viscount opposite commented upon the election of Spiritual Peers, and I entirely agree with him in what he said. I fail to see how they are to elect a number from among themselves by proportional representation, how it refers to them in any way. I should much prefer the provision in a Bill that I had the honour of presenting for Second Reading in this House in 1888. By that Bill the Spiritual Peerage would have been reduced to five: the two Archbishops and the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester, who have rather a different tenure from the other Bishops. I sincerely hope that means will be found for ensuring that representatives of the other great denominations should find a place in this House. I should like to see it. I do not agree with the noble Viscount opposite in the small number which he mentioned as sufficient for a reconstituted House of Lords. I think he put it at 100.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01055"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Or 200.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01056"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member><membercontribution>: There are rumours&#x2014;absolutely unfounded, no doubt, but still very persistent&#x2014;that under some circumstances the noble Viscount and his colleagues would not be absolutely horrified if the numbers of the House were increased to about 1,000 or 1,100. There is a great gap between that and the modest number of 100 which the noble Viscount thinks would be quite sufficient. I look with great satisfaction upon the fact that Peers are to be eligible for the section to be elected outside, and I think it ought to give great consolation to all those Peers who are about legislatively to die. They may all become resurrected under it. I think the Bill, considering what it had to do, has been very considerate of the Peerage. If this Bill becomes law Peers who desire a more energetic field for the exercise of their abilities than this House affords will no
<col>480</col>
longer be precluded from seeking admission to the House of Commons, and I venture to say if they do seek admission they will in a great number of cases he successful. If a Peer's ambition is to sit in this House as a Lord of Parliament there are three doors open to him: he can be elected by his brother Peers if qualified; if he is not qualified, or fails to be elected by his Peers, he can be recommended and nominated; or he can be elected by the suffrages of the electoral colleges. To that I attach great importance.<lb/>
The noble Marquess laid stress, in his speech on the First Reading, upon what he called the value of the Cross-Bench mind&#x2014;the value of independence in this House. I quite agree with him. I believe that the most solid ground of objection held by sober-minded men in the country to this House is that they think the House is actuated too much by Party considerations, that it is not as independent as a Second Chamber ought to be. That, of course, is a great exaggeration; it is, however, an honest opinion and ought to be dealt with, and this Bill will help to deal with it. It is obvious that any one possessed of what is called a Cross-Bench mind may find himself, and in some cases must almost of necessity find himself, placed in a position of considerable difficulty as regards Party platforms and Party politics, and I am sure it would be an immense relief to men of that independent frame of mind to have the opportunity of explaining their actions to a constituency or to the electoral colleges of their fellow countrymen and submitting themselves to their judgment. I think that is one of the most important provisions in the Bill.<lb/>
On one point only do I wish to make a little criticism. The method of election by electoral colleges, consisting, as I understand, in the first place at any rate, of members of the House of Commons, is I consider a very admirable way of getting over a very great difficulty. It is very admirable and, what is not always synonymous, very practicable. But what I do not altogether like are the instructions to be issued to Commissioners who are to delimit the electoral areas. According to the Bill they are to have regard to population and area, to boundaries of counties and boroughs, to existing Parliamentary constituencies, and to community of interests. I should like to have seen less stress laid on population and more stress laid on community
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0245"/>
<col>481</col>
of interests; and in the reference to areas I should have liked some indication that the larger areas, the main divisions, of the United Kingdom should be taken into consideration. In fact, in both categories&#x2014;in the section elected by the Peers and in the section elected by the electoral colleges&#x2014;I should have liked, with due regard, of course, to population, boundaries, and other things, some prominence given to the great main divisions, so that Lords of Parliament would, to some extent at any rate, sit as representatives of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. I should like that because, in the first place, community of interests is obviously more developed and defined in those great territorial divisions than in smaller ones, and I think it important that that community of interests should be considered. But I frankly admit that my real reason for saying this is that I should have liked the House so framed that it might fit in with a development which I feel confident must sooner or later come&#x2014;that is, some delegation of power to subordinate bodies in order to relieve the House of Commons from the congestion which suffocates and paralyses it. I admit, also, that I should have liked the constitution of the new House of Lords to be of such a character that it might act as a germ, as it were, of some great scheme of federation that may some day arise whereby the great Dominions oversea might find representation, not perhaps in the Imperial Parliament, but in some Council or body emanating from that Parliament.<lb/>
I approve of this Bill for the reason that it aims at a stable and a well-balanced double-Chamber system. I approve of that because, in my opinion, it is only under such a system that the democracy can really rule and protect itself from the fate which has befallen so many democracies. In spite of what the noble Duke (the Duke of Northumberland) said and of his quotation from Dr. Flinders Petrie, I have the utmost confidence and belief in our democracy provided only our democracy has fair play, and to have fair play I believe a stable and well-balanced Second-Chamber system is absolutely essential. I approve of the Bill because of the opinions I hold as to the relations which ought to exist between Great Britain and Ireland. I approve of it because I am what is commonly called a Home Ruler. I am not, of course, going to say what I understand by Home Rule,
<col>482</col>
except that my conception of it is very different from that on which the two Bills of Mr. Gladstone were founded. My conception is rather in the direction of a federal arrangement. I am not going to trouble the House with my reasons for believing in Home Rule. I believe that it would be enormously beneficial both to Ireland and to the United Kingdom, but I believe it can be beneficial only under certain conditions. One of those conditions has to do with finance, and that, of course, I cannot discuss. But I do not believe that any statutory Parliament set up, for instance, in Dublin, which of course would be subject to the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament from which it derived its powers, could have the remotest chance of working successfully and of having fair play if it was under the supervision of a Single Chamber, an omnipotent House of Commons, swayed, as the House of Commons must always be, by great and sudden changes of opinion, and gusts of prejudice or passion. I do not believe such a statutory Parliament could have a chance of working well except subject to the supremacy of a stable and well-balanced Parliament acting under a stable and well-balanced Constitution. I cannot conceive that Home Rule would have a chance of being successfully worked either unless it was conceded&#x2014;I do not say absolutely approved of but acquiesced in&#x2014;by a majority of the people of Great Britain. It may be, and I have no doubt it is, too much to hope that a statutory Parliament in Dublin could be set up, or a statutory body of any kind, by the advocacy of both the great Parties in the State, or by the advocacy of the great majority of the predominant partner. But I do not think it is too much to hope that it might be generally acquiesced in with an honest desire that, if established, it should work well. I do not believe for a moment that it would have a chance of working well if Home Rule were snatched by a chance majority of such a coalition as His Majesty's Government are now supported by. Take as an example the Act of Union itself. That Act was passed without any reference to the Irish people, the only authority that had any right to decide upon it. It was passed without reference to them more than 100 years ago, and the people of Ireland have never forgotten or forgiven the outrage that was then done to the principles of democracy; and the Union never had a chance. To smuggle on to the Statute-book an Act so vastly important as an Act
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0246"/>
<col>483</col>
remodelling the Act of Union without referring it to the people of Great Britain would, I am sure, be resented by them, and would not have a fair chance. I believe a balanced and stable Second Chamber system would be absolutely essential for the well-working and the success of any statutory Parliament that might be set up in Dublin, or of Home Rule of any sort or kind, and for that reason, if for no other, I should support this Bill, which aims at stability, and vote against any Bill which seeks to undermine stability and destroy Parliamentary equipoise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01057"><sup>*</sup><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we on this side of the House have been racking our brains, and I should not be surprised if some members on the other side of the House have been doing the same, to know what unfortunate circumstance induced the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition to introduce this Bill into your Lordships' House. There must be some reason, but the reason is not easy to find. Last night Lord Selborne, in his exhaustive and eloquent speech, gave us one reason. After saying that without the Crown the Empire would not exist twelve months, he went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"Therefore, it is the duty of Constitutionalists, by an honourable surrender of their dignity, to come to the rescue of the Crown."</quote>
I fancy I saw the eyebrows of some noble Lords opposite go up when he made that statement. I make no comment whatever on those words, the purport of which seems to have escaped the noble Earl. I leave them to his riper consideration. But if we allow ourselves to entertain what I venture to think is a preposterous proposal, what does the noble Earl propose? He proposes to effect his object by attacking, if not altogether abolishing, one of the most important privileges of the Crown by stopping the creation of Peers and Members of your Lordships' House. There may be some other reason. We were told that one reason why a Bill would have to be brought in was on account of revolution. We have not heard a word about that in this debate, and therefore I let that go by the board. We were also told that there were two great lions in the path. One, of course, was Home Rule, and the other was a Single Chamber. Neither Home Rule nor a Single Chamber has been mentioned in the whole of this debate until my noble friend mentioned
<col>484</col>
them in the last speech your Lordships have listened to. I therefore do not say one word about them.<lb/>
I should like to call the attention of the House to the extraordinary proceedings which have gone on for the last eighteen months and which have now landed us in what Lord Selborne calls the amazing position in which we find ourselves. Things were in a very disquieting state up to the end of last year, and on February 10 <i>The Times,</i> in its wisdom, announced the abandonment of reform from within. Mr. Garvin, the pacemaker of noble Lords opposite, immediately jumped in and told the public that the policy was to be changed again. He made a great discovery&#x2014;that the duty of an Opposition was to oppose and not to construct, and in his beautiful language he said that the Lords were not to charge but to form squares. That, I fancy, is one of those parade movements which were alluded to by the noble Marquess opposite and to which he seems to have so serious an objection. The word went round that the Liberal Party were to be tackled in earnest, and it was whispered&#x2014;of course, I do not know how true it was&#x2014;that this back-stiffening and more resolute policy was the direct result of beneficent and outspoken feminine influence. A paragraph went round the Press to this effect&#x2014;and it made an immense sensation&#x2014;that "a Party which cannot get up a fight and justify its position can only expect and deserve extinction." That spirited paragraph was, rightly or wrongly, attributed to a female pen, and some of us on this side of the House rather expected a move in that direction.<lb/>
But I often wondered in the long March afternoons when we listened to Lord Rosebery, and in the long November nights when we listened to the noble Marquess opposite, what the Peeresses of the United Kingdom must have thought of the suicidal suggestions and the filicidal propositions of those two Whig leaders of the great Conservative Party. I hope the House will do me the justice to believe that I am not such a consummate ass as to pretend that in any way I understand women. In the course of a somewhat long life I never knew but one man who said he did. He told me he did, and he came to the most hopeless grief it is possible to conceive. Still I think I am justified in saying that, now that the crisis has come, the maternal instinct&#x2014;or "gorge," to use the pet phrase of Lord
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0247"/>
<col>485</col>
Rosebery&#x2014;must rise at the sight of their lords and masters in earnest making preparations, not only for self-slaughter, but for the slaughter of their sons and of their sons' sons. I can well imagine the feelings of the mother as she follows the agonised looks of her beloved son. "the honourable Isaac," as he is bound and helpless on the sacrificial altar, with one eye fixed on the sacrificial knife which has been sharpened by "the noble Abraham," and the other eye wandering about searching for a friendly old billygoat or a handy old ram caught in a thicket by its horns.<lb/>
In these circumstances the mothers would cry out, "A truce to this&#x2014;." I will not use Lord Milner's expression, but you know what I mean. And they would go on to say, "Is there no alternative to this massacre of the innocents, young and old; is there no golden bridge by the crossing of which we will be able to save not only our privileges, our coronets, our robes, but our faces as well?" Of course, my Lords, there is such a golden bridge. It is our Parliament Bill, to which we shall ask the House of Lords to give a Second Reading next week, and that bridge has been declared by a majority of your fellow country-men to be a safe and a sound bridge; and though you were not aware of it, by the acceptance of the first clause with regard to finance and the third clause with regard to five-year Parliaments instead of septennial Parliaments, you are safe over two-thirds of that bridge already. The Parliament Bill, at any rate, does not insinuate that four-fifths of your Lordships are, I will not say unworthy or unfit, but unable or unequal to the task of carrying on those great hereditary' duties to which most of you were born and the rest created.<lb/>
The country, my Lords, has spoken, and it has spoken with no uncertain voice. It has declared that the despotic, absolute, uncontrolled, and irresponsible power of your Lordships' House must go. It seems to me that a great deal of this debate has been beating the air. The real fight is about the powers of this House. That is what will have to be settled. You are fighting for despotic powers; we are fighting for your powers to be somewhat limited. I very respectfully ask the House&#x2014;What is the wisest thing for, you to do in this crisis?" Is it to sit down and cut not only your own throat, but the throats pf your sons and your sons' sons as well,
<col>486</col>
or boldly to face the inevitable&#x2014;to fight to the last and go down with your flag flying? If you want an Imperial example you will find it in General Botha and his gallant Boers at the end of the South African War and a national one in Wellington's desperate struggle against the reforms of 1832.<lb/>
I think it was Lord Morley who said that the proposals of this Bill were farcical. It is absolutely true. I hear from Liberal agents in all parts of the country that the country is laughing at your suggested concessions. If the country wants an elective Chamber of course it will have it, and you and I will have to go. But if you must perish why should you perish before your time? I believe there is a great deal more searching of hearts and wringing of hands and grinding of teeth among the supporters of the noble Marquess opposite than he apparently Lad any idea of. It seems to me that not only the noble Marquess but his followers are not altogether displeased with the result of the last election. In spite of the Rosebery Resolutions, in spite of the Lansdowne Resolutions, our sons are still on the steps of the Throne, our wives still in the Peeresses' Gallery; and in spite of his magnificent voluntary act of self-renunciation, in spite of the effort to bring about a hereditary holocaust, still we see with the greatest pleasure the noble Marquess restored to health, sitting in his old, old place, surrounded by his supporters and his friends&#x2014;himself the most perfect, up-to-date, ideal, British impersonification of "the <i>marquis malgr&#x00E9; lui."</i><lb/>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01076">Debate on the Motion for the Second Reading <i>resumed</i> (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01077"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have so far had few speeches upon this measure from the opposite side of the House, though they have included three from members of His Majesty's Government. I am sorry to see that they have adopted on the whole so unfriendly and uncompromising an attitude towards this Bill. I venture to say that their attitude does not fairly reflect public opinion outside this House, or even the opinion of the most influential organs of their own political Party. The fact is, I take it, that noble Lords opposite are swayed by two currents of opinion. In the first place, they are aware&#x2014;they must, I think, be aware&#x2014;that this is a sincere and courageous attempt on our part to grapple with this problem, that it marks a great advance on anything that has preceded it, and that, though it is susceptible of amendment, and I dare say of considerable amendment in its future stages in this House&#x2014;and for my own part I should hope that that amendment would come not from one side of the House only, but from both sides&#x2014;yet it does give a promise of a reconstituted Second Chamber which should possess authority, experience, Judgment, a representative character, and which would not unfairly attempt to hold the balance between opposite political Parties in the country. I take it that it was in this spirit that the noble Viscount opposite in his first speech ten days ago spoke of the measure as a bold and frank and helpful measure, and in his second speech as marking an enormous stride in advance.<lb/>
Then comes the opposing consideration, which affects so much of our action. The point of tactics has to be considered. Everything has to be subordinated, in the view of noble Lords opposite, to the tactical necessity of pushing their Parliament Bill without amendment through your Lordships' House, and therefore from this point of view it is necessary to pooh-pooh and ridicule our suggestions lest, perhaps, the country might find in them a reasonable and acceptable alternative method of dealing with the Constitutional problem. This, I think, was the spirit of the Lord Chancellor's speech yesterday&#x2014;
<col>490</col>
I did not, unfortunately, have the advantage of hearing that speech, and could only read it in the newspapers this morning&#x2014;in which he appeared to me, if I may respectfully say so, to combine, as his speeches so often do, the outward forms of courtesy and conciliation with an unbending spirit of defiance. It was also the point of view of the noble Viscount opposite, who in another part of the speech to which I have referred described our measure as inadequate and illusory, and also of Lord Carrington&#x2014;I am sorry not to see him in his place to-day, and I am still inure sorry not to have heard his observations yesterday&#x2014;who described the Bill by an adjective which he more than any other man has a right to apply&#x2014;namely, that our Bill is farcical.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, commenced his speech the other day by rebuking me for some language, as he said, of a too uncompromising character that I had employed in a speech elsewhere about the Parliament Bill, but I looked in vain in his speech for those accents of consideration and moderation and compromise in which he told me I was conspicuously lacking. My object this afternoon is to endeavour to answer some of the objections which have been advanced against our measure, and to enter into a defence of some of the provisions contained in the Bill. The first point taken by Lord Morley was that the House that we propose to constitute is too large&#x2014;a House, mind you, of somewhat less than 350 members is too large. When did the noble Viscount make that discovery? After all, we are members of a Chamber over 600 strong, and the chief reason why we are so numerous is because of the action of noble Lords opposite. Only during the last few years while they have been in office they have added something like forty or fifty to our ranks, and yet when we come here with a measure to reduce the total by nearly one-half they suddenly discover that that number is greatly in excess of what is required. I venture to think that that, at any rate, is a somewhat captious objection which recoils on the heads of those who use it.<lb/>
Then the noble Viscount went on to say that our scheme is lacking in stability and simplicity. He defined what he meant by stability when he added that it meant con-
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0250"/>
<col>491</col>
tinuity of purpose and policy. I thought the one complaint that had been made against us, which runs through every speech of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, has been that there is too much continuity of purpose and policy in the action of your Lordships' House, and that you are animated&#x2014;I do not agree with him, but I cannot pause to discuss it&#x2014;by a too undeviating spirit of hostility to Liberal measures. So, far as that charge is made, whether it be true or not, we have endeavoured to meet it in this Bill by providing machinery for the fair representation of both political Parties in your Lordships' House. I would suggest that what we want in a Second Chamber is not stability of policy and purpose so much as moral stability, stability of character, intellect, and judgment, and I see no reason why these qualities should be at all deficient or why they should not predominate in the reconstituted Chamber winch we venture to suggest.<lb/>
As regards simplicity, that is the one charge against the Bill that does not disturb me the least in the world. The chief merit, I think, of this proposed Second Chamber is that it is composite in character and structure. We are familiar with the taunt that in this House we are too much of one pattern and belong too exclusively to the wealthy and landowning classes. I do not think that the taunt is altogether undeserved, and, at any rate, it is a familiar one. For my own part, I would add that in the present trend of political action there is an increasing tendency even in the House of Commons to return men too much of one type. If that be so, the Second Chamber is the one place in which above all you should try to represent classes, interests, and points of view which are not necessarily represented in the First Chamber. It is on that basis that every successful nation has laid the foundations of its Second Chamber. There is no successful Second Chamber in the world that is not composite in structure and character. If it is a question of complexity, I would ask the question whether the House of Lords is altogether free from complexity now. I doubt if your Lordships realise the extraordinary complexity that exists in the composition of your Lordships' House. We have here at the present time hereditary Peers, many of whom have inherited their titles from a long line of ancestors, Peers who have themselves been ennobled, life Peers, <i>ex officio</i> Peers, Irish
<col>492</col>
Peers&#x2014;not, I am afraid, necessarily always connected with that country&#x2014;returned by the Irish Peerage for lifetime; Peers returned by the Scottish Peerage for the term of a Parliament; and you have in this House the most extraordinary freak&#x2014;the most amazing fly that ever crept into the amber of any legislative system in the world&#x2014;in the person of the Bishop of Sodor and Man, who may sit and speak in tins House, but may not vote. Compared with the complexity of your Lordships' House as it now exists, our plan, with its three broad categories of elected Peers, nominated Peers, and Peers from outside, may almost be described as simplicity itself. So anxious was the noble Viscount to throw discredit on our proposals that he even proceeded to ridicule our method for a fair representation of both Parties in the nominated section of the future House. I speak, of course, of the plan adopted from the familiar usage of the House of Commons for giving fair representation to all Parties in the House. The noble Viscount affected altogether to misunderstand our proposals, although I doubt if he really did. He pretended to believe that the Peers to be nominated under this provision would be selected by the Whips and would have to be submitted to your Lordships' House. Of course we mean nothing of the kind.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01079"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: That, of course, is even more absurd, and I am only too glad to correct the misapprehension under which the noble Viscount seems to labour. There are to be these 100 nominated Peers. How are we to constitute them with a fair regard to both Parties? Taking the present proportion of Parties in the House of Commons, the idea presented itself to us that out of the 100, 59 should be nominated to the Crown by the Prime Minister as representing his own Party, and 41 should be nominated by him after consultation with the Leader of our Party. It does not matter to us in the least how the Prime Minister chooses his 59. We do not know who are the members of his Party, who are the sections that acknowledge his leadership. That is in dispute every day in the House of Commons; that is a domestic matter in which we do not venture to enter. He may send
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0251"/>
<col>493</col>
to this House what 59 he likes. All we ask is that he will send 59, and that, after consultation with the Leader of our Party, he should give us 41. I venture to say that the plan is quite simple, intelligible and fair, and that it is not open to the criticism, the mistaken criticism as I think, which the noble Viscount passed upon it.<lb/>
The noble Viscount also spoke in very unfavourable terms about our suggestion for the election of Peers by groups of members of Parliament. This plan was designed exclusively to secure the fair representation of both Parties at the first election of these 100 Peers. As such, I venture to say it was a most democratic proposal which might have been expected to meet with the favour of the noble Viscount. And yet he could find nothing better to say for it than that he could not conceive any benefit which could not be better obtained by election by the House of Commons as a whole. Surely the noble Viscount quite misunderstood the nature of the proposal. There are, as we think, three invincible objections to the election of this portion of the reformed House of Lords by the House of Commons as a whole. In the first place, you would destroy all chance of that local representation to which we look forward as one of the principal merits of the scheme. Under it we should hope that Yorkshire, or a Riding of Yorkshire, Lancashire, London, or any other area, would return a man known to the locality, known to the members of Parliament representing it, and reflecting the best interests and opinions of that part of the country. If you have election by the House of Commons as a whole such a chance is greatly diminished, if it does not altogether disappear.<lb/>
In the next place I think all noble Lords will agree that one of the great faults of our present House of Commons is that, under our representative system as it now is, with the extraordinarily unequal distribution of seats, and with the principle of the bare majority operating everywhere, there are vast minorities in different parts of the United Kingdom which are wholly unrepresented. If you had election of your Lordships' House or a portion of it by the House of Commons obviously those injustices and inequalities would be reproduced. But if, on the other hand, you have election in smaller areas by electoral colleges, with the single transferable vote,
<col>494</col>
those defects will be to a large extent rectified. The third objection, which I think was anticipated by the noble Viscount himself, is that if you had election of these 120 Peers by the whole House of Commons&#x2014;quite apart from the sentimental objections to such a plan, which I think are considerable and would be very much felt by your Lordships' House&#x2014;you would give rise to the most gigantic system of wirepulling, caucusing, manipulation and clandestine intrigue that has ever been known in this or in any other country possessing representative institutions. I hope, therefore, that, whatever may be your view of our proposal, nothing more will be heard of the idea of electing that portion of your Lordships' House by the House of Commons as a whole.<lb/>
I pass on now to say a few words on the reasons which led us to propose the particular form of election that appears in the Bill. I am aware that there are some members of your Lordships' House who would prefer a system of direct election. Of course, we considered that plan. We considered the idea of taking the present electors and either grouping them in larger constituencies or, possibly, of creating a new franchise, based either on property or education, or age, such as is sometimes adopted in foreign countries for the election of their Second Chambers. The second alternative we ruled out at once, because this is not the time in the world's history in which to propose, in this country at any rate, the creation of any new fancy franchise resting on property or anything else. As regards election by the existing electors in larger constituencies, may I venture to place before your Lordships the reasons which led us to reject that plan? They are reasons pertinent not only to this discussion, but to the plan which it is quite likely the Government may, at a future date, have in view themselves. If you have the same electors voting for the House of Lords or a portion of the House of Lords as vote for the House of Commons, you are bound to have a House of Lords, or a section of the House of Lords, which is, to a large extent, a reflex of the House of Commons and which will claim a sanction and an authority co-ordinate with it. We want neither. We want in our Second Chamber to have different interests and classes and points of view represented. We want, above all, to have minorities represented. I think every one on this side of the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0252"/>
<col>495</col>
House is agreed&#x2014;I do not enter into the disputed question of the degree of subordination of this House to the other House and of predominance that ought to be claimed by the House of Commons&#x2014;that we do not want a Second Chamber co-equal and co-ordinate with the House of Commons, claiming an authority equal to it and certain, to the degree to which it insists on that claim, to provoke collision and conflict with the other House.<lb/>
There is another objection to direct election by constituencies more potent still. Under this scheme, as you will readily realise, we must have very large constituencies. If you are to return one Peer for every 375,000 people, and if no constituency is to return less than three Peers while some might return six, nine, or twelve, clearly you would have very large areas, amounting at the smallest to over a million persons&#x2014;I am speaking of population and not of voters&#x2014;and in the largest to many millions. It seems to be supposed that if you had election of Peers by a popular electorate in areas of tins size, you might dispense with all the machinery and all the paraphernalia of a General Election. I venture to say that any such idea is an absolute illusion. Democracy, when it has acquired rights, is apt to insist on them. It does not readily give them up, and you may be certain that the electors, accustomed to all the forms of a General Election for members of the Lower House, would equally, if there were election of Peers to this House, insist on having the candidate's address, hearing his views, and having, in short, all the machinery, in many cases the abominable machinery, of a General Election. I venture to say that that would be a public calamity. Elections in this country are too much with us late and soon. We are overridden with elections in every form, and one of the main reasons against multiplying them is not that people grow keener or more enthusiastic as elections increase, but that they tend to become apathetic, and in the long run you might develop a regrettable spirit of lethargy towards elections in this country. Furthermore, you do not want your Second Chamber to be born in the throes of political excitement or amid the hurricane of the platform. There is yet another consideration. Are you quite certain that the men whom you want to become members of your Second Chamber, many of them men of
<col>496</col>
experience, authority, and some age, would stand the racket, the turmoil, and the expense of an election held under those conditions? I believe you would lose some of the most valuable recruits whom you might expect to gain for your Lordships' House. It was for these reasons that we decided against direct election, and I venture to say that if His Majesty's Government at a later date propose a Bill resting on direct election, all the dangers which I have forecast will have to be considered, and by all those defects if they adopt that plan, will their scheme be overwhelmed.<lb/>
The question may be put&#x2014;"That is all very well, but why do you select members of Parliament as the electors?" The answer is simple. If we could not go to democracy direct, then, we said, let us go to that which is next door to democracy. We considered whether the electoral colleges might consist of delegates from the county councils and county borough councils. There are, I know, many members of your Lordships' House who would bitterly regret that upon the face of municipal politics there should be laid the trail, to any greater extent than is already the case, of Party politics, and we felt, too, that any such body would be open to the charge of being too Conservative in character. The same consideration applied to the suggestion that you might compose your electoral colleges of persons holding <i>ex officio</i> positions in different parts of the country. They would be, on the whole, overwhelmingly Conservative. It applied, too, in a greater or less degree to the scheme which obtains in France, under which the electoral college consists of Deputies combined with representatives from the county associations. Here again we felt that, if we proposed that, you might say that we were trying to dilute the pure springs of democracy by introducing a necessarily Conservative element, and, therefore, we fell back upon the system of election, at any rate for the first time, by members of the House of Commons. It is a machinery which is simple, it is in existence, it is inexpensive, and it is popular. Whether it should remain, supposing our Bill passed into law, the permanent machinery is, I think, a matter quite open to question. I think myself it is by no means certain that it is the machinery which would be employed in perpetuity, and I hold most strongly the view that, if a scheme of this kind came into
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0253"/>
<col>497</col>
operation, the question of who in the electoral districts should be the electing body is one that ought to be decided by mutual consultation and, if possible, agreement, between the two Parties, and should not be foisted by one Party upon the other.<lb/>
I turn to another question about which not much has been said in this debate, but upon which I think something ought to be said. That is the question, Why have we retained the hereditary element for a proportion of the new House? The noble Viscount complained that we are destroying the ancient House of Lords, and yet the one link of connection that we propose to retain with the old House of Lords meets with nothing but ridicule and scorn from him. May I recall to him a famous passage in the conversations of the Emperor Napoleon at St. Helena? Speaking of the Emperor Alexander of Russia, he said&#x2014;
<quote>"What discussions have I not had with him&#x0021; He maintained that hereditary right was an abuse, and I had to expend all my eloquence and logic during a full hour&#x2014;</quote>
Fancy a full hour of the Emperor Napoleon in your Lordships' House&#x2014;
<quote>"to prove that hereditary right maintains the repose and happiness of nations."</quote>
I am sure the noble Viscount would be the last to scoff at the Emperor Napoleon. I sometimes think I detect certain resemblances between them. The Emperor Napoleon was not a Conservative or reactionary force; he was what we should call nowadays an advanced politician. He always claimed to speak in the name of democracy, and yet he had a somewhat despotic temper in the background. I think some little weight might be attached to the views of the Emperor Napoleon on the question of hereditary rights.<lb/>
The reasons why we propose to retain a portion of the hereditary element are these: In the first place, we regard it as a valuable and useful link with the past. So far as I know, the country does not desire an altogether new House of Lords. What it wants is a House of Lords that shall be free from the blemishes of the existing Chamber&#x2014;namely, that we are apt to be too much of one way of thinking and that we are insufficiently in touch with the democracy. We propose to correct those defects, but we also provide at the same time that the reformed House shall be clothed with some portion at any rate of the traditional privilege
<col>498</col>
lege which your Lordships have inherited from a long time ago, and which, let me add, are the best guarantee for the independence of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
Another point of view which strongly appeals to me is that the hereditary portion of the reconstituted House will in reality be a delegation from the existing hereditary Peerage. I have always thought that your Lordships, when surrendering rights which in many cases you have inherited, not merely for generations, but for centuries, have some claim to be considered, some claim to carry on under a system of delegation or otherwise the proud privileges of which you have hitherto been the exclusive owners. It is desirable, again, to retain the hereditary element in the interests of an institution even more august and vital to the stability of the country than the House of Lords itself. So long as you acknowledge the value of the hereditary principle in the case of the Crown, I have never been able to understand why you should regard it as absurd in its partial application to one branch of the Legislature. But in the case of the Legislature you can fortify the operation of the hereditary principle by safeguards and guarantees which you cannot use, and which fortunately it is not necessary to use, in the case of the Crown. You cannot say that the Heir to the Throne shall only succeed by the choice of the other members of his family or because he has rendered some form of public service, but you can say it of the Peerage, and we have said that hereditary right should only come into operation if it is supplemented by choice and if it rests upon the basis of some recognised service to the State.<lb/>
The noble Viscount asked, "Why fetter the choice of Peers? Why not let them choose the 100 whom they best like themselves?" and his remark was greeted with some cheers on this side of the House. I can quite understand that it would be a popular method, and it is a point we may have to consider in Committee. But the reasons we propose the system set out in the Bill are these. In the first place, it would be of decided value to noble Lords to have some form of guidance in making their choice. It will obviously be easier to elect 100 men out of 300 than to elect 100 out of 700, and if that be so in the first instance how much easier when the triennial elections come round and when you would otherwise be called upon to elect twenty-
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0254"/>
<col>499</col>
five out of 700. I tremble to think of the manipulations which might then be resorted to, and what strange results might in some cases ensue. In the next place, it would commend itself to public opinion that a man should be a legislator not merely because he was the son of his father, but because, being the son of his father, he had been chosen by his brother Peers in consequence of having rendered some service to the country or the State. The third consideration is that it will act as a great stimulus to the continuance of public service by the hereditary Peerage. If a hereditary Peer who does not happen to have had the chance to be in the Army, the Navy, the Diplomatic service, or any other of the qualifying professions knows that by rendering active service in the part of the country in which he lives he can qualify for election to the House of Lords, will it not be a great incentive to him to public duty? I venture to attach great value to this. The greatest danger that can befall any aristocracy is that it should be divorced from the public life of the State; that it should lead a life of ease or luxury or wealth, or art or culture, or whatever you like, outside the main currents of the national life. That is the rock on which have struck and foundered many of the proudest and fairest aristocracies in the world. That has not so far been our fate. We have had the glory&#x2014;I speak, I hope, without undue pride&#x2014;of having an aristocracy which, without desire of reward or chance of payment, has always been willing to render service to the State. That is a priceless asset in our national life. Whatever you do, pray do not give it up. Pray retain in this country the traditional sense of public duty as connected with birth and rank. It is of enormous advantage to the country to know that it can rely on the gratuitous services of those who have the tradition born in them and carried down with them, and it is of enormous advantage to the aristocracy itself to recognise these duties and not to rest, in the familiar words, "idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean."<lb/>
I pass on for a moment to consider the question, upon which some stress has very naturally been laid, of the sacrifices which your Lordships are called upon to accept. I should be the last to underrate them; they are considerable and genuine. But they apply equally to all members of your Lordships' House. There is to be no privileged class in the future. No man,
<col>500</col>
however distinguished, will get into your Lordships' House by the mere virtue of his qualifications alone. The only Peers who would become Lords of Parliament without passing through the ordeal I have described would be the most rev. Primates, whom I am sure we should all be glad to admit, and the Law Lords required for purposes which I agree it would be of great advantage if we could dissociate from the ordinary political activities of this House.<lb/>
I have heard it said that there is some feeling on the part of the Irish and Scottish Peers that they will be badly off under the proposed changes. The Irish Peers are 175 in number, and of these 81 already have seats arising from other Peerages in your Lordships' House. The total number elect 28 Peers for life. It is quite certain that they would not elect so many in a reformed and reduced House, but I suspect that, with the aid of the single transferable vote, they will be able to elect a proportion at least as great as any other section. And whether they do so or not, let me point out what they gain. They will not in the future vote merely for a vacancy in the Irish Peerage as from time to time it occurs; they will vote for the whole 100 members of your Lordships House when first they are elected by the Peerage, and they will vote at every recurring election. In addition they will be able to stand for your Lordships' House for any constituency in any part of the United Kingdom, and those who are not chosen to sit in this House will have open to them what is not open now&#x2014;namely, the power to stand as candidates for the House of Commons for any constituency in any part of the United Kingdom. Those will be the gains of the Irish Peers.<lb/>
Take the case of the Scottish Peers. At present they are 86 in number, of whom 52 have seats in your Lordships' House conferred by other Peerages; they elect 16 members for the duration of a Parliament. Under the present system a Scottish representative Peer is merely elected for a Parliament, and, as we know, he is not necessarily re-elected; under the new system he will be elected for twelve years. As it is now, if he is not elected he has no other chance of entering your Lordships' House; under this scheme he could stand for any constituency in any part of Scotland or the United Kingdom. Under the present system he is absolutely debarred from entering the House of
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0255"/>
<col>501</col>
Commons; under this Bill he could stand for any constituency for the House of Commons. Taking the Peers generally, under our Bill a Peer is allowed to resign his Peerage, and to divest himself of his legislative functions if he so desires. He is not permitted to do so now. If a man is the eldest son of a Peer, and has a seat in the House of Commons, he is excluded from that House on his accession to the Peerage; under our Bill he could remain in the House of Commons. At present no Peer except an Irish Peer may enter the House of Commons; under our Bill, if he is not elected to this House, or if he does not desire to serve in this House, he can stand for the House of Commons. Then apart from all that, we maintain his active interest in this branch of the Legislature by giving him the opportunity of exercising effective influence in the elections to this House in almost every year that passes.<lb/>
I hope I have said enough to show that though the sacrifices may be great, the compensations are not small. And remember this, that whatever consequences your Lordships may think this Bill may be fraught with, you will receive very short shrift from noble Lords opposite. The only hint we have had of their scheme is of a House of Lords consisting perhaps of from 100 to 150 members resting entirely on direct election by constituencies. I wonder how many, out of the 700 hereditary Peers, would be willing to stand, or, if willing to stand, would succeed in being elected under such a system. It comes to this, then, that whereas under this Bill there are many avenues of entry into this House, noble Lords opposite would present us with but one very narrow door, having many bolts and bars across it, through which alone ingress would be obtained to this Chamber.<lb/>
The best test, perhaps, of any scheme for a Legislative Chamber is to imagine it in operation. Now, supposing this Bill were passed into law, what would the House of Lords be like? There would be 100 Peers elected by your Lordships who would represent the picked men of this House. I suspect that they would be more or less identical with the 100 Peers upon whom I am told that at present the burden of debate and of Committee work almost exclusively devolves. Then you would have the nominated Peers, and in that
<col>502</col>
category there would be room, first, for those who had not been fortunate in election; and, secondly, for those classes about whom a good deal has been said and whom we should like to see in this House&#x2014;the heads of great religious organisations outside the Church of England, the great bankers and financiers, and also those representatives of science, art, and literature, who add so much lustre to our proceedings even if they do not take a very active part in our debates. Then you would have the 120 elected Peers who would represent the free choice of the democracy, and who might include anybody from a great territorial magnate to a schoolmaster or a working man. I cannot help thinking that, under our scheme, just as now in the provinces you find municipalities anxious to enlist in their service as mayors and Lord Mayors the most prominent and patriotic citizens in their neighbourhood, so it would be the great desire of Lancashire and Yorkshire, for instance, to return, under this section, its most powerful, useful, and munificent citizens to this House.<lb/>
Lord Morley says that a House so reconstituted will be strongly partisan and based on Party machinery. I cannot see that. The noble Viscount tried to make out that such a House would give the Unionist Party a majority of 40 or 50 and Lord Sheffield last night tried to make out a majority of 50 or 60 for them. I wholly fail to understand that method of reasoning. I think, if I had time, that I could demonstrate its fallacy. But let me suppose that the reconstituted House of Lords was tainted with strong political partisanship, and that there was a Unionist majority of 40, 50, or 60 in it. How do we meet that? Surely the noble Viscount has forgotten that provision, which is the corollary of this Bill&#x2014;namely, the resort, when there is an irreconcilable conflict between the two Chambers, to Joint Sessions. That is vital. In the present House of Commons, with its 670 members and its Radical majority of 120, the figures are: Liberals, 395; Conservatives, 275. In our new House of Lords of 350 members let us give the Unionist Party a majority of 40, which the noble Viscount, I think, unfairly predicates. That would be 155 Liberals and 195 Conservatives. But in a Joint Session you would have the Liberal Party 550, the Conservative Party, 470&#x2014;or a Radical majority of 80. Is not that enough
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0256"/>
<col>503</col>
for noble Lords opposite? Surely you do not want more. Surely that is not loading the dice against you. Then let us suppose that instead of the two Houses meeting <i>in plenum</i> because of the unwieldy character of such a body, you were to take two-thirds of the House of Commons constituted as it is now and two-thirds of the House of Lords as we propose to constitute it. The figures would then work out at a Radical majority of 54. I do not think you need be very much afraid about your legislation under those circumstances.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01081"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I was supposing that proportion in order to meet the difficulty of the two Houses sitting <i>in plenum,</i> because there is no chamber except Westminster Hall which would be big enough to hold them. Taking two-thirds of the House of Commons as now constituted and two-thirds of the House of Lords as we propose to constitute it your majority would work out at 54.<lb/>
My Lords, I have dared to give a little sketch of our scheme in operation. Let me now ask this House for a moment to imagine the Government's scheme in operation. We will suppose you pass your Parliament Bill without amendment, and that you leave, as you propose to leave, the unreformed House of Lords to carry on for a time the functions of a Second Chamber. What would happen? It is inevitable that there will be a great burst of legislative activity in the first few years of a Radical Parliament, that measures will be sent up here red hot from the furnace of democracy, and I think it is certain also that measures as they come here will in those circumstances be less cautious, less moderate, and less discriminating than they have been in the past. Your Lordships will know that you are powerless in the long run to reject those Bills, that you can only tentatively and hypothetically revise them, and that whatever you do you are certain to be abused. Do you think that will be an encouragement to this House to approach your. Bills in an impartial spirit, or that we shall have more of that temper of compromise and conciliation to which the noble Viscount himself sometimes appeals? Is it not certain that by your tyrannical measures, as we think them, you will breed an
<col>504</col>
obdurate and reactionary spirit in the House of Lords as it then exists? Is it not certain that your Lordships' House will he a greater bar to Radical legislation, within its powers, in the future than it has been in the past? The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack seems to regard the history of the House of Lords as animated by an unswerving hostility to Liberal measures. That has not been my experience. Since I have been in this House I have only known one Liberal Bill rejected, or rather referred to the people, by your Lordships, and that was the Finance Bill. My experience leads me to think that on the whole this House is most anxious to approach Liberal measures in an accommodating spirit, and in nine cases out of ten your Lordships are willing to pass measures proposed by a Liberal Government with which noble Lords do not happen personally to be in agreement. But under the Parliament Bill there is much more likelihood of having a fight <i>d l'outrance</i> in the future. I doubt whether the spirit of conciliation will prevail. I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that a contrast can fairly be drawn between the smooth working, as I think it would be, of a reconstituted Chamber such as I have sketched, with the machinery of Joint Sessions behind it, and the procedure that you with your Parliament Bill and an unreformed House of Lords propose to set up.<lb/>
We have endeavoured to state in this Bill our views on the reconstitution of the House of Lords. What are your views about a reformed Second Chamber? This debate has been going on for three days, and we have had scarcely an inkling as to what is in your minds. Hardly a corner of the curtain has been raised. I see opposite to me Lord Haldane, who in one of the debates in the House of Commons on this subject used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"The Government policy is a single policy. It is in my view not the Veto Resolution, and then, as a separate part, reconstruction of the Second Chamber. It is both."</quote>
I am entitled to believe that the noble Viscount spoke for his colleagues on that occasion. Then if your policy is a single policy why do you cut it in two? Why do you give us one part of it alone and shroud the other in absolute obscurity and decline to answer any questions about it? When we produce our reforms for what they are worth you cover them with
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0257"/>
<col>505</col>
ridicule, you abound in negative criticism. But let that pass. It is part of the Party business. What is your plan? You tell us that you are moderate men, that you are Second Chamber men, House of Lords men. Yet, you are going to introduce for a term of years at any rate a form of Constitution which exists in no sane nation in the world. You tell us you are double-Chamber men, yet you are going to set up for a period a single-Chamber Constitution, constructed, as far as we can see, to carry out Party objects alone. You tell us you are House of Lords men, and you propose to reduce the House of Lords to a pitiable state of impotence.<lb/>
When we ask you how long this fatal interregnum is going to last you say, "We hope to introduce a Bill in the present Parliament if time permits." It is not a question of time permitting; there are other and more important agents than time. The question is whether the different sections of your Party will permit; and if they permit you to introduce the Bill into the House of Commons will they allow you to carry it through that House. And if you carry it through the House of Commons are you so certain of carrying it through this House? When we ask you what you have in your mind you are absolutely dumb. For my part, I doubt very much whether you have a scheme or whether you are likely to get one. If you do get a scheme I should be very reluctant to stake anything on the probability of your measure in a reasonable period becoming the law of the land. The country, I believe, desires a reformed Second Chamber. I am confident that at a public meeting anywhere, except perhaps a Socialist meeting, if you were to ask the question, "Are you in favour of a reformed House of Lords?" by a majority of nine to one you would get an answer in the affirmative. On the one side then we have a Party with a plan which at any rate is courageous, ingenious, and not ungenerous in its recognition of the claims of democracy and the rights of both political Parties in the State. On the other side there is nothing, so far as the reform of the House of Lords is concerned, but a blank, and when we ask you to fill that blank up your only language is that of ridicule as applied to our Bill, of menace as referring to your own intentions, and your only desire, instead of reconstructing, appears to us to be the desire to destroy.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01082"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just addressed us has spoken in the vigorous and forcible fashion to which we are well accustomed, and which we all admire, but he has introduced into his speech a combative spirit which I think is a little inexpedient on this occasion. I say this as one who would fain agree with him and go with him a considerable way in the work he proposes to undertake. But the combative character of his address has excited within me some feelings of opposition rather injurious to that spirit of conciliation which I would fain cherish. The effective part of the noble Lord's speech was devoted to a criticism of the speech of my noble friend the Leader of the House, which criticism appeared to me to be of a very unfortunate and incorrect character. I have heard the speech of my noble friend described as one unexpectedly friendly to the Bill. It certainty did not shut the door to its consideration, and the suggestion that the Bill was treated in a spirit of ridicule and contempt is a suggestion which my memory at all events does not confirm. I should have said that my noble friend Lord Morley made as serious and as detailed an examination of the Bill now before your Lordships as was possible in the circumstances, and the speech which we have just heard from the noble Lord opposite seems to me to show that he has not sufficiently appreciated the position in which my noble friend stands; and if the noble Lord is correct in his final surmise that the Government themselves have not as yet conceived a scheme for dealing with this question, he is surely most injudicious in pressing them as enemies instead of attempting to conciliate them as friends. The noble Lord added another and very serious item of controversy when he tacked on as an inseparable part of his scheme the suggestion of Joint Sessions for the settlement of differences between the two Houses. That is a suggestion which may well have been contemplated by the authors of this Bill and one that cannot he ignored, but to make it an inseparable part of the Bill, a thing to which the Bill leads up so that if it is dropped the Bill becomes worthless, does in my opinion great injury to the Bill itself.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01086"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: When I learnt Euclid&#x2014;a long while ago&#x2014;a corollary was a deduction which followed inevitably from the premises, and if the suggestion of Joint Sessions is a corollary to the Bill it follows inevitably from the Bill. I thought also the noble Lord said it was a vital part of the scheme. I conceive that to be unfortunate. I want the scheme of the Bill discussed on its own merits, because I think it is quite worthy of consideration by itself even if the Parliament Bill were passed unaltered and untouched. I regretted to hear my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack state last night that the consideration of this Bill would involve an inevitable surrender of the attitude taken up by the Government. It involves no surrender whatever. The reform of this House is an inseparable part of the programme of the Government and that being so it is no surrender on the part of the Government to discuss and consider this Bill, and possibly to regard it as a measure which might in some form or another after some changes and modifications be made part of a scheme of their own in the future.<lb/>
If the Parliament Bill were passed by the House of Lords as it stands without any qualification it would, in my judgment, be more necessary than ever to consider the passing of some such Bill as this conceived in the same spirit, because if the Parliament Bill is passed without alteration by this House your Lordships' power would then become a purely moral power, a power dependent on the weight which the speeches and arguments of your Lordships had upon the judgment of the people. It is imperative in those circumstances that this House should stand as strong as possible in the judgment of the country, so that its verdict should go to the country not with a cloud of suspicion but with some flavour of recommendation. The members of this House should be such that their arguments and speeches would always command
<col>508</col>
attention, and their judgments and conclusions be things that would have to be weighed and considered, not put lightly aside as the prejudiced judgment of a large number of legislators the greater part of whom have no title to assist in legislation except the accident of birth. That is what is said now, justly or unjustly, and that has to be got rid of. The noble Duke who spoke last evening in a very interesting and impressive manner, if I may be allowed to say so, referred to that point; and to remedy that is the object of the Bill before us.<lb/>
The first thing to be done if the Parliament Bill is passed, will be to improve this House so as to increase its authority in the nation. There is another thing to be done which I shall not scruple to avow to your Lordships. If the Parliament Bill is passed in its naked and simple form, the authority of the other House will stand in a new degree paramount as the expression of the mind and the will of the nation. That is the title under which authority is claimed by the other House. It is the representative Assembly of the people, and the mind, the determination, the will, and the desire of the nation are to be found there. But that claim will, I think, have to be bettered very much if the Parliament Bill were to stand as it is and the House of Commons also were left without reform. If the House of Commons is to be the final expression of the will of the nation, it must justify its claim, or your Lordships' House will have a claim of reference over the head of the House of Commons to the people at large. To that many of us feel great aversion, but it will, nevertheless, be forced upon us unless the House of Commons itself is so reformed that to refer a Bill from that House to the nation would be absurd, because the House of Commons would contain within it a real representation of the people. It does not do so now, except more or less by accident.<lb/>
Let me put in a caution here. The House of Commons, according to the usual criteria recognised by all parties and by none less clearly than the Conservative leaders in the past, is at present entitled to say that the Parliament Bill has received the approval of the country. Although at the December election other questions were involved, the Parliament Bill was the paramount question. There was no concealment of detail and no lack of information such as might be claimed in respect of
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0259"/>
<col>509</col>
the previous election. The Parliament Bill was before the people, and the people voted for it being well warned of everything that was involved by their vote.<lb/>
I pass on to an examination more in detail of the Bill now before us. In the first place it is a composite Bill. I have always thought that a composite Bill was inevitable in any scheme for the reform of this House. It seemed to me that when supporting that proposition the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, was almost arguing against an invisible enemy. I am not aware of any practical person, any one of old or long standing in Parliament, who has thought that this House could be suddenly swept clear of all its members and a new body of members brought into it with no continuity, no connection between the new body and the old. There must be some tradition if only to keep up the forms of the House and to preserve continuity and maintain a little of the old spirit. To my mind it would be insulting to His Majesty's Ministers to suppose that they have ever seriously conceived, either as a body or as individuals, the replacement of this House by a House entirely new in its constitution.<lb/>
I recognise that the House must be composite, and the practical questions are&#x2014;What number of the present House shall appear in the new one, and how shall that number obtain its title? I congratulate the authors of this Bill on having reduced the representatives of the existing House to 100. My noble friend the Leader of the House expressed his satisfaction, in the speech he made early in the week, at that reduction. That is one of the great improvements in this Bill upon any scheme which has been brought forward before for the reform of this House. It has reduced the representation of this House to 100, but it is no use blinking the fact that that 100 gives a very considerable majority to the other side. The noble Lord who has just sat down professed not to understand how that could be. The 100 are to be chosen according to the principle of proportional representation; they are to be divided according to the representation of Parties in the House as it stands, and it is not reasonable to say that every noble Lord who takes part in the ordinary business of the House will find a place in the 100. The noble Lords on this side who take part in the business of the House form too large a proportion for their share of the 100 to cover them. My noble friend Lord
<col>510</col>
Sheffield last night made a genuine estimate, in which he suggested that out of the 100 there would be given a majority of 73 or 74 to the opposite side of the Home&#x2014;a tremendous majority to start with, and a thing that must not be lost sight of in the consideration of the merits or demerits of this Bill as a whole.<lb/>
Then my noble friend the Leader of the House pertinently asked why you do not allow the 100 to be selected from all the members of the House. Why restrict it to those who possess certain qualifications, qualifications which run down to the Lord Mayor of a town, a captain in the Navy, a colonel on the active list in the Army, &amp;c.? Lord Curzon addressed himself to answering that question, and I confess I thought not with any great effect. He admitted it was a question that would have to be considered in Committee if we ever got into Committee on this Bill, but it is an illustration of the temper which has run through the construction of this Bill and which I find in other parts&#x2014;a tendency to put constraint on the free acts of persons where no constraint is necessary. Why in the election of the 100 constrain members of this House to choose from those who possess these qualifications? They naturally would choose largely men possessing such qualifications, but there would be others left out who, compared with some of those in that list, had much greater claims to a position in this House. It is said that insisting upon these qualifications will make Peers zealous in the future as they have been in the past to distinguish themselves in the public service. But, my Lords, may I ask is their public spirit in the future to be considered so poor that without this inducement they will fail to make themselves conspicuous in the service of their country? I am afraid the drawing of this hard-and-fast line is an exemplification of a tendency to compel people to run along particular paths instead of leaving them to choose their own way of getting to the desired destination. I venture to think that the real operation of the selection of this 100 would be that the men who now perform public service in this House would largely find themselves in the 100. All the occupants of the Front Benches would, of course, be there, and it is absolutely necessary that there should be some means of getting the leaders without much trouble brought back into the House in order to bring their experience and weight and knowledge and authority to
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0260"/>
<col>511</col>
assist in the guidance of its new deliberations. The Peers on this side compared with the other side would get quite an insignificant number, but the leaders at any rate would come in, and on the other side almost all who have done service in the House would find themselves readily returned within the 100.<lb/>
Now I pass to the 120 members elected by the House of Commons. My noble friend Lord Morley asked, "Why not allow the members of the House of Commons to elect those 120 directly? Why resort to all this machinery of instituting Commissioners and setting up colleges and having local elections?" That, I think, is another example of the tendency to place unnecessary and useless and even pernicious restraint on the free action of those who are to be entrusted with the election of Members to this House. The noble Lord gave three reasons for that restraint. In the first place, he said it was most desirable that the elected members should in the majority of cases come here with the connections and traditions of localities, should be persons known in their own neighbourhood who could bring a knowledge of local conditions and local circumstances to the general conduct of business here. Would not these local influences always exercise their weight even if you did not compel the electors to come together in this arbitrary fashion in colleges? Suppose Wales happened to be a college, do you think the Members for Welsh constituencies electing persons to sit in this House would not have regard to local feeling? The Welsh Members are a part of the whole body of the House of Commons, and if they desired to give expression to their local life and to send a local representative here, nothing would be easier. So also with respect to Yorkshire, or Lancashire, or the Home Counties, or Scotland. Members would be able to elect Lords possessing local knowledge if they cared to do so; if they did not care to do so because of some other more important reason, why should they not be allowed discretion as to whom they should choose? You may be perfectly sure that local connections, attachment and character would have greater weight under the free system than under your restrained system.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord opposite, rather contradicting himself, said that in this way you would secure the representation of minorities. He appeared to have read
<col>512</col>
the speech of my noble friend Lord Sheffield, delivered last night, but he must have passed over that part of it which showed that the institution of electoral colleges would be, if not fatal, at all events very injurious to the representation of minorities. In regard to the question of the election of representatives of Labour, for example, there would not be Labour Members in sufficient number in any of the electoral colleges to secure the election of a Labour Member to the House of Lords, although if the Labour Members as a whole in the House of Commons voted together they would secure a fair share of representation. But scattered throughout the colleges which you propose to create they would become impotent and powerless. Again, Wales is represented in the House of Commons by a homogeneous body, or very nearly so&#x2014;it was in the Parliament of 1906 completely homogeneous&#x2014;and if Wales were one electoral college there would be no possibility of securing a representative of the minority, because the minority electors do not exist. You must have a quota of electors sufficient to return a minority Lord, and where the minority does not exist in the quota you would not get the election of minority representatives. So that the cutting up of the country into colleges would be almost a destruction of that bringing together of minorities which is our aim.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord said that if the elected representatives were to be chosen by the House of Commons you would have endless man&#x0153;uvring, bargaining, exchanges of votes, something given here in return for something given there, and electioneering of a very blatant and extravagant kind. The picture was rather fanciful, but I admit there would be a good deal of electioneering, calculation, and consideration in the arrangement of minority representation. But you will not get rid of that by the process of electoral colleges; you will not get rid of influences being brought to bear which had better not be mentioned; in fact, you will probably get a greater deficiency of pure political action in the choice of members through your colleges than you would secure if you threw the burden on the House of Commons itself. I can conceive a different reason from those advanced by the noble Lord for dividing up the House of Commons into portions for the purpose of electing members of this House. If 120 members of this House
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0261"/>
<col>513</col>
were to be elected by the 670 members of the House of Commons the process would be elaborate and would involve the expression of so many alternative choices that it might lead to some difficulty in arranging the machinery of the elections. The proportion of 670 electors to the 120 to be elected is so inconsiderable that the process of election would be one involving some hazards of chance and difficulties of manipulation. I can conceive that the difficulty might easily and well be obviated by electing the 120 members, not at one stroke, but in batches of 30 or 40&#x2013;30 if there are four categories, so that the House of Commons should elect 30 to sit for twelve years, 30 to sit for nine years, 30 to sit for six years, and 30 to sit for three yours. Under those four successive elections you would get an easy machinery and secure due representation in the final House. That is one reason for reducing the number.<lb/>
On this point I have a suggestion to make which has not been made before, and which I think deserves attention. I would propose in the interests of this Bill that, if you are going to have the election of 120 members of this House by members of the House of Commons, instead of electing them for twelve years, one-fourth going out every three years, the election should be for three Parliaments, and that one-third of the number should go out with every Parliament. I think it is desirable that there should be a connection between the Parliamentary life here and the Parliamentary life in the House of Commons, and the arrangement I suggest would obviate an inconvenience which would follow from the scheme as contained in the Bill. Suppose the scheme contained in this Bill had been in operation in past years, what would have been the probable situation of the present Government, or rather of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Government, when they came into power? If there had been an election of one-third in the year 1896, there would have been one-third elected under Unionist auspices; in 1899 there would have been one-third also elected under. Unionist auspices; in 1902 there would have been a third third elected under Unionist auspices, and in 1905 a fourth third elected under Unionist auspices. When Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman came into power at the end of 1905 he would have had all four sections of elected members of this
<col>514</col>
House elected under hostile conditions, and they would have been immovable during the years 1906 and 1907. Not until the year 1908 would a third have come on for election under Liberal auspices. That would have been an extremely inconvenient situation. You would have had a powerful Ministry at the head of a victorious House of Commons, abundant in its majority, met by a solid phalanx here elected by the Unionists at four successive elections. Now, if you had had one election in each Parliament you would have had the election by the House of Commons in 1906 of a third of the members here, and Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman would at once have obtained the support of that third. The situation I have described is one which would not infrequently arise if you adhere to the twelve years term with a quarter going out every third year. An incoming Government would often find itself in an embarrassing position, whereas if you allowed an incoming Government to be reinforced by the election of one-third of the Lords of Parliament it would at once receive a help which would enable it to carry its measures through this House; and if you had election by the House of Commons in batches of 40 instead of in batches of 30, it could be done equally well without the means of colleges or the intervening apparatus provided by the Bill.<lb/>
I pass to the 100 members to be nominated by the Ministry of the day. The noble Lord opposite made some sport, or attempted to do so, of the observations made by my noble friend the Leader of the House with regard to the proposal in the Bill as to the election of that 100. The proposal of the Bill is that they should be elected after the manner in which members of Select Committees of the House of Commons are appointed. When the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition read that clause in introducing the Bill I could scarcely conceive that such words could be found in an Act of Parliament; they are of the most novel drafting character, and there is no definition of the method to be found in any authoritative book; moreover, the manner has changed considerably within my recollection. When I was first in the House of Commons the principle was that the Government should always have a majority of one vote. On the introduction of new Parties there arose a claim for the representation
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0262"/>
<col>515</col>
of those Parties, and no doubt the present method of election is that the Whips of the four Parties agree together that each Party should contribute a proportionate number of members in the composition of any Committee. Of course, it is a thing that might be changed at any time; I am simply speaking of the method in which it has been done so far. But the process is not completed there. The process of the nomination of a Select Committee is not ended until the Member in charge of the Motion for the appointment of the Committee makes the Motion in the House and puts down upon the Order Paper the names of the members selected and exposes the names for possible alteration or addition, and there may perhaps be a debate on the construction of the Committee. I have known such debates take place, where it has been pointed out that a Committee was very weak in some respects and that the representation of this or that element was necessary, and a change in the composition of the Committee has been made. But the process itself is quite open to all the criticisms that have been bestowed upon it. It would have to be completely changed in order to fulfil the ideal of the noble Lord who has just spoken, and who seems to have been in a large measure the constructor of the Bill.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, to go over my points. I have accepted the Lords elected by their fellow Peers, I have suggested a change in the method of election by the House of Commons, and I have accepted the principle of nomination by the Prime Minister. I would have these last not nominated for twelve years and a quarter going out every three years, but nominated for three Parliaments and one-third going out with every Parliament. There still remains under the scheme the grave objection that it would give an enormous majority to the Opposition. I would not object to a little Conservative majority, but I do object to a majority of seventy. This House must be Conservative; it is sure to be Conservative; there is not great objection to it if it is, but it should be moderately Conservative, and something must be done to get rid of that great preponderance. I would also point out that the elected members from outside, however elected, would probably be men who were not in the first flush of political life, but sober and staid people, disposed to lead quiet lives, conservative in temper even though Liberal by Party;
<col>516</col>
and the reflection of the House of Commons to be found in this House under this system would be a pale reflection, you might, perhaps, call it a sort of afterglow of the meridian heat of political life; and so naturally this House, however constructed, would be a Conservative one. That fact emphasises the great Conservative majority which is given by the 100 members elected by this House. I am very loth to add further to the 340 members already proposed under this Bill, but it seems to me inevitable, if this scheme is to go further, that some provision must be made, at all events when a Liberal Government is in power, to enable a Liberal Prime Minister to add a certain number of members to this House say for one Parliament only, which would bring the House into a better relationship with the other House and make it on the whole a more trustworthy co-operative body.<lb/>
I apologise for the time I have occupied. I have gone into details which perhaps it would have been better to reserve for Committee, but some of these details are of radical importance and cannot be considered so well in Committee unless they are suggested at least in outline beforehand. The scheme as it stands I recognise, as the Leader of the House recognises, as a very bold scheme, and one considerably in advance of anything that has been presented before. It is a great stride forward, and as such I hope the Liberal Party, the Liberal leaders and the Liberal Government&#x2014;they have not as yet given us any reason for thinking that they will do otherwise&#x2014;will look at it and consider it. They have not given it a hostile reception; they have given it a very mixed but, on the whole, a friendly reception. I am sorry I did not hear my noble friend Lord Carrington's speech last night, but on the whole I think the attitude of the. Government has been to encourage rather than discourage the authors of the Bill. It might have been received with more welcome. It has not been received with flouting, nor treated with ridicule, contumely, and opposition such as the noble Lord opposite has suggested. I do not know whether we shall see any further stage of this Bill, but I think that it is a necessary part of what we are bound to undertake in the reform of this House, and that it will he a necessary complement to the reconstruction of the relations between the two Houses. And,
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0263"/>
<col>517</col>
as I said at the outset, it will also be necessary to take seriously in hand the reform of the House of Commons. What we are all striving after is some trustworthy, faithful expression of the reasoned national mind. We want to make this House sufficiently independent as to be at all events a contributory element to that representation of the national mind; to free it from the great preponderance which it has now of class association; to bring it into some relation to the masses of the people, with whom it has now no relation whatever; to bring into this House elements which are entirely foreign to it so as to make the House in itself representative of the nation without. If we could do that, and still more if we could make the House of Commons a faithful image of the mind of the nation, we should then be going a long way towards that reconstruction of Parliament which we all admit to be our duty, and the necessity and importance of which I think it is absolutely impossible to overrate.<lb/>
The noble Duke (the Duke of Northumberland) last night, in a speech to which I have already referred, carried us back to the year 1832 and referred to the divergences which have since grown up between this House and the other House. I am not sure that he did not look back to 1832 with some regret at the change that has taken place. To my mind no one can seriously examine the conditions of political life before 1832 without rejoicing at the change that has been made. It is true that up to that time members of the two Houses more or less belonged to the same set, lived the same lives, thought the same things, pursued the same aims and belonged to one society. They got divorced in 1832, and the divorce has gone on more than ever since. But when you consider what society before 1832 tolerated in the way of law and administration and the change that has taken place since, always, I am afraid, in the face of more or less persistent opposition on the part of your Lordships though you have given way in the end&#x2014;when you consider what the Criminal Law was, what the relations between husband and wife were, the state of the law of property, the administration of the Civil Law, the class injustice of the Common Laws, the conditions of Labour and the burdens in restraint of trade, there is cause for thankfulness that we have broken away from all that. I admit also
<col>518</col>
the truth of what the noble Duke said as to the difference between the present and the past in the development of the House of Commons, and I join largely with him in regretting some forms of that development. We see in the House of Commons a great falling away from the vital elements of personal life which existed some years ago. Private Members have no initiative. The discussion of a large question on the initiation of independent Members is rare, and the carrying of any measure by a private Member absolutely unknown. We are no doubt in the presence of a new development of the House of Commons, and, as the noble Duke said, we are very much in the presence of a temporary dictatorship of Cabinets over the country. I look for something like the redemption of the House of Commons when it may go back to what it was in the past, and when we shall, although no doubt with very considerable changes in the method of doing business, again have personal initiation and independence. When that comes about the House of Commons may be trusted to be truly representative of the people of the country in all their aspirations and wills and thoughts and desires. The composition of this House will then probably be of less importance, but until then it will be of immense importance. When that comes about we may not hear anything of Referenda, of appealing from the House of Commons to the nation, but until it is brought about we shall hear over and over again of Referenda, and, despite the unwillingness of noble Lords to entertain it, it will be forced upon their acceptance as it has been in other democratic countries. Meanwhile it is our duty here to undertake the business of reforming this House in as little a partisan spirit as possible, and try to make it a contributory representation of the national will by enlarging the range of choice of its members, by reducing the representation of those whose associations so entirely belong to one class, and making this House more and more correspond to the feelings and aims of the nation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01087"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just sat down has, contrary to the example set him by the two official representatives of the Government, addressed his observations to the Bill, and I, being of a prosaic and unimaginative character propose to follow the same course. The noble Lord has avowed himself as favourable to the Bill in principle. He
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0264"/>
<col>519</col>
adopts a friendly attitude towards the Bill, and he, I thought with a considerable amount of courage, described the attitude of the previous official speakers as being also of a friendly nature. I am afraid that I am unable to attribute the same epithet to the reception accorded to the Bill by the official representatives of the Government, and personally I should prefer a reception of another character. Since I have attended this debate I have occasionally wondered, supposing there really exist noble Lords who pass the greater part of their lives in the densest thickets of backwoods and supposing one of these mythical beings has been present here during the course of the debate not having been here, say, for four years previously, whether that noble Lord might not imagine himself to be either the victim of hallucination or of some horrible nightmare. I fix an interval of four years because on an occasion like this I cannot avoid being egotistical, and I vividly recall my own reception when I introduced a milk and watery measure which would not be looked at nowadays and for being connected with which I was treated almost as a person unfit for human intercourse. We have heard the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition introduce a measure which he himself described as the death blow of the existing House, and if the reception of that measure has not been one of enthusiastic applause on the part of noble Lords who sit behind him, it has been received with what I suppose the noble Viscount opposite would describe as "sombre acquiescence."<lb/>
This Bill has naturally been subjected to considerable criticism, and my own criticism, such as it is, takes the form of regret that this measure did not see the light of day long before; and those who question the propriety of introducing a Bill of this nature at the present moment must surely have forgotten what took place on the occasion I am alluding to four years ago. Four years ago everybody on this side of the House, including even my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke, voted for the appointment of a Committee to improve the efficiency of this House, and the decisive step was taken upon that occasion from which there can be no recall. Everybody knows well enough what happened. That Committee was appointed; it sat for a whole year, and issued a Report of which no notice was taken. That occupied a period up to the end of the year 1908.
<col>520</col>
During the year 1909 nothing was done at all, and the question was never once alluded to. Having admitted that reform of this House was necessary and that there was nothing to be gained by delay, our procedure has been a mystery to me with regard to this matter. I myself hold strongly, and always shall hold, that it would have been more dignified, more prudent, and more courageous, if we had set about the work some years ago instead of waiting as we have done until the latest possible moment; and, it is permissible, I think, to express the opinion that had this step been taken earlier it might possibly not have been necessary to ask noble Lords to make the sacrifices which now confront them.<lb/>
Having uttered this lament, not, I admit, for the first time, I hasten to add that I have little sympathy with such criticism as has up to now been directed against this Bill. Without being offensive, I think I may say that the criticisms of the representatives of the Government are hardly worth noticing at all. What do they amount to? The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack and the noble Viscount opposite have said in so many words, in a polite manner it is true, "This is no doubt a very interesting academic subject; we are much interested in observing the reception the Bill meets with at the hands of the Opposition, but we really care very little what you do in the matter; we are here for the purpose of putting the Parliament Bill into effect." That is their attitude, and I have no doubt it accurately reflects the spirit of the instructions&#x2014;it would be unkind to call them orders&#x2014;which no doubt they have received from their Irish and Labour supporters in another place.<lb/>
There are other important critics of this measure besides the Government critics. There is the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, Lord Rosebery. The noble Earl disapproves of the Bill on two grounds. He does not consider that the moment is opportune, and he thinks that a Bill should be the task of the Government and not of the Opposition. The noble Earl, if I may be permitted to say so without offence, strikes me as a sort of political <i>prima donna</i> who requires a great deal of humouring; and his conduct appears to me, if I may also say so without offence, not to be regulated by the procedure of ordinary human beings, but to be governed by the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0265"/>
<col>521</col>
eccentricity of genius. What is the noble Earl's history in connection with this matter? The noble Earl first brought forward the subject in 1884&#x2014;I am not quite sure whether he was in office himself at the time or not. The next occasion was in 1888, when he certainly was not in office. Then the noble Earl remained quiescent upon this particular subject until the year 1907, when he was again dragged, possibly reluctantly, into the arena, and was persuaded to accept the Chairmanship of the Committee to which I have already alluded. But last year the noble Earl came forward again and insisted&#x2014;in my opinion quite properly&#x2014;on the Opposition taking up this question. His criticism, as I understand it, amounts to this, that we ought to confine ourselves to Resolutions and not make ourselves responsible for a Bill. I think the noble Earl will admit that whichever course we had adopted we should certainly have done wrong in the eyes of our opponents. Supposing the noble Marquess had contented himself with reaffirming the Resolutions of the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, what would have been said? It would have been said, in varying tones of indignation, that he was little better than a hollow impostor and meant to go no further. You always have this difficulty with regard to Bills and Resolutions. If you confine yourselves to Resolutions you are looked upon as a sort of impostor or windbag; if you produce a Bill your opponents seize upon some detail in the Bill of which they disapprove and endeavour to make out, and occasionally with success, that the Bill itself is a fraud too. The difference between bringing in a Resolution and bringing in a Bill seems to me very much the same as the difference there is between meeting a debt with an I O U and paying in solid cash. In one case the obligation never may be met at all, but if you have actually paid, the thing is done and there is no going back from it. That is the case with regard to a Bill. Now our boats are practically burned. We are as a Party, I imagine, committed to the principle of the Bill, and if it has done nothing else, the introduction of the Bill has vindicated the honesty of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition and those associated with him.<lb/>
I pass from the Cross Benches to the noble Lord on the other side of the House, Lord St. Davids, who spoke early in the debate. I thought that for a democrat of
<col>522</col>
advanced views he represented a most extraordinary form of opinion. The noble Lord appeared to be under the gravest apprehension that if this Bill ever became law this House would be turned into a hard-working sort of place where people would be kept assiduously at their duties and ordered about here and there by Whips, and altogether that it would bear a strong resemblance to the place from which he has recently effected an escape. The impression borne in upon me was that the noble Lord has already fallen so violently in love with this Assembly that he is in mortal terror that something may occur which at some future period may cause him to be ejected from it. The real interest in this debate to my mind lies, not in the view of the Government or persons in responsible positions, but in the view which is taken of this question by independent Peers who sit on this side of the House&#x2014;noble Lords, for instance, holding the opinions of my noble friends Lord Willoughby de Broke and Lord Bathurst. With regard to these two noble Lords I am bound to confess that the first of them, my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke, does not appear to me to cut a very heroic figure or a very consistent one. What is the noble Lord's history in regard to this matter? He voted, like everybody else, for the appointment of the Rosebery Committee, thereby identifying himself with the cause of reform; but for a long time past my noble friend has been tramping the country chanting the praises of an unadulterated hereditary system. And now when a Bill is brought in which administers the most severe blow to the hereditary principle that has ever been applied to it, my noble friend, with lamblike docility, announces, not only that he is prepared to vote for it, but that he is also prepared to vote for a very much worse one which will do away with the hereditary principle altogether. The other noble Lord, Lord Bathurst, excited my admiration considerably more than my noble friend Lord. Willoughby de Broke did. Lord Bathurst, at all events, is prepared to stick to his guns. He is a sort of die-in-the-last-ditch for the hereditary principle politician, and, as I understand, is prepared to divide the House on the subject.<lb/>
If Lord Willoughby de Broke is honest but inconsistent, and if Lord Bathurst is honest and consistent, I am afraid that the only thing that can be said of the Government is that they are consistently dis-
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0266"/>
<col>523</col>
honest. They are consistently dishonest in this way, that whereas they are in power largely by virtue of their unmeasured denunciation of the hereditary system, they themselves have never moved a hand's turn, and, so far as I can make out, never will, to remedy anything wrong with the system. And not only that, they are before long, I understand, going to show their real feeling with regard to the hereditary system by presenting us with a number of concrete instances of that principle which will be collected at the shortest notice, and, I presume, at the lowest cost. We have heard a good deal here, and more elsewhere, in favour of abolishing the hereditary system altogether and establishing a purely elective Chamber. For my part I have absolutely no enthusiasm for a proposal of this nature, and until the House of Commons becomes absolutely intolerable in its tyranny, which perhaps it will some day, I do not think that we need seriously consider such a proposal. I have two fundamental objections to such a proposal. But even if you had an open electoral basis for this Chamber, what sort of guarantee have you that the right kind of men would be elected? The British voter is no respecter of persons or personalities. Everybody, I suppose, would admit that Mr. Balfour enjoys as much respected personality as any living man in this country, but the last time he stood for a popular constituency be was defeated by an obscure and unknown opponent by something like 2,000 votes. Therefore it does not follow in the least, however eminent a man may be, that he will be certain of election by a popular constituency. But of course the real reason why all sensible people ought to be opposed to a proposal of this kind is that no sensible person wishes to set up two competing Assemblies of equal and co-ordinate powers.<lb/>
I find it extremely difficult to account for the sudden change of opinion which has taken place in the Unionist Party with regard to the hereditary principle. A short time ago it was the convenient thing in this country. What reason is there for the mysterious change of view which has come about all of a sudden? Surely the case of the hereditary principle is a case of <i>Nemo repente fuit turpissimus.</i> I am not conscious of being any viler in consequence of anything I have done during the last year or two and I do not suppose any other noble Lord is either, and I am certainly not
<col>524</col>
prepared, because I am a member of the hereditary Party, to be butchered in order to make holiday for Mr. Redmond or Mr. Keir Hardie, or my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke, or even for youthful gentlemen who have had a few months' experience of a new House of Commons. With regard to this Bill, I look upon the arrangement by which it is proposed to retain the hereditary principle as a triumph of ingenuity. What I particularly admire about it, though it does not appeal to me as a rule, is the really democratic nature of this proposal. Here you have a Prime Minister or an ex-Prime Minister putting himself on the same level as a Chairman of Quarter Sessions. You have an ex-Viceroy of India abasing himself to the level of a Mayor or Chairman of a County Council.<lb/>
I understand from what has fallen from various speakers that the whole principle of qualification is largely resented. I think Lord Courtney asked to-day&#x2014;or, if not he, some other speaker in the debate&#x2014;why should there be any qualifications at all; why should not the House elect any 100 persons it chooses? There are a number of noble Lords, friends of my own, whose blood positively boils when they see it suggested in the Schedule of the Bill that a man should be qualified to sit in this House because he happens to have formerly been a member of the House of Commons. I am sure there are a number of noble Lords here who absolutely decline to see any additional value in a man because he happens to have been in the House of Commons, and are rather disposed to think that the only difference between him and the ordinary Peer is that he is rather more conceited on the whole. I admit that intrinsically it does not in the least follow because a man has been in the House of Commons that he is better than other men, but at all events, whatever you may think of the House of Commons, the mere fact of standing for the House of Commons does imply some sort of disposition towards political life; and I confess it seems to me that the difference, roughly, between a man who takes an interest in politics who has been in the House of Commons and a man who has not is very much the same difference as exists between two soldiers of equal merit, one of whom has seen actual warfare while the other has not had the opportunity. But, my Lords, although I have no overwhelming admiration for the House of Commons even in view of the princely
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0267"/>
<col>525</col>
stipend which members are going to enjoy, I contend that an election is a political education in itself. It might be the only occasion in the life of a noble Lord on which he would hear the bare truth about himself. But the great advantage to my mind is that this is a qualification which is absolutely incapable of opposition by the Government. The House of Commons, as we know, is not only the fountainhead of wisdom but an infallible body. Everything that it says twice or three times must be right. It stands to reason if any man is good enough to sit in an Assembly of that kind he is clearly good enough to sit in this place of which they have so contemptuous an opinion.<lb/>
If this Bill ever goes to Committee, I trust that the principle of qualification will be rigidly adhered to, no matter what opposition it may create. If you abandon qualification, what would be the result? You would have a mob of 700 Peers armed with 700 votes apiece, I presume, struggling for places in this House, and the process of getting a seat here would strongly resemble that which people go through in order to secure a ticket for the enclosure at Ascot. The result would be that if you obtained a seat in this Assembly it would be very difficult for you to give satisfactory reasons for being here. Nobody in a case of this kind would necessarily vote for the most eminent amongst our body. I imagine every one would vote for himself, because whatever may be the admiration we express in public for our leaders every one sitting on these Benches probably in his heart considers himself every bit as good a man as another if he were allowed an opportunity. It is easy to realise the dissatisfaction and the disappointment which would be caused by resorting to a process of this kind. The meritorious A, who has been a liberal contributor to Party funds, might find himself excluded for the benefit of B, who had never done anything substantial for his Party, and who, on the contrary, had perhaps received considerable emoluments in the course of his career from his Party. C, on the other hand, who had sometimes, perhaps, filled, and sometimes occasionally emptied, these Benches with his eloquence, might find himself dispossessed in favour of D, who never came near the place except when there was some particular question being debated in which he had an individual interest. One might multiply instances of this kind. Without
<col>526</col>
entering too closely into the merits of qualification, at all events qualification limits the choice of representatives, and nobody who sat in this House as a representative of the rest of the Peerage would be unable to give some substantial reason for the place which he occupied.<lb/>
A good deal was said by way of encouragement by my noble friend Lord Curzon with regard to the possibilities of unofficial Peers entering this House. There are to be, as we all know, three avenues of approach. There is the avenue of election by your fellow Peers; there is the method of getting your leader to nominate you; and, if you fail in that, you can fall back on Members for constituencies in your neighbourhood and make yourself as agreeable as you can to them in whatever way occurs to you&#x2014;I refrain, from motives of delicacy, from suggesting how I should put that into operation myself. But in view of the extreme difficulty of framing a measure of this kind I think that the noble Marquess may congratulate himself upon the reception accorded to his Bill. Do not let it be forgotten that this is the third attempt within a few years at devising a satisfactory Bill. The first attempt was made by the Committee under the presidency of my noble friend Lord Rosebery; the second attempt was made&#x2014;it is an open secret&#x2014;by unofficial members who sit on this side of the House; the third attempt is the attempt made by the united intellect of the leaders of the Unionist Party; and I repeat that, considering the ridicule which habitually attaches to makers of Constitutions all over the world, they may be satisfied with the reception which their Bill has encountered.<lb/>
I confess I find it difficult to speak with patience of the attitude of noble Lords opposite and members of their Party, who are inclined to jeer at what they term an insufficient sacrifice. They call it an insufficient sacrifice when, under the terms of this Bill, something like five-sixths of the members of this House may have to go, and to go for ever. Then there is the fault which the opponents of this Bill find with it on the paltry ground that by some manipulation of figures you can show that in all probability the Unionist Party would have a nominal majority in this place. As far as I am personally concerned, I would be quite willing to make
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0268"/>
<col>527</col>
any sacrifice, whether it took the form of enlarging the numbers or was done in some other way, for the purpose of meeting these trivial objections. The Government really ought to be honest in this matter. What they ought really to admit&#x2014;and I trust they will admit it before the debate concludes&#x2014;is that they do not want an impartial Assembly here at all. What they want is an emasculated and subservient Assembly which would be little better than an unpaid imitation of the omnipotent institution next door.<lb/>
I look upon this Bill as an honest and sincere attempt to redeem the promises and engagements which have been made by the leaders of the Unionist Party. I do not say that I look upon it as a supplement or as an alternative, but I do look upon it as a basis for a fair settlement if only we had to deal with reasonable people. So far as I personally am concerned, so far from contemplating any changes in the composition of this House pleasure, I contemplate them with aversion amounting to detestation. I have no grievance against this House; it has always treated me a great deal better than I deserve, and I think a good many noble Lords would be prepared to say the same for themselves. The new House, when it comes into existence, will in some respects be distinctly inferior to the present one. It will contain, no doubt, a number of pretentious people full of their own importance. But, on the other hand, I admit reluctantly that it has been borne in upon me during the last few years that a change is not only imperative, but inevitable, and, although the sacrifices which we may be called upon to undergo may be hard and bitter, nevertheless I feel that it is our duty to make them if we are prepared to do what we believe to be our duty, not only to our Party, but to our country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01088"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose to detain the House very long. But after the somewhat pointed appeal directed to me by my noble friend who has just sat down I think it right to make clear once more the reason why I thought it better, and still think it better, to have proceeded by means of Resolution rather than by means of a specific plan. I do not object in the slightest degree to my noble friend's references to me. My noble friend's speeches are always such galaxies of fireworks, with squibs falling
<col>528</col>
in every direction and on every head, that they sometimes remind us of our amusement on the Fifth of November in our early boyhood. I am quite sure that no one who has felt the dart of my noble friend's wit has ever had the slightest cause to feel any compunction or annoyance.<lb/>
But my noble friend found fault with me for not concurring in the decision come to by the Front Opposition Bench as to the introduction of a Bill. The point is one of so much importance, not as regards myself, but as regards the whole policy in relation to this measure, that I am anxious to say a few words about it. My noble friend was surprised that I should have taken that line. I express no surprise at his surprise, because if he had not expressed it I should have known that he had read all my speeches on the subject&#x2014;which I am sure he has not&#x2014;in every one of which there is reported in the strongest terms the statement that no one but a responsible Government should deal with such Constitutional questions. But apart from the Constitutional aspect of the question&#x2014;and I assure my noble friends behind me that I did not mean to take part in this debate, as I wished to refrain from accentuating the differences which unfortunately exist between us as to methods&#x2014;but apart from the Constitutional point, let me say there are some very obvious questions of strategy in regard to the wisdom or non-wisdom of producing a Bill. If you produce a Bill you attempt an impossibility, because I say at once there is no human being who has ever lived on this planet who could produce a scheme for the reform of the House of Lords which would not be open to almost countless objections and almost universal criticism.<lb/>
If there was any justification of my difference from my noble friend Lord Lansdowne on this point, it would be found in the very first speech of my noble friend opposite, Lord Morley, in answering him. The noble Viscount opposite said at once what I know would be said in regard to any Bill introduced by anybody without a Government majority to support it, and that is, "This Bill will please nobody." If the angel Gabriel came down from Heaven and tried to draw up a plan for the reform of the House of Lords which would give satisfaction, of course from its authorship it would be a perfect plan, but I am certain, nevertheless, that
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0269"/>
<col>529</col>
it would not give satisfaction. That is why, apart, from the Constitutional reason, a grave change and revision of our immemorial Constitution should not be proposed by an Opposition which, though I know it is known as "His Majesty's Opposition," is yet an irresponsible body. But apart from that Constitutional point, I think there are the gravest reasons as regards strategy for not producing a Bill. I venture to say the Bill of my noble friend has not given satisfaction, and it cannot give satisfaction. It is impossible without the influence of a Government, without all that a Government has to give, without all the inducements that a Government can hold out&#x2014;tickets for the enclosure at Ascot, to which my noble friend so feelingly referred, and the fountain of honour which falls so lavishly twice or thrice a year&#x2014;without all the influences that a Government can exercise it is impossible for people not to see the motes and the beams in any plan which can be suggested for the reform of the House of Lords. I make noble Lords opposite a present of that statement.<lb/>
I think my noble friend Lord Lansdowne felt that a certain rather flaccid attitude was shown even by those behind him when he offered his Bill to the House. May I say with what interest I listened to the clear, solemn, and, I think, pathetic statement in which my noble friend recommended this Bill to the House. I was reminded of a scene which has often been portrayed both by historian and painter, the scene during the French Revolution of the gaoler coming in every night to the Conciergerie and reading out to the prisoners the list of those who were to go to the scaffold on the morrow. I think it was with the same absence of enthusiasm, to say the very least of it, with which the hapless prisoners listened to that list that their Lordships behind my noble friend listened to the details of this Bill. Therefore, I remain firmly of opinion that it was impolitic to bring a Bill forward. Resolutions are the recognised method for an Opposition to bring forward its policy. Mr. Gladstone always adopted that method when he was in Opposition. The reason is tolerably clear. You bring forward your Resolutions in the House in which you are preponderant, knowing that if you embody them in a Bill the Bill will be lost in the House in which you are not preponderant. Therefore, it would surely have been a wiser thing in a Resolution to affirm our adher-
<col>530</col>
ence to the Resolutions passed last year, and to declare that in our opinion they offer a basis for Constitutional rearrangement and revision and a basis for another Conference, if you will. It would surely have shown more wisdom to introduce a Resolution of that kind to which no fair objection could have been taken, and which, I think, would have been recognised by the country as a pledge of honour on the part of this House, than to bring forward a Bill which meets with objection even here, which certainly meets with no enthusiastic support, and which you know can never pass into law until you change the composition of the other House. I wanted to develop the reasons for the position which I have been compelled to take up on this matter, which I have honestly and conscientiously taken, and as to which I had meant to remain silent had I not been poked and prodded by my noble friend Lord Newton.<lb/>
But having said so much of the impolicy of introducing a Bill, let me at once say that I think the Bill&#x2014;if a reform Bill in relation to the House of Lords is of any avail at this juncture, if the sands have not been flowing too fast, if we have not got past the point where a mere reform of this House will avail&#x2014;if you are to have a Reform Bill of the House of Lords I cannot imagine a much more sensible one in the way of combining the hereditary tradition of this House with the newer spirit which you wish to infuse into it. I can see from my experience on the Committee which considered the subject last year some traces of authorship, unless I have wholly lost all critical faculty. For example, Lord Newton dealt largely with the question of qualification. I was surprised to hear that criticism from him, because on the Committee he was an ardent apostle of qualification, whereas I was a humble and unsuccessful opponent of it. But I cannot help seeing in that ingenious method for combining qualification and election which is in the Bill a homage paid to qualification by a distinguished member of the Committee, a homage which in this case is really somewhat unnecessary. My noble friend Lord Curzon&#x2014;I am sure he will forgive my referring to him directly in regard to his part on the Committee&#x2014;was always a very ardent and convinced believer in the principle of qualification. I was always a very ardent and convinced disbeliever. But my noble friend had more votes, and probably more arguments, than
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0270"/>
<col>531</col>
I had, and he carried the Committee with him.<lb/>
What does qualification mean? It means as a rule that a gentleman who has filled some very responsible situation, or some very irresponsible situation in the past, very often comes to the House of Lords to spend the evening of his days in unbroken repose, and that in the opinion of his friends, and still more of his enemies, he has ceased to be fit to hold any of those offices which he held in the past. I do not look to the other side of the House. I should be afraid of my eye unwarily resting on some distinguished ex-Minister&#x2014;I do not mean any of the existing Ministers&#x2014;who has retired here, under shadow of a coronet, to spend the evening of his days. I am not thinking of any one living. All those I am thinking of are dead and gone. But I do say this, that to take an Assembly of 600 gentlemen who, as Lord Newton has just told us, think themselves, every one of them, quite as good if not better than their leaders, and to put a stigma on those who have not those qualifications and to limit the choice to those who have, does seem to me a mistake.<lb/>
I think if you are to acknowledge the democratic principle of election you had better not restrict it. I have heard from Lord Lansdowne and Lord Curzon long eulogies on the extraordinary astuteness, generosity, and discrimination with which the House of Lords will choose the best men irrespective of any other consideration. That being so what is the use of the qualifications? It is really only a homage to an extinct and embalmed principle to which I thought we had said good-bye for ever when we closed the doors of our Committee. I know my noble friend is deaf to all remonstrance on this point. Another flaw in the Bill is, I think, the composition of colleges. I loathe the word college in that connection. To begin with, it has to me a flavour of the Latin races which is wholly inconsistent with Anglo-Saxon civilisation; but I am quite certain that Lord Lansdowne if I could find a better word would gladly adopt it, but I do not know that I can find one. I think again that if you are going to do homage to the democratic principle of election you should do it without restriction or restraint. I think the idea of a mere knot of members of the House of Commons collecting in a room somewhere in Yorkshire or in Surrey, or
<col>532</col>
wherever it may be, to elect a delegate for this purpose seems to me to be too limited to be defined as an acknowledgment of the principle of election to serve any useful purpose.<lb/>
Of course under different and happier circumstances we might imagine that a college of the House of Commons members might have voted like the captains did for the Admiral to command the Athenian fleet. They voted each one for himself, as Lord Newton said the Peers would do. I am not sure that under the unhappy circumstances in which we find ourselves, or are likely to find ourselves, that any member of the House of Commons will care to leave a stipendiary position richly repaid by &#x00A3;100 a quarter for the comparatively barren honour of sitting on these Benches. But at any rate, is it not enough for the House of Commons to exercise unquestioned dominion without wishing to have a hand in the election of 120 Peers whenever or wherever they may be collected? Would it not be far better to try to make a college for this purpose out of county councils, borough councils, or whatever body may lie ready to your hands, instead of restricting yourselves to the arid limits of the House of Commons? I know it is said that it would introduce politics into the county councils. I do not honestly think it would. I never have thought so. The opportunity of their exercising their political feelings would come so rarely, and the body would be so considerable if you unite all the municipal and county councils of the area, that really it would not be worth while to discard an excellent municipal reformer in favour of some politician of your own views. At any rate, it would extend the area of choice in a manner which I cannot help thinking would be more agreeable to the principle of democracy than the somewhat restricted attempt made in the Bill.<lb/>
The third remark I would make is this. I could wish that my noble friend had taken the opportunity not to give the Law Lords an undisputed pre-eminence over every other member of the House of Lords except the two Archbishops by giving them seats for life, but had proposed to expunge them from the House of Lords altogether. It would be perfectly easy to create a tribunal quite as august as the legal members of the House of Lords. Call it if you will, the High Court of Parliament, that most beautiful expression the meaning of
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0271"/>
<col>533</col>
which will soon have Vanished for ever, the Supreme Tribunal, or whatever you choose. It is a mistake, it seems to me, at this juncture, after our experience, to perpetuate an arrangement which is perfectly hollow, perfectly nominal, which has no particular dignity to recommend it, and which has caused constant confusion in the constituencies. It is therefore with profound respect for the Law Lords that I would ask them to leave this Assembly, reformed or unreformed, for ever.<lb/>
What is the use of talking about this Bill? What will it matter to any human being on the face of this globe what is the composition of the House of Lords when the Parliament Bill has become Law? Who are the people who will accept the degrading position which is to be offered under the Parliament Bill in this ancient House? Who are the acolytes, the sycophants, persons who will consent to an abject and degraded existence under the Parliament Bill, and who will consent to fill the denuded Benches of this House? I suppose that the Government have some of their followers opposite who are ready to come to hand and do what will be required of them under the Parliament Bill, but I hope their number will not be great. I hope this House of Lords will be too sensible of what it has been in the past and of what a Second Chamber should be in the future to accept the abject condition of a Peer under the Parliament Bill.<lb/>
If there is any hollowness or unreality in the debate to which we have been listening during the last three days, and I think there is some hollowness and some unreality, is it not because while we are discussing one thing we are thinking of another, and that over all this debate there looms the shadow of the Bill which the noble Viscount will present for our discussion, and perhaps for our acceptance, next week? If that Bill becomes part of the fundamental law of these realms, Lord Lansdowne's Bill matters little. The revolution through which we have passed will have no significance. It is on the Parliament Bill and the Parliament Bill alone that depends the future, not of this House, but of Second Chamber government and of the whole Constitution of the country. I am not pleading for the House of Lords; I have never held a brief for the House of Lords. I have never been able to see how the existence of an hereditary House of
<col>534</col>
Lords is compatible with the various Franchise Bills that have been passed and the gradual movement of popular feeling in the country. I hold no brief for the House of Lords, any more than I hold a brief for the House of Commons, but I do with all my heart appeal to this House that it shall do what it can do to preserve double, bicameral, government in this country, and do something to sustain that which the Government have determined actively to overthrow, the immemorial Constitution of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01089"><member>THE MARQUESS OF NORTHAMPTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with the noble Earl who has just spoken that while we are discussing this Reconstitution Bill we have in our minds the Parliament Bill. Is it not the absolute truth that if it had not been for the introduction of the Parliament Bill we should never have seen the Bill that is now before the House? We are given reasons for the introduction of this Bill; we are told that the country, or rather the electors, desire the reconstitution of this Chamber, that they object to the hereditary principle, and that they desire a fairer division of Parties in the Second House. But that is not the point that everybody is discussing. At no meeting I have ever attended since 1884 and 1885&#x2014;and I have attended a great many of my own and a great many of others also&#x2014;has any special point been made of opposition to the hereditary principle. The one and only thing that was brought forward was, not how this House was composed, but determined hostility to the action of this House when Liberal Governments were in office, and a determination to work, and to work without ceasing, until what had prevented us from passing the Bills that we thought necessary was removed. The question during the whole of my political life has been the power of the Veto of this House, and not so much the question of the hereditary principle or even unfair majorities. I do not think noble Lords opposite can be aware of the intense feeling that has existed amongst the rank and file of the Liberal Party during the last twenty-five years. I only speak of that period because I have experience of that, but of course it began long before. In my opinion there was no subject which united Liberals more closely, no subject which roused such intense enthusiasm of feeling as this subject of the Veto, and I quite agree with the noble Earl who
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0272"/>
<col>535</col>
has just spoken that it is the Veto which occupies all men's minds infinitely more than the question of the reconstruction of this House.<lb/>
The Bill which is before us now has been received&#x2014;I venture to disagree with what the noble Lord who sits below me (Lord Courtney) said on this point this evening&#x2014;by the Liberal Party with cold indifference. Every Liberal that I have spoken to or met says exactly what the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, has just said, that he does not believe there is any chance whatever of this Bill becoming law. They do not treat it even as a serious Bill. They do not, however, pour contempt upon it. They recognise fully that it is a genuine attempt to grapple with a very difficult problem&#x2014;a genuine attempt, of course, on the understanding that the hope of the Conservative Party is that this Bill may take the place of the Veto Bill. But at the same time there is not a single Liberal in the rank and file of the Party at the present moment who has the least fear that this Bill will ever become law. At the present moment Liberals care for one thing and for one thing only, and until that is accomplished they care for nothing else. We have received a distinct pledge from our leaders that they would never occupy office again until they had grappled with and settled this question of the Veto. If they had turned away from that by one hair's breadth their whole Party would have left them. We call them our leaders, but practically the leaders of the Liberal Party&#x2014;and I am sure they are proud of it &#x2014;are really those who are looked upon as the servants of it; and our leaders are in office at the present moment on the clear understanding between all of us that the first thing they have to do is to abolish the Veto of the Second House, however that Second House may be constituted.<lb/>
Your Lordships constantly taunt us with not bringing forward our plans. I am only a humble member of the Liberal Party and I cannot speak officially with regard to what our plan is, but to taunt the Government with not bringing forward their scheme&#x2014;I am sorry it has been said again to-night that you do not believe the Government will ever bring forward their scheme&#x2014;is somewhat ungenerous in the face of what the Prime Minister said the other evening, that within the lifetime of this Parliament the Government would
<col>536</col>
bring in their scheme for the reform of the House of Lords. It is impossible for any men, however able, however clever, to grapple with one of the most difficult questions that men have had to grapple with&#x2014;the reconstitution of the Second House of this country&#x2014;unless they know on what foundation they are going to build the reconstitution scheme. Is the Veto Bill going to pass? How can anybody at the present moment foresee what is going to take place during the next few months? We believe that the Veto Bill will pass, and the moment it has passed into law we shall have a foundation upon which to build our scheme. The noble Lord opposite, Lord Ashtown, shakes his head. He does not believe what the Prime Minister said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01090"><member>LORD ASHTOWN</member><membercontribution>: There will be no need for a Second Chamber if the Bill passes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01091"><member>THE MARQUESS OF NORTHAMPTON</member><membercontribution>: I entirely disagree with the noble Lord about that, and I will say a few words in answer to him before I sit down. My point at the present moment is that until you know whether the reconstituted Chamber is going to have the same power of Veto as this Chamber has, you cannot decide what the reconstitution of the House is to be. There has also been a taunt to-night that all that is done by the Liberal Government at the present moment is done at the command of the Irish Party. During the last twenty-five years there have been many changes of fortune to the Liberals owing to their alliance with the Irish Party. I do not for one moment deny&#x2014;on the contrary, I glory in it&#x2014;that the Party to which I belong has done its level best to be friends with the Irish and to act in consort with them as far as possible. I do not think that any man who calls himself a Liberal should be ashamed of avowing that one of our great objects has always been to reconcile Ireland to England and not to drive Ireland away from England. Our idea of reconciliation took the form not only of legislation but also of treating them as friends and equals whether in the House of Commons or elsewhere, and I am thankful that the Government has thought fit, if they have done so, to act in consort with the Irish Party on any matter. I am not ashamed in any way of our alliance with the Irish. But during the last twenty-five years we know
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0273"/>
<col>537</col>
that over and over again&#x2014;in 1885, for instance&#x2014;the whole Irish influence and vote throughout the country has been against us; but it was at the very moment when the Irish were against us that we on political platforms were advocating the abolition of the Veto of the Second Chamber. It was not the Irish who brought that before us; we were working for it without the Irish; and whether the Scottish, or the Welsh, or the Labour, or the Irish Party have helped us or not, we have fought consistently and patiently for one object and for one object alone, and now when at last we see a chance of getting that object achieved we are not going to relinquish the fight. The action of the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition and of those who followed him when they went into the Lobby and defeated the Finance Bill of the Liberal Government in 1909 was the drop that caused the cup to overflow, and by that action they signed the death warrant of the enemy of Liberal legislation.<lb/>
The noble Lord opposite, Lord Ashtown, said that we should not want a Second Chamber if we once passed the Veto Bill. I do not know whether he is aware of the provisions of the Veto Bill. But this is not the time or the moment, of course, to go into that. Perhaps he is aware of them. I was sorry to hear the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, say what he did in reference to occupying a place in the Second Chamber if the Veto Bill passed. He used very strong language with regard to that. Men sometimes use strong language and repent of it afterwards. I cannot imagine, even if the power of Veto was limited in this House, why any noble Lord should not be as proud to sit in the Second Chamber as he is at the present moment. And, my Lords, let me say this. I and other noble Lords on this side have sat here in a degraded position ever since we have been in this House. Those who, like myself, have remained for all these years members of a small minority when our Party is in power in another place, knowing that when our Reform Bills are brought here they will be either mutilated or rejected, will not at all events complain when that sting is taken away from this House, and when the House is placed on a sure and stable basis. Nay, more than that. When the cause of the unpopularity of this House has been removed, the House will at least have what it has never yet had, or at any rate
<col>538</col>
has not had for the last fifty years, not only the esteem and the confidence but even the affection of the people of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01092">[<i>The sitting was suspended at twenty minutes to eight o'clock and resumed at a quarter past nine.</i>]</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01093"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in rising to support the Bill which the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition has brought forward, I would like to say at once that it appears to me to be the logical outcome of the Resolutions which we agreed to last year. In agreeing practically unanimously to those Resolutions confirming the principle that a Peerage should no longer of itself confer the right to a seat in this House we committed ourselves to some drastic changes in the constitution of this House. Now that these proposals have taken more concrete form, noble Lords opposite and some noble Lords on this side of the House find themselves in disagreement with those proposals. It appears to me that any reform of this House must affect very seriously the position of many of its members, and it certainly cannot be agreeable to those of us who are in danger of losing our seats to contemplate the passing into law of this Bill or any other Bill containing similar proposals. But although I have not had the honour of a seat in this House for any very lengthy period, I have had sufficient experience of business within its walls to know that votes are given in this House on grounds of public policy, and are not dictated by any personal or private motives.<lb/>
Many demands have been made on your Lordships to sacrifice your own personal views, and such demands have not been made in vain. The demand which is now being made by the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, in this Bill was really formulated and acquiesced in last year when we passed the proposals put forward by Lord Rosebery. I am, I confess, surprised at the manner in which this Bill has been received by noble Lords opposite. For some years the Party which noble Lords opposite represent have been going about the country inveighing against this House, abusing it up hill and down dale&#x2014;many of them, perhaps, with a view of eventually finding themselves in this House&#x2014;on the ground that the majority of your Lordships hold your seats in this House in virtue of heredity. Even Cabinet Ministers have
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0274"/>
<col>539</col>
been eager in fanning the flames of prejudice. We have not forgotten how the Chancellor of the Exchequer performed a pilgrimage through the country in order to arouse prejudice against the hereditary principle. At Limehouse his language, as far as I remember, was somewhat strong. At York and at Newcastle it became stronger, and at Wolverhampton I think it reached the limit.<lb/>
This campaign of prejudice has naturally had its effect on the people of this country. They have been taught to believe that the hereditary principle stood in the path of progress, and that there were certain anomalies in this House which ought to be removed; but more than that, they have been tricked into believing that the abolition of the hereditary principle was what Radical politicians were aiming at. On our side this has very naturally led to our trying to meet the Liberal Party. In this Bill we offer to remove all the grievances which the Radical Party have made so much capital out of at recent elections, and what is the result? The result is a complete change of front on the part of our political opponents. We offer to remove the hereditary right of a Peer to sit in this House. Noble Lords opposite rise one after another in support of the hereditary principle. We offer to reconstitute this House so that there shall be a fair representation of both political Parties. Speech after speech has been delivered from the Government Benches supporting the composition of this House as it stands. I am surprised that these noble Lords who are so strongly in favour of the hereditary principle have not raised their voices in protest at the gross misrepresentation which has been taking place at recent elections.<lb/>
Then we have the speech of the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor. I feel somewhat diffident in referring to his speech as he is absent, but I will be very careful to quote his words exactly. Last night the noble and learned Lord had a kind word to say for the hereditary principle, and he informed us that in his opinion the people of this country are not opposed to that principle, provided they secure fair play. It seems to me that the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition has indeed gone very far in securing to the people that fair play to which they are entitled. I do not say that it conforms to the definition of fair play which is evidently
<col>540</col>
held by His Majesty's Government. The Lord Chancellor quite clearly gave their definition of fair play. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"We, the Liberal Party, would have no means of enforcing our wishes in the case of differences of opinion."'</quote>
It is obvious that a Bill of this kind which reconstitutes one House of Parliament cannot possibly come into operation during the present Parliament, or until after a Dissolution and a General Election had taken place. If that General Election resulted in an increased Radical majority, the verdict of the country would be reflected to a considerable extent as regards over two-thirds of the membership of the reconstructed House, and might very easily result in a Radical majority in this House. I think that is a sufficient answer to the criticism which the Lord Chancellor levelled at Lord Lansdowne's Bill in regard to the fair play which would be shown to our political opponents under that Bill.<lb/>
In order to show the complete change of front which has been executed by the Radical Party I would quote, with your Lordships' permission, some words of the Prime Minister. Speaking in the House of Commons the night before last he said&#x2014;
<quote>"The hostility of the people to the House of Lords, and their demand, that this Bill should be passed into law before anything else is done, is not due to any academic or abstract dislike of the hereditary principle. People are quite content to acquiesce in the hereditary principle, whereas in the case of the Monarchy it fits in and performs an efficient function in the operation of democratic government."</quote>
How does this compare with other Radical utterances of former days? What about "rats in a trap"? What about "first of the litter"? What about all the vulgar abuse of the Peers which was used so effectively at the recent elections? I would like to ask noble Lords opposite how often their Party are going to change their minds? Their attitude up to now has been one of avowed hostility to this House on the ground of the unfair composition of this House. They have said to us in effect, "We cannot allow you to carry out the natural functions of a Second Chamber until the unfairness of your composition has been redressed." That is, presumably, the meaning of the Parliament Bill with its Preamble, if it means anything at all. But now the Radical Party turn round and say to us in regard to this Bill, "We cannot allow you to be reformed because we do not intend that you should
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0275"/>
<col>541</col>
exercise the proper functions of a Second Chamber." According to the Prime Minister's words which I quoted just now we apparently have to "perform an efficient function in the operation of democratic government." I confess I do not understand what those words mean, and I have no doubt that if I were to ask the Prime Minister himself he would deliver a very clever peroration which would leave me equally in the dark as to what he does mean. But we know that, as regards the people, under the Parliament Bill which is about to appear in this House they will lose the only control they possess at present over the legislation of this country.<lb/>
The great objection on the part of the Radical Party to Lord Lansdowne's Bill was voiced last night by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. He said that there would be no escape for the House of Commons except by the Referendum. Well, the only checks upon the arbitrary power of the Cabinet which we would impose are Joint Sessions for the settlement of ordinary disputes between the two Houses of Parliament, and the Referendum where the differences between them are exceptionally grave. It is, therefore, to these democratic safeguards to which the Lord Chancellor and his Party take exception. The provisions of this Bill combined with these safeguards would give an effective Second Chamber and an effective method of settling disputes between the two Houses. It may, of course, be desirable to modify some of the provisions in this Bill. I confess that I should like to see representatives of the other great religious denominations included in a reconstituted House. I should also like to see the qualifications somewhat widened. It appears to me that it should be possible to elect any man of undoubted financial experience and ability. I think there are several in this House whose knowledge of finance makes them pre-eminently desirable members of a Second Chamber. The great increase in our local and Imperial expenditure, in fact the extravagance which has been indulged in since the present Government came into power, renders it doubly desirable that these men should be qualified for election to a reconstituted House; more particularly does this apply in regard to local expenditure which is not subject in the other House to the same safeguards which attach to Bills affecting Imperial
<col>542</col>
expenditure. When I remind your Lordships that in the first year of office of the present Government our local expenditure increased by over &#x00A3;2,000,000, and our local debt increased in the first year by over &#x00A3;20,000,000, your Lordships will be inclined to agree with me that the financial powers of this House, such as they are, should not be lightly thrown aside.<lb/>
To turn to the criticism which has been directed against this Bill. The noble Viscount the Leader of the House said that 350, or even 200, members seemed too large a number to carry out the duties of this House, and I think he said they ought to be reduced to about 100. May I ask the noble Viscount how he proposes to carry on the Private Bill work of this House? It seems to me that 350 is really quite the smallest possible number to carry on all the Committee work and the various duties which attach to a Second Chamber. Then the noble Viscount made another criticism which I confess surprised me. He suggested that a slur would be cast on an ineligible Peer under this Bill. I presume he meant a Peer who did not succeed in being elected to this House. I would ask the noble Viscount in what way would the position of that Peer be worse than that of a defeated candidate for the House of Commons? Take the case of the present Home Secretary, Mr. Winston Churchill, who was rejected by the electors of North-west Manchester, and was forced to take refuge over the border. I do not think that the noble Viscount opposite can say that any slur attaches to the Home Secretary, and as regards his material prospects being effected I think his present position in the House of Commons is sufficient answer to that.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0008P0I0276"/>
<col>543</col>
grievances which they talk about so much. Adverting to what I said in my earlier remarks as regards votes being given in this House on public and not on private or personal grounds, I venture to believe that the vast majority of your Lordships will put first and foremost in this controversy the necessity for an effective Second Chamber, and it is because I believe that the Bill which is before us now has been framed with that end in view, that I propose to give my support to the noble Marquess who has brought it forward.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01096"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I find myself in the position of one who cannot well give a silent vote upon the Second Reading of this Bill. For my own part I share the views of those referred to by the noble Marquess when he introduced this Bill as being desirous of going further than the proposals contained in the Bill. I do not think that this Bill goes far enough, either to have any chance of acceptance by a majority in the country, or to secure to supporters of double-Chamber government a position in which they can make any real stand. What I do wish to see is the creation of a Second Chamber strong enough in the confidence of the nation to exercise all the powers of the existing House of Lords, and I do not believe the creation of such an Assembly to be possible save on a purely elective basis.<lb/>
I attach no great importance to retaining a shred of the hereditary principle and that partly in order to secure the subordination of the reformed Second Chamber to the House of Commons. Moreover, the retention of that shred of the hereditary principle necessitates an invidious form of selection, which to me is more objectionable than the frank surrender of all hereditary rights in favour of an elected Second Chamber. I am not alarmed at the prospect of an elected Second Chamber claiming co-ordinate rights with the House of Commons, provided always that the differences between the two Houses are referred for settlement to the judgment of the constituencies. If your Lordships pass the Second Reading of this Bill it does not seem likely that any legislation will ensue, because the Government have told us that they will not accept the Bill in any shape or form. I intend to vote for the Second Reading of the Bill, because it is a concession to the necessary principle of reform.</membercontribution></p>
<col>544</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01097"><member>THE EARL OF LEVEN AND MELVILLE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I trust that your Lordships will forgive me for venturing to address you so very shortly after becoming a member of this House and with such little political experience on a subject so grave as that which is contained in the Bill introduced by Lord Lansdowne. It has been said many times during the course of this debate, and perhaps most notably by Lord Rosebery this evening, that there is no use in discussing this Bill because it can never become law during the life of the present Parliament. With all respect I venture to differ from that expression of opinion. It does seem to me that an object has been attained by the discussion of this Bill. Whether or not the Bill is the best possible solution of this difficulty, it is at least an expression of a definite intention to do something towards the reform of the Second Chamber. The contrast has now been emphasised between the objects of noble Lords who sit on this side of the House and what is proposed by noble Lords who sit on the other side of the House, or, at any rate, on the Front Bench.<lb/>
The leaders of the Opposition have brought forward a definite scheme for the reform of the Second Chamber. They have proved thereby that they do intend to do something in that direction, and the proposals which they have brought forward amount to a declaration that they would accept any scheme whatever for the reform of the Second Chamber rather than no scheme. I think it was Lord Selborne who emphasised that the most when he spoke. We have, on the other hand, the policy in this respect of noble Lords opposite. They propose, as an alternative to the noble Marquess's scheme, their own Parliament Bill. They have expressed absolutely clearly their intention to bring forward that Bill as an alternative to Lord Lansdowne's Bill, but I do not think they can seriously maintain that the Parliament Bill is a Bill for the reconstitution of this House. It does not deal with the subject of reconstitution. It has nothing whatever to do with it. Is it possible to maintain seriously that a Bill which leaves this House with precisely the same numbers as it has at present, and those numbers having less power than at present, is a Bill which reconstitutes this House? It is not sense to say so, and with all respect I do not suppose noble Lords opposite will venture to say it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0277"/>
<col>545</col>
The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, made, I understood, some sort of complaint, the leaders of the Opposition having asserted that they wished to meet the Government in some form of agreement with regard to their proposals for the reform of the Second Chamber, that one of them, I think Lord Curzon, had said that his attitude towards the Parliament Bill was one of uncompromising hostility. I understood the noble Viscount to insinuate that there was some sort of inconsistency. He contrasted the two statements&#x2014;that the Opposition wished to meet the Government in agreement, and at the same time would not go any step towards agreeing to the Parliament Bill. I venture to say that there is no inconsistency of any kind in those two statements. The two Bills deal with altogether different subjects. There is no connection whatever between a scheme of reform and a scheme which proposes to abolish the Second Chamber, or, at any rate, to reduce it to a mere shadow of its former self.<lb/>
I would like to see noble Lords on the Front Government Bench come down to this House in a really honest and, downright spirit and say what they really mean. They have a very good example of what they should do in this respect in the case of the man who governs them at this moment&#x2014;I mean Mr. John Redmond. If they followed that example they would come down and say honestly that they would vote for a thing of which they did not approve because it would lead up to something of which they did approve. If they did that, it seems to me they would be doing something much more honest than they are doing now. Mr. Redmond has frequently said he has voted for things&#x2014;for instance, the Budget of 1909&#x2014;of which he did not approve, because he thought that by so doing he would obtain a more important and ulterior object which he wished to obtain. If the Government's leaders would come down and say they are going to vote for the Parliament Bill, not because they approve of it in itself, but because by its means they wish to do other things which are in their opinion for the good of the country, they would be saying something which is really true.<lb/>
There was one remark in the speech of Lord St. Davids which I would like to answer. He chose to scoff at the reception which had been accorded by the supporters
<col>546</col>
of the noble Marquess to his Bill. Did the noble Lord really think, on a subject such as this, with such difficulties as are apparent in its very nature, it was probable that there would be any sort of unanimity in a great Party like the Unionist Party? Does he think that that is a stone&#x2014;I will not discuss the sort of House in which he is going to live&#x2014;that he can afford to throw at noble Lords who sit on these Benches? I would, like to ask whether noble Lords opposite can mention any single principle or any single clause of any conceivable Bill which might be brought forward for the reform of this House on which they would have a unanimous majority&#x2014;a majority unanimous in itself&#x2014;in another place; and a majority unanimous in itself is what Lord St. Davids said was absolutely necessary for any Party who wished to bring in a Reform Bill. This debate has, at any rate, defined two policies&#x2014;first, the policy of the noble Marquess who sits on this side of the House, which implies the definite, intention to reform this House and to see that there shall be in the Constitution an efficient Second Chamber; and, secondly, the intention of the Government not to bring in any such Bill, but, on the other hand, to introduce a Bill&#x2014;the Parliament Bill&#x2014;which would prevent any such Bill being brought in. For these reasons I have no hesitation whatever in supporting the Bill introduced by the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Earl who has just sat down, and whom I wish to treat with the indulgence that the House always shows to a speaker who does not address it too frequently, must not expect to have his observations passed altogether without comment if he deliberately trails his coat for the purpose of having it trodden on, and I think he has a little done that in the remarks he made. He began by saying that he did not find in the Veto Bill any trace of the reconstitution of the House of Lords, and he could not conceive how anybody could say that the Veto Bill did effect a reform or a reconstitution of the House of Lords.

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01100"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: It is rather an unusual thing, I think, to call one Bill an alternative to another Bill, when one Bill has been before the country at least a year and a-half and the other not more than seven days. Lord Lansdowne's Bill we never saw until the other day. The Parliament Bill has had a General Election upon its actual text. I do not think, therefore, it can be quite properly said, even in this House which is sometimes a little out of touch with realities, that the Parliament Bill has been brought forward as an alternative to the Bill we are now discussing. But the noble Earl went on to say that in his opinion the reconstitution and the reform of this House had nothing whatever to do with a Bill for limiting its powers, and he added that the two things were not connected in any way. As I understood it, the gravamen of the charge made by the noble Marquess is that we are not combining the two. It is constantly contended that the two schemes ought to form part of one complete scheme. I do not know that the noble Earl is quite supporting his own Party when he says that. He finished by stating that this reform was necessary, and that he was going to support it so that the other matter should be considered, as I understood him, entirely apart from it.<lb/>
From the course of this debate I think we are entitled to assume that the Bill which is now before us definitely represents the policy of the Opposition, and is put forward officially as the Opposition policy. That has been stated quite clearly, and consequently I am in a little difficulty in regard to a sentence which I observed in a leader in <i>The Times</i> on the morning after the noble Marquess presented his Bill for First Reading. Of course, I do not wish to regard that organ as inspired, but one looks at it as expressing sentiments which as a rule are in accord with the sentiments of the noble Marquess opposite. It was a somewhat curious sentence, and it read as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"This Bill, introduced by a Peer of the purest Whig descent and tradition&#x2014;</quote>
<col>548</col>
I am not quite sure whether that was intended to be complimentary to the noble Marquess or not. If it was not intended to be complimentary, I think every one in this House will agree that it is very hard lines on him, because he has done everything that could be expected of him to support and represent his Party, and why these words are introduced except in some way to suggest that he does not represent them I do not know. But I will give the sentence again&#x2014;
<quote>"This Bill, introduced by a Peer of the purest Whig descent and tradition, is not the work of the Conservative majority of which the Government complain</quote>
I cannot for the life of me understand what is meant by that sentence. It would seem at first blush to imply that the Bill is not brought forward officially, but I take it there is no suggestion that the Bill is not official, and that it does not receive the official support of the Opposition in this House and in the country. If so, I do not quite understand why this sentence appears there. Then <i>The Times</i> goes on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"Nor is it an attempt to provide a substitute for the Parliament Bill."</quote>
It may be that by the words, "The Conservative majority of which the Government complain," they mean the Conservative majority on the Back Benches as distinct from the leaders of the Conservative Party in this House. How far the Bill has the support of that portion of the Conservative majority in this House it is a little difficult to say.<lb/>
I find again in <i>The Times</i> of May 15 a letter from Lord Wemyss expressing opinions which we should expect him to express on a Bill of this character, and possibly expressing opinions shared by a good many noble Lords who have not expressed them on the Benches opposite. But here we are, and we have this Bill to consider. As to whether it is a substitute for the Parliament Bill or not, I am sure I do not quite understand the line that has been taken upon that. We are told that it is not a substitute or alternative for the Parliament Bill. We were subsequently told, I think by Lord Selborne, that the Opposition would not in any case proceed with this Bill if the Parliament Bill were proceeded with. It is not intended to be a supplement to the Parliament Bill, or to be placed on the Statute Book if the Parliament Bill becomes law. Why it is produced at this exact moment if it is not
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0279"/>
<col>549</col>
intended to be a substitute for the Parliament Bill and to distract attention from it I do not know. We have suggestions thrown out by the Opposition over and over again to the effect that this Bill may be considered, and that a compromise may be come to, and that some agreement may be found. The noble Lord opposite, Lord Newton, complained, not without justice, that some speakers had not dealt with the Bill itself, and he himself promptly proceeded to deal with a large number of other subjects.<lb/>
I will venture to say, in passing, a word or two about the Bill itself. The scheme, if this were the time and the occasion to consider schemes for reforming this House, may be said to be a very ingenious one. I am not sure that it is not a little too ingenious and too fantastic to commend itself to the people of this country. It is rather involved and rather complex, but it certainly has the merit of ingenuity, and it has the merit of providing a certain elective element in this House, though I do not personally care about the members of the House of Commons being created as electoral colleges for the purpose of electing members to this House. The system of proportional representation also seems to have won Lord Courtney to some extent to bless the Bill. In the speech which the noble Marquess made when introducing the Bill on the First Reading and in which he gave us a most lucid exposition of its contents, he showed very great courage in quoting an observation by Lord Crewe to the effect that what was desired was to retain the power and the supremacy of this House in a way which was more creditable but not less certain. I think, as I say, the noble Marquess showed great courage in quoting that, because the majority which would be preserved for the Conservative Party under this Bill would seem capable of doing the work which is required to be done in destroying Liberal measures quite as effectively as a larger majority, and although the noble Marquess does not assent to the calculations of the much larger majority which have been made on this side of the House, he still admits quite freely that there would, under his Bill, be a majority for his Party.<lb/>
The noble Earl who last spoke was, I think, under the impression that provisions for the Referendum and Joint Sessions were included in this Bill I think I am right in saying that neither of these is included in
<col>550</col>
the Bill itself. It was pointed out the other night that if we had a majority of 120 in the House of Commons the scheme for Joint Sessions would work all right, because it would give the Liberal Party the advantage. A majority of 120 is a fairly large and exceptional majority. But I would like your Lordships to consider for a moment that if the Conservative Party had a majority of twenty in the House of Commons the whole of their legislation would go through both Houses without trouble or opposition, whereas if the Liberal Party had a majority of only twenty there they would be practically as badly off as they are now. If that be so, how can you say that the dice are not loaded? How can you say that this is really a fair scheme as between the two political Parties? It shows great courage on the part of noble Lords opposite to continue to make that assertion.<lb/>
When the noble Lord, Lord Ampthill, spoke last night he asked us to put aside our false pride as standing in the way of a settlement, and he said we might easily come to an agreement. He also made, if I understood him correctly, the remarkable statement that this House had not gone contrary to the will of the people in rejecting the Education Bill and the Licensing Bill. This, of course, we are used to as a matter of argument, but he actually went on to include in the same category what is known as the "People's Budget." If one is to go by the ordinary indications of the will of the people on a particular measure, I should think that the election which followed the rejection of that Budget showed that this House did not succeed in interpreting correctly the wishes of the majority of this country. How can this appeal be made now to the Liberal Party to put aside false pride, show themselves statesmen, and come forward and meet in some round table conference and agree to a scheme which is less distasteful to noble Lords opposite than the scheme which is now before the country? Is it not recognised that it is somewhat late to use that argument? Lord Rosebery said to-day in plain words that it is too late for that argument. You have passed the time. You cannot talk any longer about conferences and agreements and about arranging these things together. I have here comments, made by a paper which is more Tory than the Tories, of a very unfavourable character on the Bill which is now before your Lord-
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0280"/>
<col>551</col>
ships. I do not wish to trouble you with any of them.<lb/>
But I have also a curious little paper called "Misrepresentation of the People," circulated, I think, by Sir Henry Kimber. It says&#x2014;
<quote>"The Constitutional right of one House, with or without Royal Assent, to deprive the other House of its powers without its assent has yet to be considered by the people."</quote>
Do noble Lords opposite really say that the provisions of the Veto Bill have yet to be considered by the people? Can any one be found with courage enough to say that the people have not considered the Bill? It was mentioned in every election address. It was made the particular plank and the particular point of every contest, and for that Bill a large majority has been obtained in the other House. When you threw out the Budget you deliberately challenged this conflict. You said you were not afraid of the consequences, and I recollect that at the time I congratulated your Lordships upon not being afraid of the consequences. Now that the consequences have arrived, you do not like them. I ventured myself to predict, and so I think did nearly every other speaker on this side of the House, that when the consequences arrived you would not like them. Now you are all objecting to the consequences. Having given that challenge, having fought your duel and been worsted, now, when the sword is at your throat, you actually look up at your adversary and say, in the most conciliatory manner possible but really with consummate audacity, "Is not this the moment when you should give up the advantage you have gained, the victory you have achieved, and what you have pledged yourselves to carry out?" We urged you, everybody urged you, not to take the course of throwing out the Budget in 1909. Everybody warned you, noble Lords on that side of the House as well as on this side, that the consequences would be a conflict. As I have said before, this House is not as much in touch with realities and with the feelings of the country as is the House of Commons; but it really is asking a little too much, after two elections, that the policy of the Government which has been endorsed by the people should be given up because you find you are on the point of being beaten. That is what it really comes to. That is what the plain man in the country thinks about it, and
<col>552</col>
that is what he thinks about this debate. I am willing to give credit for sincerity to the noble Marquess and those who sit with him on the Front Opposition Bench, but that is what the country will be inclined to think about the debate on this Bill. People remember that the Conservative Party had ample opportunities during many years of office for proposing these reforms, and I am afraid there is no reasonable man in the country who will not connect the fact of these proposals being introduced at this late hour with the fact that a Bill depriving your Lordships' House of its absolute Veto is now on its way to the Statute Book.<lb/>
Complaint has been made that in the speech of the Lord Chancellor he said&#x2014;
<quote>"We will talk to you about the reform of the House of Lords and these other matters when our Bill is on the Statute Book."</quote>
That is not an unreasonable attitude. The Government is pledged to the people of this country to use every political expedient for the purpose of putting that Bill on the Statute Book. It is pledged to limit the powers of this House to reject and mutilate Liberal measures, and until that Bill is on the Statute Book the Government is surely justified in the action taken up. It would be a breach of faith to act otherwise. They are obliged to pursue that policy, and that policy alone. It is desired by the Liberal Party, and that desire has been endorsed by the country, to deprive this House of its power of forcing General Elections upon every Liberal Government, to deprive this House of its power of preventing Liberal Bills from becoming law.<lb/>
We are told that what we are aiming at is single-Chamber government. It is surely perfectly well known to every one here that if a Bill has passed the House of Commons in three successive years and has been discussed in the constituencies it must on the whole meet with the approval of the country. It is a somewhat severe ordeal for a Bill to go through. In saying that, I do not dissociate myself altogether from some of the observations made by Lord Courtney as to the growing power of Cabinets in the House of Commons. I think there is&#x2014;I am fortunately in the position of being able to speak without any official ties as to reticence&#x2014;something in the statement that the House of Commons is no longer so autonomous, so self-governing, as we would wish to see it. But,
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0281"/>
<col>553</col>
in spite of that, I think your Lordships will agree that you cannot get a highly contentious Bill through three separate sessions, with all the country and the newspapers discussing it, unless there is general agreement that that Bill is desired. That being so, we have a very effective and considerable check upon panic legislation. Recent instances of panic legislation have, I think, been seen in this House&#x2014;the Rosebery Resolutions, the Referendum Bill, and this Bill. Whatever may be said otherwise, I repeat that plain men in the country look upon all these as panic legislation; they look upon these powers and privileges that you are giving up as cargo jettisoned to save the House from destruction.<lb/>
So far as the Bill itself is concerned, I do not know that it is really useful to discuss its provisions at this moment. It is perfectly clear that until the Parliament Bill is disposed of this particular Bill cannot possibly receive an impartial and a calm consideration on its merits. To alter any institution as old as this House is is a matter which is not to be lightly done, and no one contemplates it with particular pleasure as an act in itself. It is very difficult for anybody to say what would be the best way of doing it. It is still more difficult for anybody to say what will be the ultimate result on political life of any particular way of doing it; but I cannot help feeling for myself, representing the plain man in this matter, that this is not the moment to discuss it. This Bill is now put forward at a moment when it cannot receive the really genuine assistance of all the members of your Lordships' House, directing their minds to it impartially, because it is being discussed as a sort of alternative to that Bill which His Majesty's Government are obliged to put on the Statute Book at the earliest moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01101"><member>THE EARL OF WICKLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should not venture to intrude upon your Lordships at this stage, but I feel that if I were to hold my tongue I should not be doing my duty to those who did me the honour of electing me as their representative to this House. I suppose we were all prepared to find in Lord Lansdowne's Bill proposals for a more or less drastic reform of your Lordships' House, and for a considerable elimination from its constitution of the hereditary principle, but I do not think that we were all quite prepared for
<col>554</col>
such a measure as the Bill now before us. For my part, if the proposals in this Bill had emanated from the noble Viscount opposite or from his colleagues I should have been surprised at their violence, but coming as they do from the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition I am amazed. I do not know whether your Lordships are prepared to express your willingness to commit political suicide upon an extraordinarily extensive scale, or whether it would be your wish to reject this Bill; but if you intend to pass it I hope, at any rate, that you will not do so without the insertion of most careful Amendments. It does not seem to be probable that this Bill will pass into law in the near future, but no doubt your Lordships will take into consideration the fact that if you give it your approval, if you allow it to pass through its several stages in this House, in its present unamended condition, it will remain upon record as an undertaking of the length to which you were prepared to go in the matter of reform, an undertaking which you might at any time be called upon to fulfil.<lb/>
It is with the aspect of this Bill as it is likely to affect Ireland and the representation of Irish Lords in this House that I am principally interested, and to which I wish this evening to draw your Lordships' attention. That representation is based upon the Act of Union between Great Britain and Ireland, and it seems to me that, because His Majesty's Government seem to propose by introducing a Home Rule Bill to tear up one half of the Act of Union, that is no reason why your Lordships should immediately proceed to tear up the other half. The proposals in this Bill will press with particular hardship upon the representation of Irishmen in your Lordships' House. The noble Marquess proposes that your Lordships, in consideration of abdicating your right to sit and vote in this House, should be allowed to return 100 members to represent you; but Lord Lansdowne qualifies his generosity by inserting at the end of the Bill a Schedule of qualifications which it will be necessary for any one of your Lordships to possess before he can present himself for election. The noble Marquess has made this Schedule very wide. It covers the highest offices which it is possible for a subject to hold under the Crown, and it covers such offices as Lord Lieutenant of a county and chairman of a county council. But I have looked in vain in this Schedule for any mention of those
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0282"/>
<col>555</col>
Peers who have already been elected as representatives of either Scotland or Ireland, and I for my part cannot see why, if a Peer has been considered good enough to be elected to represent his Peers in the past, he is not to be considered good enough under the new conditions which Lord Lansdowne proposes to set up.<lb/>
By the Act of Union Ireland was given the privilege of returning twenty-eight Peers to Parliament, and in addition to that privilege she has enjoyed representation by a number of your Lordships who, although Irishmen, are in possession of English Peerages. It seems to me that by the Bill of the noble Marquess there is very great danger that Ireland will get no representation at all. It is quite clear that any noble Lord who has held high office under the State with honour and distinction will have no difficulty whatever under the provisions of this Bill in either being elected by his Peers or securing admission into the new House which Lord Lansdowne proposes to set up by one of the other entrances provided; but it does seem to me it at it is not fair to say that a Peer holding one of the minor qualifications in the Schedule is better fitted to sit and vote in this House than one who has taken the view that duty, like charity, begins at home, and who, instead of going out to look for high appointment and honour away from home, has served his country by trying to do his duty in that stage of life in which it has pleased Providence to place him. There is an injustice in this, and I think the noble Marquess himself realised that it was hard upon the unqualified Peer, because he said that those of your Lordships who did not find a place in the Schedule and were in other respects worthy of a seat in this House would no doubt be able to secure election by one of the electoral colleges which he proposed to create under this Bill.<lb/>
That may be all very well in England, but I should like to know how many noble Lords in Ireland would be likely to be elected by electoral colleges composed of Nationalist Members of Parliament. I should like to know also how many noble Lords in Ireland, or in the South of Ireland, or anywhere out of Ulster, would be likely to get elected as Lord Mayor of a City or chairman of a county council. Take another qualification. The noble Marquess has inserted in this Schedule the qualification of chairman of Quarter Sessions.
<col>556</col>
That office is held in Ireland as a rule by a County Court Judge, so that that provision would be of no use to your Lordships in Ireland. I had hoped that when this Bill was introduced the noble Marquess would find room in it for some provision which would retain something of the principle of the Act of Union, and which would secure the representation of Irish Peers by Irish Peers elected by Irish Peers. I am not entirely without hope that your Lordships will be able, if this Bill goes into Committee, to insert Amendments giving effect to something of that kind.<lb/>
The noble Marquess also proposes that 120 members of the new House should be elected by what he calls electoral colleges. He proposes, I understand, that the country should be divided into districts, and that in each of those districts should be set up an electoral college composed of the Members of Parliament for that district, and that these Members should have the privilege of returning Peers to this House. Lord Lansdowne says he is able to contemplate with perfect equanimity the introduction into your Lordships' House of the nominees of any section of the supporters of His Majesty's Government in another place. I am sorry to say that I am quite unable to share his equanimity. I think my noble friends who come from Ireland will agree with me that if the Irish Nationalist Party is to be given the privilege of electing Peers of Parliament your Lordships' House is likely to be invaded by some very remarkable members indeed, members who, I venture to think, will not add much to the dignity of your debates or to the lustre and the ancient and honourable traditions of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
With regard to the noble Marquess's proposals about Spiritual Lords, I have very little to say; but I find myself in complete agreement with noble Lords who have said that it is a matter for regret that room could not be found for representation of religious denominations other than the Church of England. I think that the eminent divines at the head of many of the religious organisations of this country would be ornaments to the Episcopal Bench. I appreciate what the noble Marquess said about the difficulty which he found in introducing such a provision into the Bill, and I am glad to hear that he does not think that those difficulties will be quite insurmountable. I have ventured to occupy your Lordships' time
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0283"/>
<col>557</col>
at far too great a length, and I will conclude by again expressing the hope that, if your Lordships do pass this Bill, you will, before doing so, subject it to most careful and searching amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01102"><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I venture to intervene for a few moments in this debate it is not because I think my length of service in this House entitles me to give any very experienced opinion on the business of the House, but because there is probably no noble Lord who has been more constantly on public platforms during the past eleven years than I have throughout the whole of this Kingdom, and especially during the past few years; and I am perfectly certain, from the attitude taken up by public audiences on this question, that the hopes and expectations which have been aroused by the other side have derived their strength, not because the country objected so much to the powers of the House of Lords, but because they entertained some objections to its constitution. I believe that the House of Lords could have pursued exactly the action which it has pursued, and could, perhaps, have intervened with even more effect upon the policy of Governments than it has been able to do, if the country had had more confidence than it now has in the way it is constituted. Therefore I feel, if there is an alteration to be made in the constitution of this House or in the relationship of the two Chambers and their powers, that the country will be more satisfied by an alteration in the constitution of this House than by an alteration of its powers.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, told us that the whole difficulty dates from the time that this House threw out the Budget, and he ventured to correct the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, on what he termed a point of history, by telling him that the situation had been provoked by this House throwing out the Budget, and was not due to the action of the Government of which he is a member. I am afraid that the mere fact of his making that statement would induce me to pay less regard to him than I generally would on matters of history, because if he will cast his mind back I think he must acknowledge that there has been a Constitutional question simmering ever since 1832, and it was certainly brought to a climax when the present Government came into power
<col>558</col>
in 1906 and the famous "C.B." Resolutions were brought before the House of Commons. The relationship of the two Houses became an acute question from the moment the Government assumed office in 1906, and the expressed intention of the noble Viscount and his colleagues since that time has been to provoke a conflict with this House. That conflict had to come, sooner or later. If it had not come over the Budget it would have come over something else, but in any case it has come, and the Party opposite have used the occasion in order to gain power by abusing&#x2014;I do not refer to particular noble Lords who sit opposite, but certainly their friends throughout the country&#x2014;the hereditary privileges of this House which they do not propose for one moment to change.<lb/>
It is difficult to say that they have been dishonest in doing this. I have no doubt there are many on the opposite side who honestly believe that the Preamble of their Parliament Bill, which certainly has not been much amplified in the course of this debate, is a perfectly genuine thing. But it seems to me that they will find very great difficulty in going on with their reform proposals for the very same reason that they find great difficulty in indicating their position now, because they are not absolutely their own masters in the matter. They will find that exactly the same situation and the same methods which have led them to the Parliament Bill will drive them to measures which take them further. I can imagine that when the Parliament Bill is passed and this House, as no doubt it will, exercises its powers of delaying measures, there will arise a demand on the part of those who drive the Liberal Party for further action against the House of Lords. Whatever they may say about their intentions to reform the constitution of the House of Lords, they will be driven, as now, by those whose desire it is not to cripple, not to reform, but to abolish the House of Lords, out of existence&#x2014;a policy which I do not believe noble Lords opposite for one moment support. I honestly believe that they are being driven by their supporters and the Parties which keep their Government in power to a policy which must end in the absolute abolition of the House of Lords.<lb/>
The view of those who sit on this side of the House has been, from the moment
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0284"/>
<col>559</col>
that this conflict arose, that the question was to be solved by reforming the constitution of this Chamber and not by altering its powers, and it is idle to pretend that there has been any inconsistency in our attitude. There has been, as naturally there should be, differences of opinion as to the exact Bill which should be brought in, or the exact lines which should be followed; but from the very first the attitude of those who sit on this side of the House has been that if the Constitutional question had to be touched&#x2014;and I do not pretend that there was any keen desire to touch it&#x2014;the right step to take was to bring in a Bill altering the constitution of this House so that it should command more confidence from the people of this country. The general view as to the functions of Second Chambers held by the Government is shown, I think, by the attitude they have adopted with regard to the Second Chambers of our Oversea Dominions. So thoroughly had the scheme of reform been foreshadowed that what is contained in this Bill shows scarcely any striking novelty. There is hardly a provision in it, with the exception of one, which has not been indicated in previous Resolutions awl debates in this House. As far as I can discover, the only outstanding feature which is really new is that of the electoral colleges, and if that is a new feature it surely is not one which can be considered as unfair to the Liberal Party.<lb/>
The criticisms upon this Bill run upon two lines. It has been alleged that our proposals are not genuine. I do not believe that it would have been genuine not to have brought in these proposals. It has been alleged that they are complicated. Lord Curzon showed this afternoon that the composition of this House as it stands now is very complicated, and I venture to say that if you had had to put into a Bill a proposal constituting the present House of Lords, with its different sections of Peers sitting by heredity, Scottish and Irish representative Peers, Law Lords, the Bench of Bishops, and other categories, you would have required a much longer and more complicated measure than this Bill. The truth is that the moment you begin to write down a Constitution which has hitherto been unwritten you are bound to get into complications and difficulties. And if this scheme is complicated, where
<col>560</col>
is the simpler scheme which noble Lords opposite would put in its place?<lb/>
It has been alleged that the scheme put forward by the noble Marquess is a partisan one, and does not give the Liberal Party a real chance of a majority. I do not wish to go to the extent of counting heads, which seems to be the Liberal idea of electing an impartial Assembly, but on the best computation by the promoters of the Bill the possible or probable Unionist majority at this moment would be something like eighteen, as I understand it. If the course of the debates on three of the measures which have been thrown out during recent years&#x2014;the Education, the Licensing, and the Finance Bills&#x2014;is followed it will be seen that a number of noble Lords sitting on this side of the House did not vote against those Bills but showed their independence by voting on the other side. The truth is that there is a spirit of independence in this House far greater than is ordinarily shown in the House of Commons, and you cannot count heads here as I am sorry to say you can in the House of Commons. Further, supposing that this Bill had been the law of the land in 1906 when the present Government assumed office, who can doubt for one moment that the Liberal Party would during that Parliament have had a huge majority even in this House? At any rate, if it is alleged that the Bill in its present form would produce a House of Lords predominantly Unionist, surely that is a matter for the Committee stage which noble Lords opposite could remedy by suggestions of their own. Then it is charged against this Bill that it does not introduce sufficient of the elective element. I, for one, deprecate the introduction of any more elections, and moreover, as an old Member of the House of Commons, I should infinitely regret any step by which this House derived its authority from exactly the same quarters as the House of Commons. Any such step would force this House into a position of more and more competition with the House of Commons, and would in my opinion make the situation more acute than it is now. These sort of criticisms against this Bill are in reality points which the Government, if they chose to do so, could meet in Committee.<lb/>
In my opinion this Bill could only be brought forward as an alternative to the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0285"/>
<col>561</col>
Parliament Bill or as a supplement to another Parliament Bill. I cannot understand the attitude of those who, while believing in the double-Chamber system, say that it will be possible to pass both this Bill and the Parliament Bill. I, for one, do not care what the constitution of the House of Lords is if the Parliament Bill is to pass as it stands, line for line. I do not think it matters, and I sincerely hope, if the Government proceed with their announced intention of going on with their Parliament Bill and placing it on the Statute Book line for line, that the noble Marquess who introduced this Bill will not proceed with the Committee stage of his Bill. It is not worth while proceeding with the discussion of this Bill in Committee if the Government continue to maintain the attitude which they have hitherto maintained. When the whole of the powers of the House of Lords will have disappeared, as they will to all intents and purposes under the Parliament Bill, I think it would be an absolute waste of time for your Lordships to continue discussing the constitution of the House.<lb/>
The only Second Reading argument which has been used in this debate against this Bill has been used by the Lord Chancellor. The noble and learned Lord's argument was used with his usual courtesy but with emphasis. His argument amounted to this, that having in the tourney unhorsed his enemy three times he is now going to exercise his right to cut his throat. The noble and learned Lord announced that very politely, but very firmly. If the Government of which the noble and learned Lord is a member are really going to carry out line for line and threat for threat that policy, I am perfectly certain they will find that they cannot make changes in the British Constitution for the temporary purpose of passing Liberal measures with merely the aid of their extremists without creating a powerful reaction in the opposite direction. I, for one, am anxious to see the end of the wrangles over this Constitutional question. I would like to see a settlement on broad lines between both Parties. If I vote for this Bill, as I shall if the House proceeds to a Division, I shall vote for it, not because I believe it to be in itself ideally desirable or right, not because I regard it as in any sense a final settlement of the question, not because I feel it will in any circumstances proceed to the Committee
<col>562</col>
stage and Third Reading, but because I believe it to be a consistent and an honest attempt to deal with this great Constitutional question, and because it provides a basis whereon, if the Government were so minded, both Parties could proceed after discussion to find an agreement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01103"><member>LORD RAGLAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether I am a "backwoodsman" or not; the <i>Daily Mail</i> says I am. But although I have been for a long time a member of your Lordships' House I think this is the very first occasion on which I have ventured to address your Lordships on other than a military subject, but as I intend to vote against this Bill I do not think I ought to give a silent vote. The position in which your Lordships are put by the introduction of this Bill seems to be a very peculiar one. I should like to give a little illustration to show what I mean. About 100 years ago within a few weeks the French were besieging the city of Badajoz. The siege was feeble. The garrison was strong and in good heart, and the Anglo-Portuguese force was within a few days march when the Spanish captain surrendered the town. In order to cover his weakness, he made one stipulation&#x2014;that, the garrison should march out by the breach; but he had to make a breach himself for the garrison to march out. I venture to think that this is what the noble Marquess who introduced this Bill is asking you to do.<lb/>
At this stage of the debate, I will not dwell on the objections which are made to your Lordships' House, nor will I dwell on the reasons why these objections are largely entertained, but I do believe very thoroughly that no objection can be made or is made against the composition of your Lordships' House which could not be made with equal force against the composition of the House as proposed by the noble Marquess in this Bill. We have a sort of <i>olla podrida</i> of members chosen in half-a-dozen different ways. The thing will happen as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow, that the first time the reconstructed House interferes with some Radical measure the elected Members will get up and say that your hereditary Lordships represent nobody, that they represent the people, and that you have no business here at all. To compare very small things with great, I have had that thing happening in the Isle of Man during the past nine
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0286"/>
<col>563</col>
years since I have been there. It has been the custom for the two Houses of the Legislature to sit together at certain times, and it is always thrown in the teeth of the Upper House that it is composed of officials, that the members represent nobody, and that the People's House represents the people, and therefore the members of the other House ought not to be there at all. That would happen in your Lordships' House if you ventured to interfere with what some Radical Government would choose for the moment to say was the desire of the people.<lb/>
We have heard a good deal about the feelings of the people of this country, their objection to the hereditary principle, their wild desire to see your Lordships' claws clipped, and your House reformed in some sort of way. I do not believe there is any wild desire on the part of the people in this direction, and I am sure there is no Assembly in this country, except possibly some dilettante debating society, in which a majority of any sort could be obtained in favour of any such proposal as is seen in this Bill. In no country with a written Constitution could a change be made in the Constitution without a very considerable majority&#x2014;two-thirds or three-fourths&#x2014;and if the matter were put fairly and squarely before this country I do not believe a substantial majority of any sort could be obtained for interfering with your Lordships' House. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, said the last election took place entirely on the Veto Bill. We know how Liberal votes are obtained. One moment it is on the Veto Bill, at another it is on Home Rule, and the same thing will happen with regard to Welsh Disestablishment. They will say that the great heart of the people pines for the separation of this unfortunate Celtic race from the Church. I do not believe that the people of this country voted at the last election on the Veto Bill, which most of them had never seen and a very large number had not heard of, and I am sure none of them could have understood it if they had heard of it.<lb/>
The Bill of the noble Marquess is what I may call the apotheosis of the Conservative Agents' policy. The Unionist Party has suffered most bitterly from what I call the Conservative Agents' policy. I believe nobody knows less about the feelings of the country than the average
<col>564</col>
Member of Parliament, whether Liberal or Conservative, because he sees the feelings of the people of the country, not through his own eyes, but through the eyes of his agent and his committee, who are, of course, extreme men, and naturally have a wild desire to snatch a few votes from the other side. Therefore they say to the Member, "You say something pleasant about female suffrage, and you will pinch ten votes from the other side." The thing is done; but you never get the ten votes, and you only disgust your own supporters. This Bill represents the Conservative Agents' policy carried to extremes. I have only one thing to say in conclusion. I have the strongest possible objection to being executed. I do not consider it is the height of political wisdom to respond to such an invitation as this on the part of our opponents, "Will you come out into the street and let me cut your throat?" If I am to be executed I shall mount the tumbril with fortitude, but I shall not order the tumbril myself, nor shall I make an assignation with Monsieur de Paris.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01104"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when the noble Marquess introduced this Bill he informed us that it struck a death blow at the House of Lords as we had known it. As the noble Marquess uttered this sentence he must have felt that there, at any rate, he was certain to have the unanimous assent of his audience. I confess that when, two days after, I received a notice amongst my Parliamentary Papers informing me that on June 22 a boat would be in waiting at the steps of Chelsea Pier to convey members of your Lordships' House to Westminster Abbey, for one moment I suspected a deep-laid plot between the noble Marquess and His Majesty's Government and that the boat was meant to convey "ineligibles" for this House, not to Westminster Abbey, but to the Tower. As I listened to the speech by the noble Marquess I could not help thinking, in the first place, whether it was really necessary for him at the present juncture to introduce a Bill of this sort; and, in the second place, what were the reasons, in addition to those he stated, which made it necessary to take some action. In the third place, I was lost in amazement that he should retain for the new Chamber the name of the House of Lords&#x2014;a name which has been used by our Radical opponents to heap contempt, opprobrium,
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0287"/>
<col>565</col>
and contumely on your Lordships' position, individually and collectively; a name which the baser sort of Radical politician has not hesitated to use to insinuate that your Lordships are all responsible for the action which this Chamber takes in its judicial capacity; a name which, if I may borrow an expression made use of by the present Home Secretary, has served as a text for "clap-trap" on a thousand platforms throughout the country. And this in order to retain in the new Chamber 100 qualified members of the hereditary Peerage, nearly every one of whom would be certain to obtain nomination or election to whatever Second Chamber was set up, whether by the noble Marquess or still more so if it were brought into being by His Majesty's present advisers, for the very simple reason that they would be most anxious that those noble Lords should not obtain election to the popular Chamber.<lb/>
As I say, I wondered whether it was necessary for the noble Marquess to introduce this Bill at this particular juncture. He could not have done so with the idea of appeasing the Radical Party. The speeches from the Ministerial Benches have shown how vain would be that hope if it had ever existed. But, apart from those speeches, we all know that, although His Majesty's Ministers express an academic wish to reform this House, no Radical in his heart of hearts wishes to reform it, and, by making it more representative, to make it stronger. They are willing to leave it as it is when they have stripped it of its powers and rendered the House from their point of view innocuous. This is not stated very openly, so I was rather surprised to see it stated in a Ministerial organ, the <i>Westminster Gazette,</i> which expresses what most Radicals feel but which most of them have the sense not to put into words. This organ said something to the effect that if the Peers could not reform themselves in a reasonable manner after an earnest and strenuous effort nobody else ought to try, and it was urged that with the suspensory Veto in operation this historic Assembly might just as well be left to its own devices. Of course, I do not say that your Lordships cannot reform yourselves, but I have mentioned this to show what is the opinion of the Radical Party with regard, to reform.<lb/>
What is the view of the Unionist Party? There is no doubt that the Unionist Party do not think that your Lordships' House
<col>566</col>
needs reform because it is inefficient to carry out its duties under the Constitution. I think everybody agrees that the debates in this House are most excellent, and the Government have shown their appreciation of them by insisting in the Parliament Bill that your Lordships should criticise those financial measures upon which they will not allow you to vote, and the Private Bill business is so admirably conducted here that I need not waste your Lordships' time by referring to it further. Four and a-half years ago Mr. Balfour, speaking on the House of Lords as it is now constituted, said&#x2014;
<quote>"It stands impregnable, not merely on its historic past, but upon its present utility."</quote>
Why is there such a change? Why do we find the noble Marquess, instead of calling upon us to stand shoulder to shoulder to resist the onslaught of our opponents dealing what he himself calls the death blow to two Estates of the Realm&#x2014;the Lords Spiritual and Temporal&#x2014;who were said less than five years ago by the leader of our Party to stand in an impregnable position? The noble Marquess tells us that this course has been taken because His Majesty's Government have introduced the Parliament Bill, which would result in single-Chamber government. I fail to see what the Parliament Bill and the Bill which has been introduced by the noble Marquess have to do with each other. The Parliament Bill deals with the powers of this House; the Bill of the noble Marquess deals with its constitution; and it seems to me that His Majesty's Government would have placed Lord Lansdowne in a very awkward position if they had said&#x2014;
<quote>"Certainly, proceed with your Bill; it is not all we wish, but we will accept it as far as it goes";</quote>
if they had passed it through its various stages in the House of Commons and had then said, "Very well, we will pass it, but you pass our Parliament Bill." We know that that is not what Lord Lansdowne wishes. After all, when we complain that the Government have introduced a Bill doing away with the greater part of the powers of your Lordships' House without telling us what new Chamber they propose' to create, may we not at the same time complain that the noble Marquess has introduced a Bill dealing with the constitution of this House and does not tell us what powers he proposes to entrust to it? We have heard from Lord Curzon this afternoon more than we had gleaned before.
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0288"/>
<col>567</col>
He told us about Joint Sittings, either of the whole House or two-thirds, but really it is almost impossible to judge what the effect of this would be without seeing a Bill.<lb/>
Then we are told that in extreme cases we are to have recourse to the Referendum. The only Referendum Bill we have seen was introduced by a member of the late Government, but that Bill, I understand, does not obtain the approval of the noble Marquess. We have not been told whether the new Chamber is to retain its powers over finance, or to accept the Veto Bill with a saving clause as to "tacking." This seems to me one of the most important things for us to know, because in my view it is absolutely essential that any Second Chamber which might be created should have the same power over finance which your Lordships' House now possesses. I believe that the credit of the House of Lords never stood higher in the estimation of the country than in January, 1910. It had shown that it was a strong Chamber, because it took strong action and referred to the electorate a Bill which it believed to be injurious to the best interests of the country. Your Lordships know the result. There was a turnover of 200 votes in the House of Commons. The Irish Members were open to bargain for their votes, but it was known that they disapproved of the Finance Bill, and their constituents also disapproved. Therefore your Lordships' action secured the approval of the majority of the constituencies in the Kingdom. I, for one, expected that with 100 new Unionist Members in the House of Commons most of them would have striven to take the opportunity of explaining the reasons why they objected to the Budget, and also why their constituents had withdrawn their support from the Government. But what happened? The Budget Bill was rushed through under the closure with hardly a protest from the Unionist Benches, on the plea that the Government must be carried on. And when the Bill reached your Lordships' House I hoped that our leaders would have explained that the action of the House of Lords had been amply justified, and that they bound themselves, when the Unionist Party returned to power to repeal at any rate those portions of the Budget which proved most damaging to the industries of the country. When this did not happen I, for one, felt that the House of Lords was doomed, not because of the action they had taken with regard to the Budget, but because the Unionist Party
<col>568</col>
after the election did not back up the House of Lords in its action.<lb/>
May I say a few words as to the Bill itself? It seems to me that it either goes too far or does not go far enough, and in view of the speeches which have been made during the past year by Unionist Members of Parliament I am inclined to think it does not go far enough. I have already expressed my disapproval of the retention of 100 hereditary Peers on the ground that they would be almost certain of election in any other Second Chamber which might be created; but in addition I would like to criticise the Schedule at the end of the Bill which states the qualifications for elective Peers. We profess to be a great commercial country. Our commerce is unrivalled, and yet noble Lords who may be called captains of industry cannot, as such, become qualified for election here. A noble Lord may have been chairman for many years of one of our great railway companies, such as the London and North Western or the Midland; he may have been a representative of great banking interests in the City&#x2014;but as such he has no right to be elected to your Lordships' House. At the same time a Peer who had once been returned a Member of Parliament by a majority of ten in January and rejected by the same constituency in December of that year would have a right to stand for election.<lb/>
I do not desire to bring the wrongs of Ireland into this debate. That subject has already been dealt with by the noble Earl, Lord Wicklow, who showed clearly that noble Lords from Ireland had not the same opportunity of becoming qualified for election to this House as is now enjoyed by those of your Lordships who live in England and Scotland. It is impossible for any of us to succeed, unless we live in the north of Ireland, in becoming Members of Parliament. We cannot take any part in county business, municipal affairs are out of the question, and it is impossible to become chairman of Quarter Sessions because by Statute that office must be occupied by a County Court Judge. One word, in passing, as to the clause, which does away with the rights of Irish and Scottish representative Peers. It seems to me that this is tampering with the treaties of Union between the three countries, and may prove a very dangerous precedent for future legislation.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0289"/>
<col>569</col>
As to the second category, Peers who are to be elected by electoral colleges, I must say it is rather <i>infra dig.</i> that members of a reformed Second Chamber should owe their election to members of the House of Commons. It seems to me it would put them in a false position. Here, again, I would like to say a word about Ireland. Under this Bill, as I understand it, twelve Lords of Parliament are to be elected by Ireland, of whom ten would be chosen by the Nationalist Members. If those ten were chosen by the Nationalist Members to the present House I think they would show their contempt for this House by electing what we call "corner boys." But the number might be filled up by the choice of ten members of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, which would then have a larger representation in this House than the Church of this country. Much criticism and censure has been passed upon the Prime Minister for the intention which is attributed to him of, under certain circumstances, advising the Sovereign to create 300, or 400, or 500 Peers, but the Bill of the noble Marquess creates 220 at once, and every three years there is to be an additional fifty-five. It is doubtful what these Lords of Parliament are to be. I shall be told that, at any rate, they are not hereditary Peers. I have heard it suggested that when Mr. Jones becomes a Lord of Parliament he may become Lord. Grosvenor Square, but when his term of office expires he will revert to the appellation of plain Mr. Jones. The noble Earl, Lord Carrington, said last night that he did not pretend to understand women, but I feel confident that Lady Grosvenor Square will not be so ready as her distinguished husband to resume the name of Mrs. Jones. It seems to me that ere long the country will be over-run with a number of live Peers greatly exceeding in number those which His Majesty's Government propose to create.<lb/>
Now I come to the last category, the nominated Peers, and here at last I am glad to say I find myself in cordial agreement with the noble Marquess who introduced this Bill. For it seems to me that if the House of Lords is to be done away with, it is only in a nominated Chamber that we can hope to secure a fair representation of Parties and men of sufficient independence to become members of that Second Chamber, and at the same time not to claim equal authority with the House
<col>570</col>
of Commons. I would go much further in this direction than does the noble Marquess. I would like to see an equal number of members of the nominated Senate oppointed by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, and all vacancies which occurred subsequently filled up by the Prime Minister of the day. It may be said that this would give us ere long a Radical majority in this House, but I candidly confess that I am not very much afraid of noble Lords who have been sent to this House by Radical Prime Ministers as long as they are here in their private capacity. It is only when they become Ministers that I consider them dangerous, and the reason for that is that the Government is ruled by its extreme members, and consequently noble Lords may, very rightly of course as members of the Government, have to defend and further measures in this House which they may have done their best to modify or stop altogether in the secrecy of the Cabinet.<lb/>
When I look upon noble Lords on the Front Bench, I am reminded of a Scottish story. An old Scottish lady was very ill, when news arrived that her only son, a soldier, had been taken prisoner in one of the Chinese wars and been dragged to Peking, where he was languishing in durance vile, chained to another prisoner. This news was broken very gently to the old lady, but the only remark she made was, "God pity the chiel that's chained to our Davy." When I think of noble Lords on the Front Government Bench chained to a distinguished Statesman of the same name and dragged through the purlieus of Limehouse I am sometimes inclined to utter with respect to them the pious ejaculation of that Scottish dame. Up to the present time the Unionist Party has defended the House of Lords. If it ceases to do so, the House of Lords must go, but I, for one, should be very sorry if this were so and I think there are many who will agree with me, because I believe that this House has filled, and is still capable of filling, an honourable position in British history. But if it has to go, do not let us attempt to place new wine in old bottles or to dignify by an historic name a new Assembly less than one-third of whom would be hereditary Peers elected by other Peers, the majority of whom you will yourselves have declared to be unfitted to sit in the reformed Chamber.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01105"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALIFAX</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have three observations to make with regard to this Bill. As far as I have been able to follow the course of the debate, it appears to have been assumed that it is impossible to have real representation without election. I would ask if this is really the case. Does the present House of Commons, to give a concrete example, adequately represent all the different constituent elements that make up our national life? He would be a bold man who said that his experience led him to that opinion. Will any one pretend that the House of Commons more truly and completely represented the opinion of the country in regard to the various Education Bills that were introduced by His Majesty's Government than this House did? Were that question submitted to the constituencies in such a way that it was not complicated by other matters I have no kind of doubt what the answer would be. Let me draw your Lordships' attention to a passage in the first volume of Lord Beaconsfield's life. I think they are words which are well worthy the attention of this House&#x2014;
<quote>"In our effort to get rid of representation without election, it will be fortunate if eventually we do not discover that we have only obtained election without representation."</quote>
I come to my second point. Lord Curzon, if I heard him aright, spoke of the necessity of maintaining as far as possible the ancient traditions and historical continuity of your Lordships' House. There is one portion of your Lordships' House, the most ancient portion of it, which does not owe its seats in this House to hereditary right and which constitutes one of the Estates of the Realm&#x2014;the Lords Spiritual. I venture very seriously to express the hope that when such a Bill as we are now considering comes to be considered in detail more regard may be given to that Estate of the Realm. The noble Marquess, in introducing this Bill, gave reasons why representatives of the Established Church of Scotland, of the Roman Catholic body, and of the great Nonconformist communities would not, under the provisions of this Bill, find seats in this House as it is proposed to reconstitute it. I was unable to see the force of the noble Marquess's reasoning. It seems to me that if there is to be such a reconstituted House as has been suggested to us, it would be desirable that the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the President of the
<col>572</col>
Wesleyan Conference, the Archbishop of Westminster and others should find seats in that House. They would represent great interests, and I am at a loss to understand why there should be an objection to such persons finding, a seat in this House because&#x2014;I am not mentioning in this Connection the Archbishop of Westminster&#x2014;they would individually only sit in that House for the period of one year. What can it signify, so long as they represent the bodies with which they are connected, whether it is the same or different individuals who discharge that duty?<lb/>
In the third place, I desire to endorse what was so admirably said by the Duke of Northumberland in his speech yesterday. What can we predicate of public opinion except this, that what it is to-day it will not be to-morrow? Is there anything in this world more changeable or more uncertain than public opinion? That being the case, I hope that when we come to consider the details, either now or later, of such a Bill as is now before your Lordships' House, we shall consider much less the advice of political organisers and what may be thought advantageous at the next election, and a great deal more what may assist in the formation of a really strong Second Chamber, and what we believe to be for the real and permanent interests of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01106"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Newton, described the Resolutions of this House as being in the nature of an I O U, whereas the Bill now before your Lordships' House was in the nature of current coin of the realm. By voting for the Second Reading of this Bill I feel that your Lordships are laying upon the table coin of the realm without having any idea what you are going to get in return. Personally, I would be prepared to support the Bill of the noble Marquess or any other measure which might be brought forward if it offered that solution of the question which I and many others in this House think is the only possible solution, and the only solution worth striving after&#x2014;that is, that there should be, of some kind or other, a strong Second Chamber that could take that place in the Constitution of this country which a Second Chamber, according to all accepted theories, should occupy. The Government, as far as I suppose any of us know, intend to force
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0291"/>
<col>573</col>
the Parliament Bill, if possible, through this House, and place it upon the Statute-book. If that is done, there is little or no use in proceeding with the Bill of the noble Marquess, because when that is done there will be nothing left of the House to reconstitute at all, nothing, at least, in the opinion of those who take the view that the Constitution of the country is worth fighting or contending for.<lb/>
The Government have started upon a violent revision of the Constitution. I should like to ask them if they have really thought of all that it means to a great many of us? They are substituting in this country for an unwritten Constitution, to which we had been accustomed, a Constitution which will be in every sense of the word a written Constitution, and in so doing they are opening up a vista of troubles in the future, the end of which it is very difficult to foretell. As long as the Parliament Bill, with all its potentialities of single-Chamber government, lies before us, I hesitate to see the advantage of
<col>574</col>
supporting a measure which does not first of all deal with that fundamental question. It is the duty of the Government to look upon this change in the Constitution, not from a small Party point of view, but from the point of view of the good of the country. Instead of that, the present Government are abolishing the Constitution for some momentary advantage which they conceive may be useful to their Party politics. For these reasons I feel that I ought to know what we are going to get for the price, and it is a very large price, that the members of this House are being asked now to pay. Before I know that, I hesitate to pay it. But I would gladly pay it if I could feel that I was assuring to the country the inestimable boon of a powerful, efficient, and popular Second Chamber.<lb/>

<title>CANADIAN-AMERICAN RECIPROCITY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01124"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member> rose to call attention to the probable effects of the proposed Canadian-American Reciprocity Agreement on the commerce and Imperial relations of the British Empire, and to move for any correspondence or communications with the United States as to the extension to the United Kingdom or any other part of the British Empire of the tariff concessions granted to Canada, or raising the question of the bearing of this Agreement on most-favoured-nation Treaties.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01125">The noble Earl said: My Lords, the subject of my Motion covers a very wide field. I do not propose this afternoon to attempt to cover that field, but to confine my observations to one or two special aspects of it. But before doing so there are two preliminary observations which I should like to make. It is a matter of agreement between all political Parties in this country that we have no concern with the domestic politics of Canada. It is the birthright of the Canadian people within the British Empire to work out their own national salvation, and any criticisms or anxiety that may occur to us do not arise from Canadian matters or from the action of Canadian statesmen in connection with Canadian affairs. But where the action of one part of the Empire has an effect or influence on the United Kingdom or on other parts of the Empire, we have the right, indeed the responsibility, to consider the situation which may have arisen. The second observation I would make is in respect of the United States of America. Here, again, the members of all political Parties in this country are in accord. We have no greater desire than for a permanent friendliness and perfect understanding with the United States of America. But the Americans regard us&#x2014;it is one of the unfortunate accidents of history&#x2014;as a foreign country, whereas the Canadians do not, and that exactly explains the difference in our attitude towards Americans and towards Canadians. If I have the privilege of the personal friendship of one of your Lordships who is no relation of mine, it is no derogation to that friendship if I have a still greater concern and interest in all that appertains to my own brother. That exactly is the difference between our feelings towards America and our feelings towards Canada.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01126">I must refer to a remarkable speech made by President Taft only a few days ago. I
<col>578</col>
have the report as published in the <i>Standard,</i> dated New York, April 28, and as I have seen no correction of that report I think I am entitled to regard it as substantially correct. This is what President Taft is reported to have said&#x2014;
<quote>"This is a critical time in the solution of the question of Reciprocity. It is a critical time because unless it is now decided favourably to Reciprocity it is exceedingly probable that no such opportunity will ever again come to the United States. The forces which are at work in England and in Canada to separate
Canada by a Chinese wall from the United States and make her part of an Imperial commercial band reaching from England round the world and back to England again by a system of preferential tariff will derive impetus from the rejection of this Treaty. If we would have Reciprocity we must take it now or give it up for ever."</quote>
Later on President Taft said&#x2014;
<quote>"Annexationist talk is bosh. Every one who knows anything about it realises that it is bosh. It should not enter into the consideration of serious men engaged in solving a serious problem."</quote>
We all, of course, without the slightest hesitation or reservation, accept what the President says about the cry of annexation, which was raised in Congress by a prominent American politician. Therefore we say absolutely nothing more about that.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01127">But I must say a word about the Chinese wall. That allusion shows a complete misapprehension of the ideas of those in this country who are in favour of Tariff Reform and the policy of Preference. It has never entered our minds, it is no part of our policy, to establish a Chinese wall between any part of the Empire and the United States or any other friendly country. On the contrary, we have always recognised that the exact fiscal needs of the different parts of the Empire differ and will differ, and we have no desire to prevent those parts of the Empire from entering into suitable Agreements with foreign countries any more than we have a desire to prohibit ourselves from doing so. But our contention is that the basis of such Treaties must be, first of all, Preference within the Empire between the different parts of the Empire, and then that each part of the Empire, with its own tariff, should be in a position, as I will describe presently, to make its own particular arrangements with foreign countries. Never have we for a moment desired to see a Chinese wall erected between any part of the Empire and the United States. Indeed, there are only two instances of which I have any recollection that might fairly be described as a Chinese
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0294"/>
<col>579</col>
wall in tariffs, and they were associated with the names of Mr. McKinley and Mr. Dingley, and as far as my recollection serves me neither of those was a British statesman.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01128">Before I go on to the special aspects of this Reciprocity Agreement to which I wish to draw your Lordships' attention, perhaps you will allow me to remind you that there are, roughly speaking, two classes of trade arrangements which countries make between themselves. In foreign countries trade arrangements are the result either of direct negotiations based upon the tariffs established by those countries, or of such advantages as arise automatically from favoured-nation Treaties. Our country has no such tariffs, and cannot, in consequence, engage in negotiations of that kind. Any advantage, therefore, which we enjoy beyond those arising automatically from Treaties is limited to the benefits which may be incidentally derived from the negotiations of other countries, those negotiations being carried out not in the interests of Great Britain but entirely in their own. That reminder is necessary as an introduction to the remarks that I am going to make. It appears from that that we depend mainly, though perhaps not entirely, on what is called the most-favoured-nation clause in our Treaties. And here it becomes important to remind your Lordships that this great clause&#x2014;the most-favoured-nation clause&#x2014;has been interpreted in two ways. One interpretation is that of our own country, followed not only by the whole of the Empire but practically adopted by all the Western nations; and then there is the interpretation which I believe is confined to the United States of America. The interpretation which <i>is</i> placed by Great Britain on most-favoured-nation treatment is as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"Favoured-nation countries&#x2014;that is, countries which have favoured-nation Treaties&#x2014;must grant to the United Kingdom every tariff concession which they extend to other countries."</quote>
That is a very simple and intelligible interpretation of the clause.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01129">There are many such Treaties, but so far as the Dominions are concerned, or any part of the Empire outside the United Kingdom, these Treaties have been made on a system which has varied at least thrice. Before 1881 neither the Foreign Office nor the Colonial Office consulted any part of the Empire as to whether it wished or did not wish to adhere to a Treaty. They were
<col>580</col>
automatically included in it. But from 1881 until quite recently the system has been different. Clauses were inserted which allowed the self-governing Dominions of the Empire either definitely to adhere to the Treaty or to express their desire not to be included. There was the positive and the negative method, but the result was the same. There was no automatic inclusion of the Dominions in the Treaty; it was left to the self-governing Dominions to decide whether they would or would not be included. But once included they were included in the Treaty for as long as it existed. There was no possibility of, we will say, Australia withdrawing from a Treaty to which she adhered so long as that Treaty
was not denounced by His Majesty's Government. Quite recently a third system has been introduced. I had thought till a day or two ago that the Japanese Treaty recently made was the first example of this new system, but I have been told that a Treaty made with Roumania about three years ago was an earlier example. The system which at any rate obtains in the new Japanese Treaty is this. The Dominions are given, not only the opportunity of adhering or refusing to adhere, but also the opportunity of denouncing their position in the Treaty without involving any action on the part of any other portion of the Empire or of the United Kingdom. I may not be absolutely accurately informed, but I believe there are no fewer than 130 such Treaties to which the United Kingdom is a party, and to 44 of these Treaties the Dominions or Colonies are parties&#x2014;not always the same Dominions or the same Colonies, but, as it were, in different groups according to their recent decisions to adhere or not to adhere. But the central fact remains, that there are no fewer than 130 of these Treaties which affect the United Kingdom, and of those 44 affect other parts of the Empire in different groups.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01130">If you will be good enough to bear with me and keep these facts in mind, I would ask you to follow me still further in considering the history of this Agreement, which is now being discussed in the Canadian Parliament and in the American Congress. The starting-point of our consideration must be the tariff which Canada adopted only a few years ago. That tariff had three sections&#x2014;the general tariff, the preferential tariff to the British Empire, and the intermediate tariff. The first thing that occurred after this tariff had been made and
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0295"/>
<col>581</col>
the preferential treatment of the British Empire secured under it was a desire on the part of the Dominion Government to conduct negotiations with France for a Treaty of Commerce. And here we come, I think, to what was a new stage, a fresh precedent, in what I may call Dominion diplomacy. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs appointed two Canadian statesmen, Mr. Fielding and Mr. Patterson, plenipotentiaries to negotiate this Treaty of Commerce with France. I make no comment on that fact; I merely note it as a sign-post in the diplomatic experience of the Empire. The Canadian Government wished for certain concessions from the Government of France, and the return they were prepared to make to them was the Canadian intermediate tariff. But the French Government would not accept the Canadian intermediate tariff. They were not prepared to give Canada the concessions she asked for in return only for the Canadian intermediate tariff, and the result was that the Canadian negotiators had to go below the intermediate tariff and give France better terms than that tariff by itself would have given. The first result of the Treaty negotiated on that basis was this, that the Imperial Preference was diminished.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01131">The second result was that Switzerland, which had a most-favoured-nation Agreement with Canada, claimed the same terms for herself under the most-favoured-nation clause as Canada had given to France, and, of course, she got them. Canada had to extend to Switzerland exactly the same concessions that had been given to France; and, of course, from that followed a further inroad on the Imperial Preference. The third result of this Treaty was that Germany was not content that Switzerland should get these concessions and that German trade should remain in the position in which it then was. Germany had not minded the concessions given to France because French trade did not in this respect conflict with German trade in the Canadian market; but directly the Preference was given to Switzerland German commercial interests were affected, and Germany entered into negotiations with Canada. No Treaty has yet been made between Germany and Canada, but a provisional arrangement has been entered into, and that provisional arrangement again, just like the French Treaty and the Swiss Treaty, has resulted in an inroad being made on the margin of Imperial Preference.</p>
<col>582</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01132">But the fourth result was the most important of all. After Germany had made this provisional Agreement the Government of the United States began to move. So far as one who has no access to inner official Papers can form a judgment, it was the action of Germany that finally brought the United States Government into the field, and the United States Government appear to have taken the field, it is fair to say since the declarations of President Taft, with a special direction against British Preference; and the result of America taking the field in these commercial negotiations with Canada is seen in the Canadian-American Reciprocity Agreement which is now being discussed in Canada and at Washington.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01133">I told your Lordships that there were only two aspects of this question which I was going to discuss, and I now come to the first of them. I have already stated that this country has 130 most-favoured-nation Treaties, and that to 44 of those the Dominions and Colonies of the Empire in varying groups were parties. Canada is a party to no fewer than 12 of those Treaties. She is included in the most-favoured-nation Treaties with Austria, Russia, Switzerland, Japan, Spain, the Argentine, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and three others, and also with France in accordance with her own recent Treaty. This is the first time, I believe, in the history of the British Empire that one part of the Empire has obtained better terms from a foreign country in respect of a part of its
commerce than those enjoyed by the United Kingdom or any other part of the Empire. According to the best calculations I have seen, if the Reciprocity Agreement was now in force nearly &#x00A3;3,000,000 worth of British produce would, by the latest figures, be subject to Import Duty, from which if they came from Canada they would in some cases be entirely free, and in others would pay considerably lower duties than would be levied in the case of the United Kingdom. Whatever our views on the fiscal question may be, I do not think there is one of us who will not feel some anxiety in respect of this precedent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01134">I make no complaint of the action of the Canadian Government. As I said before, it is the position of every one of us that Canada must work our her own salvation without having her elbow jogged by us, without any interference from us or from anybody else. But I do say that it is a
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0296"/>
<col>583</col>
precedent at which I cannot express pleasure&#x2014;that for the first time one of the great Dominions of the Empire should be on the point of receiving different treatment in respect of some of its exports from a foreign country from what similar exports from the United Kingdom or any other part of the Empire would receive. It is a precedent which may be capable of very large extension. Canada has made this Agreement with America. As I will show your Lordships presently, America is very anxious that Canada should make an even more extensive Agreement of the same kind. Canada has the same right to make a similar Agreement with Germany or with any other foreign country, and all the national rights which Canada has and which we freely admit in this respect are rights which are equally shared by Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. If this precedent should be largely followed and each one of our great Dominions, or we ourselves here in the United Kingdom, should have a series of Agreements with foreign countries according to which their or our products received more favourable treatment than the products of other parts of the Empire&#x2014;well it may be possible to imagine an Empire system of that kind, but all I can say is that it would be a different system from any which we have previously known or contemplated, and not one which I think any of us would regard without some anxiety. I would go further and say without grave anxiety, because, my Lords, the step between receiving and giving is a very short one. If our Dominions get accustomed to receiving better terms than we get from foreign countries, will it be wonderful if in time to come they think it a natural consequence to give better terms to foreign countries than they may be able to give to us or to other parts of the Empire? And if you get a general system of commercial Treaties throughout the Empire under which the Dominions are giving to and receiving from foreign countries different terms from what they are giving to or receiving from the rest of the Empire, I think it will be very difficult to see exactly how the Imperial system is going, to work. Because where commerce steps in diplomacy almost always follows; and I do not envy the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the future if this precedent should be largely followed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01135">I have already quoted President Taft's speech, but I have another quotation to
<col>584</col>
make from it, and I ask your Lordships' particular attention to these words&#x2014;
<quote>"We tendered the Canadian Commissioners absolute Free Trade in all the products of either country, manufactured or natural, but the Canadian Commissioners did not feel justified in going so far."</quote>
We tendered the Canadian Commissioners absolute Free Trade in all the products of either country, manufactured or natural! Now, what did President Taft mean? Supposing the Canadian statesmen and the Canadian Parliament had accepted those terms, that would mean that all products of America would go free into Canada and all products of Canada, manufactured or unmanufactured, would go free into America; but Canada could not give to the United States what she did not give to the British Empire. Therefore all the goods, manufactured or unmanufactured, from the British Empire would go free into Canada, and if they went free into Canada how could they fail to pass into the United States if there was complete free trade in such articles between Canada and the United States? Not only the British Empire but Canada has no fewer than thirteen Treaties with great countries giving them most-favoured-nation treatment, and therefore the free trade that Canada gave to America she would have to give to these thirteen foreign countries as well as to the British Empire. The result would be that all the products of these thirteen countries as well as the products of the British Empire would be passing freely from Canada into the United States. That would mean Free Trade on the part of the United States, not with Canada alone, but with the world. Does anybody suppose that President Taft meant that?</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01136">We all know what the American view of a fiscal policy is. It is perfectly clear that President Taft did not mean that. Did he mean that Canada should free herself from the obligations to which I have referred by leaving the British Empire? We know very well that President Taft did not mean that, because he has told us, in words which we accept without any reservation, that the talk about annexation is all bosh. Therefore we are driven back on the alternative that President Taft did not know the conditions under which the trade of Canada was conducted. He did not know the ties which bind Canada with the rest of the world, and he did not know the elements of the diplomatic situation as it affected
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0297"/>
<col>585</col>
Canada and the United Kingdom. Is there no blame on the part of His Majesty's Government that he did not so understand? Is not that the natural consequence of His Majesty's Government taking no part in these negotiations? Was not it the duty of His Majesty's Government, not only to have safeguarded the interests of the United Kingdom and the rest of the Empire&#x2014;and I will come to that point presently&#x2014;but to see that both parties to these all-important negotiations really understood all that was involved. It may be that we do not do justice to His Majesty's Government. It may be that all these things were present in their mind, that they have taken an active part in these negotiations from the beginning, and that my conclusion is wrong. That is why I move for Papers and for some information as regards the negotiations which have taken place, because up to now, except in so far as answers have been drawn from them in the House of Commons, His Majesty's Government have given us no information whatever on the course of these most important negotiations. You will see that if the United States Government accepted our interpretation of the most-favoured-nation clause the difficulty would not arise. We have a most-favoured-nation clause with America. If they accepted our interpretation of the meaning of this clause, automatically the American Government would give us the same terms at they have given to Canada.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01137">And in this connection I must draw your Lordships' attention to a letter from Mr. Harold Cox which appeared in <i>The Times</i> a few days ago. Mr. Cox quotes from our Treaty with America; and these are the words of that Treaty which govern the consideration of this question&#x2014;
<quote>"No higher or other duties shall be imposed on the importation into the United States of any articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of His Britannic Majesty's territories in Europe&#x2026;than are or shall be payable on the like articles being the growth, produce, or manufacture of any other foreign country."</quote>
According to our interpretation of language we can see no meaning attaching to those words except that put upon them by our own Foreign Office. But I understand that notwithstanding those words the United States Government do not admit, indeed repudiate, the suggestion that they are bound by that Treaty to give our products the same terms that they are giving Canadian products. I understand that
<col>586</col>
they have a formula which may be summed up in the words "Concession for concession." On that point I should like to know what the Foreign Office have to tell us. I have suggested to your Lordships&#x2014;I believe not unjustly&#x2014;that throughout the whole of these negotiations our Foreign Office has been extraordinarily supine. At any rate they must have had in mind the claim on behalf of our products for the same treatment as was given to Canadian products. I invite His Majesty's Government to tell us if they can now, or to promise Papers shortly which will put the thing clearly before the country&#x2014;I invite them in one form or another to tell us what they have done, what action they have taken, how far they have maintained our rights under what seems to us the only possible interpretation of those words, and on what grounds, if any, those claims have been denied. This Agreement between Canada and the United States is not in the form of a Treaty; it is an Agreement which has to be embodied in legislation. Has that technical point any bearing on the question of whether we are or are not entitled to get the benefit of our most-favoured-nation Treaty with the United States?</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01138">Before I pass to another aspect of this question, I should like to ask His Majesty's Government what is the opinion of the Board of Trade with regard to the effect on the importation of wheat and the milling industry in this country of this Agreement if it becomes an accomplished fact. I hold in my hand a copy of the Consular Trade Report, dated December 6 last, issued by the Bureau of Trade and Manufactures at Washington&#x2014;it is the same kind of thing as a Board of Trade circular in this country&#x2014;and I invite the attention of His Majesty's Government to this paragraph&#x2014;
<quote>"What remedial measures are practicable to protect the interests of the United States against the activities of countries that have entered as rivals for the world's grain market? British importers, to whom, the changing conditions are especially important and who have given much thought to them, are quite unanimous in the belief that measures should be adopted in the United States by which the surplus wheat of Canada should be regulated if not controlled. It is suggested that this may be brought about if Canadian wheat can be handled by the north-western mills of the United States; by them it could be converted into flour and the mixing performed in the United States which is now carried on in the United Kingdom. By this means Canadian wheat would be kept out of the British market without injury to the Canadian farmer, fluctuations in price would be removed
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0298"/>
<col>587</col>
American mills would be benefited, the export of flour from the United States increased, and all these advantages would be secured without injury to the American farmer."</quote>
The gist of that statement of the American Bureau of Trade and Manufactures is this. They regard it as very important for the American farmer and the American miller that the United States should obtain complete control of the Canadian wheat market, and that all flour now manufactured in Canada or in England should be manufactured in the United States. It is very natural that there should be solicitude in this report for the interests of the American farmer and miller. I am very glad to see that those who wrote it are also concerned for the interests of the Canadian farmer. But where does the British miller or consumer come in? I suggest to his Majesty's Government that a very large question is involved in this, and I invite them to tell the House, either now or by laying Papers on the Table, what their attitude is in this matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01139">The second aspect of this question to which I wish particularly to invite your Lordships' attention and on which I invite an explanation from the Government is how Canada and the policy of Canadian statesmen and our policy and interests are really and vitally affected by the fact that we are both parties to a series of most-favoured-nation Treaties which neither of us can denounce without involving the other. I reminded your Lordships that there are no fewer than twelve of these Treaties to which Canada and the United Kingdom are parties. Before considering how these Treaties affect the Canadian position I would discount at once an objection that may be made. It may be said, "Oh, but the trade which these particular countries at present have with Canada is small and insignificant, and therefore we need not consider it." I admit that the trade is inconsiderable, but I have pointed to what this precedent may grow when the consequences of it could not longer be considered insignificant. Nor would the matter be insignificant even now if, as President Taft has suggested, the interchange of goods on a reduced or free basis were enlarged between America and Canada. Therefore in considering this question I submit that it is no answer to say that the volume of trade between these twelve countries and Canada is too small to be a serious item.</p>
<col>588</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01140">If you consider what are the views of the Canadian statesmen, of the whole Canadian people, almost without exception, on the subject of fiscal policy, you will see how, to put it very moderately, extraordinarily inconvenient these twelve most-favoured-nation Treaties must be. Look at the matter from the view, not of a Free Trader in England, but from the view of a Protectionist in Canada. Canada in return for certain concessions makes a Treaty with France. At once there are twelve countries that can claim the same concession without giving any concession in return. Then Canada makes a Treaty with America in return for very valuable concessions, as the Canadian Government believe them to be, and thirteen foreign countries can at once, if they choose, claim from Canada exactly the same concessions without giving anything at all in return. That is all very well for a Free Trade country, but it certainly puts a Protectionist country in a position of extraordinary difficulty. I invite your Lordships to consider that there are only three possible alternatives for the Canadian Government in the matter&#x2014;alternatives which involve us, and therefore which we have a right to discuss and consider without for one moment impinging on the right, which not one of us for a moment denies, of the Canadian people to follow their own fiscal policy entirely without regard to our opinion. Supposing this Agreement with the United States becomes an accomplished fact, and that Canada elects to give to these thirteen foreign countries, if they claim it, exactly the same treatment as she has given to America. That puts us in no difficulty at all except this&#x2014;it is not a difficulty but it is a substantial loss&#x2014;that it at once makes a great fresh inroad on our preferential treatment. It affects that part of our trade very materially. It is not a matter of contention. All parties are agreed that the Preference freely given to us has been very profitable. But, apart from that inroad on the Preference which we and the rest of the Empire now enjoy, it is quite obvious that this process would make a very considerable inroad on the Canadian fiscal system. Canada would be giving, according to her ideas of tariff policy, a great deal for nothing, and at the same time would be making serious drafts upon her reserve of bargaining power in the future; and it would make it almost impossible for the American
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0299"/>
<col>589</col>
Government to extend further the advantages which it is prepared to offer to Canada. I cannot too definitely insist upon that point. The more advantages America offers to Canada, the more bricks she throws down off that Chinese wall which was erected by Mr. McKinley and Mr. Dingley between America and Canada, the more difficult will be the Canadian position in respect of these Treaties.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01141">I ask your Lordships to consider the next alternative. Supposing the Canadian Government said to His Majesty's Government, "You see our difficulties. We ask you to denounce these Treaties of Commerce." I would remind you that as long ago as 1892 there was a correspondence between Canada and the United Kingdom on this very subject. In that year both the Senate and the House of Commons in Canada adopted a Memorial to Her Majesty Queen Victoria. The Memorial pointed out objections to the system of most-favoured-nation Treaties, suggested the adoption of the principle of reciprocal concessions as between various parts of the British Empire and between the Empire and foreign nations thereby adopting the American view of favoured-nation treatment, and declared that the obligations imposed on Canada by the old Imperial Treaties were objectionable and injurious to Canada in a variety of ways. Therefore as long ago as 1892 the Parliament of Canada was already restive under the application of these most-favoured-nation Treaties. Then in 1897 the Canadian Government actually asked Her Majesty's Government to denounce two Treaties, the German Treaty and the Belgian Treaty, the reason why those Treaties were singled out for denunciation being that they alone contained a special clause making it impossible for the United Kingdom to receive preferential treatment from the Colonies, and Her Majesty's Government, I think&#x2014;that is my recollection and belief&#x2014;because of that special clause&#x2014;and really it is difficult to understand how it ever could have slipped into one of our commercial Treaties&#x2014;did denounce those two Treaties. That was in 1897.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01142">Before asking you to consider further what would be the effect if His Majesty's Government were to denounce this mass of Treaties to which I have alluded, I would remind you that, unfortunately, although the Treaty with Germany was
<col>590</col>
denounced in 1897, no fresh Treaty has been made with Germany, and I think the reason is significant. I quote from an answer given by Mr. McKinnon Wood in the House of Commons on March 27 last&#x2014;
<quote>"The main difficulty in the way of a satisfactory conclusion of a new Treaty with Germany lay in the divergence of views between the two Governments concerning the right of the Colonies to form special arrangements as between themselves and the Mother Country of which the advantages were not extended to any foreign country."</quote>
The German Empire, of course, has the right to take that line if it thinks proper, but it is a significant fact and one we should not forget. The main difficulty in the way of the conclusion of a new Treaty with Germany has been the unwillingness of the German Government to admit the right of the United Kingdom to receive preferential treatment from any of the Dominions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01143">Now what was the answer that Her Majesty's Government gave to the Canadian Parliament in 1892 when they first became restive under these Treaties? I will not trouble your Lordships by quoting more than a very brief extract from the reply&#x2014;
<quote>"In order to confer on the Dominion complete freedom in its negotiations with foreign Powers it will be necessary to revise very extensively the existing commercial Treaties of the British Empire, and a great break-up of existing commercial relations is involved in the suggestion."</quote>
I think that this language certainly does not err on the side of exaggeration. I cannot for a moment contemplate any Government in this country, with our present fiscal system, and with no tariff with which to negotiate, being willing to denounce wholesale these most-favoured-nation Treaties. Such action would lead to something very like commercial chaos. The whole British commercial world would stand aghast at such a suggestion, and it would, if accomplished, lay our commerce open, if any foreign nation chose, to the imposition of their penal tariffs. Therefore I cannot for a single moment contemplate, under existing conditions, this or any other Government being willing to denounce all these Treaties.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01144">Consequently the Canadian people are thrown back necessarily on what I submit is the only final alternative, the only third course open to them&#x2014;that is, that they should try and make a separate reciprocal Agreement with each one of those countries. Just as their Treaty with France was
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0300"/>
<col>591</col>
followed by the Agreement with the United States, so it seems to me that almost the only alternative left to Canada, if any of these most-favoured-nation Treaty countries claim the advantages given to the United States, is that they should endeavour to negotiate with them as they have done with the United States. Every such Treaty only lands the Canadian Government and people in further difficulties, because every advantage they give to any one of these twelve or thirteen countries has to be extended to all the others, and therefore it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that the more Treaties of this kind Canada makes the more hopelessly she will find herself fiscally bogged. And if that is true of Canada to-day, it would also be true of Australia, of New Zealand, or of South Africa to-morrow if the time comes&#x2014;as come it surely will&#x2014;that their trade is sufficiently valuable to make foreign countries court them and desire to make commercial arrangements with them. If these Dominions find themselves in this what seems to me real and genuine difficulty as regards the formation of fiscal relations with foreign countries, if that is the position, how can we maintain that they are absolutely free to work out their own salvation fiscally as in all other respects?</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01145">The most-favoured-nation clause has been vaunted as the sheet anchor of our fiscal system. It seems to me that that anchor is dragging, and that there is real danger of the ship of Empire getting on political rocks which have not been sighted by His Majesty's Government. To us it appears that the solution of this difficulty was remarkably foreseen by Mr. Deakin when, in the Conference of 1907, he urged, and urged very eloquently, that the right system was the establishment of a preferential arrangement within the Empire, and then that on that basis there should be joint Imperial negotiations with foreign countries. That, my Lords, represents our view. We have no responsibility for the danger into which the ship of Empire is drifting. Our policy is a policy of Tariff Reform involving a tariff as a basis from which to negotiate with foreign countries&#x2014;a preferential tariff within the Empire, and then joint Imperial negotiation with foreign countries from that basis, so that the different needs of each part of the Empire can be adjusted in its relation

to foreign countries. That is not the policy of His Majesty's Government. We know that. But I submit to them that the policy of <i>laissez faire</i> is impossible also. This is just one of those situations out of which they cannot get by simply doing nothing. If nothing is done the difficulty only becomes greater for the Dominions and for ourselves; and I have seen no sign in anything that has transpired in the other House of Parliament or in the publications we have had that His Majesty's Government understood in the least what was involved in those negotiations when they began between America and Canada. As far as I have understood, they have taken a pride in an attitude of aloofness. Not only have they said we do not interfere in Canadian matters&#x2014;an attitude which, in my humble judgment, is absolutely correct, and which we should imitate&#x2014;but they have not even taken a hand when far more than Canadian interests, when the trade and manufactures of the United Kingdom and the whole fiscal relations of the Empire, were concerned. They have stood still, and have given no proof up to now that they have in the least realised all that was involved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01146">I submit I have proved that the situation is a serious one. I think I have proved that the precedent which has been set is one which we cannot regard without anxiety. I submit I have proved that the Government cannot extricate themselves from the difficulty simply by doing nothing. I ask them to tell us what they are going to do. I invite them to tell it us now so far as they can. Of course, I know the difficulties of foreign negotiations, and if they tell us that there are certain things going on now which they cannot disclose, the responsibility must rest on them. But I do press them to promise us at the earliest possible moment to lay Papers before Parliament giving the fullest account of all negotiations that have taken place, and telling us, not only of official negotiations, but of communications which have passed between them and the Dominion or the American Government in relation to this very involved problem.</p>

granted to Canada, or raising the question of the bearing of the Canadian-American Reciprocity Agreement on most-favoured-nation Treaties.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Selborne.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01148"><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would like to express, if I may, our gratitude to the noble Earl who has just made this Motion for the manner in which he has dealt with the question. I know that the position would be a difficult one to a less experienced speaker than himself to express his views as fully and as plainly as he has expressed them without offending the susceptibilities of either of the great Dominions or nations concerned, or making it in any way difficult for the Government to play the part it is playing in these matters. I can only say that nothing the noble Earl has said has created any difficulty of that kind, and I should like to express our gratitude to him for that.<lb/>
In considering this question we have to consider, first, the particular question of fact, and, secondly, the general question of policy. The noble Earl did not devote much of his speech to the particular facts of this question. As to the figures which the case involves, I will give them in as short and condensed a form as I can. I must give them because they are very germane to the discussion. What we are discussing is the way in which this proposed Agreement may or may not affect generally the trade of this country and the trade of the Empire. In order to be able to discuss that we have to consider what the actual effect, so far as we see it at the present moment, is likely to be, and first of all how this Agreement, if it comes into being, may affect the trade of this country with Canada. Our total exports to Canada practically amount to &#x00A3;20,000,000 annually. Of that &#x00A3;20,000,000 the goods dealt with under the Agreement amount to &#x00A3;969,000, of which, however, &#x00A3;176,000 are free to all nations. We should retain a substantial preference on trade amounting to &#x00A3;477,000, leaving only &#x00A3;316,000, or 1&#x00BD;per cent. of the total, on which our preference is annulled; so that so far as that is concerned it is quite obvious that no case can be made as to the disastrous effect on the export trade of this country to Canada that is likely to be produced by this Agreement.<lb/>
<col>594</col>
As to our exports to the United States, our total exports in the year 1908&#x2013;9 were &#x00A3;43,500,000. The goods affected by the Agreement amount only to a little under &#x00A3;3,750,000, but those figures are misleading in this sense, that a great part of that amount represents goods in which Canada does not in the slightest degree compete with us. The two best instances of that are cutlery, of which Canada exports to the United States only &#x00A3;75 worth, and tinplates, of which we have a very large export and Canada an entirely negligible one. Therefore we may say that on the whole the advantages which Canada will reap relate mainly to articles in which the United. Kingdom is not a competitor. I have given those figures in order to show what you may call the material damage to the trade of this country that might ensue, even supposing our existing trade to be destroyed by the effect of the preference, which is a very doubtful and debatable point. But supposing for a moment you admitted it, the damage to our trade is bound to be very slight indeed.<lb/>
The noble Earl raised the question of other Treaties that may be affected. The best answer with regard to that is the answer which was given by Mr. Fielding in the House of Commons in Canada on February 16 last, in which he said&#x2014;
<quote>"France is a favoured-nation country to a limited extent, that is to say, as respects the lists of articles specified in Schedules B and C to the French Treaty. Twelve countries: Argentine Republic, Austria-Hungary, Bolivia, Colombia, Denmark, Japan, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Venezuela are accorded most-favoured-nation treatment generally. These are consequently enjoying the benefits of the French Treaty. As respects the dutiable schedules in the Agreement with the United States, the concessions to be granted to the United States are largely the same as already have been granted to France and the favoured-nation countries&#x2014;</quote>
I would ask your Lordships to notice that&#x2014;
<quote>"As respects a large part of the list, therefore, no additional advantage will be enjoyed by such countries. There are, however, a few articles in the French schedules which in the Agreement with the United States are made free or dutiable at lower rates. In these cases the advantages granted to the United States will extend also to France and the favoured-nation countries. In the case of a few articles which are not to be found in the French Treaty the favoured-nation countries will be entitled to receive the concessions on the same terms as the United States, but France will not be so entitled."</quote>
I think it is quite plain from that that the aspect of the question as to how this will
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0302"/>
<col>595</col>
affect existing Treaties, to which the noble Earl devoted a considerable part of his speech, has by no means escaped notice by the Government at Ottawa. It is also perfectly obvious that the difficulties which the noble Earl painted when they come in fact to be considered are by no means so considerable as he would have us believe.<lb/>
There is a point in this on which we on this side and the noble Earl and those who believe with him will never be agreed. The noble Earl spoke of the possible breaking down of Treaties of this kind, and seemed to think that whenever there was a possibility of a tariff wall crumbling, that was to be considered, if not disastrous, at any rate dangerous. We can never take that view. One of the
things which we consider most admirable about the present negotiations is that we foresee not only to a certain extent a breaking down of the tariffs of the two countries concerned, but a wider effect outside. There is at any rate a possibility, and we consider a very hopeful probability, of other tariffs being broken down. If that comes about, we would not consider it either a danger or a disaster. We consider it a consummation most devoutly to be hoped for. The noble Earl has spoken of this general question as if he regarded it as constituting a danger. If it is, as he considers it, something against which you must take precautions, what one would like to ask is, "How are you going to prevent it?" The noble Earl, although he dwelt on the possible dangers which he alleged might result from it, gave us no indication as to how the alleged dangers were to be dealt with.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01149"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: I said our policy was joint Imperial negotiation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01150"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I will come to that point in a moment. I thank the noble Earl for reminding me of it. Let us consider how you are going to meet this particular case with any policy of that sort. Is it suggested that you should attempt to forbid Canada to conclude this arrangement, which is entirely within her present statutory rights? That is one possible policy, but it is a policy that I think nobody would consider. Are you going to put obstacles, diplomatic or otherwise, in the way of the negotiations? Are you going to try, by whatever means
<col>596</col>
come best, to impede them? The only and inevitable result of that would be to revive the demand, of which I am glad to say we have heard little for a considerable time, that the greater Dominions should have separate diplomatic representation. The only remaining course is to offer inducements of a financial nature to Canada which she would find more profitable than those now being offered to her by the United States. Is such a thing possible? Can the United Kingdom ever offer to Canada the advantages which the United States can offer? I do not think so. You have only to consider the laws of nature, the laws of geography, and the statistics of production of the two countries to realise that Canada and the United States are, in matters of trade, complementary one to the other in a degree in which Canada and this country never can be. If any proof of that was required you have it in the figures which I have just given to your Lordships. The Agreement, by common consent, covers most of the products either of the soil or of trade. It embraces the standard industries of both countries, and it includes the mutual requirements of both countries. With regard to those very articles on which this Agreement is based this country takes a very small share, as I have shown from the figures, and it is quite obvious, looking at the figures, that this country can never be complementary to Canada in anything like the degree that the United States can. You have only to consider what has been the history of the two countries and the history of the negotiations that are going on, to see, in the words which Mr. Fielding used in his letter to the High Commissioner, that in making this Agreement Canada is realising what have been the desires of her people for half a century. As I say, Canada can supply to the United States what the United States wants, and the United States can supply to Canada what Canada wants, and the fact of geographical proximity and great similarity of condition is bound to make trade with the United States more satisfactory than trade turned artificially in any other direction.<lb/>
The question which, after all, is at the bottom of the whole of this discussion, and that upon which the points of view of the noble Earl's Party and of the Government differ, is whether Reciprocity with the United States and Preference to the United Kingdom are or are not mutually
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0303"/>
<col>597</col>
exclusive. We think it would be exceedingly dangerous if these two things were mutually exclusive; but neither we nor the Canadian Government think that they should be so. I can quote to your Lordships the views which have been expressed by Canadian Ministers on that question. Sir Richard Cartwright, speaking at Toronto on the fiscal situation on December 11, 1903, said&#x2014;
<quote>"I have advocated the formation of a friendly alliance by any possible means between Great Britain, Canada, and the United States. With that view I advocated Reciprocity with the United States. Largely with that view I have advocated the British Preference."</quote>
Sir Wilfrid Laurier, speaking of the Agreement on March 7 last, said&#x2014;
<quote>"Surely in no way at all can it affect our trade with Britain. The United States can enter our market with their natural products, but it is certain that England will never send a bushel of any kind of grain to Canada. However, England can give us a preference in her market for our natural products if she chooses to change her policy, and then we are prepared to give her upon her manufactured products a corresponding advantage. The policy of Canada is just the same as it was three months ago when this arrangement was made; nay, it is the same to-day as it has been for the last twelve years, and it will be the policy of the Canadian Government at the next imperial Conference which will open in May next."</quote>
Then Mr. Fielding, speaking on January 26, said&#x2014;
<quote>"This instrument, deals with duties on goods from the United States, but we would have to look over our tariff and see how it affected the British Preference at any given point, and if we see fit to grant Great Britain a larger preference than would remain it is absolutely within the right of this Parliament of Canada to fix that preference at whatever we think is a proper rate."</quote>
We are grateful for the preference that Canada, has given us in the past, and we are equally grateful for the promise of its continuance in the future. But here we come to the point on which, as I say, we are divided&#x2014;the question of what the noble Earl called early in his speech a Chinese wall around the Empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01151"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: It was not my word.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01152"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Well, the idea expressed in the words Chinese wall. The system of Reciprocity with the United States and Preference given by Canada to us does not commend itself to the Protectionists of this country. The noble Earl suggests, as an alternative to the present system of things, the policy which Mr. Deakin put
<col>598</col>
forward&#x2014;that you should have Imperial negotiations before you conclude these kind of tariffs. Is the noble Earl really prepared to come forward at the present time and say to these Dominions, to whom you have deliberately given by statutory right the power to make their own arrangements, that we are going to take that power away from them and substitute in its place the power of having a small minority share only in the negotiation of these Treaties in the future? What is going to be the result of that? I do not believe that in these matters, particularly in Imperial matters, you can at this stage put the hands of the clock back. You have given these powers, for better or for worse&#x2014;we are convinced that they are given for better&#x2014;and I do not believe that any Government, by any means you can conceive, could take away the power of individual negotiation which the Dominions now possess and substitute for it simply the power of joint negotiation. What would be the result? As a result of that, the Dominions would lose their exclusive power of following their best and truest interests.<lb/>
If you try to exclude any form of Reciprocity outside the Empire in order to establish more firmly your system of Preference within, what will be the result? Take this concrete case. There undoubtedly are at the present moment in Canada a large number of people who will be gainers by this Reciprocity Treaty; they may, or may not, be gainers by any system of Imperial Preference. You are bound to have at any rate a number of people&#x2014;it may be more or it may be less&#x2014;who would consider that they would have been greater gainers had they been allowed to negotiate the Treaty of Reciprocity with the United States. The result, therefore, of any attempt to exclude Reciprocity would be that whereas you have at the present moment the whole of Canada and the whole of both Parties unanimous in favour of Preference&#x2014;that is a point which is never even debated in Canada, because everybody is in favour of it&#x2014;you would have a discontented body of people saying that the price they had to pay for being Imperialists was that they were losing so many cents or whatever it might be a bushel on their wheat. If the United States wants Canadian wheat, can you prevent her having it? Can you prevent the United States taking off the present duty which she puts on wheat if
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0304"/>
<col>599</col>
she wants Canadian hard wheat in her mills? You are powerless to prevent that. I would like to know whether Protectionists in this country seriously contemplate trying to compete with the United States in the matter of tariffs to anything like the same degree or height that she herself thinks it fit to impose. Are you, for instance, going to put a 2&#x00BC; dollars tax on corn, as she does, in order to compete for Canadian wheat? It seems to me that the lines on which the noble Earl argued this question are lines on which it is impossible to have a successful Empire, and on which it is still more impossible to have an Empire in which you will not have a larger or smaller section feeling that they are being made to bear burdens because they are members of the Empire.<lb/>
We believe that the true policy is to allow the component parts of the Empire to seek their own prosperity in whatever way they think best. After all, the thing that will foster British trade in Canada far more than the &#x00A3;360,000 worth of that trade that may be now, perhaps, in a rather less good position with regard to American competition than it was before, will be the rapid development of Canada. If Canada in her wisdom considers that more rapid prosperity is going to be achieved by her through negotiating this Reciprocity Agreement, that will automatically do far more for British trade than we could possibly lose under this Agreement; and, in the second place, I say that when a Dominion has deliberately made up its mind to pursue a course of that kind, there is one thing and one thing only which this country ought to do, and that is give Canada a fair field and no interference whatsoever in trying to achieve her object. The noble Earl says that the Government have stood aloof in this matter. What would he have liked the Government to do? Would he have liked the Government to
interfere; and, if so, in what way? We know, from the speech which Sir Edward Grey made on this subject in the House of Commons a short time ago, that Mr. Bryce has shown the greatest keenness to assist the Canadian delegates in every way he possibly could. When the noble Earl says that the Government have stood aloof, would he have liked Mr. Bryce to interfere with the Canadian delegates, and, by pressing side by side with what the Canadian delegates were asking for the claims of this country, make the Agreement impossible of attainment?
<col>600</col>
because that is the only alternative. In a matter of this kind you can either help the delegates of the Dominion concerned to get what they want, or you can interfere with them, and by pressing the claims of this country I think you could easily prevent the thing from being brought to fruition.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I come to the point to which the noble Earl devoted a considerable part of his speech&#x2014;the interpretation that is to be placed on the most-favoured-nation clause that exists in our Convention with the United States. The noble Earl quoted that part of Article II of the Convention of Commerce between Great Britain and the United States of America in the year 1815 which deals with what we now call the most-favoured-nation clause, and from that he assumed that we had an absolute right to most-favoured-nation treatment. I suggest for the consideration of the noble Earl the actual words in that sentence. I think your Lordships will agree that the matter is not necessarily quite so simple as is made out, and does not bear, as the noble Earl says, only one possible interpretation. The words are "any other foreign country." I do not know that we could say unhesitatingly that with regard to this country Canada is any other foreign country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01153"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: I would submit that it is any other foreign country in respect to the United States.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01154"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I am only submitting this point. I am not by any means laying it down as a definite fact, but it seems that there are difficulties in the way which the noble Earl has to a certain extent slurred over. I think the noble Earl would find a great many lawyers who would say that the words "any other foreign country" relate to States other than the two contracting States. Therefore I say the matter is not an easy one, but is fraught with considerable difficulties. We do not agree with the grounds on which the noble Earl bases his claim. But we do agree with him in so far that we think we have the right to be treated in the same manner as Canada is treated, but at the present moment, as I have said, it is our emphatic policy that Canada should be given a fair field and no interference whatsoever in her efforts to obtain what she desires.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01155"><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Lord's pardon for interrupting him, but the point is so important that there ought to be
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0305"/>
<col>601</col>
no ambiguity about it. Do I understand that the contention of the United States is that we do not come in under that Treaty because Canada is not a foreign country according to the text of that Article? It is a very important point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01156"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I have not said so, and I should be sorry to say so at the present time. I am merely saying that that is a very possible and a very probable interpretation which may be put upon the words by the United States.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01157"><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: It is one that the Foreign Office do not accept, I understand.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01158"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: The Foreign Office have never accepted the American reading of most-favoured-nation Treaties. In pursuance of our policy&#x2014;and I think the noble Earl will find his Question answered in what I am going to say&#x2014;we are at the present moment watching the situation. We are of opinion that our position will not be prejudiced in the slightest degree by waiting, nor by the Agreement that may be concluded between Canada and the United States. I would only like to say one further word with regard to that. If the United States were to grant to some third State the advantage they are prepared to concede to Canada His Majesty's Government would at once be in a position to claim the same concession under the Convention of 1815, but it is only fair to point out that the State Department at Washington has replied to Press inquiries that they have not any intention of admitting the claim of any Power to the same concessions that they are prepared to give to Canada.<lb/>
I have answered to the best of my ability the Questions the noble Earl has put. I can only say that his speech has revealed a difference between us which will not, and I do not think ever can, be bridged over in this matter. It is a difference which goes to the very roots of Imperial policy. Cloak it as you may, disguise it as you like, there is no question about it that the noble Earl would like in some form or another to take away from the Dominions the rights they at present enjoy and which they have exercised for a good many years of controlling the commercial arrangements which they may make with other Powers&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01160"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I know the noble Earl did not say so in so many words, but I do not think any one listening to his speech could put any other interpretation upon it. He did go so far as to say that he was a deliberate advocate of a policy by which the initiation of every Dominion was to be taken away.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01162"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: It may be by free consent or it may not, but the fact remains that the policy to which the noble Earl adheres&#x2014;of course, we all know it is a policy which can never be forced down the throats of the Dominions&#x2014;is that they shall give up the powers which they at present hold for making their own commercial arrangements. We believe, in the first place, that it is not the right thing to do, and, in the second place, that by no such policy as that can the individual, component parts of the Empire achieve their true commercial prosperity. As long as we debate the matter on those lines, I am afraid we shall never come anywhere near agreement. In our belief, the power as it was freely given should be freely used, and it is on those lines that we are watching the present negotiations that are going on between Canada and the United States.</membercontribution></p>

<col>603</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01167"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether in any quarter of the country it may be represented that this debate is an infringement of the rights of self-government in one of our greatest Dominions. In my view to hold such an opinion, that full and frank discussion on a subject of such vital importance not only to Canada but to this country and the Empire is wrong, is not only unsound but extremely dangerous. I go further and say that that policy is extremely unpopular in Canada. It was constantly represented to me when I was there that in many cases Canada was treated, if I may say so, rather like a young man whose relations refuse to believe that he has grown up. They pat him on the head and call him a good lad, and still continue to treat him as a child. Surely Canada is past that, and has now arrived at a stage when we can indulge in a full and frank discussion on matters which vitally affect not only these two countries but the whole of the rest of the Empire. If two friends find that the time has arrived when they can no longer discuss things fully and frankly between themselves surely that is the sign of the end of their absolute friendship? They may keep up acquaintanceship, but that friendship, the proof of which is frank discussion on matters affecting them both, is gone. I venture to think the same holds good between this country and the rest of the Empire. If it be true that the ties which bind the Empire together are as light as air but strong as links of iron, then a discussion on a matter which affects the Empire and its whole foreign policy as strongly as this proposal does, must of necessity be not only a prerogative of friendship but a duty.<lb/>
The noble Lord who replied on behalf of the Government was asked, "What are the Government doing?" and so far as I could understand him he held up his hands and said, "What could the Government do?" He practically endeavoured to get out of his dilemma by asking that question, and then went on to deal with what he called facts. He stated, for instance, that the cutlery and tinplate trade of Canada was so infinitesimal that it really was not worth considering. I venture to think that was rather an unfortunate instance to take, because I understand that the steel trade and the iron trade of Canada are the two trades which are progressing more rapidly and in every way more widely than any other trade in the Dominion. If it is a fact that at the
<col>604</col>
present moment those two items, cutlery and tinplates, are but small and not worth considering in the Reciprocity proposal, may not the time arrive when they will become great and flourishing industries and be tremendous competitors with ourselves in the markets of the United States? If it is merely a question as to the amount of the trade, then there must arrive a moment when that amount becomes serious. But the point with which we have to deal to-night is not the question of amount but the question of principle.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord asked, amongst other questions, "Can the United Kingdom offer to Canada as much as the United States?" It is not a question of the United Kingdom offering to Canada; it is a question of the British Empire; and the British Empire, I have always been given to understand, has the greatest markets of any country in the world. It includes not only one-fifth of the area of the globe, but also one-fifth of its population; and if the noble Lord asks whether the British Empire can supply as great a market to Canada as the United States can, I not only reply unhesitatingly in the affirmative but I add that it can supply an infinitely greater one. Then the noble Lord said that a Reciprocity arrangement between the United States and Canada was complementary to Preference to this country. It is perfectly true that that may be so; but the question arises, which is to be complementary to the other. If our Preference is to be complementary to an arrangement with the United States, that is a very different thing from the United States arrangement being complementary to the British Preference. We on this side of the House believe that the United States should come second to this country and the rest of the Empire, and that, to my mind, is the vital difference which divides the two Parties in this House.<lb/>
The noble Lord went on to ask, Did we propose to dictate terms to Canada? I thought that the question of dictating terms to the great Dominions had been exploded in the eighteenth century. But now we have gone to the other extreme and refuse to make any criticism of any sort or kind. I believe the one policy is as antiquated as the other, and that the time has arrived when we should discuss fully and frankly this Reciprocity proposal. There is a possibility that we may have to dictate to Canada, but that possibility will
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0307"/>
<col>605</col>
only arise if we follow the lead which apparently is to be given to us by His Majesty's Government. You have almost done so to-night by stating that you would be glad to have Free Trade with Canada and the rest of the world, and you possibly hope that such an arrangement may follow. When we come to the question of most-favoured-nation clauses, if this country takes up the stand that it is impossible to release Canada from this engagement, then at any rate you arrive at a dilemma from which you can only escape in one of two ways&#x2014;either by dictating Free Trade to Canada, or by making new arrangements throughout the rest of the world.<lb/>
Reference was made by the noble Earl to a speech by President Taft, in which he spoke of a Chinese wall. I venture to think the speech of the President of the United States was a curious one, and coming from the quarter which it did it is still more curious. I am distinctly under the impression that there is a very high tax imposed on every passenger who travels from the Hawaiian Islands to an American port in anything but an American ship. The President of the United States omitted to mention that. I believe the tax is 100 dollars. That is a greater Chinese wall than anything that has ever been proposed by the wildest Tariff Reformer in this country. Another thing the President omitted to mention was the proposals to link up the Philippines still closer with the American people and practically to wipe out all foreign firms and destroy their trade. Those proposals were on foot when I was there two years ago, and they may have been carried into effect since. I believe I am correct in saying they have not been withdrawn, and are at any rate still in the air. If they are going to deal in that way with the Hawaiian and Philippine Islands and drive out all other competing peoples, that surely is a Chinese wall if ever there was one. I can only imagine that because the President of the United States happens to live in what is called a White House he spoke on the assumption that he was entitled to throw stones.<lb/>
Then we are sometimes told of the "bogey of annexation." I am not going to give an opinion on that subject one way or the other, but I will quote one who will be treated as an authority, I venture to think, by both sides of this House, and although we on this side do not perhaps agree with him as fully as noble Lords
<col>606</col>
opposite, we realise, at any rate, that no one can speak with more authority on the subject of the American people than the present British Ambassador at Washington. In his book which has gone through many editions, "The American Commonwealth," we still find this statement in the very last edition&#x2014;
<quote>"The material growth of Canada would probably be quickened by union" (with the United States) "and the plan of a Commercial League or Customs Union which has lately been discussed, might, if carried out, lead to a political union; indeed, it is hard to see how otherwise Canada could have her fair share in adjusting such tariff changes as might from time to time become necessary."</quote>
It is perfectly true that the present Reciprocity arrangement does not preclude Free Trade with Canada, and therefore perhaps one may say that it is not a question which affects us at the present moment. But at any rate it does affect the trade of the two countries intimately, and extends to a very large proportion of the whole of the imports of those two countries.<lb/>
I, too, must follow the noble Lord into figures. I give these figures, not so much as questions of fact, but as showing the principles that are involved. A writer in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> this month gives the following figures with regard to the changes that are effected by this tariff. This proposal will place a further 9&#x00B7;19 per cent. of American imports into Canada on the free list, and reduce the duties on 10&#x00B7;82 per cent. In other words, the Agreement affects more than 20 per cent. of the imports from the United States into Canada, and as already 44&#x00B7;36 per cent. are free, we find that America will get a total of 53 per cent. of her imports into Canada put on the free list altogether. As the United States already holds over 59 per cent. of Canadian imports as compared with our 25&#x00B7;3 per cent., it is obvious that we have to consider that in all seriousness. Sir Wilfred Laurier, speaking of the relations between this country and Canada made this remark&#x2014;
<quote>"If we do not draw closer together we must inevitably drift apart."</quote>
That is a question the noble Lord opposite will have to consider&#x2014;namely, whether this Reciprocity proposal&#x2014;I hope it will never be an Agreement&#x2014;is likely to draw Canada and the United Kingdom closer together, or whether the reverse will not more probably be the case. Then as to the imports into
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0308"/>
<col>607</col>
the United States from Canada. There we find that 40&#x00B7;67 per cent. are put upon the free list by this proposal, and a further 7&#x00B7;68 per cent. get a reduction in duty. In other words, 48&#x00B7;35 per cent. of Canada's imports into the United States are affected by the proposed Agreement. As 46&#x00B7;78 per cent. of her imports are already free, and it is proposed to make free a further 40&#x00B7;67 per cent., only 12&#x00B7;55 per cent. of Canada's imports into the United States will remain subject to duty once the Agreement is in force.<lb/>
There arises at once the question whether Canada or the United States can give similar and equal advantages to this country and to the rest of the British Empire and also to those countries bound to Canada by most-favoured-nation Treaties. The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, pointed out that the interpretation in the United States of most-favoured-nation Treaties is entirely different from our own. I could not follow altogether what the noble Lord opposite really intended by his reference to that point. As far as I could understand, he thought that we still had a chance of getting the interpretation altered by the United States. I venture to think that that is a hopeless contingency. It has been for many years the policy of the United States that concessions should only be given to those countries that were prepared to give a <i>quid pro quo.</i> That policy was upheld by the Supreme Court in the year 1887, and quite recently another case came before the Customs Court of Appeal. A British firm found that it was being taxed 9<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a gallon on British whisky, as against 7<i>s.</i> levied on the French product. The British firm appealed against the higher tax as being contrary to the interpretation of the most-favoured-nation arrangement, and in giving judgment the United States Court of Appeal said this&#x2014;
<quote>"If this country" [the United States] "should concede to Great Britain without consideration what it has conceded to France for a consideration, it would not be conceding to England the favour it had conceded the other country, but would be conceding to England more than it had conceded to the other country, because England in such a case, gives no consideration for which France gave a consideration. The extension of the 7<i>s.</i> rate (on whisky) to England without a mutual concession would be conceding something more than that which was conceded to France. Therefore, it cannot be within the purview of the most-favoured-nation clause of the Treaty."</quote>
I venture to think you could not have a more definite statement as to the interpretation
<col>608</col>
of the most-favoured-nation clause in America than has been set forth in that judgment.<lb/>
What will happen? Unless the United States is prepared to reverse her interpretation of the most-favoured-nation Treaties Canada will receive a preference, as the noble Lord himself acknowledged, which the rest of the Empire will not get in the United States markets. Then comes a question of what will happen in Canada. I am one of those&#x2014;and I think there are many in this House&#x2014;who have never been able to understand what principle underlies the policy of His Majesty's Government. It is certainly not the policy, as it used to be in old days, of <i>laissez faire</i> and <i>laissez aller.</i> It is quite true that they follow the policy of <i>laissez faire</i> with regard to the composition of this House, but that is not the policy they adopt with regard, to its powers. It is quite true that it is the policy they adopt with regard to the products of labour, but it is not the policy they adopt, and rightly, with regard to the conditions under which labour itself exists. Which is to be their policy on this occasion? Is it to be a policy of <i>laissez faire?</i> We have no answer from the noble Lord opposite except that of "Wait and see." Let us see what will happen. If Canada signs this Agreement twelve nations, as the noble Earl has pointed out, will claim similar advantages to those which Canada is prepared to give to the United States. It is perfectly true that the trade is not very considerable, but Canada has to consider the question of principle and whether she is going to adopt our interpretation of the most-favoured-nation Treaties or that of the United States. We all know that Germany is prepared to make a similar arrangement with Canada if possible, and it is obvious that Canada in that case might desire to have her hands free from all the engagements we made with her in earlier days.<lb/>
What is to be the policy of His Majesty's Government? Are they going to wait until this Agreement is signed and then find themselves in the position of saying to Canada, "Yes, we quite see that you should be released from these arrangements, and we shall have to undertake the policy of making new arrangements with the whole of these twelve countries." As the noble Earl has pointed out, it is fourteen years since the Treaty with Germany was brought to a conclusion, and we have failed to make another one yet. Is it to be hoped that we
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0309"/>
<col>609</col>
shall be any more successful with these other twelve countries than we have been with Germany? Supposing this country says, "No, we cannot release you from the most-favoured-nation Treaties," then it comes to this, that this is a policy of dictating. You will have to say, "You must have Free Trade with these other countries; we dictate Free Trade terms." Canada can reply, "We cannot accept that position," and Canada must then reconsider her position in the British Empire. That is what the policy of drift is bound to lead us to, and the reason the noble Earl put this Notion on the Paper is to discover what the Policy is, if they have one, of His Majesty's Government, and at any rate to see that something shall be done before matters arrive at a point when any action is too late, and when we shall have arrived at a situation as dangerous as it is unsatisfactory and unpleasant both to Canada and to ourselves.<lb/>
I am one of those who believe most implicitly in the destinies of Canada. I believe in a fair field and no favour. To say that a fair field and no favour is what is offered by His Majesty's Government is certainly not the description I should give of it. Canada has not got a fair field in this country. She has made offers to us which have not been accepted, and the way in which those offers were met will, I think, go down to history as an example to be avoided. I venture to hope that no such phrase as has been used on the last occasion will be used at the forthcoming Imperial Conference. The noble Lord opposite ended by saying, "It is all very well, but what are you going to do? Are you going to refuse to allow Canada to sign this Agreement with the United States?" It is not, as we have stated again and again, for the Opposition to frame a policy for the Government. We have a policy, and I think noble Lords opposite realise what it is. Our policy is that we should be able to offer better terms to Canada, as we can do, than any other country in the world; and if we did offer those terms there would then be no need for a Reciprocity Agreement with the United States, and the whole of the questions raised by this Agreement would naturally fall to the ground. Sir Wilfred Laurier has himself publicly stated in Canada that he is prepared to renew those proposals. It is for His Majestys' Government to decide whether they will again bang and, bolt and bar the door against them
<col>610</col>
and allow the policy of drift to go on until they find themselves face to face with a situation in which drift and <i>laissez faire</i> are no longer possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01168"><member>LORD GREVILLE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel that an apology is due from one who has been so short a time a member of this House for rising to take part in this debate. But though I have been in your Lordships' House only a short time, I have spent seven years of my life in two of our largest Dominions. I had the honour of serving in Australia for four years under a distinguished member of this House, who I am sorry to see is not here to-night. I welcomed this Motion of the noble Earl very warmly when I saw it on the Paper. I was in Australia at the time, and the one thing you heard on all sides after the Conference was the regret and disappointment felt at the I do not like to say want of sympathy, but want of action on the part of His Majesty's Government. I therefore welcomed very warmly the noble Earl's effort to get some information from the Government as to what their policy is.<lb/>
The noble Lord who spoke from the other side made use of the word "interfere" several times. That is a word that I do not think ought to be used at all. It is an absolutely unnecessary one. No one, I think welcomes more than our&#x2014;I would like to use the word&#x2014;brothers in the Colonies full light and full information with regard to all the actions of the Government. We are rather in the position of a large commercial house with branches all over the world, and I do not think that the word interference can be used when the head of the house makes arrangements or business terms with the branches outside. That, my Lords, seems to me what the policy of the Government should be&#x2014;to so arrange affairs with the Colonies that there could be no question of these Treaties coming up. The noble Lord the Under-Secretary asked what would we have them do? I would like to see a continuous policy laid down dealing with all these matters. The noble Lord said that at present he thought there was no danger of any interference with our trade by any Agreement that might be made. But I like to look into the future. The trade is not going to stand still. Any one who knows our Colonies and has visited them will say without hesitation that it is impossible to quite forecast the enormous expansion of trade and prosperity in the Colonies, and little though these Agreements
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0310"/>
<col>611</col>
may affect us now I venture to say it will be a very different story in the future. We have heard the expression "Chinese wall." The wall of tariffs may be broken down between America and Canada, but what I am most anxious to see is that there should not be a large wall built all round England preventing everything that we must desire coming in; and I fail to see, if the Colonies are making Agreements all over the world, where we shall come in when we have no terms and no Agreements to offer on our part. The noble Earl strove to extract from the noble Lord opposite some definition of the Government's policy, and it was with feelings of great regret that I listened to the reply of the noble Lord, because I cannot say he threw the smallest light on the subject. I feel most deeply that full and free discussion of the policy of the Government of this country is welcomed very warmly by the Colonies, and that is why I regret that so far the Government are unable to give us any indication of their policy, or any information in the shape of Papers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01169"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WELBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the only conclusion I can come to from the speeches of noble Lords opposite is that much regret is felt that His Majesty's Government have not taken such steps as would practically have put an end to this Reciprocity Agreement being carried forward. I would like to ask the noble Earl whether he has seriously looked back upon the history of this question. Reciprocity has been, I might almost call it, the dream of Canada for sixty years. It is over sixty years since a wise statesman, then Governor-General of Canada, warned the Government of the day that if Canada was to be kept as part of the Empire it would be absolutely necessary to grant her Reciprocity with the United States. Over and over again in Despatches he dwelt on that important point. If that is the case; if Canada, now having the opportunity, is really anxious for Reciprocity; and if, as we learn, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, her Prime Minister, is prepared to carry this Agreement through at all hazards or fall with it&#x2014;I ask the noble Earl whether he thinks he is going to add to the loyalty of Canada or to the stability of the Empire by throwing himself athwart the wishes of that great Dominion.<lb/>
The noble Earl, if I may say so, raised some questions which I think are not at all real questions. He portrayed Canada receiving the manufactured goods of the
<col>612</col>
United States free of all duty, while the tariff remained in force against us. When he paints that picture he overlooks the fact that Canada is at present Protectionist to the backbone; she refused Mr. Taft's offer suggesting greater freedom for manufactures, and as far as we can judge there is no symptom whatever of her intention to depart from the policy of Protection on her manufactured goods. Let me give one fact to show how devoted Canada is to the principle of Protection. Some years ago she gave us a preference of 33&#x00BD; per cent. on the duties on our woollen manufactures. Before very long the woollen manufacturers of Canada rose against this tremendous concession to us, and the Canadian Minister, Mr. Fielding&#x2014;this is only three or four years ago&#x2014;yielded to the pressure put upon him, and the preference was reduced to, I think, 14 per cent. That will show your Lordships that Canada has no intention at present to carry out such an Agreement with the United States as that which the noble Earl raised up in order to frighten us.<lb/>
I should like to ask whether the effect of Preference in Canada generally has been of any very great moment to us&#x2014;except in this regard, that I look upon it as a very valuable proof of the goodwill of Canada to us and to the Empire. But as far as any actual benefit to us is concerned, I think it would be very difficult to show it from figures. If you look at the figures ranging over the whole period from 1897, the beginning of Preference, up to 1909, you will see that on the import of dutiable goods it very slightly increased from a proportion of 30&#x00BD; to 31&#x00BD;, which is not a very large advance. On the other hand, to be quite fair, the import of free goods from this country fell. I think it is fair to say that Preference probably rested on what was then a falling import from us, whilst in the case of the United States, who had no Preference at all, their imports, both dutiable and free, show a considerable increase. Looking at that fact I come to the conclusion that the contiguity of the two great countries, the absolute necessity in their own interests to exchange their products, makes it impossible for Canada not to avail herself largely of American produce. You might carry it further. I will give you the instance of metals, one of the most important things that have been mentioned. The duty-paying metals imported into Canada by us increased in those thirteen years by about fourfold, and we
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0311"/>
<col>613</col>
enjoyed a certain preference. From the United States they increased sixfold. That appears to me to show beyond all question of doubt that it is so much in the interests of Canada to deal with her neighbour close hand that we cannot really rival the United States in the matter.<lb/>
I feel very great difficulty in knowing what the noble Earl opposite would have done. It appears to me that if he had had his way he would have interfered earlier in the course of these negotiations with a view of bringing up a variety of very dangerous subjects, the most-favoured-nation clause, and so forth, and he would have taken that action entirely with a view of stopping this Treaty of Reciprocity. The noble Earl has one general remedy. Whatever be the case, his general remedy in all difficulties is Tariff Reform. If I might venture without offence to say so, he rather reminds me in that connection of Canning's celebrated saying with regard to reform&#x2014;that a man arguing in favour of reform as a universal remedy was like a painter who could only paint one thing, and that was a red lion, and the red lion was introduced on every occasion when he had to use his brush. It seemed to me that from that point of view the noble Earl fails in his argument; and I must say I very greatly regret that anything should be done in this country which would put any difficulty in the way of this Treaty of Reciprocity, and convey the idea that we grudge the Canadian people making the best use of their commercial opportunities, that we, are anxious to promote what I might call our own selfish interests rather than the interests of Canada and of the Empire. I can only hope that that policy will not be pursued, but that the Reciprocity Treaty if it passes will be received by us with wishes of god-speed, for there is no doubt that as the trade and prosperity of Canada and the United States increase we shall have our share.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01170"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think we have reason to feel indignant at the manner in which we have been treated by His Majesty's Government. My noble friend, Lord Selborne, in pursuance of his duty as a member of this House, brings forward a question of the first Imperial importance, and the Government, in answer to him content themselves with putting up a young Under-Secretary to make a speech such as we have listened to, and of which I will not say more than that it had very
<col>614</col>
little indeed to do with the question we put to the Government, which was, "What are you going to do in the circumstances which have arisen?" Instead of answering that question, the Under-Secretary turns on us and plies us with questions. "What are you going to do?" "What would you have done?" he asks, and finally ends up with a scandalous misrepresentation of the attitude of the Unionist Party. The Government remain silent and dumb as to what their policy is. It appears that in this as in other matters they have no policy. But I would like to observe that the government of the country and the management of the affairs of the Empire are matters in which the people of this country are concerned and with regard to which they have a right to be informed, and it is in Parliament and by means of Parliament that they obtain such information. His Majesty's Government are neglecting their duty if they maintain this arrogant attitude of "Wait and see," and of refusing information. We shall persist in our endeavours to obtain information, and if these suave methods of the noble Earl&#x2014;and they were admitted by the noble Lord opposite to be suave and unexceptionable in every way&#x2014;do not succeed, I am afraid that we shall have to become a little more pertinacious.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord on the Back Bench opposite is put up because His Majesty's Government have no answer to give apparently and cannot give an answer, and he misrepresents my noble friend by saying that my noble friend made a general attack on Reciprocity. He did nothing of the kind. Nothing could be further from the fact. He was most careful to guard himself against any suggestion or suspicion that that was his intention or his object. What he did was to ask, "What are you, the Government, going to do in the circumstances which have arisen?" That is to say, if Canada does conclude this Reciprocity Agreement, what are you going to do? That was the question. There was no attack whatever on Reciprocity. I will not follow the noble Lord further into his argument except to remark that his history is at fault when he says that Reciprocity has been the dream of Canada for the last sixty years. He ought to know that the policy of Reciprocity was superseded some years ago by the policy of Imperial Preference, and it is our refusal to entertain the policy of Imperial Preference which has revived the policy of Reciprocity.</membercontribution></p>

<col>615</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01171"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WELBY</member><membercontribution>: May I interrupt the noble Lord? I think I am perfectly right in saying that it was the dream of Canada sixty years ago. Over and over again it has been pressed forward by the Canadian Government upon the United States Government, and not very long ago Sir Wilfrid Laurier said they had only ceased their efforts on account of the absolutely repellent attitude of the United States Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01172"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: I have nothing to say to that. But there is all the difference in the world between saying that a thing was a dream sixty years ago and that a thing has been a dream for sixty years. The dream ceased, and has been succeeded by Imperial Preference. The object of this Motion was most clearly explained by my noble friend, and it is intolerable to have to repeat an explanation so clear and so full. It is simply to obtain information. We do not want to raise a debate on Tariff Reform or to discuss food taxes, or, indeed, to go into any of those usual dialectics which were evidently anticipated by the noble Lord the Under-Secretary. We want to know what the Government are doing, or are going to do, in a matter of such deep and far-reaching concern to the Empire. It is not at the present moment a question either of maintaining Free Trade or of advancing Imperial Preference. It is a question of dealing with the far-reaching situation which is confronting us at the present moment.<lb/>
May I state what we want to know in simple and different words from those of my noble friend? The question we ask is this, How are you going to maintain the continuity of commercial obligations and the continuity of commercial diplomacy if Canada decides to conclude a Reciprocity Agreement? We say "if Canada decides." We have not disputed her right to do so; we have not even questioned the expediency of her doing so; all we know is that Canada is considering these arrangements, and we ask if she does decide upon them what are you going to do to maintain continuity in our commercial obligations and continuity in our traditional commercial diplomacy. Do you wish to maintain those obligations and the commercial policy which Great Britain has pursued for fifty years, or have you some other policy in view? If you do wish to maintain them, how are you going to do it? That is what we want to know. It is
<col>616</col>
simply that question to which we want an answer. And if you do not wish to maintain those obligations, then what is your policy? Those are the questions we ask, and it is to those questions we respectfully ask for an answer from His Majesty's Government for the information of the people of this country who are deeply and vitally concerned.<lb/>
My Lords, let me explain once more as briefly and as simply as I can, but from rather a different point of view from that of my noble friend, how this question has arisen. Hitherto the British Empire has been one in the matter of commercial relations with the rest of the world. I say it has been one, but I know, of course, there have been certain exceptions during the past thirty years or so, but that is the general principle. The British Empire has been one in the matter of commercial relations with the rest of the world, and on that principle all
the States forming the Empire have shared the advantages and the disadvantages, and the obligations, if you prefer to put it so, of that policy. But now there is to be a change. There is now to be for the first time in the history of the British Empire a differentiation in favour of one of the States forming the Empire as against the United Kingdom and as against the other States of the Empire. Canada has entered into an arrangement with the one nation in the world which puts a different interpretation on the most-favoured-nation clause from ours, and that is why this is a new question and why totally different difficulties have now arisen. The Reciprocity arrangement goes a great deal further than anything that has taken place hitherto in the Agreements which Canada has made, in pursuance of her autonomy and with the full consent of the British Government, with France, Italy, Belgium, Germany, and Holland. It is an entirely new question, because it is one of differentiation against the rest of the Empire.<lb/>
What it means is this, that Canada is to enjoy advantages which we are not to share, or&#x2014;and this is equally important&#x2014;she is to suffer disadvantages on account of her Imperial connection. As my noble friend Lord Stanhope said, it is not a matter of amount but one of principle. It may be a very short time before the amount which you may now call insignificant becomes overwhelming in importance. On account of Canada's action we are to
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0313"/>
<col>617</col>
lose some of the advantages we have been enjoying, and this discrimination on the part of Canada as against the rest of the Empire is incompatible with Imperial unity. There is no doubt about that. Nobody will deny that the tendency of such differentiation in commercial relations must lead to political disintegration. The difficulty here is that we are concerned with a great principle; it is not a question of Canada alone, it is the position as affecting the Empire as a whole. This question must arise in the other Dominions of the Empire. It must arise in India. We had an exceedingly important statement elsewhere last night from the ex-Viceroy of India, my noble friend Lord Minto, who pointed out that although in many respects there is a vast difference between Canada and India yet the same question was arising there, and that unless India were allowed to make such commercial arrangements as would assist her own development we should not be treating her fairly. The question, therefore, will arise in every part of the Empire. The whole question depends upon most-favoured-nation arrangements and upon the fact that we in the time of our supremacy and our pride and our conversion to Free Trade forced our interpretation of that arrangement on the rest of the world, whereas the United States of America have adhered to the interpretation we used to hold before the days of Cobdenism. This most-favoured-nation clause is the very citadel of Free Trade, and the one thing on which Free Traders pin their faith. They tell us, in reply to every argument for Imperial Preference, "We have our most-favoured-nation clause what more do you want?" But that citadel is being attacked; the enemy is actually within the gate. But what are His Majesty's Government going to do? There is no time to parley; there is no time to obtain a mandate; it is a matter which requires immediate action, and unless something is done the citadel on which you pin your faith, together with your pride, is going to tumble to the ground.<lb/>
The thing I want especially to call your Lordships' attention to is that this question is not even touched upon by Free Trade speakers; it is not touched upon by Free Trade journals all over the country. They are afraid to touch it; they funk the question. A very important Memorandum was published by the Tariff
Commission yesterday, and yet this morning it is not even
<col>618</col>
mentioned in a single Free Trade or Radical paper throughout the country. This conspiracy of silence and inability to reply increases our anxiety for information. We want to know what his Majesty's Government are going to do. There is one more reason which makes it all the more extraordinary that His Majesty's Government appear to be so unconcerned and unable to give any explanation of their policy, and it is this: One of the certain consequences, so far as we can see, of this Reciprocity Agreement if it is ever carried out is that the price of bread will go up in this country. That is a matter as to which you have always professed to have the greatest concern. If you are not concerned with what Canada contemplates, if you are not concerned with how this matter affects the rest of the Empire, what are you going to do to prevent the rise in the price of bread for the people of this country?<lb/>
We have made many vain attempts to get information from the Government on a matter which discussion has surely proved to be of supreme importance to British trade interests. At first the Government were inclined to pooh-pooh the whole matter and treat it as if it were no concern of ours. The very meagre White Paper which was issued would really seem to show, unless a great deal of correspondence has been suppressed and withheld, that the Government were not alive to the importance of the question, or did not understand that it was bearing on the whole system of International Treaties. In the White Paper there is no allusion to the most-favoured-nation clause until the arrangement has been made between the representatives of the two countries. Surely there was time for the thought to have occurred to His Majesty's Government that possibly the matter might in some way be affected by this most-favoured-nation clause, of which they talk so much at other times and to which they attribute so much importance. Surely there was time between May 13, 1910, and January 21, 1911; but there is not a word in this White Paper, not a word of any correspondence, not a sign to show that any of those officially concerned with the business had ever lighted on the idea that possibly most-favoured-nation arrangements might have something to do with the question.<lb/>
When these things were pointed out in another place, Sir Edward Grey was obliged
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0314"/>
<col>619</col>
to admit that they did contain difficulties, that they were of importance, but he still attempted to minimise them. He said that difficulties under the dual interpretation of the favoured-nation clause had existed before, and he doubted whether the Reciprocity Agreement would be a serious contribution to those difficulties. He went on to say&#x2014;and this is a most peculiar statement&#x2014;that the difficulty was not specially germane to, or peculiarly influenced by, the Reciprocity negotiations. That, my Lords, is surely an extraordinary statement to proceed from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in a matter of this kind. After all that has been said on both sides of the water and by statesmen and responsible men of all three countries concerned, surely it is recognised that the question which has arisen in Canada will arise in other Dominions of the Empire. And in the absence of some policy, of some Imperial principle for the negotiation of trade Treaties for the mutual and individual advantage of the States of the Empire, one of two things must happen. The Dominions may withdraw from our Treaties, in which case the Imperial Government will have to denounce them all.<lb/>
That is a proposition which noble Lords opposite will not deny. That is one alternative. The other alternative is for the Dominions to sacrifice their own interests for our advantage, in which case we shall have to reproach ourselves with hampering them in their development. Both those contingencies must lead to the disintegration of the Empire. You offend the Colonies and create difficulties and all the elements of quarrel. Therefore I say it is essential on that account to have some Imperial agreement.<lb/>
The Imperial Conference is upon us; it opens next week. That is why my noble friend has brought forward this question this evening, in order that we and the
people of this country may know what attitude His Majesty's Government have taken up. Surely they must have some policy on the very eve of the Conference. We have left it till the last moment to ask what that policy is, and I think that is fair. They ought by now to have made up their minds what they are going to do in the matter of this difficulty. We, the Unionist Party, have a plan. I am not going to describe it; it ought to be familiar to all. It is a plan, and I challenge denial,
<col>620</col>
which has ever been recommended and urged by the Dominions themselves&#x2014;the plan of Imperial Preference. What is the Government plan? Perhaps they have some better plan than ours. They cannot let things slide. The policy of <i>laissez faire</i> will not do in this matter. You must do something, or you are faced with one or other of those two contingencies which I have just mentioned. The idea of denouncing all our commercial Treaties is too monstrous to be entertained for a moment. I would not suspect even His Majesty's Government of harbouring such an intention. It would mean chaos not only for us but for foreign nations who have built up their tariff systems on our interpretation of the most-favoured-nation clause&#x2014;an interpretation which we have forced upon them. They did not want these complex tariffs which they were obliged to impose and which we forced upon them when we had predominance and power.<lb/>
My noble friend quoted the reply to Canada in 1892 when we refused to denounce these Treaties for the benefit of Canada on the ground that it would mean a great breaking-up of the existing commercial relations of the whole British Empire with foreign nations. Let me explain once more why these contingencies are inevitable unless we come to some agreement with the Colonies in this matter of commercial diplomacy. Let us take the present case of Canada, although really in this matter Canada is merely the occasion for the discussion. The point of view of my noble friend was one of Preference; he did not attack the Reciprocity Agreement. He wants to know what you are going to do in regard to the question of principle which has been raised by these circumstances in Canada. And I repeat again, because I do not want the misrepresentation to go forth to the country, that my noble friend neither attacked nor approved the Reciprocity Agreement. We take Canada, therefore, merely as an instance. When we last asked a question on this subject the noble Viscount the Leader of the House told us that Canada proposed to extend the concessions which she will grant to the United States under the Reciprocity Agreement to those foreign nations, twelve in number, which are entitled to them under the most-favoured-nation clause. She cannot do that for long, however much she wishes to do it,
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0315"/>
<col>621</col>
if indeed she can do it at all. Under her present system, which is a Protectionist system, she cannot give concessions to any number of nations for which she receives no equivalent concessions in return. Obviously the result of so doing must, if it is carried to any extent, force a policy of Free Trade upon her. Her tariff would cease to be revenue producing to the extent to which she was obliged to give those concessions to other nations. If this reciprocal arrangement leads, as everybody thinks it will lead, to complete commercial union with the United States of America, Canada would obviously be unable to maintain a tariff at all. That would mean Free Trade with America, and therefore she would be obliged to give Free Trade to every other country, which she cannot do because she depends upon her tariff for her revenue. If that is clear, surely you will admit my conclusion that Canada is bound sooner or later, probably sooner, to seek release from her present obligations under most-favoured-nation arrangements. Will anybody deny that that is not only probable, but inevitable? That is my point. Very well, that is agreed; and I need not enforce the argument by pointing to actual experience.<lb/>
When Canada first adopted the policy of Preference she found herself up against the difficulty of the Belgian and the German Treaties. Sir Charles Tupper, the Canadian statesman, pointed out the difficulty, but Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who was in office, said, "We shall be able to arrange that, and maintain those Treaties." But he tried it and found it unworkable, and what Sir Wilfrid Laurier had to do was to refund the duties to the foreigners. The result was that Canada was obliged to ask for the denunciation of those Treaties, and they were denounced by Lord Salisbury in 1896. That is what happened then, and that is bound to happen again. If Canada is once drawn into the net of United States commercial diplomacy she will be forced to adopt the American interpretation of the most-favoured-nation clause. That is the point. That means separation. You cannot have two different interpretations of Treaty obligations under the same sovereignty. I challenge anybody to tell me that you can. You cannot have such a position that the Sovereign of this country is obliged to say to other Sovereigns that the words of one and the same authority mean one thing as applied to
<col>622</col>
the United Kingdom and another thing as applied to Canada or to any other Dominion you like to name. The English words in a legal obligation must always mean the same thing.<lb/>
In this matter there is a question of principle involved, a question totally different from questions of Party politics such as we have often discussed here. You have to deal with foreign nations, and foreign nations have a means of enforcing their wishes if they are too seriously thwarted. If Canada, adopting the United States interpretation, were to administer her Customs contrary to
Imperial obligations, that would be tantamount to separation. It would be a declaration of independence. Canada, as we all know, would not dream of doing that. But if she wished to administer her Treaties in accordance with American interpretation we should have to denounce those Treaties. It is a serious matter, in spite of the light-hearted attitude of the Under-Secretary. Those Treaties are not easily negotiated again. My noble friend reminded your Lordships of the German Treaty of 1865 which was denounced by Lord Salisbury in 1896. When that Treaty was denounced we became technically liable to the German penal tariff, and the only reason why that tariff has not been imposed is that Germany, no doubt for excellent reasons, has been magnanimous towards us. If we denounced those Treaties we should be liable to the penal tariffs of other nations unless they, too, chose to treat us with magnanimity. We cannot count on the magnanimity of foreign nations. Why should they be magnanimous? It is not business or common sense to entrust your commercial interests to the magnanimity of commercial rivals. If you do not agree with me I beg you to ask that question of any business man you like in the country. Why should they be magnanimous? We forced on them our interpretation of the most-favoured-nation clause at a time when we had the start of them in manufactures, commerce, and everything else, and we have put them to the trouble of building up these complex tariffs, which they have had to revise from time to time. But they have no longer to depend on our favour, and would not this be their opportunity of taking it out of us if we were obliged to give up these Treaties? We are faced, therefore, with the alternative of injuring ourselves or of injuring the Colonies
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0316"/>
<col>623</col>
by hampering their developments, and in either case, put it how you will, of injuring the Empire as a whole.<lb/>
And what for? I will not go into that point because, as I have said, we only want information. We do not want to raise the question which is at issue between the two Parties of Tariff Reform or Free Trade, but I ask your Lordships to consider why are we to be forced to choose between these two alternatives of injuring ourselves or injuring the Colonies, and in either case of injuring the Empire, instead of adopting another course. There is, as I have already said, another course. But possibly His Majesty's Government have still a further
alternative. Perhaps they are contemplating an Imperial policy on quite different lines from anything that we ourselves have imagined or suggested or discussed. If that is so, surely they will tell us. It is a matter which concerns the people of this country vitally. It is a matter which is urgent, imminent, important, because next week His Majesty's Government are going to meet the representatives of the Dominions and discuss this question. I ask them therefore once more&#x2014;and I do beg that they will not reply by merely retorting with a <i>tu quoque</i> storm of questions such as the Under-Secretary put to us&#x2014;What are you going to do to give commercial men of this country a sense of security in the international relations of trade? And, as my last word, I would say that in this matter if we do not take the right line now we may start irretrievably on the downward path.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01173"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just sat down has for the second time this session poured out the vials of his wrath upon the heads of His Majesty's Ministers. Last time Mr. Bryce came in for a share of his criticism. On this occasion he has said nothing of Mr. Bryce, but has directed his speech to putting and enforcing the pointed question, "What is the policy of His Majesty's Government at this crisis?" I will tell your Lordships. The policy of the Government is to give every facility to Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the people of Canada to do the best they can for themselves, to enter into this Agreement, and, as they think and as we believe, to take thereby the best step they can for the development of
<col>624</col>
Canada. We hold that it is not a disadvantage to us that Canada should develop by the growth of trade relations with the United States. We hold that an enlarged Canada, a Canada with a great trade of this kind, cannot fail to be a more prosperous Canada, a Canada which will be a better market for our goods and will do more trade with ourselves. Therefore, from every point of view, we look upon the step which Canada is taking as being probably a very good step in our own interests as well as in the interests of Canada. But, my Lords, it is not for us to intermeddle with the policy of Canada. We have a perfectly definite attitude towards these matters. We do not think it is a good thing to attempt to guide or influence the policy of the great Dominions in matters of trade. We are&#x2014;and perhaps this is a simple answer to the noble Lord&#x2014;we are Free Traders, and we intend to remain Free Traders.<lb/>
As for Preference, we regard it as an utterly unscientific policy. We expressed our view when it was launched on all sorts of incorrect premises in 1903. We retain that view, and every new phase and every memorandum which comes from that obscure region, the committee rooms of the Tariff Reform League, fills us more and more with the impression that those who promote that policy have not thought it out, and have not the facts and materials on which to put a definite proposition before their countrymen. The noble Lord has asked for a definition of our policy. That is our general policy. And now I come to the more specific case which has been dealt with by the noble&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01174"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount has not given me a complete answer. My question is, What are you going to do for us?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01177"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: We are going to leave the British merchant to flourish in the future as he has done in the past under Free Trade, and to leave the British Empire to hold together by bonds of
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0317"/>
<col>625</col>
sympathy and see that it is not killed by any kind of fiscal fetters being put upon it. I noticed that the noble Earl opposite, Lord Selborne, coupled with his disclaimer of any attempt to interfere with Canada a hankering and longing for another policy which was to be adopted by common consent, but which, he was careful to say, would impose such restrictions upon entering on negotiations such as we have been witnessing lately between the United States and Canada as would make that kind of development impossible. That is a policy which to my mind represents a tendency in Imperialism which may lead in very different directions from that supposed to be contemplated.<lb/>
The noble Earl seemed to think that the British Government in the course of these negotiations had been sitting with hands folded doing nothing. We have done nothing in one sense. That is to say we have not interfered, but we have been cognisant at every turn of what is taking place. I doubt whether any negotiations have been more closely watched or more sympathetically observed. We are fortunate in having an Ambassador who possesses the confidence of the people both of the United States and of Canada. He has been in constant relation with both sets of Ministers, but not for the purpose of interfering. He has kept us informed of what has gone on and has carried out our policy, which is that we should not enter into communications with the Government of the United States with a view to interfering with negotiations of which we approve, and in the way of which we have not the slightest intention of putting obstacles. Mr. Bryce, as I say, has kept us informed, and we have been cognisant of these negotiations. If we do not lay correspondence with the United States, it is because we have none to lay, having deliberately abstained from trying to interfere with these negotiations. For what purpose should we interfere? Perhaps some noble Lords think that this is a new departure on the part of Canada. Canada has carried out similar Agreements with Germany and France, and, I think, also with Belgium, and has been in negotiation with other Powers, not only with our complete consent, but because it is part of the liberty of her Constitution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01178"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: I said the same myself.</membercontribution></p>
<col>626</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01179"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The business of British Ambassadors is to assist and be sympathetic, and it is not our business to try to interfere in these matters with a view to exercising some sort of controlling hand. The noble Earl put his case on a different ground. I could not get clearly before my mind what his point was, but he seemed to think that we were giving up some plain and obvious right which we had by Treaty with the United States to the same advantages as Canada is getting in this case. The noble Earl assents. I am not going to express an opinion one way or the other on this point, except to say that I think the noble Earl is under a very great delusion if he imagines that this is a clear plain business about which there cannot be two views. I presume that what he is alluding to&#x2014;it is the only thing he can be alluding to&#x2014;is the Convention of Commerce which was signed at London in 1815 between the United States and this country. The second Article of that Convention says that&#x2014;
<quote>"No higher or other duties shall be imposed on the importation into the United States of any articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of His Britannic Majesty's Territories in Europe, and no higher or other duties shall be imposed on the importation into the territories of His Britannic Majesty in Europe of any articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of the United States, than are or shall be payable on the like articles being the growth, produce, or manufacture of any other foreign country."</quote>
And therefore, argues Lord Selborne, because Canada gets certain advantages, we ought to get the same advantages. It may possibly be so. I make no admission. I pronounce no opinion one way or the other. But in order to sustain that you have to make out that Canada is "another foreign country." I can only say that, so far from being the obvious proposition which Lord Selborne seemed to think, it is a proposition that requires very careful consideration indeed, and I should be very much surprised if it did not turn out that there were very great differences between legal authorities on the point. My present desire is not to express any opinion on that one way or the other, further than to say that it is anything but the plain proposition which the noble Earl assumed.<lb/>
If that is so, what is our position? Supposing that the country had not at two or three General Elections pronounced against Protection, we might take up Protection and enter next week into some such general tariff agreement as embodies
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0318"/>
<col>627</col>
the policy of Mr. Deakin, to which the noble Earl referred, but then we should be turned out of office; we should be hurled with execration from the position we now hold for going against the express and in this case most distinct decision of the country. That is not a policy which responsible Ministers can for a moment lend themselves to. If that policy is shut out, what remains? I will tell your Lordships what remains. What remains is to watch with the utmost care all these transactions as they occur; to approach them not with minds <i>parti pris,</i> but recognising the liberty and freedom of those great Dominions and that in their prosperity you find your own prosperity; believing also that the best course for them is to get rid of those tariff walls which are hampering their trade with other countries and to take such a course as suits the necessities of their own people. We have heard recently from Sir Wilfrid Laurier his own views of policy in that connection. It is not suggested that we should go against those views of policy, and if that be so I am at a loss to understand, I am puzzled to understand, what is in the mind of the noble Earl or the noble Lord who has just spoken.<lb/>
I have never been able to bring these tariff propositions into a concrete and crystalline form. They are put forward in general terms, and when you come to try to put them into a definite form they evade and elude you. They are put forward on platforms at meetings full of Tariff Reformers, and because they receive applause and assent they are supposed to be clear. But when we come to examine them in debate they go to pieces. There was an expression used in the House of Commons the other day which is not sufficiently polite for your Lordships' House, and therefore I will not use it but merely quote it. "Sloppiness" is the expression I refer to, and it conveys that the matter is not in a clear or crystalline form and is not intelligible when you come to look closely into it. If any illustration were wanted of the danger of lapsing from that clear crystalline form in which these things should be presented it is found in the suggestion which arose in the speech of the noble Earl to-night. Neither on the terms of the Convention has he a clear case nor has he a clear case on his policy. When he is challenged, he cannot say that anything else ought to have been done than
<col>628</col>
was done. He cannot say that Mr. Bryce was negligent. He does not say that. He cannot say that we ought to have interfered in the negotiations between the United States and Canada. He agrees that Canada is not to be deprived of liberties which she has enjoyed on other occasions, and which she is enjoying now. There is nothing left except that we should accept or adopt the policy of Mr. Deakin. His Majesty's Government have no intention of adopting the policy of Mr. Deakin, and, as I have explained, if they did they would be turned out of office, as they would deserve to be, by the majority of the people of this country as unworthy of their trust. As that also has gone, we remain with nothing as an alternative to the course which Ministers and their representatives abroad have pursued in connection with this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01180"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after the apologetic speech of the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies it has been a relief to your Lordships to hear the full-blooded defence of the position of His Majesty's Government which has been delivered by the noble Viscount. At the same time I must say I was very much surprised at the charge the noble Viscount made, that on this side of the House a proposition had been advanced in general terms and that my noble friends evaded anything like a definite proposition, because all that the noble Viscount did was to deal with this matter in the most general terms. He did not attempt to make good that this was in any respect a policy which was likely to be advantageous to this country. He spoke in general terms of prosperity, and dealt separately with the position of Canada and Great Britain in this particular. So long as the Canadians are, on their own behalf, trying to make an Agreement which will develop their trade with the United States, their policy is admirable. If Great Britain enters on an attempt to secure Preference for her Colonies, we are told that she is entering upon a sordid bond; but the moment that Canada or any other Colony enters into some Agreement it is said to be a triumph of civilisation and a matter on which everybody must be congratulated, especially if it happens to exclude this country.<lb/>
The noble Viscount's argument was certainly a most peculiar one, and was very
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0319"/>
<col>629</col>
much in contrast with that of the noble Lord the Under-Secretary, whose apology was&#x2014;"What does it matter? The whole subject is so small." The noble Viscount spoke quite differently. He said this was a very good step in our own interests. How? Where? It may be a good step in Canada's interests; I am not saying a word about that at this moment. But how in our interests? Where do we come in? My noble friend Lord Selborne has pointed out that one of the operations which we may expect to see carried out under this Agreement, and in support of which he gave quotations from a periodical equivalent to the Returns of our Board of Trade, is the manipulation of the market for Canadian wheat so as to take care that the Canadian farmer gets something more and loses nothing, but with the avowed object of raising the price of wheat in the British market.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01181"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I thought that was just what the Party of the noble Lord wanted to do&#x2014;to raise the price of wheat all round. At one time we hear complaints of dearness, and at other times of cheapness. But I do not believe it will happen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01182"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: That is a strange delusion under which the noble Viscount is labouring. I know, of course, the old innuendo, but I really thought that as the noble Viscount has so thoroughly adopted the tone of this House he would have discarded anything he might remember of the tone of the platform. Surely he knows that our proposal with regard to wheat, to which it was proposed to give a preference, would have itself enabled this market to be supplied with wheat on which no duty of any sort or kind would be paid. The whole question of our having a policy to raise the price of wheat all round is disposed of by that one fact; whereas the noble Viscount, who poses as the patron of cheap food, is at this moment justifying, on behalf of Canada, an action which may lead to the advantage of Canada but which will be taken advantage of on the part of the United States to raise the price of wheat in this market. Of course, the noble Viscount is not responsible for that; but still I again ask, where does our interest come in? I shall wait for an answer, a reasoned reply which we have a right to expect from the Government to justify their inaction in this very serious matter.<lb/>
<col>630</col>
The charge of the Under-Secretary that my noble friend had brought forward this motion with the object of endeavouring to interfere with the freedom of action of Canada in this matter was most unfounded. The noble Lord said that what Lord Selborne wished was to take away from Canada the right to negotiate separately. There was not in my noble friend's speech a shred or shadow of foundation for that statement. It was reiterated by Lord Welby, and was cheered on those very rare occasions when cheers were heard from that side of the House. The whole point of my noble friend's argument was that there was an opportunity, which was being missed, of bringing the whole forces of the Empire to bear to get better terms than could be obtained by a part of the Empire. On that, which is our policy, we have the right to stand without being accused of grudging such a shred of advantage to one Dominion as might be obtained without that co-operation.<lb/>
I think it is right to ask, especially on this occasion, that we may have a reassuring word from the Government as to one statement made by the noble Lord, the Under-Secretary. I do not propose to labour the question of the most-favoured-nation clause, except to ask this. Were we right on this side of the House in understanding the statement of the noble Lord the Under Secretary to be to this effect, that the United States had some basis for the interpretation which they have put on the most-favoured-nation clause, an interpretation which has been repudiated by this country for over 100 years? We on this side of the House so understood him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01183"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I certainly never said so. I merely stated, in reply to a question from somebody, that we had never accepted the view which the United States had taken of the most-favoured-nation clause.</membercontribution></p>

My noble friend asked the noble Lord whether he could lay any Papers. To that he replied that there were no Papers to lay, from which we conclude that no correspondence has taken place on this subject at all.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01186"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: We cannot sufficiently call in question the masterly inactivity of His Majesty's Government. The noble Lord said several times over that they were watching the case. The noble Viscount said they had "sympathetically observed the case." We think we have a right to ask for more than that. I agree with the tribute which was paid by the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, to our Ambassador in the United States, but that our Ambassador should have had no instructions to pursue British interests in this matter at any stage of the negotiations does certainly seem an extraordinary omission on the part of His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01187"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: May I interrupt the noble Viscount for one moment?

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01188"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: The terms of the Motion are, "as to the extension to the United Kingdom or any other part of the British Empire." That is a very serious question. We desire to be reassured as to the extent to which His Majesty's Government have attempted to receive from the United States assurances as to the extension of the tariff concessions granted to Canada to other parts of the British Empire and to this country. It seems to us to have been a most short-sighted policy to have allowed this opportunity to escape. The Government have placed themselves in a very difficult position for negotiating with any other foreign Power or with the United States by themselves locking and shutting the door to any possibility of tariff negotiations on our own side. They have, of course, tied their hands, and the more they choose to assume that the people of this country have decided against our policy&#x2014;at one moment they tell us that the verdict was on Free Trade, at another that the verdict was on Home Rule, and at another that the verdict was on the
<col>632</col>
House of Lords&#x2014;the more we feel that they do not rest on the opinions of the people in this particular respect. I believe that the result of this debate will be to create a widespread feeling that what the noble Viscount calls "sympathetic watching" the negotiations has really meant the neglect by a Government which is completely absorbed in home questions of Constitutional change of British trade interests. As Lord Ampthill pointed out, we have only had one small White Paper on this subject. The announcement that there are no more Papers to follow will, I think, be a great disappointment, not only to your Lordships, but to the country. It represents a confession on the part of the Government of having no power to act, and the speeches to which we have listened really make us feel that they have no desire to act in the matter. Apart from the general question, I congratulate my noble friends on having, on the eve of the Colonial Conference, drawn from the Government the kindliest possible references to our great Dominions. But coupled with that has been the evidence that there has been complete inactivity on the part of the Government in pressing the interests of this country in these negotiations, and an attempt, which I do not think will deceive any man who comes over here from the Colonies, to impress this House with the belief that any union between Great Britain and the Dominions overseas for these purposes would weaken the Dominions rather than establish that co-ordinate and sustained effort which we on this side of the House believe will have the best possible results for the trade of the Empire, and also for the union of the different parts of His Majesty's Dominions.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HOUSE OF LORDS RECONSTITUTION BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01205">Debate on the Motion for the Second Reading <i>resumed</i> (according to Order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01206"><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the debate on this Bill has now proceeded over three days. It has been discussed, I believe, by every section of the House, and in the peculiar circumstances I think the noble Marquess may be very well satisfied with the reception which has been given to his Bill. I say in the peculiar circumstances because the Bill itself is one which is not calculated to arouse very great enthusiasm. The noble Marquess who introduced it will hardly have expected, I think, that his supporters should have risen one after another in their places and thanked him for asking them to surrender their traditional privileges and to give up their Constitutional rights in the future; but I am bound to say that it appears to me there has been a greater readiness to sacrifice personal considerations to the wider interests of an effective Second Chamber amongst the supporters of the noble Marquess than has been shown on the other side of the House. The support to this Bill, it is true, may have been grudging; it has been regretful support; but that fact is only further proof of the extent of the sacrifices demanded of your Lordships by this Bill and of the disinterested nature of the support which has been given to it.<lb/>
There is another circumstance, I think, which tends to create a somewhat unreal atmosphere about this debate. As every one knows, the Constitutional difficulty which we are discussing is a double question, a two-fold question, and yet we are never able to discuss the Bill as a whole. It is always given to us for our consideration piecemeal; it has never been submitted as a whole to either House of Parliament; it has not even been submitted in its entirety to the country. We had, first of all, a few weeks ago, a very interesting debate upon the Reference to the People Bill of Lord Balfour of Burleigh. That was only one feature of this difficulty. Now we are discussing the Bill of the noble Marquess, and to-morrow I believe we are to enter upon a discussion of a third Bill, that promoted by His Majesty's Government, which again deals with only one side of the question. But, my Lords, it was the case
<col>636</col>
of the Government that owing to the particular composition and constitution of this House, and in consequence of the action of this House in recent years, it was desirable to limit its powers for the future, and to accomplish that object the Government have drafted their Parliament Bill. But, in addition to curtailing the powers of this House as at present constituted, it is admittedly part of the Government's policy to reform the constitution of the House. It was on that policy as a whole that they went to the country, and for that policy as a whole that they were returned with a majority to Parliament. Yet since the General Election we have never had any indication of the policy of the Government on the second half of their proposals.<lb/>
The Government told the country that it was desirable, first of all, to limit the powers of this House, and, in the second place, to proceed to a reconstitution of the Second Chamber. We know well enough what are their proposals with regard to the first part of their policy, but it is because of this unbroken silence with regard to the second part that this Bill has been introduced. That, I take it, is the justification of the introduction of this Bill, and even now, when the question of the reform of the constitution of this House is before your Lordships, when we are engaged in discussing this Bill&#x2014;even now, though the debate has proceeded over three days, that silence on the part of the Government remains unbroken, and we are still without any indication of what is their policy with regard to the composition either of the House of Lords or of some alternative Second Chamber. The noble Viscount who leads the House said, on the first day of the discussion of this Bill, that in his opinion it was useless to discuss the composition of this House until we had determined what were to be its powers. I think that was what the noble Viscount said&#x2014;that the settlement of the powers of this House must come before any consideration of its constitution. But surely, my Lords, that is an inversion of the natural order of events. Surely you cannot determine what ought to be the powers of any Assembly until you know how that Assembly is to be composed. Even now I do not think that any one is very clear what are the powers which the Government intend to give to their reformed Second Chamber if and when the Preamble of their Parliament Bill is carried out.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0323"/>
<col>637</col>
There have been since the General Election speeches made by members of the Government which have only increased our uncertainty upon this head, and I should like to ask the noble Viscount who leads the House a question, and if he could answer it I think it would tend very much to clear up the difficulty which is in our minds. Is it the intention of the Government, when their Parliament Bill has been carried into law, that it should apply in the future, not only to this House as at present constituted, but to any reformed Chamber which may take its place according to the Preamble of their Bill? That is a question upon the answer to which I think a great deal depends, and I hope that when we get another speech from the Government Bench later this evening we shall have a definite answer to that point&#x2014;namely, supposing the Preamble of the Parliament Bill be carried out, whether, when the Government bring forward their scheme for reforming the constitution of this House they intend that that reformed House should never exercise anything more than the limited Veto which they are applying to the present House of Lords by the Parliament Bill. The noble Marquess who introduced this Bill made it perfectly clear that the House which his Bill would establish would be free to exercise, I will not say an absolute Veto, for the noble Marquess himself pointed out that that was not claimed even by your Lordships to-day, but free to exercise at any rate full legislative powers. It is only on that condition that this Bill can receive any consideration at all.<lb/>
I imagine that if your Lordships were under the impression that the House which would be constituted under this Bill was never to exercise anything more than the limited Veto offered to us by the Government, there is not one of you who would vote for its Second Reading or give it any support at all. It is the intention, I think, of those who support this Bill to call into existence a House which in their opinion would be better fitted to exercise the same functions which are at present exercised by your Lordships' House&#x2014;a House which would exercise those powers, we hope, with more impartiality and with greater authority, but nevertheless which would exercise the same powers, subject only to a provision for a Joint Sitting between the two Houses of Parliament in certain cases of difference, and a reference to the people in certain other cases of more important differences
<col>638</col>
between the two Houses. I think I am right in saying that it is the intention of all those who support the Bill which we are now discussing that, subject to those two limitations, the Second Chamber which this Bill would set up would be free to exercise full legislative powers in the future. From that point of view I do think that this Bill is worthy of consideration. I do not feel, any more than many other speakers who have taken part in the debate, that the Bill is perfect in all its details, but I hold that a Bill brought forward as this one is by the Opposition Leader must be regarded rather as a declaration of policy on the part of the Opposition than as a final legislative proposal, and it is as a declaration of policy that I welcome the introduction of this Bill and that I propose to consider it for a moment.<lb/>
In many respects I cannot help feeling that the Bill is unnecessarily complicated in its details. Another defect seems to me to be that it does not proceed upon any very intelligible principle. For instance, it is difficult to understand upon what principle the term of twelve years has been fixed. Why is it that the members of the reformed House are to sit for twelve years any more than any other period? Why, again, is one section of this House to be composed of 100 members and another section of 120 members? There does not seem to be any very clear principle which has determined these particular figures. The machinery for electing the Lords of Parliament is somewhat complicated and difficult to understand, and even the schedule of qualifications at the end of the Bill is, I imagine, put forward rather more as a suggestion and as a basis than as any hard-and-fast rule which we have to accept. Into all these details it is not necessary to enter at this particular moment, but I cannot help feeling that when we come to a final solution of the problem of the constitution of our Second Chamber it will be desirable, if possible, to discover some rather more simple method than that which is proposed by this Bill.<lb/>
In order to consider the Bill effectively it is necessary, I think, to understand what is the problem with which this Bill seeks to deal. Why is it that we are discussing the reform of this House at all at this moment? What is the complaint brought against your Lordships' House, and which has necessitated the introduction of this Bill? The complaint is not that this House is com
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0324"/>
<col>639</col>
posed of Peers. We have the authority of the Lord Chancellor that that is not the complaint which is brought against your Lordships' House. In his speech on this Bill the other night the Lord Chancellor said&#x2014;
<quote>"No one questions the great talent and distinction in this House, or its illustrious past. It is not the case that individual Peers are looked upon with dislike in the country; on the contrary, I believe they are popular and well liked all over the country."</quote>
I agree with the noble and learned Lord, though I cannot help noticing, in passing, that his language is very different from that which has been used so much lately by many of his colleagues. The real complaint against this House is contained in the next words of the noble and learned Lord's speech&#x2014;
<quote>"The people of this country are naturally very tolerant of authority, very tractable, and do not care very much whether there are hereditary duties or not provided that they secure what they think is fair play."</quote>
That, my Lords, is the whole complaint that has been brought against this House in the past. We shall be commencing tomorrow a discussion upon the proposals of the Government, and we shall have an opportunity then of examining their proposals for establishing fair-play between the two Houses of Parliament.<lb/>
But let us for a moment consider the Bill from that point of view. The real complaint against this House in the past has been this, that its numbers were too large for effective business; and, secondly, there was a complaint against the proportion in which the political views of your Lordships are distributed in this House. I should have thought that the remedy for those two evils was very obvious, and might have been provided by a somewhat more simple procedure than that which is laid down in this Bill. The obvious remedy for the first evil is to reduce the numbers of your Lordships' House. That is a remedy provided in the Bill, and upon that particular feature of it I think very little criticism has been made. The Bill of the noble Marquess proposes to reduce the membership of this House to about 350. I have heard very few criticisms of that figure, although there have been some suggestions from the other side of the House that even that number was too large. Whether it be too large or too small is a detail for Committee stage discussion. At any rate, this Bill does meet the first objection to the large numbers of
<col>640</col>
the House. The second object of this Bill is to equalise Party representation in this House, and all the criticism against the Bill has been directed to this second point, and it is just upon this second point&#x2014;the machinery whereby the equalisation of Parties in this House is sought&#x2014;that the Bill appears to me to be unnecessarily complicated, and I am even doubtful whether, with all its complications, the Bill would really achieve the desired result.<lb/>
I would suggest that by a simpler method a real equalisation of Parties might be obtained. I would suggest that once you have decided what should be the number who should sit in this House, the leaders of the two political Parties of the day should, in the first instance, select an equal number of Lords of Parliament to be represented in the Second Chamber, and that subsequently all vacancies in the representation should be filled up on the recommendation of the Prime Minister of the day by the nomination of the Crown. If that were done, we could not hear any more of those phrases such as "loaded dice" and the other phrases which have come from the opposite side of the House and which are directed against this Bill. Such a procedure would be simple, and it would give an equal chance to both the great political Parties of the day at all times, not only of getting their Bills passed, but of getting their Bills rejected, because there are two features in this question, one of which is perpetually neglected by the Government. They tell us that they object not merely to the rejection of Liberal measures by your Lordships but to the passing of Conservative measures by your Lordships also, though that is a feature of the question for which they have never attempted to provide any remedy at all. It is obviously out of place to develop at this moment in any detail a scheme of that sort. I merely mention it in order to say that I should greatly prefer some simple machinery of that kind, either to that which is set up in this Bill, or, still more, to the purely elected body which is so often suggested in various quarters of the House. But in any case, whether this Bill be accepted in all its details or whether some other scheme be provided for establishing an effective Second Chamber, I do hope that it may be possible to provide that those who sit in the Second Chamber shall sit there for life and not for any limited period, because it is only by such a tenure you can secure that real
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0325"/>
<col>641</col>
independence which is an essential characteristic, an essential feature, of any Second Chamber.<lb/>
It is inevitable that a question so large so grave, and so difficult as the reform of the Constitution of this country should arouse differences of opinion and call forth many suggestions, but surely that is a reason for proceeding slowly and cautiously in the matter, surely that is a reason for trying to secure only the minimum of change which is necessary to meet admitted defects in our present Constitution. Whether this Bill be perfect in all its details or not, no one, I think, can deny that it marks a stage, and a very important stage, in the Constitutional development of this country, and the chief value to be attached to it in my mind is the indication which it gives of the spirit in which your Lordships are prepared to approach this question of reforming the Constitution. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack paid a well-deserved tribute the other night to the spirit which had been indicated in this Debate. All those who have spoken on this Bill, even those who have criticised it most severely, have admitted that it marks a great advance upon any-thing which has been suggested in the past. Your Lordships passed last year a number of Resolutions on the motion of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches (Lord Rosebery). Those Resolutions were attacked at the time on the ground that they were vague and indefinite, and because of those criticisms I think your Lordships were bound, if you were in earnest in the matter, to fill in the details and give some indication of the lines on which you were proposing to proceed, and I regard this Bill as a frank and courageous attempt to fill in the details of those Resolutions and to put before the country a definite policy. I do not think it has been suggested that this Bill could settle the Constitutional question, but its introduction at this moment and its acceptance by your Lordships' House&#x2014;I hope it will be accepted&#x2014;will make the solution of that question easier in that day when a Government can be found to deal with the question as a whole; not in the interests either of individual privileges or of the political Party of the hour, but in the interests of the permanent needs of the country; and when that day comes the Government, approaching the question on those lines, will have, I think, to seek a solution, not by the force of a composite majority, but upon lines
<col>642</col>
which will secure the consent of all Parties in the State.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01207"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SAYE AND SELE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope you will not be offended when I say that the Benches opposite remind me of a kaleidoscope. Looking through it during the First Reading of this Bill, and indeed at this moment, one sees a harmonious and beautiful picture; but as one turns it round during successive speeches little bits of glass seem to be falling about&#x2014;brother upon brother, David upon Jonathan, may I say Willoughby de Broke upon Newton, Raglan upon Bedford&#x2014;and this, as it seems to me, because all along the Conservative line there has been a general playing with the hereditary principle.<lb/>
Look at some of the little bits of glass as they fall and make new pictures. Lord Bathurst protested with all his strength against the Bill. He had spoken to many noble Lords about the Bill, but had not met one who <i>en bloc</i> approved of it. Many noble Lords, he said, were going to vote for the Bill because they believed the noble Marquess to be a safe man to follow. Lord St. Levan said they realised that the people were not prepared to support the hereditary principle. Lord Lamington questioned whether the hereditary principle was as unpopular as it was the fashion to make out. He sometimes doubted whether there was any half-way house between the hereditary and the elective principle. The Earl of Wicklow was amazed that such proposals should be submitted by the noble Marquess. Lord Faber said most of them would prefer to leave the House of Lords in its present condition. Public opinion, so far as he could gather, was for better or worse, against the hereditary principle. He deplored the fact. The Duke of Bedford did not believe that the creation of such an Assembly would be possible save on a purely elective principle. Lord Raglan intended to vote against the Bill&#x2014;a Conservative Agents' policy.<lb/>
So much for these lesser lights. But what does Lord Newton say? He says that noble Lords opposite have burnt their boats. I cordially agree with him. You have burnt your House-boat, and now you are running up and down the bank trying to let riverside lodgings, varying the monotony with an occasional dive into the 'flames to
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0326"/>
<col>643</col>
try and save your valuables&#x2014;some antique, some modern, but mostly inherited from your fathers. But, lastly, we come to the most pathetic picture of all. In the middle of the House-boat, in solitary grandeur, sits my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke awaiting the end, painting pictures of what might have been, and feeding the flames chiefly with members of His Majesty's Government. My Lords, I must point the moral. With all possible respect to the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, this Bill is moulded on the policy of Ananias. I do not allude to that gentleman's inability to give a correct version of the day's doings, but to his unfortunate habit of keeping a bit up his sleeve. This Bill, whether you look at its qualifications or whether you look at its proposed electorate, reeks of the hereditary principle. You have here a Bill professing to give effect to our pious Resolutions on the hereditary principle, professing to correct the unfairness between Parties, yet retaining the hereditary principle and retaining a permanent Conservative majority in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I cannot conclude without a word regarding the speech of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches (Lord Rosebery). The outpourings of his stricken soul were as usual eloquent if unconvincing. There seemed to be going on in his mind a duel between the Peers' Bill and the Parliament Bill. His cry of anguish seemed to be&#x2014;Fools to the right of me, knaves to the left of me, I'm one in six hundred. With his usual astuteness he recognised that the Peers' Bill was armed with blank and the Parliament Bill with ball, and, of course, he would vote against both of them. Who are the people, he says, who will accept the degrading position which is to be offered under the Parliament Bill in this ancient House? Who are the acolytes, the sycophants, persons who will consent to an abject and degraded existence under the Parliament Bill, and who will consent to fill the denuded Benches of this House? I have no quarrel with the noble Earl over his vain questionings. He may ask what questions he likes, but I would that he had kept his answer within the area of his stricken soul. He linked up the answer with followers of His Majesty's Government, and said he supposed that the Government had some of their followers ready to come to hand and do what would be required of them under the Parliament Bill.<lb/>
<col>644</col>
Being a hearty supporter of the Parliament Bill believing it to be the only solution of the present difficulties and a freedom withal from the very abject and degraded existence of which the noble Earl speaks, I ask myself. What is this that he calls us? A sycophant is a flatterer. May I remind the noble Earl that with the flatterers&#x2014;that is, near by&#x2014;were busy mockers of an honest attempt to find a fair way for social reform from yonder to yonder&#x2014;social reform pausing, it may be, for a while, to receive hospitality at your Lordships' hands, then passing forward. What, in the next place, is an acolyte? An acolyte is a subordinate officer in the Romish Church&#x2014;one who slings incense. I say at once that I would rather sling incense over the Parliament Bill from the Back Benches of the Liberal Party than nonsense from any other part of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
But, my Lords, enough. I do not wish to quarrel with the noble Earl. Indeed, I sympathise with him&#x2014;poised on a Cross Bench thinking of one thing, and, as he told us, talking of another. When he called us acolytes did he not intend to call us aconites?&#x2014;pretty little flowers that bloom in the backwoods. In a few days, when the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack gives the command, Ayes to the left by the Bar, we will strew the path with these little yellow flowers, and flowers that bloom in the spring will have something to do with the case of the Parliament Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01208"><member>LORD KILLANIN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should feel grateful to your Lordships if you would allow me a few minutes in which to state that, although I do not believe I am a reactionary, and while I consider that some changes might well be carried out in the composition of this House, I shall, if the House goes to a Division, vote against this Bill. I shall also endeavour to show your Lordships why I consider that it will be dangerous and most unwise for this House to give a Second Reading to this Bill and thus not only endorse the principles of the main propositions which the Bill contains, but agree to the many inferences which can legitimately be drawn from your action in giving it a Second Reading. I am not going into the merits, or the demerits, as I think them, of the particular proposals in this Bill. This is not the occasion for doing so, and after all, the merits or the demerits of the particular proposal is not the important point.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0327"/>
<col>645</col>
The important aspect of the question to-day is the effect and the consequences of your Lordships giving a Second Reading to this Bill. In my opinion, the certain and inevitable consequences will be ruinous to the good name and prestige of the existing House. I think it will be disastrous to the utility and to the authority of this House if your Lordships agree to the Second Reading of this Bill and to the principles which it contains. May I briefly put my case by asking and answering one or two questions? What is this House? Who are we who are members of it? What does this Bill propose to do to this House, and what will be the consequences of that action? First, what is this House to-day? I am not going into its ancient history, in which so many of the ancestors of your Lordships have played a conspicuous part. I mean, what is the practical position of this House to-day in the established Constitution of the country? It is one of the three Estates of the Realm. It is one of the two Houses of the Legislature. It is a component part of the established Constitution of this country. And who are we who are members of it? We are the trustees. It is in our hands that the powers to guide this House, to manage that trust, properly rest. We are not here of our own accord. Our powers here are not our private property. They are public property, and we are public trustees to protect and manage this great trust. Therefore I submit to your Lordships that while we hold that trust, and while it seems we are going to continue to hold it for some years, we should do nothing which would injure the good name or the authority of this House.<lb/>
Then what does this Bill propose to do? In the first place, let me say that this Bill will do nothing&#x2014;that is partly my objection to it&#x2014;because it is not contemplated that it is going to become law. Opposed as I am to the Bill I might conceivably be argued into voting for it if I thought it was going to become law. It is not suggested by the noble Marquess that this Bill is to become law in the immediate future. Therefore the question is, What does this Bill say of this House? It says that six-sevenths of the existing House ought to be deprived of their trust&#x2014;that 400 members of this House ought to be declared by Statute ineligible to hold such a trust, and that a few members, about 100, I believe, may perhaps he retained in order, as I see it said, to add an
<col>646</col>
element of weakness to the new House. If your Lordships give a Second Reading to this Bill, that is the verdict you will have passed on this House. That is the condemnation, the irrevocable condemnation, of the House that you will have put on record if you give this Bill a Second Reading. And what will be the consequence of doing that? The consequence will be that you will have utterly discredited this House and deprived it of its repute, its authority, and its utility, and in my opinion it will be well nigh impossible from this day forth for this House to do anything of importance where there is any opposition in the matter. That will be the consequence of giving a Second Reading to this Bill. Yet in the same breath I hear it said that the House which you will thus have condemned and defamed is to do a lot of extremely brave things to-morrow and the day after&#x2014;it is to deal with the Veto Bill, with Home Rule, and with Welsh Disestablishment. Why, we will not be able to lift a little finger much less deal with any of these questions if we have thus condemned ourselves.<lb/>
I do not believe that noble Lords in this House agree with that condemnation. I doubt whether any noble Lord, even the noble Marquess, agrees with that condemnation. But to those who do agree with it, and above all to those who do not, I say, Ought we to pass this condemnation on the House as long as we hold our trust? Is there any excuse for passing it unless the noble Marquess really foresees that he is going to hand over this trust to new trustees? If the noble Marquess can tell us that he foresees that position in the immediate future, then I think there might be a case possibly for this Bill, though I am against it on its merits. I submit to your Lordships that the only justification for agreeing to this Bill is that you contemplate and can foresee that it will become law. The noble Marquess when introducing this Bill may possibly have thought that it would be accepted by the Government and become the law of the land&#x2014;it or some modification of it. I venture very respectfully to ask the noble Marquess whether his attitude towards this Bill has been in no way changed by the fact that the Government have refused to adopt it. Lord Curzon said he was greatly disappointed with the reception that the Bill had received from the Government&#x2014;the unfriendly, I think he called it, and uncompromising attitude that the Government had adopted with
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0328"/>
<col>647</col>
reference to it. I respectfully suggest to the noble Marquess, does that not affect at all his attitude towards this Bill? Inasmuch as he sees that it is not going to become law, inasmuch as he sees that this House will have to go on and fulfil most important duties, would it not be wiser and better now not to press this Bill further, but to drop it or let it be adjourned?<lb/>
I am one of those who thought that this House made a mistake in accepting the Resolutions of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches. I think the House got somewhat into a hole over having accepted them, but I see no good now in getting deep down into a pit, which I believe we will be doing if we give a Second Reading to this Bill. I believe that this House has suffered for the last fifteen months in repute and in authority owing to the fact that we have been living all this time with these ropes of Rosebery Resolutions round our necks. The noble Marquess thinks it is a consequence of having passed these Resolutions that he must now lead us to the scaffold. I would agree with the noble Marquess if the third stage was likely to come off, and if the hangman was to come forward from the Government side and remove the plank and hang us. I would agree then. But I strongly object to being condemned and defamed and exhibited to public gaze on the scaffold but left unhanged, and told into the bargain that one ought to be an extremely important and useful citizen and legislator during the next few years.<lb/>
I constantly see it said that this House is dead. The noble Earl on the Cross Benches announced to the country some mouths ago that this House was dead. I see this Bill referred to as a death-blow. I hear our policy described as suicidal. What I object to is that it is none of these things. We are not dead, but we are going to be buried alive, and that is a very much worse fate both for ourselves and for the public weal. Give a dog a bad name, but, if you do, hang it. Don't tie a rope round its neck, don't tether it, don't revile it, and then when you have done that tell this noble hound that it is to run Home Rule to earth and tear it to pieces, and even to vomit the Veto Bill. For these reasons I venture to ask seriously and earnestly but respectfully as an insignificant member of your Lordships' House, Cannot the noble Marquess, inas-
<col>648</col>
much as the Government have adopted this attitude to the Bill, see his way not to press this matter any further? If he does press it, I shall feel bound to vote against the Second Reading, and I earnestly ask your Lordships to take a similar course, because if you give the Bill a Second Reading you will, I believe, be guilty of an action which will be fatal, not only to the future of this House, but to its present effectiveness as a House of the Legislature of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01209"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I regret to find myself in opposition to the noble Marquess who has for so long led this side of the House and for whom personally I have the very sincerest affection and regard, but the matter is so serious a one that, loth as I am to do so, I feel I must rise to oppose him on this occasion. I may say that I agree with the speech of the noble Earl on the Cross Bench, Lord Rosebery. I was unfortunately unwell and not able to be here to hear his speech, but I have read it with great interest, and I thoroughly agree with him that this was not a Bill for any member on this side of this House to bring before the country. It is a Bill that could not possibly be passed into law unless it were introduced by a Government, and a strong Government, too, with a majority not only in this House, but in the other House as well. For that reason I sincerely regret that the noble Marquess has introduced this Bill. We have the Resolutions which were adopted by your Lordships and are known as the Rosebery Resolutions. We have also the further Resolutions which the noble Marquess himself introduced and which were adopted by your Lordships. I would like to ask the noble Marquess why he has gone so far beyond those Resolutions? This Bill is, I believe, the most revolutionary that has ever been introduced into your Lordships' House, either from this side or the other side of the House.<lb/>
I have heard a great number of so-called Second Reading speeches, but in this debate, with the exception of the speech of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches and that of the noble Viscount who leads the House, the Bill itself has not been criticised. I think it is only right that noble Lords who sit on this side of the House and those who sit on the back benches of the opposite side should realise
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0329"/>
<col>649</col>
the position in which they are asked to place themselves. The first proposition in the Bill of the noble Marquess is that 100 Peers should be elected out of some 300 existing Peers with certain qualifications. That would leave some 370 of your Lordships not only without a qualification to be elected as a member of this House, but in a worse position than the meanest of the electors who return members to the House of Commons. Every noble Lord in this House has at the present moment an equal right to sit and vote in this House. Sheer ability, and possibly opportunity, has put certain noble Lords on the Front Benches. There are many of you who, if you had had the opportunity, might have been occupying an equally important position, but circumstances have been adverse. The result is that you remain "backwoodsmen," while the Front Benches are occupied by noble Lords who, I am sure, are well worthy of their position. But look at your own position. As I have said, 100 are to be elected out of 300 with a qualification; the remaining 350, or whatever it may be, have only the power to vote for the 100. You are therefore in a worse position than the 300 qualified Peers, because you cannot be elected as a member of this House by your brother Peers. You may be elected in either of the other two categories provided in the Bill, but you are so much the worse in respect to this House. You are, as I have said, in a far worse position than the meanest elector to the House of Commons, and for this reason. I am, of course, only alluding to the first category. You can only elect; you cannot be elected; whilst the meanest voter for a Member of Parliament can not only vote, but can, if he wishes, stand for a seat in the House of Commons. Therefore, if your Lordships accept this Bill you are putting yourselves in a worse position in regard to this category.<lb/>
There is another point. No doubt on the first election noble Lords who sit on the Front Benches and those who are prominent in your Lordships' House will be elected. But what is to happen afterwards? In the course of four or five years one-third of that 100 will have to retire, and the Whips will send your Lordships&#x2014;that is, the 350 <i>plus</i> the remaining 200 who are not elected&#x2014;a notice to say that these gentlemen are very honourable gentlemen and very fitted to sit in the House of Lords, or whatever
<col>650</col>
you may call it, and they will trust that you will vote for them. But for how long will your Lordships continue to take an interest in voting for Peers knowing that you have no possible chance of being elected yourselves? Let me give your Lordships an example of what happens every Parliament. At every Parliament there are sixteen Scottish Peers elected to sit to represent Scotland, and there are, roughly speaking, 100 electors for the Scottish Peers to Parliament. How many of those vote? I have stood for election for something like twenty-five years, and I have never in the whole course of my life, to the best of my recollection, known more than forty-two votes given for any Peer at that election. Therefore your Lordships will see that not one-half take the interest which they ought to in the election of Scottish Peers. The noble Marquess himself is a representative of a very honourable and ancient Scottish family and has a vote for the Peers of Scotland. I have constantly written to him, in common with other Scottish Peers, asking him to do me the honour of giving me his vote and support, but he has never to my knowledge responded to that invitation. I do not think he has ever troubled himself to vote at the election of Scottish Peers. I do not wish to labour that point. I merely quote it as an example of how, if you have an election where your Lordships have no possibility of being elected, the whole thing will be apt to be turned into a caucus for the 100 who are in. That is what I believe will be the result&#x2014;the 100 will be elected, and will prove to be an absolute caucus in the House of Lords. I would far sooner see the whole principle of heredity done away with. If we have lost the support of the country, which I do not for one moment believe&#x2014;Scotland is the most Radical country in the whole of the world, and I do not believe that even Scotland is against the House of Lords one tittle&#x2014;but if we have lost the support of the country, better let the whole thing go rather than simply retain 100 nominal members in this House. I think it would be the height of folly. It would be the ruin of the whole thing.<lb/>
I come now to the second category of elections to your Lordships' House. There is a tentative suggestion that there should be certain electoral groups in various parts of the country, that these groups should be made into electoral colleges, and that the Members of Parliament in those groups should elect a certain number of members
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0330"/>
<col>651</col>
of this House. All I say to that is that I do not agree that the members of the House of Commons are the best people to elect. If you give them this opportunity, you will find it very hard to get them to resign the position which you have given them. Therefore it is most important, before this Bill leaves your Lordships' House, that you should be absolutely certain about the effect of the working of this second category.<lb/>
I pass to the Schedule. I hate this Schedule. I hate your qualifications. Why, I ask your Lordships, should a member who has been a week or a month or a year&#x2014;there is no limit&#x2014;who has been either a long or a short time in the House of Commons and then succeeds his father and becomes a qualified representative in this House&#x2014;why should he have a better right to sit here than a distinguished soldier, or anybody like that? I have in my mind a distinguished soldier in this House who, I believe, has no qualifications under this Bill. He is one of the most distinguished soldiers who has ever served in the British Army. I do not know whether he is here to-day, but I trust he will forgive my mentioning his name&#x2014;I refer to Lord Dunmore. He has gained the greatest prize that a soldier can win&#x2014;the Victoria Cross. He has been through several campaigns with the greatest distinction. His father died, and he succeeded. Well, he has not the qualification under this Bill, although he is a major in his regiment, to sit in your Lordships' reformed House. Why should he not have? He is a leader of men, a proved man. Yet a man who has lived in the atmosphere of the House of Commons for a year or so is regarded as competent to be elected to your Lordships' reformed House in preference to one who has proved himself to be a great man and a great leader.<lb/>
I would like to see how this matter of qualification is going to work out. If your Lordships will look at the Bill and the Schedule, you will see that the whole of the qualified persons are officials. There are one or two qualifications for soldiers and sailors&#x2014;I do not propose to read them; your Lordships know them very well. There are Cabinet Ministers and&#x2014;officials. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Under-Secretaries, Board of Trade Secretaries, and&#x2014;officials; Lords Lieutenant, and officials; High Commissioners, and officials. Then we come to members of the
<col>652</col>
Privy Council, members of the House of Commons, and officials again. And so on. So that the whole of your qualified persons are officials, ex-members of the House of Commons, and a certain limited number of noble Lords who have obtained high military or naval distinction. What is going to happen when you come to elect them? You must bear in mind that less than one-third of your Lordships' House is to be elected by your Lordships, and two-thirds are to be elected from outside. In twenty or thirty years, how many of the noble Lords who presently sit on these Benches as officials will still sit, and who will be the officials who will take their places? One-third of the members of your Lordships' reformed House will be your elected nominees; two-thirds will be those elected from outside. Will it not follow that in twenty or thirty years' time your officials' qualifications will have disappeared? That will be the result of your electing under that category.<lb/>
Finally, I say I do not like the Bill. I am stoutly opposed to it. But I will make a very strong appeal to the whole of the noble Lords who sit on this side of the House and behind the Front Bench. I know that there are many of them who are anxious to vote against the Bill. I appeal to them most strongly not to do so. I think that at this moment it would be a great mistake that we should show dissensions&#x2014;if there are dissensions&#x2014;between ourselves and our leaders. I appeal to noble Lords on this side not to vote against the Bill, but I also appeal in the strongest way that I can to the noble Marquess, if we let the Second Reading of this Bill go through, not to continue to press it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01210"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened to the speeches which have been delivered during this debate with deep interest, but with some misgivings and also with some feelings of regret. I should like, quite briefly, to tell your Lordships my views with regard to this measure and my attitude towards it, because I feel that if a Division is taken to-night I shall be unable to go into the Lobby to support the noble Marquess. Every one will recognise the enormous labours involved and the hours of discussion which must have taken place in order to produce a piece of constructive legislation like the Bill which is before your Lordships' House. It is, therefore, in no spirit of captious and idle
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0331"/>
<col>653</col>
criticism that I venture to say that I disagree with the proposals contained in this measure. I profoundly believe that these proposals can never ultimately solve the problem which now confronts us. I trust that no noble Lord on this side of the House will think that my action is in any way disloyal to the noble Marquess, for, after all, I am bound to him by ties of kinship, of friendship, and also of gratitude; but I feel that on this occasion we have to consider not the interest of our power, but the capital of our power, and it is not to the noble Marquess himself not to our Party in general but to ourselves and ourselves alone that we have to justify the action which we take in regard to this measure.<lb/>
It is now some eighteen months or two years since Lord Rosebery brought in his Resolutions. At that time I ventured to protest against those Resolutions. I numbly suggested to the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, that if once the hereditary principle was abandoned, if once that principle was thrown over board, there was no alternative but to go to the other recognised principle, the principle of election; and I venture to say that the events which have occurred since those Resolutions were brought into this House have strengthened me in the opinion which I held at that time, and I see nothing whatsoever to in any way shake my confidence in the views I then held. We then came to the Resolutions of the noble Marquess in November, 1910. I felt that those Resolutions were brought forward to mitigate the abuse and contumely which had been poured on the hereditary principle by the Party opposite. I subscribed to those Resolutions. I supported them. It was the eve of the General Election, and it was the duty of every Peer in this House to support the Party to which he belonged and the House of which he was a member. But I frankly say this, that having had some little experience of the last General Election I do not think that the British public displayed any great enthusiasm for the Resolutions of the noble Marquess. They were somewhat complicated in character; they were rather long and difficult to explain; there was a certain amount of prejudice, largely created by the Party of noble Lords opposite, with the idea that your Lordships desired to absorb the Prerogative of the Crown. On the other hand, there were many who profoundly distrusted the proposal of the noble Mar-
<col>654</col>
quess that we should give up on behalf of this House the old control which we claimed to possess over financial measures.<lb/>
I believe that our countrymen dislike a coalition, and equally they do not like a Chamber which is called a composite Chamber. The only question, in my humble opinion, which we have to decide to-night is this&#x2014;How will the electors view these proposals of the noble Marquess? In what light will they regard them? We know that noble Lords opposite have given us no support. We know that the noble Viscount opposite has not in any way shown a desire or wish to co-operate with the noble Marquess in the views which the noble Marquess put forward. We have, therefore, to realise what will be the view of our countrymen with regard to these proposals, knowing full well that the proposals are going to receive every criticism and a good deal of abuse and contumely poured upon them by representatives of noble Lords opposite when they go on to the platforms of England. The first question which the British public will ask is this. Is this proposed composition of the House of Lords a good one, and, if it is, is it likely to work in practice? My fear is that the British public will say that they do not think the composition proposed is a good one, and that the House so composed will not work in practice.<lb/>
Let me take, for example, the first section of Peers&#x2014;the Lords who are to be elected by their fellow Peers. It is obviously felt by the noble Marquess and those who work with him that election by Peers who are themselves excluded can hardly commend itself to popular support. Hence qualification is added. How do these provisions affect one another? The need of qualification emphasises the inadequacy of the electorate, while the need of the electorate weakens the effect of the qualification. I very much fear, if I or any other noble Lord went before a popular audience and tried to explain to them the basis upon which the hereditary Peers were to preserve seats in this House, that within a very short space of time the reply which would come to me from that audience would be this, "Your proposals are mutually destructive." I turn to the second category of Peers, those who are to be elected by members of Parliament. To my mind it is perfectly clear that those Lords elected by three or five Members of Parliament, as the case may be, will come here and assert that they
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0332"/>
<col>655</col>
sit in virtue, not only of the electorate which has returned them, but also in virtue of the 100,000 or 200,000 or quarter of a million, as the case may be, of electors who return the Members of Parliament to the other House. In virtue of that they would consider that they had a far superior claim to that of the elected hereditary Peers. They will be arrogant and aggressive in their attitude towards those of us who happen to be elected qualified Lords. But that is not all. At the end of the six years, when a General Election takes place, those Members of Parliament who have returned Lords to this House may themselves be rejected by their own constituencies; so the result will be that during the first six years of their tenure they may represent and have behind them a powerful electorate, but in the last six years of their tenure of power they may represent nothing else but the ghosts of a deceased electorate. To begin with, they will be arrogant, overbearing, and aggressive; towards the end of their tenure they will become the servant of their former servant.<lb/>
Lastly, take the third section, the Lords who are to be nominated by the Prime Minister&#x2014;I desire to use the phrase employed by the noble Marquess&#x2014;"in regard to the strength of Parties in this House." That means that these Lords of Parliament nominated by the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister will be absolutely at the beck and call and under the control of the Prime Minister himself. They will not be independent. They will be his servants. I very much think that the British public looking at this section of the Lords of Parliament will say, "This section are nothing but the jackals of the Prime Minister, and they do not sit in the House of Lords in virtue of any authority from us."<lb/>
So much for the various sections of Lords who are to sit in this House. But what about the House as a whole? How will these sections generally work together? I do not think that the British public like a composite House, a House composed of members who will not derive their authority one and all from the same source. Let us bear in mind the fact that the British public have had the experience of the last two or three years; they have seen the struggle which has taken place between this House of Parliament and the other House, between the elected Chamber and the hereditary Chamber, and they will view the proposal
<col>656</col>
to form a composite House, in which the elective clement and the hereditary element are combined, as merely an attempt to perpetuate within the four walls of this House the struggle which has brought us to the present crisis.<lb/>
One word on the subject of divorcing legislative power and legislative authority from social position. As I understand, under this Bill it is determined that elected Lords shall in no way be considered qualified for an hereditary Peerage. After all, what is the most precious tradition that this House embodies and preserves? Surely it is the association of social position with public duty. The other night Lord Curzon dwelt on this theme with some eloquence, and I think it is even admitted by noble Lords opposite that one of the distinguishing features of our caste is the sense of public duty and the obligations we have towards either county or public affairs. But once you divorce these two factors you create a body of ennobled individuals with possibly no public or Parliamentary duties to perform. The danger is that they may sink into a mere social caste, slightly parasitic in character, which can but be regarded as a menace to the State. We have not far to look for an example of this. We have only to look to neighbouring countries to see what I venture to foretell being absolutely carried out. Once it is confirmed by this House that social position and legislative or Parliamentary power shall be divorced one from the other, I cannot possibly see how you can prevent the concomitant from following, and you can no longer claim that primogeniture is based upon any sound principle.<lb/>
I have a profound conviction that any scheme for the reorganisation of this House must be short and simple, and one which the humblest and most unintelligent elector can easily understand. Your Lordships will notice that the Parliament Bill, bad, contemptible, and odious as it is, has one great merit. It costs a penny. The Bill of the noble Marquess costs twopence. The price of the one indicates shortness and simplicity; that of the other suggests that it is more prolix. Your Lordships may think that to-night I have looked too much to the consideration of what position the British public will take with regard to our action; but, after all, it is we, and we alone, who have to fight on the platforms of
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0333"/>
<col>657</col>
England any reorganisation proposals laid before us. Of this I feel sure, that the electorate will never give their sanction to the election of a new body the composition of which they do not clearly understand and two-thirds of whose members will not be directly responsible to the people themselves, and to a scheme which as a whole is not in harmony with modern democratic thought.<lb/>
If the noble Viscount the Leader of the House will get up and say that he will co-operate with the noble Marquess and make his proposals into a Bill which will satisfy both great Parties in the State, and will ensure to this House the full and proper legislative powers which any Second Chamber is entitled to have, then I would at once resume my seat and hold my peace. But, having listened to this debate with great care, I have seen no indication either on the part of the noble Viscount or of any noble Lord who sits in the Cabinet with him, that they will give the slightest co-operation, the slightest help whatsoever, to the noble Marquess in his endeavours. Indeed the Liberals and the Radical Press have done nothing since Lord Lansdowne produced his proposals but pour contempt and ridicule and contumely upon them. Therefore I sincerely trust that the noble Marquess will appeal right over the heads of noble Lords opposite to the British public themselves. But if that appeal is to be made with success I feel confident that success can only be achieved by proclaiming our support to the principle of a uniform House, in which the Peers of Great Britain shall form the panel, and constructed on the single democratic principle of election.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01211"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF SOMERSET</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it right, in the present state of affairs, to say that I, for one, am unable to vote for the Second Reading of the Bill brought in by the noble Marquess the Leader of our Party in this House, who, as we all know, has had a most difficult task before him in framing this Bill. I regret extremely the fact that I cannot give him my support, but the time has now come when it is one's duty to act regardless of Party and to think only of one's King and country. The Government, as every one knows, have sold themselves body and soul to the Nationalists and the Labour Party, and the former have exacted Home Rule and the consequent breaking up of the Union as their reward for keeping the Government in power. To carry Home Rule the Govern-
<col>658</col>
ment saw that they must first wreck our ancient Constitution of King, Peers, and Commons, as this House, they knew, would never betray the country and pass a Bill for Home Rule for Ireland, and so they have brought forward their Parliament Bill for that purpose.<lb/>
But because such utterly unprincipled Party politicians as those who sit on the Treasury Bench have, by gross misrepresentation, raised a cry against this House amongst a certain section of the voters of this country I cannot see why our Party should become their accomplices, and by destroying this House desert the millions of loyal people in this country who have always looked up to it as at present constituted as the only safeguard they had against ill-considered legislation by the House of Commons and tyrannical and unjust measures of a Government such as the present. The late Lord Salisbury once said&#x2014;
<quote>"Whatever happens, never give up the hereditary principle in this House,"</quote>
and I stick to his advice. The moment you introduce the elective principle you destroy the independence which has always been the best and greatest feature of this House. I hope, my Lords, we shall stand up for our ancient Constitution and for the huge majority of loyal people in this country, who, if we will only be true to ourselves and to them, will, I am sure, back its against those who for purely Party purposes are trying to destroy this House.<lb/>
The country is tired of revolutionary projects and wishes to get to work on measures which safeguard the Empire and the United Kingdom, and give the working classes the chance of bettering themselves and remaining secure in their employment and the fruits of their labour. Why should we be a party to Constitutional changes which will destroy all security? The Government have no object in view, in the Constitional changes they contemplate, but plunder. If we make these changes easier by accepting this Bill, our action will be followed by further attacks on property of all kinds, which the man of small means will find will ruin him as well as those who are better off. I beg to thank you, my Lords, for the patient hearing you have given me, the more so as, of course, many on this side of the House disagree with me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01212"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT GOSCHEN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot help feeling that those who have not
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0334"/>
<col>659</col>
been long members of this House and support this Bill may lay themselves open to the criticism that the shortness of their service more easily persuades them to vote for a measure which curtails some of their privileges, and that the sacrifice on their part may not be so deeply felt as by those who have long upheld the traditions of this House. I do not think that would really be a fair argument, because, after all, it is the age of the traditions of this House and not the personal relationship to them which is valued by your Lordships. I am sure there is no member of your Lordships' House who will support this Bill with a light heart. Those of us who support it do so because we believe it to be one solution of a most difficult problem which will have to be solved by us on this side of the House, not by the means which we would judge to be best&#x2014;namely, a joint agreement, which I still think the people of this country most desire. But if it cannot be done by that means, do noble Lords on the other side of the House really suppose that on the question of remodelling a part of the Constitution your Lordships' House is to have no say in the matter or take no part beyond giving a "Yea" or "Nay" to the Government's Veto Bill? That is to say, first they are to assent to the deprivation of their powers, and then they are to discus the character of a reformed House of Lords?<lb/>
The only arrangement, if arrangement it can be called, which during this debate I have heard suggested from the other side, is that if and when the Veto Bill is passed this Bill might be tacked on for discussion, which means that your Lordships having had your powers taken away will then be allowed to discuss the new method in which they will have the privilege of enjoying this negation of duties. If the Government Bill were a complete Bill, a Bill dealing both with the relations of the two Houses and the reconstruction of this House, then it would not be necessary that a Bill of this character should be introduced. But the worst feature of the Government Bill is the hiatus which it leaves between the two parts of reconstruction, and it is this interval after your Lordships' House has been deprived of its powers and before it is remodelled which I believe contains the gravest consequences&#x2014;consequences which I do not think are fully understood by the people of this country. I think that the best way of pointing out what the consequences are is not merely by calling attention
<col>660</col>
to them, but by showing how they may be met, and by showing that we on this side of the House have a constructive policy of our own.<lb/>
Noble Lords on this side have been taunted by noble Lords opposite for not displaying any great enthusiasm for this measure, but is this an occasion for any display of enthusiasm? I am confident of this, that however conscious we may be of the need for reform noble Lords on both sides of the House deeply feel the gravity of the position and the change which will take place in the history of this House. But if on this side of the House we differ as to the provisions which may be contained in this Bill, I am confident that there is enthusiasm for the principle which underlies the Bill&#x2014;the principle of two-Chamber government as compared with the principle of one-Chamber government which we contend underlies the Government Bill. Personally I am in favour of the scheme under this Bill which, while abolishing the hereditary principle pure and simple, does not provide for a purely elective Chamber; because I think that in a Chamber whose functions are those of delay and revision and whose duty it is to obtain the passage of Bills which the people desire and to prevent the passing of those which they do not desire, it is well that some members should be independent of popular constituencies.<lb/>
If, putting aside the exigencies of Party politics, a reform of this House is desired in the interests of the country at large, I believe that some measure such as this is needed, as I have said, as a declaration of policy. But if, on the other hand, it is desired merely to meet a momentary situation in which the House of Lords is an inconvenience and the Government desire to abolish it, then at least may we not ask that our death may be a dignified one, that we should be killed outright instead of being starved to death and having our vital powers paralysed? I support this Bill because I believe that the people of the country desire a reform of the House of Lords, not for any transitory or political purposes, but because they wish this House to continue efficiently and satisfactorily to perform the functions of a Second Chamber, and continue to be what the noble Earl, Lord Carrington, described it the other night&#x2014;not in a speech which he made on this Bill, but in words which he let slip on the Second Reading of the Allotments Bill&#x2014;"one of the fairest tribunals in the world."</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01213"><member>LORD BRAYE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I take exception to the short title of this Bill. It is an Exclusion Bill. It contains the suggestion that 400 Peers should be excluded from this House, and that 120, I think, should remain. How the operation of this exclusion is to be carried out does not appear; it is not explained, it cannot be explained. By excluding 400 Peers from this House you are taking away their birthright, and that of their children and their children's children. You exclude, without knowing it, the very men whom it would be most desirable to retain. I allude to the elder members of your Lordships' House who have retired from public life, and whose counsel is the most valuable and the most sought after.<lb/>
It seems to me that the whole debate is very unreal because, as I understand the present state of affairs, there is no possibility of this Bill ever becoming law. If it is passed by this House and sent to another place, what possible chance is there of the House of Commons passing it into law? The wastepaper basket of the House of Commons is a very ample one, the amplest probably in Europe. Many things go there, and to that receptacle this Bill will find its way. One remedy which has been spoken of outside this House&#x2014;I have not heard it mentioned during this debate&#x2014;is the creation of life Peers. That seems to me a point that should have received a great deal of attention. For my own part, I do not think there is any remedy whatever in this Bill for getting over the present difficulty and embarrassment in the political world. I cannot see that it would go far, or indeed any way, towards a solution. A far greater and far more drastic solution is required for the difficulty in which the political world in England finds itself to-day.<lb/>
We want a solution far more important and enduring than anything which this Bill suggests. I cannot see why the four nations of which the United Kingdom is composed should not have their own Legislative Assemblies and the Imperial Parliament remain intact, the hereditary principle being preserved in its fulness and the elective principle being applied in the formation of the House of Commons. In that way you would secure perpetual Joint Sittings and a perpetual Referendum, because each country in the United Kingdom could express itself in its own Parliament, and its conclusions would come to the
<col>662</col>
Imperial Parliament. I cannot see why you should not deal with the four nations in the United Kingdom in the same way that you deal with the Colonies, and that they should, if necessary, make an appeal to the Imperial Parliament in the last resort, just as the Colonial Governments have a right now to appeal to the Privy Council. The Privy Council has a right to alter and check any of their conclusions, but it never does so, and never interferes. The whole system, therefore, has worked in harmony and for the good of the Empire.<lb/>
We are told that an Act of Parliament can do anything. That is a common saying. But there is one thing that an Act of Parliament cannot do, and that is convert a Scotsman into an Englishman, a Welshman into an Englishman, or an Irishman into an Englishman. The four nations in this Kingdom remain with their differences in religion and politics, and as separate as they were in the beginning. Now we are confronted with a new phenomenon&#x2014;namely, a Welsh nationality, which has become more and more accentuated. As for Ireland, the case is too self-evident to dwell upon, I am quite aware that these suggestions are not, perhaps, within the sphere of practical politics, but I mention them because I believe most firmly that the present deadlock and embarrassment in political life have shown that the differences between the two Houses of Parliament cannot be dealt with by a Bill of this kind, but require far more drastic and far deeper remedies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01214"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF RIPON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I trust I may be pardoned for intervening for a few moments on this subject. I do not stand here as one who holds a brief for any political organisation, and I think I may say for myself that I have always kept as far aloof as I could from Party aspects of questions. I hold it to be the duty of all who take part in the work of any Legislative Assembly to endeavour as far as possible to keep a dispassionate mind in the consideration of all questions submitted to them, and as I have endeavoured to do that I feel a great sympathy when I look at one side of the House and at the other. I have a great sympathy with those who feel that the composition of this House, from the hereditary quality of those who sit in it, does need some change and does not quite meet the conditions of to-day. On the other hand, I have a deep sympathy with those on the other side of the House who find
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0336"/>
<col>663</col>
themselves face to face with a condition of things on which the curtain, whatever the play may be, has not yet been raised. In some cases it is necessary to perform an operation, and in order to do that it is necessary to make use of chloroform. I can sympathise with those on the Opposition side of the House in this matter for I take it their position seems to be this, that they must submit to an operation one way or the other, but the suggestion which is made on the Government side of the House is that they should first be chloroformed without having any definite knowledge of the operation which is to ensue. That seems to be a very difficult position for the poor patient who has to undergo the operation. But I trust that, whatever be the result in the future, this House will not be put into a "hobble skirt." There is every reason for demanding freedom of action, whatever may be the condition in which this House is left. It would be a miserable thing that any legislative enactment should leave this House a mere shadow and a sham. That is not a position to which any Legislative Assembly ought to be reduced.<lb/>
But having this sympathy with both sides, I feel it my duty to ask myself one or two questions. What is the object in view? What is the purpose of a Second Chamber? As I understand, the object of a Second Chamber is that it may act as a kind of check and revising Chamber upon the actions and legislation of the other House. If I understand that idea rightly, a Second Chamber is to act in the same way as does a brake upon the wheel of a vehicle; and I put it to those who are considering this matter whether it is not absolutely essential, if that idea of a Second Chamber is to be carried out, that the power of applying the brake shall at least be a real one. There are times in which the brake is not needed, such as when the vehicle is going uphill; but when the vehicle is likely to be going downhill there is every reason for having the brake effective. If you take the view that the House of Lords represents the power of a brake it is very desirable that that power should be real.<lb/>
But the House of Lords ought to be a great deal more than a mere Chamber of Veto. I cannot help feeling that a great deal of misunderstanding has arisen respecting the word Veto. I think it is an unfortunate thing that the word has been imported into the controversy at all. The House of Lords ought to be in my judgment,
<col>664</col>
and I believe was intended to be, something, more than a mere Chamber of Veto. I understand that it was meant to be a Chamber in which certain classes of legislation should be undertaken with that deliberate consideration which is probably impossible in another place. In modern conditions the development of affairs in the House of Commons has, I imagine, reached such a stage that it is almost impossible for due and adequate consideration to be given to large and important measures, while private measures are crowded out altogether. There is a large quantity of legislation which might very fairly be undertaken in a Second Chamber. If I may use the expression, it ought to be an incubating Chamber for such classes of legislation as require the consideration of wise and experienced men. That legislation might then be transmitted to another place with the authority, not of mere heredity, but the authority of investigation arising from the fact that it had been considered by those well capable of considering it, and who had large experience and knowledge to bring to bear on these matters. With that view in one's mind it seems to me that the only thing that needs to be aimed at is how to secure in a Second Chamber&#x2014;I am speaking as it were purely in the abstract for the moment&#x2014;an adequate supply of men fitted for the purpose. Surely the supply of fitting members must come from those who have capacity and every opportunity of giving their best leisurely thoughts to public matters. I have often felt the deepest pity for members in another place who have to deliberate matters dominated by partisan considerations which their own personal judgment does not wholly ratify. That seems a very unfortunate position. But if the House of Lords fulfilled, as I believe it ought, its great function of devising legislation and giving it that leisurely consideration which many of these questions deserve and demand, then I think you would have a House of Lords which would immediately command the respect of the country and carry with it its own native authority.<lb/>
A great deal has been said about Party in this matter. If I may venture to put forward one thought respecting the Party aspect, I would earnestly ask that the thought of Party may be put very far from our minds. I cannot think that we are dealing justly by the question if we import Party considerations into our thoughts in
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0337"/>
<col>665</col>
this matter. What is wanted is not an Assembly in which there is a mechanical balance of Parties, not an Assembly in which there is a predominance of one Party, but an Assembly of straightforward, intelligent, earnest, well-equipped men who can give impartial consideration to any measure which may be submitted to them. When people talk about trying to make an Upper Chamber which shall be constructed on a basis of equalising the Parties of the moment, I would implore them to remember that Party in this country, from the Constitutional point of view, has very little meaning. Parties may rise and fall and disappear. As I understand the position, if I may speak frankly, I think that the real meaning of our present difficulties lies in this fact, that the two great Parties of which we hear so much do not really exist. That is to say, neither Party is in the same position with relation to the other which was the case thirty years ago. Party nomenclature happens to deal with the conditions and circumstances and topics of the hour. There was a time when Whig was ranged against Tory, when Conservative was ranged against Liberal; but in my judgment the Liberal Party is dead, and in my judgment the Conservative Party is dead. A new set of Parties and of conditions has arisen. The whole thought of the country is slowly and quietly reorganising itself, and the camps of Party in the future will not go along the lines of division which they followed formerly and which is given a fictitious importance to-day.<lb/>
We are passing through a time of transition, when the Parties of the future, if I think rightly, are going to be the Party of the Empire or the Party&#x2014;shall I say?&#x2014;of Socialism. At such a time it is wise that we should take into consideration the measures to be adopted in order to secure Imperial well-being. I want your Lordships to take a larger view, and to remember that we are not simply to-day this little United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; we are the British Empire, and if you are to really and adequately make the Legislature of this country what it ought to be it must take on what I cannot help calling an Imperial flavour. There ought to be representatives in this House and elsewhere of His Majesty's Dominions beyond the seas. It seems to me that unless we are prepared to make ready for the day when the Empire as a whole will need to stand together, we may be overtaken by a crisis in which, because we have not sufficiently
<col>666</col>
cemented together and consolidated the bonds of Empire, we shall be weighed in the balance and found wanting. That is my reason for saying that I want a larger view, and men who represent the great and various forces of the Empire ought to be found a place in the Legislature.<lb/>
On the question of the hereditary principle, I confess I cannot agree with the noble Duke opposite, who would prefer to surrender every vestige of the hereditary principle and accept the elective principle than adopt a measure of practical reform. I cannot see it in that light. What is it that is understood, or was originally understood, by the hereditary principle, and why was it that our ancestors took upon themselves to consecrate the hereditary principle by the formation of this House? They meant this, that the men who had gathered experience, the men who had served their country and proved themselves fitting, should take place and power in this great Assembly. Who will deny that in the past the Barons had more knowledge and information than the men who could be gathered by the populace? The idea was that the House of Lords should represent in the best and noblest sense the aristocracy of the country. We are living in an age in which if anything has been taught to us by the discoveries of recent years it is the fact that there is a natural selective force at work and that men come by inheritance and training into the possession of special aptitudes in this way. There are men who are born lawyers and born physicians, and there are men who are, born statesmen. The wisdom of the past must have desired to include in its Legislature men who, by virtue of the fact that their ancestors had served the State, had, so to speak, inherited a kind of instinct for government. It would be a great mistake to sweep away at one stroke the whole of the hereditary principle in the formation of the Second Chamber. The Bill before the House does not propose to set aside that principle, but to provide that the hereditary Peers of England shall select a certain proportion of their number to represent them in the Second Chamber, just as the Peers of Scotland and Ireland now do. That seems to me quite in harmony with precedent; it preserves the principle that you are selecting from the men who by tradition and instinct have a certain aptitude for government, and are likely to be among the best and fittest to serve. It is choosing the fittest, and I want that principle of choosing the fittest to be extended
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0338"/>
<col>667</col>
to include men from all parts of the Empire who have proved their fitness for these high responsibilities.<lb/>
I desire to see in this Chamber the fittest men from the whole Empire&#x2014;men who have served the Empire, men who know and understand what Colonial life means, men who have seen the world from a broader point of view than can be the case with many who are elected to the other House. We want men with larger views, and for that reason we should enlarge our thoughts and seek to form a really strong, loyal, well-equipped Second Chamber, composed of the wisest and most experienced men of the Empire. The age in which we are living is instinct with great changes, which are going on over the surface of the world. We stand at a time when the population of this country is threatened with decline, when the Colonies are reaching an adult age, and this is the time when we ought to husband our resources. We ought to gather the strength of the Empire, to consolidate, federate, and unify it, for if we do not, believe me, we shall in the future be full of deep and poignant and unavailing regrets that we had not seized the hour and united the Empire; for unity means strength and that concord which brings in its train prosperity and happiness. While there is much in the measure of the noble Marquess which I would consider inadequate, as your Lordships will understand from what I have said, still if the measure is put before us in this sense, Are you prepared to vote for a policy which will rectify some of the obsolete conditions of this House? I welcome it as containing a sound principle, without endorsing in the least degree its details, because whatever step we may take must be in the direction of reforming this House, but in my judgment it should be such a reformation as will enlarge its scope by opening its arms to receive from all quarters of His Majesty's Dominions those who have served, and are, therefore, fitted to govern.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01215"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL FORTESCUE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not sure that the last night of a debate like this is the one on which to go into the motives which induced the noble Marquess to bring forward this Bill, but those motives must have been of a very cogent character, or he would not have laid his cards on the Table before an adversary not likely to forego any advantage to be derived therefrom. I think that more acknowledgment might have been expressed from this side of
<col>668</col>
the House of the labour and care which must have been spent by the noble Marquess and those who have worked with him in the preparation of the Bill which we are now discussing. Having said so much, I hope I shall be acquitted of anything in the nature of ingratitude if I venture to make one or two criticisms on the nature of the proposals which we are considering.<lb/>
Something was said by the noble Viscount opposite on the question of the proposed numbers of the new House, and I must say it appears to me that the Bill is somewhat contradictory in that respect. In introducing it the noble Marquess spoke of the present numbers of the House as being unwieldly, yet the number he proposes in this Bill is actually greater than the average working strength of the House. A Return was furnished to us last year showing the number of Peers who in three recent years did not attend the House at all, or had attended less than ten times. Noble Lords whose attendances were limited in that way certainly could not be accused of putting any difficulties in the way of the working of the machine, but if those numbers are deducted from the total strength of the House the result shows a figure somewhat less than the 350 proposed by the noble Marquess. At the same time I think the suggestion made by the noble Viscount that 100 or so might be sufficient goes altogether too far in the other direction, for, unless some very great changes were made, that would leave a number altogether inadequate for the transaction of the Private Bill business of the House. A considerable proportion of that 100, as members of the Ministry or as leading members of His Majesty's Opposition, would be precluded from taking part in Private Bill business, and the number remaining after they were deducted from only 100 would, I believe, be quite insufficient for the purpose.<lb/>
But the question of numbers is a very important one if we may look forward with hope to an arrangement of Joint Sessions being adopted as a means of removing deadlocks between the two Houses. It is necessary, if we can be guided at all by Colonial analogy, that the numbers of this House should not exceed half of the House of Commons, and that consideration becomes all the more important in view of the proposals for a large portion of this House being recruited from the hereditary Peers. Notwithstanding the eloquence of
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0339"/>
<col>669</col>
the right rev. Prelate who has just spoken, I must say I think Clause 4 (Election of Lords of Parliament by Peers) is the weak point in the Bill. I believe that the best, men on both sides would be likely to find their way back here under almost any conceivable system which might be adopted for recruiting the House in the future. I should look with apprehension to the introduction of a separate class in the future Second Chamber which might lead to the Division lists, whenever an important Bill was passed or rejected, being scrutinised very narrowly as they would be from that point of view. I have noticed, though it is only a small thing, that on our county council and county education committee there is a certain jealousy manifested sometimes with regard to the votes of aldermen who are not direct representatives of the ratepayers, and of the votes of co-opted members of the education committee for the same reason. Of course, in such a small matter a grumble or two satisfies everybody, but it would be very different if the Division lists of a Second. Chamber were scrutinised and complaints made outside, as it is exceedingly likely they would be made, that this or that measure had been passed or rejected solely by the votes of hereditary Peers who owed their presence within these walls to the votes of their brother Peers. It seems to me that that arrangement would detract very much from the authority of this House, and would also weaken seriously the permanence and stability which it is all important to obtain in any reconstruction of it.<lb/>
It makes little difference to me personally what conclusions may be arrived at. As I differ from one Party on the question of Home Rule and from the other on the question of Tariff Reform, it is most unlikely that either of them will in the future have any need for my humble services. But I gladly recognise this Bill as a great step forward towards a solution of this most thorny question, the solution of which has been delayed all too long. For my part, I think that nothing but evil can come of prolonged delay, and whatever personal sacrifice may be involved I would leave nothing undone to further the settlement of the question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01216"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are now on the fourth day of this debate, and it is possible to estimate the tendency of the discussion. The tone, if I may say so,
<col>670</col>
has been throughout one of sombre acquiescence, punctuated every now and again by cries of pain. That, my Lords, is not to be wondered at when you consider the magnitude of the proposals involved in this Bill and the greatness of the changes which it seeks to make. It is, indeed, a demonstration to us, if demonstration were in the least needed, how large is the task upon which we are invited to enter, and how much time it must take to complete it thoroughly.<lb/>
The debate this afternoon has not varied much in character from that of the preceding days, but there is one point on which, I think, it has been distinguished. To-day it has been apparent that noble Lords, reflecting upon the propositions in this Bill, have come to take up points which were, perhaps, not apparent in the earlier parts of the discussion. For instance, this afternoon we had a thoughtful speech, if I may say so, from Lord Lytton, who laid stress upon this, that the mode of selecting the new Lords of Parliament was not to him, on reflection, a satisfactory one, and that he would prefer another method, I think a method of nomination partly joint and partly on the responsibility of the Government of the day. The Duke of Marlborough made a speech in which he was not at all opposed to great changes, as great changes must come about, but he indicated his preference for a method of election directly by the electors. Then we had other varieties of opinion. The right rev. Prelate said many things with which, I think, we shall all agree, and among them was a desire to see the Empire and Imperial interests considered, so far as possible, in fashioning the composition of the new Chamber. Then we had the speech to which we have just listened, in which the noble Earl, speaking with great detachment but great care, as he always speaks, indicated that in point of numbers difficulties must ensue if the Bill were left as it stands. All these things make it a little difficult to discover what is the principle on which we are voting on the Second Reading.<lb/>
I shall come presently to my difficulties arising out of the Bill itself, but I am speaking now of the consensus of voices, so far as consensus there has been. There have been some speeches in which there was no consensus. There was the Duke of Somerset, who said, not only to-day but also in the letter which he addressed to <i>TheTimes</i> newspaper, much the same thing of the Unionist leaders as the Unionist leaders say of the Government, and we have
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0340"/>
<col>671</col>
had other very strong speeches. The speech of Lord Bathurst was another illustration of the same thing, but, in the main, I think there has been a disposition on the part of the vast majority of your Lordships to agree that a step forward must be made, and if that be the principle of this Bill, then it is possible to define the attitude of the Government towards it. We agree that the time has come when a great step forward must be made. It may not be in the form of the provisions of this Bill, but we take it that there is an increasing agreement that we are entering upon a new stage in the evolution of our Constitution. Not all of your Lordships hold that view. Lord Willoughby de Broke spoke of the swing of the pendulum, and seemed to indicate that he thought we might come back to a state of things in which all these agitations would be at an end. I have always thought that the metaphor of the swing of the pendulum was a very misleading one. The meditations of Newton under the apple tree, added to those of Galileo in the Church of Pisa, brought about the conclusion that the swing of the pendulum is powerfully influenced by the force of gravitation, and the force of gravitation is very great at the present time. We are not likely to go back to the state of things which was easily possible in the past, but which for some years past has been more and more disappearing. I agree with Lord Rosebery that the time has gone by for hoping that there will be any arrest in the tendency which is everywhere manifest, and I am sure your Lordships would do well to dismiss any idea of that from your minds. The change has come to stay, and now we have to deal with a condition of things in which, not only as regards the powers of this House, but possibly also as regards its composition, great changes will have to be made.<lb/>
We are not at this moment discussing the question of powers, but the question of powers is inseparable from this. I remember well those days in 1895 when my noble friend Lord Rosebery took up the question of restricting the Veto of this House, and gave an impetus to that question which is still felt. But the question of how this is to be dealt with is a question which cannot be disposed of by such discussions as we have had upon this Bill, nor is it enough to seek agreement in congenial topics such as the sinfulness of this Government. Even if we were guilty of all the things that have been said of us it would not account for this Bill,
<col>672</col>
nor would it justify it. In the course of this debate I have listened to some noble Lords who said that this Bill was all the fault of the Government because it had been so weak; it was in the clutches of those who wielded the machinery; and I have heard other noble Lords say that it was the fault of the Government because the Government was a small and tyrannical oligarchy which has usurped the powers of the House of Commons and deprived the electors and their representatives of any initiative. Either of these things may be true, but they cannot both be true, and the awkward thing is that in neither view can this Bill be justified. What does the Bill propose to do? What is its root-principle? It is to take the nomination of members of the future Second Chamber and put them, in very large measure, to the extent of two-thirds at any rate, into the hands of those who manipulate the Party machine. I can only say that if that be so, then our latter condition would be worse than our former.<lb/>
While I think the Bill is open to these criticisms, there are deep reasons why it has been brought forward. The noble Marquess opposite spoke with the moderation which he always shows, and with, I think, a deep appreciation of the situation. In the speech which he made a week ago he spoke of the vast difficulties which confront both Parties. I agree. Those difficulties confront both Parties. He said that the Bill was not a substitute for the Parliament Bill, but only a complement to another Bill which would deal with powers. Again, I am in agreement with him. Then he said&#x2014;and his words were significant&#x2014;that he did not claim an absolute Veto, but that he recognised that the House of Commons must remain dominant. That he said in agreement with Mr. Balfour, and I think the meaning of that and the root-principle on which that rests to be this&#x2014;that on the House of Commons, whatever the future of this House, the Executive of the country must depend; that it must be to the House of Commons that Ministers will be responsible; and that by the House of Commons finance will be voted. You cannot serve two masters, and therefore Ministers must primarily be responsible to that House, and can never be responsible to this House, for, if they were, they would be serving two masters and the machinery of the Constitution would break down. I feel that the noble Marquess, though, of course, by dominance he does not mean and did not intend to convey that this House should
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0341"/>
<col>673</col>
have no power of control over the proposals of the other House&#x2014;I feel that the noble Marquess has gone a good way, and I feel myself in agreement with him on general principles.<lb/>
But then I come to other voices and other arguments which seem not to agree with those of the noble Marquess. In the discussions on this Bill there seem to me to have been two tendencies of thought. There is that which I have just described, and then there was the tone of argument of Lord Curzon. I do not think Lord Curzon takes the same view of the importance of the restriction of powers that I gather the noble Marquess takes. He spoke on Friday at the Portman Rooms of the Parliament Bill as au "ugly smudge" which might have to be obliterated. I know that is a view in which be will not find himself alone, but it is a view which will require very careful consideration in order that we may see the length to which it goes. And then there is the noble Earl, Lord Selborne. He wants to go, I think, even further. He wants to protect the electors of this country against their own representatives and against themselves, and to put a check by means of the Referendum upon the proceedings of Ministers. There you have other tendencies, other lines which may or may not fit into this Bill, and one asks why this Bill has been brought forward when there are views, as I think in spirit, so divergent as the propositions which I have cited from the noble Marquess and the propositions which I have just cited from Lord Curzon and Lord Selborne. Lord Selborne indeed has said that Lord Curzon and the noble Marquess are quite at one in their views, and that the speeches made by Lord Curzon on the Parliament. Bill in no way indicate a difference of opinion.<lb/>
I agree that in words there is no difference. You have agreed upon words in this Bill, but agreement upon words is not everything. There was a time in the history of the Reformation when the 31argrave succeeded in getting the two great theological schools of the Reformation&#x2014;the German school, led by Luther, and the theologians of the Geneva school under Zwingle&#x2014;to come together, and they actually reduced their views to a document, in which they agreed in words. Then they came with their supporters to the meeting-place to agree on the document, and the supporters refused to shake hands with each other, and the agreement broke down. How are those who hold the views of the Duke of Somerset
<col>674</col>
to shake hands with those who support Lord Curzon and Lord Selborne? How are the two schools really to be brought together? I feel that, if ever we get into Committee on this Bill, we shall have some startling surprises as to the unanimity which one might gather the words indicated among those who joined in framing the Bill. But even the Bill excites in my mind great sympathy with the draftsman. I think I have enough knowledge of these things to see that the draftsman has had a very difficult time. Something had to be produced bringing the divergent tendencies together, and his business was not an easy one. The result is he has produced a Bill which I am bound to say I think satisfies some of those who will vote for the Second Reading much better than it satisfies others. The noble Marquess is not the true parent of this Bill. Lord Curzon and Lord Selborne are the real rejoicing parents, and, while the noble Marquess figures in the <i>r&#x00F4;le</i> of godfather and is ready to take the vows, still one cannot but recognise that the lines of the Bill are not the lines of thought on which he naturally would have proceeded.<lb/>
Why is it this Bill has been brought forward at all if there is such a divergence of view? It has been brought forward because it could not but be brought forward, because there has been a breakdown, and something had to be put together which would cover the difficulties of the breakdown. I know there are those who say that it was quite unnecessary, who say that your Lordships have acted as you have done ill the exercise of duty, and that you have given the most conscientious consideration to every question that has come before you. I think nobody can be a member of your Lordships' House without knowing that things here are scrutinised with a very great sense of responsibility and with a great desire to do right; but it is often just the most conscientious who are in the most difficulty. All passive resisters are conscientious, and after all it is the people who are most conscientious in resisting who, in the end, get themselves into the greatest difficulties. The researches of historians during the last 250 years have resulted in this&#x2014;that Charles the First was a most conscientious man, who sought to do nothing but his duty. But he mistook the temper of his countrymen, and I cannot help recalling two instances, at all events, in which your Lordships mistook the temper of your countrymen.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0342"/>
<col>675</col>
One was the Education Bill of 1902. That was a great effort to inaugurate a new educational system. I was one of those who never was anything but its supporter. I refused to vote against it, because I saw how much good there was in a proposal to transfer educational powers from the School Boards to larger local bodies. But there was a blot on it. It had provisions which excited strong feelings of hostility in the minds of a very important class. The Nonconformists may have taken a narrow view or a right view of these things, but the view they took was entitled to more understanding and sympathy than it then received. Accordingly it was inevitable that when 1906 came and their Party was in the ascendant they should ask for redress. But it proved to be impossible to get redress from your Lordships' House. You were unsympathetic, and you paved the way for much of the agitation, if you like to call it so, which has led to the present situation, and the reality of which you are recognising by the introduction of this somewhat belated Bill. The rejection of the Budget was another case, because that was accompanied by something like a challenge to the position of the House of Commons on the great Constitutional principle that the Executive Government of the day can only be responsible to one House, and that that cannot be any other House than the House of Commons. We are reaping the fruits of these things now.<lb/>
I know the extraordinary difficulty of introducing written amendments into an unwritten Constitution. But we have had to do it before now. It was done over the Bill of Rights, and it had to be done over the Mutiny Act. It has been done several times, always as the result of great agitation, and it has never been done without causing great difficulty. To-day we are proposing to do what this nation has had to do in the course of its history before, to introduce written amendments into an unwritten Constitution&#x2014;always, I think, a mischievous process, and one which should be avoided whenever possible. Your Lordships are now proposing written amendments of a sweeping kind, and you cannot help yourselves because the things of which I have spoken have been done, perhaps inconsiderately. They have been done, and their consequences are there and cannot otherwise be got rid of. Then how do we stand in this matter? I think that if in the past the House of Lords had watched more
<col>676</col>
closely the real nature of the political evolution which was going on and the transition to democracy, it might easily have so conducted its business that the questions with which we are now dealing would never have arisen; and I for one should have rejoiced, because I do not think you could have got more easily a debating, revising, delaying, and considering Chamber than you have got at the present time. But that is past. New views of the Constitution have grown up, or at any rate the views your Lordships now entertain are not any longer in harmony with the spirit of the time.<lb/>
Lord Curzon asked, What is the policy of the Government. He said, "You have not produced one." He said of myself that I had spoken in the other House of our policy being a single policy. I did speak of it as a single policy. It is a single policy, but it is a policy extending so far, because of the magnitude of the things of which I have been speaking, because of that vastness of area which I have been trying to illustrate to your Lordships, that it cannot be accomplished at a single stroke; you must take it step by step and stage by stage. We have a large problem in front of us in connection with this House&#x2014;a problem in the settlement of which I most earnestly desire that there may be a possibility of co-operation between the two great political Parties. But before you can have that, before you can produce the sense of confidence without which it is not possible, it will be necessary that there should be some possibility of the House of Commons negotiating on some kind of footing of equality with your Lordships' House. Your Lordships are responsible to no constituents; you have no General Elections to face. It is different with the House of Commons, and no Government can get its business through in the limited time which is allotted to it, a time which is only extended if the sense of the country is very much roused, unless some kind of equality of position between the two Houses is established. At times your Lordships have been considerate and forbearing with many Bills, but I am thinking of the many measures that your Lordships have not been considerate and forbearing with, and the claim at the present time is that the two Houses should be placed by the Parliament Bill, the discussion of which will open to-morrow, on something more like an equal footing. That is the first and indispensable
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0343"/>
<col>677</col>
stage before we can get a step forward with the kind of propositions which underlie the Bill at present before this House.<lb/>
We shall see to-morrow whether the Parliament Bill is as revolutionary a measure as it is represented to be. It proposes to shorten the duration of the House of Commons to four effective years, because the fifth is excluded for reasons of finance. For the first two of these years it is in your Lordships' power to paralyse and delay legislation. Only during the first three of those years does the legislation of the House of Commons pass despite the opposition of your Lordships. But for the last two of these years the House of Commons mill have no power to pass Bills to which the Second Chamber objects. I am not sure that that, is a very extravagant position, and, speaking for myself, I think it is a position which will presently become intolerable unless the Second Chamber Meets the First in a much more genial spirit than has been the case of late. That is why with the necessity before our minds of getting this first stage accomplished of negotiation between the two Houses made possible on a footing of equality, we wish to proceed on that basis with the policy foreshadowed in the Preamble of the Parliament Bill.<lb/>
The Preamble of our Bill has been the subject of a good deal of discussion, but very little reference has been made to what the Prime Minister has laid down as the policy of himself and his Party in regard to the Preamble. Speaking on the Second Reading of the Parliament Bill in the other House, speaking again at Manchester about a fortnight ago, and speaking a third time on the Third Reading of the Parliament Bill my right hon. friend defined his policy. He said that the Parliament Bill was not a final measure, that something must come beyond it, for the reasons of which I have spoken, and that the Second Chamber therefore which the Preamble foreshadowed must be a small Second Chamber on a nonhereditary basis, not co-ordinate in powers, and, finally, not predominantly partisan. He spoke of the Parliament Bill as a preliminary stage towards the accomplishment of the policy of reform by which such a Second Chamber might become an accomplished fact. Speaking for myself I look upon the Parliament Bill only as a steppingstone, as something that cannot be a per-
<col>678</col>
manent resting place but must carry you beyond. After all, even if there were not these reasons, what alternative have we but to couple all such propositions as the Bill before the House now involves with the propositions of the Parliament Bill? On the Parliament Bill there has been as true a Referendum as the noble Earl opposite could wish to see. The propositions of that Bill, not only in general terms but in specific terms, were submitted to the country at the General Election; line for line they were made the predominant feature at the last election.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01217"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: Without any discussion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01218"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I do not know why the noble Earl says without discussion. I fought through that election, and can assure him that very little else was discussed at the bulk of the meetings which took place. Now, my Lords, I wish in the light of these difficulties, to say a few words, and they shall be very few, about the Reconstitution Bill itself. Of course, the Bill before your Lordships does not touch powers. The first observation I have to make about it is that it seems to me to be so framed as to exclude a good many Peers who would be of great value to this House. I observe that among the positions in the Schedule which qualify for membership of the Second Chamber are to be found service as mayor, Lord Lieutenant, and chairman of a county council. There is one service that is not included. Perhaps I speak with the affection of a blood relation, but I am sure I do not know why there is no mention of the important office of chairman of a county association. I can only say that I have had cause to know how admirable has been the work that has been done by some of your Lordships as chairmen of these associations, and how you have laboured hard to bring people together for a common cause without distinction of Party. I should have thought that was a very good preparation for membership of this House, yet these noble Lords, some of whom I know and can count among my friends, are excluded from the Schedule of the Bill.<lb/>
But I pass that by, and I come to the majority which the Bill proposes to give to the Unionist Party in this House. As I estimate it, that majority would be at least
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0344"/>
<col>679</col>
forty. I have worked it out in several ways and that is what it comes to. I grant that at an abnormal time when there is an enormous Liberal majority in the other House we might get a bare majority in this House, but that is a thing that does not very often happen; and when you are seeking to bring about conditions of equality between the two great Parties, I venture to submit to your Lordships that a permanent normal Unionist majority of 40 is not a right thing to handicap the relations of the two Houses with. Many Governments have done a great deal of work with majorities in the House of Commons of 30 and 40, and that sort of majority would be swamped by your Lordships' House if there were Joint Sittings and your Lordships had a majority of 40. That is one of the reasons why, if you are to have Joint Sittings, you must have a comparatively small House here. I agree with the observations made by the noble Earl, Lord Fortescue, as to having the House large enough to provide the necessary strength for Committees. But you must not have large majorities one way or the other; otherwise you preclude Joint Sittings as a mode of the solution of difficulties between the two Houses. Discussing this question last year the Prime Minister said that Joint Sittings was by no means a method of dealing with difficulties which he excluded, only the House must be small for that purpose.<lb/>
The Bill proposes 120 elective Peers. They are to be elected by electoral colleges, and the electoral districts are to return from three to twelve Lords of Parliament for each district. That means, if they elect three, there would be forty electoral districts, and if they elect twelve, ten electoral districts. The mean between these is twenty. That signifies that Scotland and Ireland will have two or three electoral districts each, Wales will possibly have one to itself, and England will have fourteen. The working out, therefore, becomes very difficult when you get that preponderance. I do not say it could have been avoided; I only say it is very difficult. A noble Lord opposite spoke of the local representation this would give, and the possibility of minorities being represented. I have a very different picture. In a county like Lancashire, where there is a very remarkable division of opinion and you find a Tariff Reformer and a Labour Member sitting side by side, or in the case of London, where
<col>680</col>
again you find an extraordinary mixing up of views and people of extreme views on both sides sitting for adjacent constituencies, how are you going to get harmony in the electoral colleges? How will you get them to put their minds into a common pot and to find a representative who will be a common denominator of that district? I can conceive no worse mode of choosing representatives than that of taking members of Parliament of most opposing tendencies of mind and shaking them together in this fashion, without any reason for supposing that they will apply their minds to a common duty. What I do think is that they will resolve their difficulties by consulting their own caucuses. As for the category of Lords of Parliament to be nominated by the Government of the day, that business will pass to the Party Whips; and this Bill, which is to deliver the country from all this kind of thing, will mean that you will hand over the composition of the Second Chamber to the machine in a way that has never been the case with the House of Commons.<lb/>
To sum up my difficulties, the Bill seems to me to exclude a great many Peers whose presence would have been of great value because in their tone and temper they provide just the kind of element we want. In the second place, the Bill hands over more than one-third of the House, it seems to me, to the caucus, and another third to the Whips. I cannot help thinking how infinitely preferable it would have been if the noble Marquess had put his proposition in the form in which the Duke of Marlborough wanted it&#x2014;an elective Second Chamber. I do not for a moment believe that in these elections, with immense constituencies of 350,000 to 375,000 people, there would be the canvassing and speeches which Lord Curzon anticipated, for the simple reason that the thing would be impossible. It seems to me, if the noble Marquess had shaped his Bill so, he would have had a choice of a plan under which the constituencies would have been so vast and incapable of being controlled by a machine that only the most eminent men would have been elected, and a condition of things brought about which would result as nearly as possible in the pure election of representatives of the people. Nor do I think there would have been any danger of such a House becoming co-ordinate, for the simple reason that the Executive always must depend on the other Chamber Which has the control of finance.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0345"/>
<col>681</col>
But, my Lords, after all, this Bill is only a first attempt. It is rather the spirit than the letter of it to which I look, and speaking for myself, I am grateful to the noble Marquess opposite for the tone and temper he introduced into the discussion and for the way in which he showed that he realised that we had reached a situation in which somehow we should have to work out these things, and possibly with the joint co-operation of the two great Parties in the State. The difficulties are not only in this Chamber. My noble friend Lord Courtney of Penwith spoke of the change which had taken place in the House of Commons, and said that the private Member no longer had a chance. That is perfectly true, and I will tell your Lordships from my own experience why it is. The Government is forced to take the whole time of the House of Commons. There is such a congestion of business that it is not possible to leave any time over to the private Member. As it is, we sit in months of the year in which our forefathers rarely sat; we sit for hours which surpass the hours sat in olden times; and, even so, we cannot get through our business. We are loaded up with it. Devolution is an imperative necessity. You may call it, if you like, Home Rule; and there will be Home Rule for Wales, Ireland, and Scotland in the sense that we shall have, from force of necessity, to devolve upon them the handling of a good deal of their local business. That is the only way in which you can relieve the House of Commons, and that is why the state of things is such as Lord Courtney describes. But while the settlement of these things does not brook delay, it is no desire of ours, either in the Parliament Bill or in the attitude we take on this Bill, to be what the newspapers call "top dog" in this matter, but rather to secure to the Liberal Party something like a fair chalice in the negotiations and discussions in this House.<lb/>
Lord Selborne has another way&#x2014;the way of the Referendum. But I cannot think that even that would help the provisions of this measure. After all, what is the proposal of the Referendum? It is to send questions direct to the electors, not to send to the electors the choice of representatives. Yet the noble Earl most inconsistently is supporting this Bill which sends the composition of this House, not to the electors, but to the very representatives whom we will not entrust with the handling of the actual business. But what happens
<col>682</col>
when you send the details of business to the electors? What would happen if we had referred the question of spending ten millions on the Navy to the electors? That is a question which has had to be decided in recent months. What would have happened if that had been put direct, without explanation, without discussion, without that delicate consideration which is given in a representative Assembly but which you cannot give on public platforms without causing mischief? Such a question as that shows where the breakdown occurs in these things.<lb/>
Long ago Themistocles, wishing to increase the Navy of Athens, persuaded the people with great difficulty to give up the division, to which they were accustomed, of the proceeds of the silver mines of Laurium, and to devote the money to the building of the fleet which afterwards won Salamis. He could do that because he had a few people in the compass of small cities, but what chance would any Government of this country have of persuading people in the country upon a mere question of amount&#x2014;very terrifying and frightening to them at the first blush&#x2014;and of persuading them to accept reasons and a policy which can only be made plain by debate and discussion? You cannot send a Bill to the electors and say, "Give your votes 'Aye' or 'No' upon this Bill." There is only one way of dealing with it, and that is for Members of Parliament to go down to the constituencies and explain to the electors what the Bill means, give their views in detail upon the minute provisions of the Bill, and get the decision of the electors. I never know quite what the Referendum means. If it means sending down great big complicated questions like Tariff Reform to be dealt with by a single "Aye" or "No" all I can say is that it is most unjust to Tariff Reform. If it means sending down a complicated Bill&#x2014;well, I have had a good deal of experience of the attitude of electors generally with regard to complicated Bills. I sat for over a quarter of a century in the House of Commons, went through many General Elections and I know the process. You cannot get the electors to put forth their minds unless you have a great process of education and discussion. It is only in so far as you ask them to appoint representatives and not to decide specific questions that you can get them to vote. Unless there was something like a General Election on the occasion of each Bill you referred, you would not get
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0346"/>
<col>683</col>
50 per cent. of your voters to come up. We had an illustration of a Referendum over the Parliament Bill. Lord Selborne complains that other questions were discussed. Yes, and so they would be whenever you had a Referendum about any Bill. People would always consider what was its bearing on the political fortunes of the Party to which they belonged. The noble Earl seems to me to have taken as his real leader, not the noble Marquess opposite, but a thinker who wrote a great deal about Constitutions&#x2014;Rousseau&#x2014;who held that the people were never free except at the time of a General Election, when every man in the crowd was giving his vote. Rousseau hated representative institutions. He distrusted them as much as the noble Earl does. That is a bad way of deciding these things. It is not by the unorganised crowd; it is by organised opinion by the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> being fully brought before the minds of those who are to decide. It is by organisation and representation by men who are picked because they have the confidence of those who have elected them, who have chosen them on broad principles, and left them free to work out the details of those principles in representative Assemblies&#x2014;it is in that way alone that you can get the real voice of the people&#x2014;the organised voice, as distinguished from the individual voices of the mob. For that reason I feel myself divided by a very sharp line of division from the noble Earl in his reasoning as to the supplement to the Bill which is before your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I hope I have made plain my own feeling about this Bill and the general lines of our position with regard to it. With the Parliament Bill we must go on. We cannot regard this measure as in any sense a substitute for the Parliament Bill. That Bill, which has been pronounced on by the country, represents what we regard as the indispensable preliminary to any progress in negotiating with your Lordships a proper settlement of the constitution of this House. Having said so much, I wish also to say that in the introduction of this Bill and in the spirit of many of the speeches we recognise a great step forward. We should be ungrateful if we did not see that to this extent, at all events, there is a measure of agreement; and holding that view, and on the broad grounds I have indicated, we shall certainly not divide against the Bill. Of course, there are many points in the Bill which would excite great controversy, but
<col>684</col>
of those I say nothing. It may be that before any settlement of this great question can be made and the necessary reconstitution be completed a long journey lies in front of us. I will only, in conclusion, express the hope that in this Bill we have not heard the last word from your Lordships. We agree that, as Lord Lansdowne said, the majority of the two great Parties have certain great aims in common. It is no use talking of doing those things except on the basis of Party, because Party is of the very essence of our Government and Constitution, and without the Party division the Government of the day would be in a very poor position. There must be criticism, there must be difference, and it is by debate between the two sides that the truth evolves itself. We desire to restore tranquillity and to set people's minds free to address themselves to other questions than that of the Constitution. We desire to repair and render stable the fabric of the Constitution, which has been seriously shaken, and who knows but that both sides may not yet co-operate in carrying out a work of this great magnitude. The future will disclose its secrets.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01219"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when a few days ago I endeavoured to explain the provisions of this Bill to your Lordships' House I ventured to say that we regarded it as one which invited criticism, and that so far as we were concerned we should welcome such criticism. During the discussion of the last four days we have had abundant criticism, but it has been criticism of which we have no right to complain, and it has been in the main, at all events, of no unfair or unfriendly character. And let me express my concurrence with what has been already said to the effect that, keen as that criticism has been, it has been, so far as I have observed, wholly untinged by any personal feelings of resentment or annoyance. Such criticism we have been vouchsafed, not only from these Benches but from other parts of the House, and it has really been from one part of the House only that we have received nothing, or almost nothing, in the way of useful suggestion. I refer to the Bench opposite. From the noble Viscount who has just sat down we did not gather one word upon the point as to which we are most anxious&#x2014;what is, at any rate, the general principle on which the Government intend to deal with the subject we are discussing. He imputed to myself and my noble friends divergences of opinion which
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0347"/>
<col>685</col>
have no real existence: he gave us his own impressions of the Education Act of 1902, and somewhat lengthy and detailed observations upon the subject of the Parliament Bill and the Referendum, but he left us in the dark upon the point whit interests us most. Lord Morley did indeed give us two or three words of illumination. He indicated to us his objection to the reconstituted House that we propose on the ground of its excessive size and because it would be what he termed a fighting phalanx, and his preference for a compact and noncombatant committee, from which he suggested it would be possible to exclude Party influences. But as we are given to understand that this smaller House of Lords is to be based on popular election and on representation it would be really interesting to us to know how Lord Morley and Lord Haldane propose to constitute it so as to exclude from it Party influences and Party organisation.<lb/>
My noble friend on the Cross Benches, Lord Rosebery, repeated to us his objections on tactical grounds to the course we have taken. He pointed out, with very great force, that we should have been on safer ground had we contented ourselves with procedure by Resolution. I entirely agree with my noble friend that the political weather is rough, and that we should no doubt navigate more comfortably to ourselves if we had shorter sail set. But that is not to our mind exactly the point. We have to convince the people of this country that we mean business, and I am afraid that Resolutions do not carry the necessary amount of conviction. While we adhered to procedure by Resolution we were apt to be told by noble Lords opposite that our proposals were moonshine, that we were merely improvising, that we were going to produce another edition of the present House of Lords in a new disguise, but virtually the same House. That is not the kind of language with which our proposals are met at the present moment. It has been admitted that we are taking an enormous stride in advance. Our sincerity has not been questioned. We have been told that we are taking a course which is frank, bold, and even helpful; and outside this House, I venture to think, we are given even greater credit for the sincerity and genuineness of our proposals than we are within it. I venture to think we should never have obtained these testimonials if we had adhered to procedure by Resolution. This is the only answer I can offer to my noble
<col>686</col>
friend, and I think it is entitled to weight. Lord Newton, far from blaming us for bringing in a Bill, took us to task for not having brought in a Bill some considerable time ago, and I daresay there is a good deal to be said for that view. But is he quite sure that public opinion, and certainly opinion in this House, was quite ripe for such a proposal as we are making four or five years ago? I am afraid there are indications, that it is not quite so ripe as we could wish even at the present moment.<lb/>
Some of those who have taken part in this discussion want no Bill at all. Noble Lords who hold those views dwell with great force upon the ability and high reputation of this House. I need scarcely assure your Lordships that I am the last person in the world to dispute their views when they pay a tribute of that kind to the present House of Lords. I have known the House for a great number of years, and I believe there never was a time when what I may call without disrespect the rank and file of its members took, a closer and more intelligent interest in our proceedings. But I do ask noble Lords who suggest that we might let well alone to consider the remarkable speech which was delivered the other night by the Duke of Northumberland. I think that speech must have given pause to some noble Lords who would have us sit with folded hands and be content with an unreformed House. For myself I may say that I have the deepest conviction that if we want a real Second Chamber, and I believe most of us want a real Second Chamber, it is impossible to bind up the existence of that Chamber with an unreformed House of Lords. Unless we have something more convincing to offer the country than arguments based on the high reputation, ability, and usefulness of tins House, I believe it will be utterly impossible for us to resist the kind of attacks, largely based on class jealousy and class prejudice, which are becoming more and more the staple weapon of those who assail the position of your Lordships' House. Therefore I have come to the same conclusion as my noble friend on the Cross Benches, that a purely hereditary House of Lords is incompatible with what he described as the movement of popular feeling in these days. I believe it to be impossible in a country deeply imbued, as this country is, with democratic sentiment, to maintain a Second Chamber constituted on entirely undemocratic lines. If we are right in these views, then I would ask those of my noble friends who would
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0348"/>
<col>687</col>
have us leave things alone whether they prefer the kind of scheme which we offer in this Bill, or whether they would rather have the kind of measure which His Majesty's Government have in contemplation&#x2014;whether it be a purely elective Second Chamber, or a House of Lords constituted as at present, but shorn of all real power to influence the public affairs of this country. In my opinion we must have a Bill, and the question is, what kind of a Bill we should have.<lb/>
May I notice for one moment a suggestion made by the right rev. Prelate in a passage of great eloquence and feeling? He told us that our measure neglects to provide for the representation of our great Dominions across the seas. A suggestion of that kind appeals to the sympathy of all of us; but I am afraid that the idea of constituting a great Imperial Senate in which the Dominions will be represented is one which it is impossible to fit into the scheme of the measure we are now discussing. The great Colonies themselves would certainly not desire to interfere in the domestic affairs of this country any more than we should desire to interfere in the domestic affairs of the great Dominions, and I believe it would be utterly impossible, without a revolution going far beyond the limits of anything that we are now discussing, to adopt the attractive and patriotic suggestion which the right rev. Prelate has made.<lb/>
My noble friend the Duke of Marlborough objected to our Bill for several reasons&#x2014;amongst others, owing to its lack of simplicity. His idea was a short and simple Bill which every one could readily understand, and he illustrated his argument by pointing out that whereas the printed copy of our Bill bears upon it a legend which sets forth that it can be purchased for 2d., the Parliament Bill of His Majesty's Government may be purchased at the moderate rate of ld. That argument is novel and carries one a long way, and I should be glad if the noble Duke at the proper time will apply the same test to the Government Insurance Bill, which occupies, I believe, no less than seventy-eight pages of printed matter. I am afraid the price of that Bill must be prohibitive. My noble friend Lord Sheffield rather found fault with us, because, he said, we have not produced a complete measure. I gather that he would have liked us to deal in this Bill with the whole question of Joint Sittings and so
<col>688</col>
forth; but I think we have shown a very considerable amount of courage in dealing with one-half of this most important question, and we can scarcely be blamed for having left the other half alone. We have, however, made known in considerable detail our views on the other part of the Constitutional question, and we shall no doubt have opportunities during the next few days of discussing the matter further.<lb/>
The real question seems to me to be this. Let us admit that this Bill has its imperfections; but can any one suggest a better? I have waited in vain for a suggestion of that kind. Some noble Lords would go much further than we are going; some would go not nearly so far; but so far as I have been able to follow the course of the debate, there is a very considerable body of opinion on this side of the House in favour&#x2014;I do not say of a Second Chamber exactly constituted as we propose it should be constituted&#x2014;but of a composite Chamber based on the three elements which are included in our scheme. Let me say as emphatically as I can that we are very far indeed from putting forward this Bill as one which represents our last word in all the important matters with which it deals. Obviously there must be abundant room for criticism, discussion, and amendment, and we wish to guard ourselves emphatically against the idea that we wish our Bill to be regarded in any sense as a sort of sealed pattern from which no departure is to be made.<lb/>
May I say one word more on the much-vexed question of qualifications? There are three courses open to us. We can get rid of qualifications altogether; we can create a separate category of Peers, who should have the absolute right to sit and vote in this House in virtue of their qualifications; and, in the third place, we can adopt the plan we propose, or some variant of it, under which there would be a low qualification but a qualification which must be possessed by any Peer who can look for election by his brother Peers. Now I should be very reluctant to strike qualification altogether out of this Bill. The idea is a very intelligible one. I think the fact that a section of the new House would be founded, directly or indirectly, upon qualification would increase the confidence which the public would feel in it, and I should, therefore, be reluctant to abandon qualification completely. On the other hand, I remain strongly opposed to having a class of
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0349"/>
<col>689</col>
Peers who would sit and vote by right of qualification alone, and for this reason&#x2014;that any such arrangement involves the admission of a Peer to this House in virtue of a title resting upon past achievement only, and not upon the prospect of his future usefulness. I also call the attention of the House to this point. I notice that ninny object to our plan because they say it involves a restriction on the manner in which your Lordships would exercise your right of selection; but if you were to add to the proposals of the Bill that there should be, let us say, fifty Peers sitting here by qualification and by qualification alone, that would be imposing those Peers on the House, and as far as those Peers were concerned, the House would have, not a restricted choice, but would have no right of choosing at all. I therefore venture to express a preference for our plan, although I readily admit that the Schedule on which it rests may very properly be revised and amended on several points.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Saltoun was rather severe on the Schedule, and dwelt at some length on the purely official character of the greater number of the persons whom it included; but the noble Lord argued rather as if every one who had held an official position in any part of the Empire was a kind of Party hack, whose election could be secured by the intervention of the Party wire-pullers. In our Schedule, however, we include distinguished members of the Indian Civil Service, members of the Diplomatic Service, members of the Regular Forces of sufficient rank, and last, but not least, we include members of the great municipalities. I therefore claim for our Schedule that it is by no means so strongly tainted with a preference for officialism as my noble friend seemed to suppose.<lb/>
Then one word as to the Peers referred to in the sixth clause&#x2014;those who would be appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of Ministers. That proposal was criticised by Lord Courtney, not so much on its merits as because he regarded it as one which in practice would be unworkable; and I think the noble Viscount opposite also dwelt on the difficulty of applying to this particular provision the exact machinery adopted in the House of Commons in the case of appointments to Select Committees. These criticisms do not move me in the least. I cannot believe that it
<col>690</col>
would be beyond the power of the leaders of the great political Parties to arrive, in the first place, at an understanding as to the strength of Parties in the other House of Parliament, and that having been ascertained, to come to an understanding as to the manner in which the right of nomination would be exercised.<lb/>
I pass for a moment to the category of Lords of Parliament, who under our Bill would be chosen by electoral colleges. May I be permitted to say that I remain strongly of the opinion that our proposal&#x2014;namely, that the Members of Parliament should be grouped for this purpose in accordance with the areas which they represent&#x2014;is a very much better and very much fairer proposal than the alternative suggested by the other side of the House, under which the whole of these 100 Peers would be elected by the whole House of Commons sitting together. I for one am disposed to attach very considerable importance to the recognition of the territorial system in this connection. I am, moreover, deeply convinced that if, as we all admit, it is desirable to eliminate as far as possible the influence of the Party machine in these elections, we stand an infinitely better chance of doing so by adopting the arrangement of the Bill than by handing the whole election over to the House of Commons. Lord Newton in dealing with this part of the Bill made some observations on the alleged dependence of the Peers elected by one of these electoral colleges on the Members of Parliament of whom that college would be composed. What I should like the House to bear in mind is this&#x2014;although the Lords of Parliament would owe their seats in the House at the outset to the votes of grouped Members of Parliament, their position would be a more independent one than that of the Members of Parliament who elect them, because under our Bill the Lords of Parliament would have a safe seat here for twelve years which may be taken, I suppose roughly speaking, as the equivalent of three Parliaments under the Bill which we shall be discussing to-morrow evening.<lb/>
I should like to notice, in passing, another suggestion which was made to us&#x2014;I think by my noble friend on the Cross Benches, Lord Rosebery&#x2014;the suggestion that we might take advantage of the opportunity offered by this Bill in order to provide for the disappearance of the Law Lords from this House. That suggestion is one which has very considerable attractions for me.
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0350"/>
<col>691</col>
I have ventured on more than one occasion to express a favourable opinion of a proposal of this kind. There can be no doubt that the presence of the Law Lords in this House does create a very dangerous and mischievous confusion in the public mind in regard to their position not only as Judges, but as legislators. That confusions fusion is apparently not confined to the minds of the electorate, because it evidently prevails in the minds of the colleagues of the noble Viscount opposite. I hold in my hand a copy of the election address of Mr. John Burns, and I find it contains these words. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"On all industrial matters affecting the working classes they are not content with being the final Court of Appeal the interpretation of the laws, but they [that is, the House of Lords] seek as a class apart from and above the control of the electorate to give partial consideration to the removal of grievances which vitally prejudice the interests of the working people."</quote>
These words show that Mr. Burns, at any rate, is under a completely mistaken impression as to the position of this House with regard to appellate jurisdiction. I should therefore hope that if this question is further dealt with Parliament will be able to discover some less confusing title for the appellate Court, and it might easily be provided that the members of that Court should not sit as such in the House of Lords, though no doubt they would be eligible for nomination and conceivably for election under a Bill of this kind.<lb/>
There is only one other point to which I wish to address myself. The principal charge we have had to meet as affecting this Bill is the charge that it is a Bill which has been drawn with deliberate unfairness to the Party opposite. We have sought to be&#x2014;and in my belief we have succeeded in being&#x2014;fair. I am disposed myself to agree with Lord Courtney when he told us the other evening that in his view a reformed Second Chamber might well contain a Conservative majority, provided, he said, it was not an overwhelming Conservative majority. I go further. Speaking for myself, I would say, Give us a Second Chamber the members of which are provided with sufficient credentials, and above all, possess an independent position; and I shall not be extremely difficult to please in regard to the mere question of numbers. But let me go a little further. Let me assume that there would be under such a scheme as ours a Conservative preponderance in
<col>692</col>
this House. I do assume it, and I assume it particularly for this reason&#x2014;that I think experience shows us that with a twelve years' tenure Conservative tendencies would be very apt to develop themselves even amongst Liberal Peers. We see the thing happening under our eves. Noble Lords arrive here and take their seats on the benches opposite, and after a time
<quote>suffer a sea-change</quote>
<quote>Into something rich and strange.</quote>
Those changes would take place under any system. Let us therefore assume that a small Conservative majority will be there. But do not let it be forgotten that if this Bill be read by the light of the Resolutions which this House passed last year, you are provided with an absolute safeguard against the undue action of that Conservative majority. We offer you in the first place, a system of Joint Sittings, which every colleague of the noble Viscount, as far as I am aware, has admitted to be a desirable addition to our political machinery, and which the noble Viscount himself in his speech this evening really spoke of as if the institution were already in existence. We suggest to you Joint Sittings, and then the Referendum, but not as the Prime Minister suggested the other day for what he called trivial and trumpery cases, but for cases of grave importance and great emergency, of the kind indicated in his speech by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. And here let me point out that noble Lords were in error when they spoke of the Referendum Bill of Lord Balfour as having been withdrawn. The Bill is still on the Paper of the House, and it is entirely for my noble friend to consider whether its discussion should be resumed or not.<lb/>
I therefore ask the noble Viscount, Is our proposal, regarded as a complete proposal&#x2014;for that is the only way to look at it&#x2014;after all such an unfair and one-sided proposal as he would have us believe? Is it just to talk of our proposal as one involving the use of loaded dice? Under that proposal our big majority in this House disappears. You have a new House of which two-thirds will certainly owe their seats in it to a democratic title. You have a majority which may be forty as you tell us, or, as we suppose, eighteen, and which may also disappear altogether in circumstances which are perfectly conceivable. We offer you coupled with that Joint Sittings under which that majority, even if it
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0351"/>
<col>693</col>
happened to be as high as forty, would be completely obliterated and overwhelmed by the present majority of the House of Commons. Is it really not rather an abuse of language to suggest, as the Lord Chancellor suggested, that we are inviting noble Lords opposite to surrender at discretion, or to suggest that under such a plan as ours the House of Commons will be held in a vice, or again that there is a complete absence of anything like fair play in what we are proposing?<lb/>
If we are to talk about fair play, I would ask the House to consider what is the idea of fair play entertained by noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite. The noble Viscount who spoke last said he desired as a preliminary to the reform of the House of Lords the establishment of something like an equality between the two Houses. What is the noble Viscount's idea of equality? It seems to me that his idea of equality is that you are to begin by hitting your enemy below the belt, that you then get him down and keep him down, and when you have got him down you will be good enough, as you put it, to "speak with your enemy in the gate." The noble Viscount repudiated with much earnestness the idea that he and his friends desire to assume the position of what I think he called "top dog" in the controversy. There never was
<col>694</col>
a more admirable example of the "top, dog" arrangement than that which is involved in the Bill of which the noble Viscount will move the Second Evading to-morrow. We are to be forced down and compelled, if necessary by unconstitutional means, to accept humiliating and disgraceful terms. To which situation does the expression "Surrender at discretion" apply most justly&#x2014;to that which we set out to create or to that which you will create, if you have your way, by the Parliament Bill? The people of this country are not bad judges of fair play, and I think we may safely leave them to decide between us.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PARLIAMENT BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01262" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01263">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01264"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to move that this Bill be read a second time. The circumstances in which the Bill appears before your Lordships are no doubt fairly well known. After the rejection of the Budget in November, 1909, His Majesty's Government propounded their policy, which was this&#x2014;formally, definitely, and by Statute to abolish the power of this House to intervene in finance, and in legislation outside of and beyond finance to take away from this House the power of absolute Veto. Then came two elections and two Parliaments. In the first of those two Parliaments the Resolutions upon which this Bill is founded were passed by a majority of between 100 and 120. In the second Parliament&#x2014;still sitting&#x2014;the Third Reading of this Bill was passed by a majority of 121, after three months of full discussion, in which many earnest and skilful disputants took part, and in which the two distinguished men who lead the great Parties in the other House, according to all accounts, which I am sure must have reached your Lordships from every quarter&#x2014;these two men of unsurpassed Parliamentary character and experience were at their very best and fought their very hardest. That is the history, as far as it concerns us, of this Bill.<lb/>
I hope your Lordships will not take it amiss if I go over in a very few sentences what it is that the Bill proposes. It has been much talked about during the debates on the noble Marquess's Bill which was read a second time last night. The provisions of it, stated shortly, are that a Money Bill passed by the House of Commons should become an Act of Parliament, on the Royal Assent being signified, notwithstanding that the House of Lords shall not have assented thereto. The question whether a Bill is or is not a Money Bill is to be decided by the Speaker of the House of Commons. That is the first clause. The second clause proposes to enact that any public Bill other than a Money Bill passed by the House of Commons in three successive sessions, whether or not in the same Parliament, having been sent up to the House of Lords and there
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0354"/>
<col>699</col>
rejected in each of those three sessions, shall be presented to His Majesty and become an Act of Parliament on the Royal Assent being signified, notwithstanding that this House shall not have assented to it. That is, of course, the centre of the Constitutional conflict in which we are engaged. The other important clauses are that nothing in this Bill is to diminish the privileges of the House of Commons, and that five years shall be substituted for seven years as the duration of a Parliament. That is an epitome of the Bill, and it is so important that noble Lords should clearly understand what it is that we propose that I have ventured to give it.<lb/>
The provisions of the Bill and the arguments for and against it have during many months past been the subject of close and tenacious argument on hundreds of platforms, in thousands of speeches, and in millions of leading articles. It cannot be said that this Bill has been suddenly intruded upon the attention of your Lordships' House. There is no doubt one new circumstance since last night&#x2014;that is to say, that this House has now admitted in the most formal and definite manner that I can imagine, that its moral authority in discussing and opposing this Bill is not what it was before the noble Marquess's Bill received a Second Reading. The noble Marquess called the Bill a death blow. So it is indeed. Other noble Lords talked of burning the bridges and the boats; and therefore I submit with all respect that we are not proposing the Second Reading of this Bill to a normal House of Lords.<lb/>
I am astonished to see that distinguished men, who I venture to think ought to have known better, say that this is a single-Chamber conspiracy. I am surprised to hear that, because it really shows some ignorance of the views held on the relations between the two Houses long before this Government came into being and long before most of its members came into being. In the year 1836 the very proposal which lies at the bottom of this Bill was brought forward by one of the chief of the utilitarian Radicals. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Be it enacted that if a Bill is passed by the House of Commons and thrown out by the House of Lords; is renewed in the House of Commons in the next Session of Parliament and passed, and again thrown out by the House of Lords, it shall if passed a third time by the House of Commons become law."</quote>
<col>700</col>
Much later than that it was my fortune, in the year 1883 I think, to hear one who was not only a great orator, but one of the soundest and truest Englishmen who ever took part in our affairs&#x2014;a man who was a Conservative in the best sense&#x2014;Mr. Bright, propound that view. A quarrel was going on between the two Houses on the question of the County Franchise Bill. There was very much the same sort of excitement that there is now. He then put forward the very scheme which the utilitarian Radicals had proposed in 1836, and the very scheme which we propose to-day. Therefore it really shows an entire want of acquaintance with the history of these political ideas to say that we have invented this in order to pass a Home Rule Bill and that it is a single-Chamber conspiracy.<lb/>
A remarkable argument is used on another aspect of the introduction of this Bill, and has found much favour among noble Lords opposite and the leader of their Party in another place. It really comes to this, that a General Election is totally worthless as a verdict upon any important issue, because Mr. Balfour, in copious and rather lurid language, says that the issue in a General Election is so mixed up, so confused, so clouded, and so hidden away amid a thousand other issues that you cannot be sure what is the decision of a majority of the electors. A General Election, therefore, is, in the words of Macbeth&#x2014;
<quote>"A tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing."</quote>
Never before, even in the most heated controversy in this country, has that view of a General Election and its significance been taken. I have never assented to the idea that a Parliament is to be confined to a single great issue. On the contrary, I voted away from my own friends in 1900, after the war election. They objected, and do still, to the Education Bill and the Licensing Bill. My argument was that when a General Election returned a Parliament, it entrusted power to Ministers to pass whatever Bills they thought fit.<lb/>
Let us take the great case of the most active and most fertile Administration in recent history, Mr. Gladstone's first Government, which sat from 1868 to 1874. He got his majority and the electors had in the forefront of their electoral vision the Irish
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0355"/>
<col>701</col>
Church. But before that Ministry came to an end six years later the fact of that being the central question did not hinder the radical reform of land in Ireland, the complete reform of the Army, the establishment of a system of national elementary education, the introduction of the ballot, the abolition of tests at Oxford and Cambridge, and the opening of the Civil Service to competition. These things were not in the minds of the electors. How could they be? Probably they were not even in the minds of Ministers at the election, but the electors did what I believe most electors would do. They returned a First Minister in whom they had confidence and to whom they were determined to give a chance of showing his power and force and constructive ability, and they left it in his hands and in the hands of his colleagues. That is my view of the right theory of the result of a General Election.<lb/>
Another point which has found great favour in the speeches of many noble Lords is that the cause which produced this Bill is violent Party vituperation, and that it is violent Party vituperation that has produced these remarkable results in the Bill read a second time last night and in this Bill which your Lordships may think fit to read a second time at some future date. I cannot imagine anything much more unreasonable. What a shallow view it is that an institution like the House of Lords, so famous, so entrenched in the roots of traditional power in a nation that is so attached to old institutions as our country is, should fall before the blast of a few Party trumpets&#x0021; Let me diverge for a moment to say what, as I judge it, is the real root of what has happened, and the divergence that has come in the views between the House of Lords and the House of Commons. In his last speech in the House of Commons Mr. Gladstone said that these divergences between the House of Lords and the House of Commons were not temporary or casual, but were far deeper than that. They were due to a different mental habit, to different prepossessions, to a different order of political and economic ideas.<lb/>
Let us see how far those differences went. My noble friend on the Cross Benches who succeeded Mr. Gladstone as the head of the Government used these words within a few months of that, speech. My noble friend referred to me the other night and he will
<col>702</col>
understand that I do not revive them for the purpose of any stupid gibe about inconsistency. A man has a perfect right to change his views, of course, but I think that a man who changes his mind ought to be very charitable in his language to those who do not change their minds. This is what he said, and the words bear on the very point we are arguing to-day. It is a third person report&#x2014;
<quote>"In his judgment the House of Lords was not a Second Chamber at all, but a permanent Party organ controlled for Party purposes. They were told that the Peers never resisted the known will of the people. He wanted to know how the wishes of the people could be bettor expressed than through the representatives of the people. Who gave the Peers the right and instinct to decide as to what wore or were not, the wishes of the people when those wishes were expressed through their representatives."</quote>
My Lords, I subscribe to the whole doctrine conveyed in those remarks.<lb/>
I dare say some of your Lordships may recall the language used by my noble friend in the debate in November, 1909, and by my noble friend Lord Crewe, whose absence we all lament, and nobody more sincerely or for better reasons than myself. What did Lord Crewe say? He said this&#x2014;
<quote>"I came here for the first time in the short Government of 1886, when I had charge of a Department. After that we went into exile for several years, and in fifteen years of Opposition I can say that neither I nor any of my noble friends&#x2014;Lord Rosebery, Lord Kimberly, nor Lord Ripon&#x2014;did the slightest good to himself or to any human being by attendance at the House of Lords. I cannot recall a case where anything we have said there had the slightest effect. I cannot recall a case when owing to any amendments of substance any of the Bills of the Government were modified in a single instance."</quote>
You talk about a single-Chamber Government&#x0021; During those fifteen years my noble friend Lord Crewe and others sat under a system of single-Chamber Government. My noble friend in a very dramatic outburst the other night spoke of the abject and degraded state to which members of this House would be exposed if this Bill, of which I am now moving the Second Reading, is passed. During all those fifteen years did he and my noble friends behind me feel that they were abject or degraded? Not at all. They took the institution as they found it and resolved, I suppose&#x2014;I am sure my noble friend did&#x2014;to alter it. It is this process, prolonged year after year, this prolonged and obstinate resistance, which prevented any of my noble friends effecting even a single amendment of substance in a
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0356"/>
<col>703</col>
single Bill, that has made the present majority of the electorate resolute and determined that this system shall come to an end. That is what is the meaning of this Bill and the meaning of the Second Reading.<lb/>
We have been asked what is the principle of the Bill. The principle is what every one of your Lordships has abundantly admitted, and nobody more abundantly than the noble Marquess opposite and Lord Curzon and Mr. Balfour, that in the event of differences between the two Houses it is the reiterated and deliberate decision of the House of Commons that must prevail.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01265"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: No; of the people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01266"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: That is the principle of the Bill. You may quarrel, if you like, with our method of enforcing that principle, but it is a principle which you all accept. Call it a single-Chamber principle, if you like, but it is undenied and undeniable, and to vote against the Second Reading of this Bill is to deny that principle. War, defence, treaties, finance, the whole control of executive government, the displacement of Governments, the power of changing Ministries and the power of forcing a Dissolution, all those vast powers which cover all the most important departments in the whole sphere of government are all withdrawn. Does it make all the difference between a practically single-Chamber system such as that signifies that you should no longer have an absolute Veto on Bills but a suspensory Veto under conditions such as are set out in this Bill?<lb/>
I see it constantly said&#x2014;"Oh, this is a log-rolling coalition." Some noble Lords agree. I wonder if they realise what it is that they are approving. I was reading of a controversy some time past on the same point when the speaker said&#x2014;
<quote>"It is monstrous that the unity of the kingdom should be broken to please an Irish clique; it is monstrous that the unity of the Church of England should be broken to please a Welsh clique; it is monstrous to alter your land laws to please a Scottish clique; and, above all, it is monstrous to invade the rights and interests of property and capital to please a Labour clique."</quote>
My Lords, if you come into power tomorrow are you going to act on that view? Is it possible? Of course it is impossible. In my opinion it is an impossibility. You
<col>704</col>
could not, if you came into power tomorrow, act in open antagonism to the Welsh people, the Scottish people, the Irish people, or the Labour people. Therefore, that is a perfectly idle remark.<lb/>
You say our majority is composite. The noble Marquess and other speakers in this debate have contended that for a Constitutional settlement you must have as many people as you can gather, in order that that settlement might have proper hold and weight on the mind of the country, to approve of it and support it. I wonder why, if it is a very virtuous thing&#x2014;and so it is&#x2014;to have as many groups of parties and sections of the community to support a great political settlement, it is such a very wicked thing, so unheard of, that English educationists, Scottish crofters, Welsh Nonconformists, the Irish, trade unionists, representatives of labour&#x2014;that each of these groups has got a special resentment of its own against the action, hitherto at all events, of this House. This combination makes resistance to your Veto all the more inevitable. Clearly the more numerous are the reasons that bring a great body of men together, the more obvious it is that their concentrating on one particular point shows the depth of feeling that they have for their own interests and for the interests of the other groups who work with them. No man in his senses denies or disparages&#x2014;I hope it is not impertinent for me to say so&#x2014;either the talents or the benevolence of individual members of the House of Lords, but it has been, it cannot be denied, uniformly partisan, and it has been a partisanship, may I say, of the very worst description, because it has really been, in no inconsiderable degree, an unconscious partisanship. Unconsciously, noble Lords have constantly voted against Bills approved in another place partly from partisan reasons, no doubt, but partly because they thought that they were bad Bills. There is no question of that, but I think it would be a very narrow view to impute class depravity to any body such as the House of Lords.<lb/>
But see the difference between the two Houses. The House of Commons, from the very nature of things, from the nature and the conditions of its existence, is constantly inclined to grope and feel the way forward in the direction of popular feeling and popular improvement. They have, in
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0357"/>
<col>705</col>
our own time, widened the electorate; they have admitted within their body Jews, Roman Catholics, and Agnostics&#x2014;they are all free to enter. They have reduced the cost of elections, they have secured the secrecy of the ballot, and they have done as much as they could to put down corruption in elections. They have done this with a sort of spontaneous and instinctive desire to make their House, as far as they can, a sensitive index to the feeling, the political wishes, and aspirations of the people who sent them there. The divergence has been growing. It is perfectly certain that the members of this House cannot be as sensitive to the feelings and wishes of the general bulk of our population. They may know some districts pretty well, but they cannot be as constantly watchful of the direction in which popular feeling is going as the House of Commons. And the history of this House shows that that is the case, because, if you go through a list of the conflicts between the House of Lords and the House of Commons, say, since the Reform Bill of 1832, you cannot but see that in these instances of prolonged, critical, and acute conflict between the two Houses, when the thing has been finally settled, that it was the views of the House of Commons that proved to be right, and the views accepted by the country with contentment and satisfaction.<lb/>
I do not want to rake up immediate controversies, but one of the most satisfactory things done, and it is said in every household to-day&#x2014;at all events in all these Imperial Conference gatherings&#x2014;what thing has been better done than the recognition of the rights of self-government in the Transvaal? Do you remember the line taken by distinguished men in this House on that subject? The noble Marquess said, "It is a tragical act." The Duke of Marlborough used some extremely vehement language which&#x2014;I wish him no mischief&#x2014;I think I had better not read. Lord Milner used some very strong language which, again, I will not trouble the House with. It is only for the sake of good feeling I do not read it.</membercontribution></p>

<col>706</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01268"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: No; it was self-government in the Transvaal. I must again remind the House what the Bill does. The House of Commons has to pass a Bill three times. It is to be rejected here twice. Two years must elapse, so there is no sudden flood-tide. A General Election will loom, it may be darkly but certainly ominously, in the minds of the House of Commons during those two years, and it will be growing two years nearer. Just let me look for a moment at the question of Home Rule. I suppose I am the only man here&#x2014;I am pretty sure I am&#x2014;who sat through the whole of the debates on the 1893 Home Rule Bill. We had eighty-two sittings. Does any one suppose, when we bring in a Home Rule Bill&#x2014;I do not say there will be eighty-two sittings, but there will be a great many sittings. It will be an immensely long process, and there will be all the blaze of the Press, all the thunder of the platform all the time. Are we to suppose that the reiterated and deliberate arguments used in this House by very competent advocates are to count for nothing, and that they will make no impression at all upon the mind of the voter? No one can think anything of the kind. There will be all this blaze of public opinion; perhaps some sort of blaze may come from the country immediately concerned. To suppose that a Home Rule Bill is to go through those two years unchanged, unmodified, for the purpose of the Government, is really to show a curious ignorance, it seems to me, of legislative conditions in this country.<lb/>
Before I close I want to say a few words on the immediate aspect of the Bill. It is idle to pretend that the powers that we have left to the House of Lords will not be both substantial and important. There are those, I may confide to your Lordships, in my own Party, persons who have a good right to an opinion, who regard the powers to be possessed by the House of Lords as formidable, and even, if they were very unwisely used, as menacing to all the things that Liberals at all events care for. There is no doubt of this&#x2014;that, if these powers were wisely used in a spirit of co-operation, they would enable the House of Lords to exercise a constant and very important influence on the whole character and shape of legislation. The fact that they could impose, or exact, two years' delay is really an effective instrument for bargaining. I
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0358"/>
<col>707</col>
do not mean bargaining in any ignoble Party sense, but for pressing upon a Minister in charge of a Bill from the Commons the introduction of changes that were desired. The fact that by insisting over-much upon a certain provision in a Bill, controversial or non-controversial, the House of Lords could keep it back for two years&#x2014;that in itself would be a very important element in discussions between this House and a Minister. This right of delay&#x2014;and this is a very important thing indeed&#x2014;would rest no longer upon the disputed survival of an antiquated right, but would rest on the definite and formal assertion of a modern Statute. That is a great difference. It would give the House of Lords a consciousness of power which it can never have under the existing system.<lb/>
Now it is evidently the interest of His Majesty's Government to secure a more evenly-constituted body to exercise the wide powers which are contained in our Bill. For us to try to discuss matters so long as the House of Lords possesses the final Veto to every or any proposal would lead us no further than&#x2014;what? No further than the Conference which failed. And so, in our view, will any Conference fail unless we went into the discussion on more even terms than we should if we went into a discussion to-day. We must make it clear that we regard the Parliament Bill as defining an advance in the democratic character of our institutions. The actual methods of the Parliament Bill are not necessarily final. When the Bill is passed it will be open to us to consider the reconstitution of the Second Chamber. As to which the assistance of the Party opposite is, as we have admitted all along, most desirable and even essential. We are all agreed that for a permanent settlement satisfactory to the mind of the country, and such as the country would be willing to help us in working&#x2014;we are all of one mind that that will be best done by agreement. But whether a more convenient and less dilatory procedure may not be devised which may commend itself to Parliament and the country&#x2014;that, after a certain amount of experiment, may appear to be desirable. But let me say this. A fair balance does not mean a balance against any article that the Government cares for and is pledged to. I agree with settlement by consent, but we do not and cannot mean by that, consent to a Second Chamber constructed
<col>708</col>
and planned on the principle of resistance to all the things that the Government and the present majority of the House of Commons believe the country wants and believe it is good for the country to have.<lb/>
I would recall to noble Lords opposite that this is not the first Constitutional conflict we have had since the Reform Bill, and I hope they will remember that no names are held in greater honour, no men are considered to have rendered more useful service in the working of our Parliamentary institutions, than those who have by wise and prudent counsels avoided bringing things to extremities. To-night, and during the course of this Bill, it is for noble Lords to consider what will be a course leading to extremities. The Bill is there and the Bill stands. I do submit that the Duke of Wellington when he gave way on the Reform Bill of 1832 won universal approval; he saved the country from a great disaster. Coming down to our own day, nobody can forget the services which were rendered by Lord Cairns and the then Archbishop of Canterbury in connection with the Irish Church. Their wise and prudent counsels&#x2014;and courage&#x2014;avoided a great danger. Then later, in 1884&#x2013;1885, it was the prudence and wisdom of men like the late Lord Salisbury that avoided a great disaster. So now, my Lords, I hope on this occasion we shall avoid&#x2014;or you will avoid&#x2014;a course which will land the country, which may land the country, in circumstances of great difficulty and perhaps grave confusion.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01270"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the concluding sentences of the noble Viscount's speech had, perhaps, more effect upon the House than the remarks which preceded them. The noble Viscount's speech up to the last few sentences was a very disappointing one, and very little applause was heard from the crowded Benches behind him throughout his speech, which, though none too long, still occupied fifty minutes and offered some advantage to those who hold, or are supposed to hold, very strongly the views which the noble Viscount put before the House. When he came to talk to us of 1832 and to compare the condition of the House at that period with its condition to-day, I could not help feeling how much the noble Viscount has
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0359"/>
<col>709</col>
lived in the atmosphere of the Cabinet of which he is an ornament, and how little he recognises the difference between the feelings of the people in 1832 and the feelings of the people to-day towards your Lordships' House. Why, the whole of London almost were in Palace Yard in 1832. Is anybody outside moved by the introduction of this Bill? Has any one of your Lordships received from the parts of the country in which you reside demands that you should vote for "the Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill," which was the case in 1832? I go to as many public meetings as most men, and I have never yet on an election platform been asked a single question on this Bill, and I have always noticed the satisfaction with which other topics have been introduced which were less abstruse and nearer to the electors.<lb/>
The noble Viscount disappointed many of us because he took the whole of his case for granted and did not show what were the derelictions on the part of this House which made it necessary to bring in this drastic, one-sided, and unprecedented measure. We heard a good deal extolling the present position of the House of Commons, and we had a quotation, which I confess I thought was strangely inadequate, in which the right of the House of Commons to override this House was put in the fore-front. We cannot mistake the House of Commons for the people. The Prime Minister speaks of the House of Commons, of the Government, as if it were the counterpart of the constituencies. He treats all questions which the Government have not taken Up as not having received the mandate of the people, but as soon as they are taken up he claims for them a mandate of the constituencies. I can only say this, in passing, that recognising to the full the importance of the House of Commons, to which the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, called attention, there is as much room for change and improvement in the House of Commons as there is in your Lordships' House. The noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, spoke last night of his experiences in the last campaign. Until the noble Viscount came to this House he was one of 62 Scottish Liberal Members out of a total of 70, there being only 8 Unionists Members; but by the votes polled at the last General Election in Scotland there should have been, not 62, but 41 Liberal Members, and not 8 but 29 Conservatives. I maintain that that is a distribution of electoral strength which has
<col>710</col>
long called for action by the Government, and which might easily overturn great Constitutional issues. I shall ask your Lordships to give some attention to the procedure of the House of Commons, because on that procedure under this Bill depends the decision of almost every political question for two years to come.<lb/>
I confess that I think we have a right to complain of the description which Lord Morley gave of the genesis of this Bill. In his opening sentences he said that from the date of the rejection of the Budget of 1909 His Majesty's Government gave clear indications that not merely would they remove from this House the whole of its powers as to finance, but they would bring to an end its complete Veto on other subjects. That is the language of autocracy; it is not the language of argument. It is the decision of the Government; it is not the decision of the people, and never has been. In that respect I challenge what was said the other night by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, and repeated last night by the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane. The Lord Chancellor said&#x2014;
<quote>"Had there been before your Lordships a Bill more definitely approved than the Parliament Bill at a General Election?"</quote>
And Lord Haldane said that it was as near a Referendum as it could be. I submit that that is a very partial statement. I do not want to labour small issues or side points. I might say something of the difficulty of asking constituencies in the month of December to reject a man whom they had elected in January, when during half of the intervening period there had been a suspension of hostilities owing to the demise of the Crown. I might say something about the election being taken on the old register&#x2014;a point that would have been taken pretty broadly by noble Lords if a Government on this side had gone to the country on a December register. I might say something also on the unseemly strife which, after the election of January, 1910, we saw between Parties in the House of Commons, who apparently came to the conclusion that their only chance of security was to agree to this Bill as the way out of their domestic differences. But I put all that aside and will come to close quarters with the main issue.<lb/>
I admit that this measure was placed before the country in December, 1910, but I say that it was so placed before the country, and the election was so timed, as to preclude any possible alternative being
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0360"/>
<col>711</col>
discussed by the country. What were the circumstances? The Conference sat for five or six months. The agreements of the Conference and the disputed points were alike concealed from the electors. During those six months the Opposition were chained up. Had we proceeded with our views for the reform of your Lordships' House we should have been held, in diplomatic language, to have been guilty of an unfriendly act. The Referendum, which for a long period had been in our minds as the proper outcome and issue of these disputes, had to be brought forward at the last moment as if it were a forlorn hope instead of a considered policy. Your Lordships will perhaps allow me to say that I speak from knowledge on that subject. It had been under discussion from the beginning of the whole proceedings. Then the Lord Chancellor told us that for six months the Parliament Bill was before the country. Last night the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, told us that the difference between the Referendum and the submission of matters at a General Election was that you must have discussion on the Bill itself. You must have the illumination of the electors by this discussion. The Veto Resolutions were discussed briefly. The Bill never passed the other House of Parliament. It was never heard of in this place at all. Our alternatives were put aside. The noble Earl's (Lord Rosebery's) Resolutions had to be brought forward at the last moment, and if the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack boasts that your Bill and your policy was before the country for six months, what does he think of a procedure which enabled our policy to be hidden from the country until about six days before the polls?<lb/>
I also think we have a right to complain of the statements that were made to the electors as to the past conduct of your Lordships' House. If your Lordships will bear with me for a few moments I would like to raise a point on which the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, was discreetly silent. He showed great courage when he descanted at length on the Home Rule Bill, because I assume that if the will of the people means anything, he will admit that the rejection of the Home Rule Bill of 1893 by this House, though it led to a collision between your Lordships' House and the other House, was unquestionably accepted by the people. The best proof is to be found in the fact that, although this
<col>712</col>
Government have been in power for five and a-half years, they have not yet touched the question, and from their public utterances it seems likely that when they do touch it it will be a very different Bill from that from which your Lordships saved the country eighteen years ago.<lb/>
The noble Viscount paid a high tribute to Lord Salisbury for his conduct over the Franchise Bill of 1885. That was the most signal victory ever obtained by your Lordships over the House of Commons. I will not go into details, for time presses; but we all know that the settlement on which the House of Lords insisted was not merely accepted by the House of Commons but has remained the shibboleth of both Parties up to this date. And that is not the only class of measure on which I think we can claim to have done good work. The noble Viscount spoke of measures for Ireland&#x2014;Irish Land Acts. Undoubtedly there was great friction in this House on some of those measures. There has been a rejection of one or two of the least important; but I should like to know if any one can say that the Irish Land Bills as amended by this House fell short of the purpose which those who designed them had intended? I would also ask whether the Purchase Acts initiated by those on this side of the House, which were in the forefront of Unionist measures and in the background of Liberal measures, have not had as much or more to do with the present improved condition of Ireland as any of the measures relating to the land which came from the Liberal Government?<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, in words which were astonishing coming from him, said that this House is&#x2014;
<quote>"the invincible obstacle to Liberal legislation, and wrecks all our principal measures."</quote>
I am not going back, as some of the critics of this House have done, to the Reform Act of 1832. I would no more dare to take up your time by vindicating the action of this House in the forties than I would attack the House of Commons for their neglect of social questions at that time. The Factory Acts&#x2014;all those measures on which the Liberal Party of that day obstructed the efforts of Lord Shaftesbury&#x2014;all these remain in evidence. Therefore let us take measures within living administrative memory. I go back to the great Parliament of 1868. Were all Liberal measures wrecked in that Parliament? Practically every measure passed by the House of Commons was
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0361"/>
<col>713</col>
passed by this House. Two measures of importance were rejected by this House. The first was the Ballot Bill. How long had that Bill been before the House of Commons? It had been before the House of Commons for thirty-eight years&#x2014;from 1833 to 1871. It was twenty-four times rejected by the House of Commons, then finally hurried through in the expiring embers of a session at a time when there was no limit to the period of the sittings; and yet your Lordships underwent abuse because for six months you had delayed that which the House of Commons had delayed for thirty-eight years. The second measure rejected by this House was the Bill dealing with purchase in the Army, on which I can only say that my sympathies were all for the abolition of purchase. That was a measure which also received the support of Lord Derby's distinguished relative throughout his career. That measure was a hardy annual in the House of Commons for something like twenty years. Finally, by the efforts of Sir George Trevelyan it was pressed on the Government of the day, and made part of a great scheme for the re-organisation of the Army. Four-fifths of the scheme were dropped in the House of Commons, and the remaining fragment came up here. Your Lordships rejected it on the ground that you wished to see the complete scheme. That Ministry, which for a period of nearly thirty-two years consecutively had held office, had ignored and pooh-poohed and put aside this question, as they had done the Ballot Bill, and then they proceeded to declare that your Lordships' House had come between the people and a reform which they had so long desired.<lb/>
Then to come nearer home, I take the case of the Licensing Bill in 1907. The subject had been before the country for forty-three years, and between 1864 and 1880 Motions dealing with it were rejected thirteen times by the House of Commons; and this is a most remarkable fact, that when the noble Viscount entered the House of Commons it had already carried Resolutions for Local Option and Sunday Closing by large majorities, and did so in the two subsequent years. Twelve years later, in 1893, the Liberal Government at last introduced a Bill, but threw it over without carrying it, I think, to a Second Reading. Finally in 1907, when they brought their Bill up to this House, they claimed not merely that they had
<col>714</col>
a mandate for the Bill, but a mandate for all the punitive and confiscatory clauses which it contained. And with grim humour the Lord Chancellor, who now charges us with wrecking all Liberal measures, asked your Lordships on that occasion not to allow the unpopularity of the Bill in the country to preclude your Lordships from showing that independence of judgment which would be shown in carrying it against the wishes of the country. I would like to know what man in this House will tell me that if that measure had been sent to a Referendum there would have been a majority for it in the country, with all Ireland seething against it. The inference I venture to draw from all these facts and from this recital is this, that the House of Commons for a period of thirty years can delay action on a particular subject, but if the House of Lords hesitates for a single session it must be subjected to censure. If noble Lords propose to send a matter for the consideration of the people they are told that they are interfering with the sacred rights of the House of Commons. It is not because we oppose the people but because we oppose the Ministry that we are called in question this day.<lb/>
I much regret that the Lord Chancellor is not in his place at the moment, because I should like to say a few words regarding what fell from him the other night on the question of fair play and on which both noble Viscounts opposite said something. We quite realise that it is difficult to carry on proceedings in a House in which so large a majority is on one side. The moderation shown by the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, has been acknowledged throughout this House, but it is impossible to carry on business permanently by the self-denial of one Party. But surely fair play could be sought and should have been sought in a change in the constitution of this House. It cannot be obtained in a change in the powers of this House such as that proposed in the Bill which we are discussing to-night. What is the fair play which the Government intend to put in force in opposition to the present system? I think only members who have sat in the House of Commons can properly gauge it. The Government hold the majority of the House of Commons in their hands. I mean nothing disrespectful in what I am about to say, but since the recent decision as to the payment of Members every one must realise that the Government have an even
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0362"/>
<col>715</col>
greater hold upon their supporters than before, for to the terrors of a General Election must be added in future, not merely in case of revolt the loss of official support, but also a pecuniary loss to a man who may have given up a great deal on coming into Parliament on the strength of the certainty of some remuneration. Certainly the position of the Government is strengthened, while the position of the private Member has been weakened. We see only to-day that one man who raised a difficulty about this Bill on the Government Benches has received warning that the official support will be withdrawn from him at the next election unless he conforms. And there is the lamentable fact that by far the most independent and eloquent man on the Liberal side, Mr. Harold Cox, has been summarily ejected from the House of Commons, and is not received by any constituency.<lb/>
It is worse than that. Under the present procedure, the Government bring in a measure and assign the time for it. The Government, through their partisan Chairman whom they have put in the Chair, settle even the subjects which are to be discussed in the Bill and the limit of time to be given to each part of the measure. And what then takes place? We are told that there will be a second and a third opportunity for the House to deliberate. But what is that opportunity worth? The men are the same; the place is the same; the subject is the same; the conditions are the same. We have only the addition that the desire for consistency will lead most men in the second and third years to vote the same as before. Then we are told under this Bill that any disputed points on the most contentious question of what are and what are not Finance Bills are to be settled by the Speaker of the House of Commons&#x2014;the servant of the House of Commons, a man who, as was said by one of his eminent pre-decessors&#x2014;
<quote>has neither eyes to see nor ears to hear anything ut what the House of Commons bids him."</quote>
Yet he is the arbiter placed between the other House and your Lordships' House on these important questions. And this is what is recommended to us in the name of fair play&#x0021;<lb/>
The noble Viscount spoke of those who were opposed to the Bill as having fought their hardest and done their best in opposition, but they fought with the rope round
<col>716</col>
their necks and with the guillotine falling, with the Government absent from the Front Bench, with the Foreign Secretary abroad, and very often with an Under-Secretary representing the Government most of the time. Those were the conditions under which they made their fight. The noble Viscount passed lightly over the interregnum, that period in which the Government, who tell us this is a temporary measure, propose to carry measures of the first importance both to the Church and the State, without any interposition from this House or the constituencies. That is the species of fair-play which the head of the English law recommends as being an adequate safeguard for the people and a sufficient recognition of the rights of your Lordships' House. I only trust that the humblest litigant who comes to that Bar will obtain from the Lord Chancellor a greater measure of fair play and of justice than that which he proposes to concede to your Lordships, whose talents in the same sentence he extolled, and to his political opponents whose respect he has enjoyed.<lb/>
I can add nothing to the outspoken language in which the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition described what our condition would be under this Bill. Lord Rosebery, in masculine language, said it was "a degrading and abject condition." The Government will find it very difficult to dispose of those terms; but if they find it difficult with regard to the House at large, they will find it still more difficult with regard to the situation in which they propose to put individual members of this House. You are to say to a man who has been elevated to the Peerage for his success in ruling various Dominions of the Crown, or to a man who has sat for twenty years in the House of Commons, or to a man who has been a Minister of the Crown or even Prime Minister, "Not only shall you not give a vote which shall dispose of the Ministry of the day, not only shall you have no right to influence the Executive; more than that, in all ordinary matters you shall have no right to bring to a conclusion that experience and knowledge for which you were sent here and which entitle you to form a judgment; you may warn, but you cannot restrain; you may complain, but you cannot avert; you may criticise, but you must not govern; you may talk, but the decision will be left to the merest tyro who has found his way into the House of Commons."
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0363"/>
<col>717</col>
That is a position which I think individual members of this House who have performed public service may well resent. There is only one man on the Front Bench opposite who has had the courage to step in where others have feared to tread. The noble Earl, Lord Carrington, who never loses an opportunity outside this House of explaining the strong zeal which animates him for democratic institutions at the expense of the Peerage inside this House, went out of his way to urge your Lordships to give up reform, to accept restrictions, and to content yourselves with "clinging to your seats and to your coronets." We have no appetite for the gilded impotence for which Lord Carrington would give us credit.<lb/>
We look upon this Bill as an unjust Bill and as a short-sighted Bill. Indeed, even the noble Viscount opposite must be aware that the Bill if passed as it is will leave behind a rankling sense of injustice. Are you wise in pressing a Party which represents nearly half the British people as hardly as you are pressing us to-day? Are you not drawing rather a heavy cheque on your balance of public confidence which some day you may find it difficult to honour? Have noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite entirely forgotten the revolution of the wheel and the seventeen years out of twenty in which they sat in Opposition from 1886? Do they suppose that if this Bill is passed in the face of the protests of five-sixths of your Lordships' House and of a minority in the House of Commons representing twenty-one millions of people, it will have any permanency on the Statute Book? We have made our contribution towards endeavouring to relieve the situation. I do not think that in the whole annals of Opposition in this country you will find so important a concession by one Party to another as that which was outlined in the Bill of the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, which was read a second time without a Division last night. I think we can detect on the benches opposite a certain feeling not only of astonishment, but of hesitation, with regard to that Bill. After all, it gives up privileges and rights which have been enjoyed for generations, and which would be enjoyed by our descendants. It gives a wide representation, and while you have had nothing but evil to say of the balance of Parties, it does give to the Party which has been in a minority of one to five in this Assembly a practical equality in an Assembly which,
<col>718</col>
unless it is to be a rival of the House of Commons, can never be its exact counterpart. It is not a theoretical change forced on us from without, but a practical evolution from within. Yet in the face of all this, the Lord Chancellor said&#x2014;
<quote>"We are invited to surrender at discretion after we have obtained the victory, to lay down our arms and accept the solution of our adversaries."</quote>
Is not that exaggerated language? You asked for equality. You asked for fair play. A majority of 400 will be brought down, you say to 40, we say to under 20, and under certain conditions it will be no majority at all. As Lord Curzon pointed out the other night, in Joint Sittings with the House of Commons such a majority as there is in the present House of Commons would give the Government a certain victory. If we go a step further, we come to the Referendum. I notice that the Prime Minister has not rejected the Referendum in such vigorous terms as some noble Lords who sit on the Front Bench opposite. What is the worst under the Referendum which could happen to you? Is it not strange to see the representatives of democracy in this House complaining of procedure which, in nine cases out of ten, would give a verdict to the House of Commons, and in the tenth case would put them in the power, not of the Peers whom they profess to fear, but of the people whom they profess to represent?<lb/>
We have been asked why our Reconstitution Bill was put forward. That is very germane to the question which is now before us. We recognise that this is a crisis in which it is the duty of every man to do his best to find such a reasonable settlement as will prevent those dangers of which the noble Viscount so eloquently spoke. We recognise also that the time has come when we can no longer rely on the unwritten law of the Constitution, and that in some form or another the relations between the two Houses must be decided by written law. We recognise further, as one or two of my noble friends behind me who are among the warmest advocates of the position of this House recognised twenty years ago, that some reform of this House is necessary if it is to be strong enough to hold the confidence of the people, and to be a check on the democracy. The Prime Minister flattered the House of Commons the other night by telling them that the powers of interposition on the part of this House were as obsolete, and had been for
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0364"/>
<col>719</col>
years, as the powers of the Crown a century or two back. I am not sure that the Duke of Northumberland was not a more accurate student of history and a more faithful judge of events when he warned your Lordships that the encroachments of the Crown were not always so dangerous to the people as the encroachments of the Commons. I say without hesitation that we desire to strengthen this House, and we desire to do it by the Bill, or something like it, which was before your Lordships yesterday.<lb/>
I shall no doubt be asked, after the speeches made in the House of Commons and after the speeches of Lord Rosebery and Lord Lansdowne, why, if we think the Bill before us now so deplorable, we have not the courage of our convictions and do not move the rejection of the Bill. The answer is that those with whom we act feel that we cannot look only at the immediate issue before us, at the partial instrument which we are asked to read a second time. We have to look at the whole field of controversy. And when we do that we remember that your Lordships' House have by Resolution agreed to surrender certain powers which are touched in this Bill; that by the Bill read a second time last night we have agreed to effect a great change in our constitution; that by the constant statements of the spokesmen of all Parties we are agreed that when the will of the people is clearly pronounced we will not stand in the way. We admit that for some change&#x2014;not for this change&#x2014;the people are fully prepared. If we took the other course and rejected this Bill summarily we would create at once an issue of the first magnitude. We would arouse the extremest feelings. We would close the door to the wiser counsels which we yet believe will prevail on the opposite side of the House. That would make all negotiation impossible. Another reason is that this Bill is brought before us as a temporary Bill, and as such we mean to deal with it. We do not accept the idea that this Bill can permanently remain on the Statute Book. When we ask your Lordships to give this Bill a Second Reading, or not to object to the Second Reading, we know that we are making a very heavy demand on the forbearance of the House. If we allow it to be read a second time it means that we must forget the number of unjust charges the fruits of which are enshrined in the Bill. We must ignore the vituperation to which the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, referred,
<col>720</col>
and we must do it simply because we believe it is more patriotic sometimes, as well as more courageous, to refuse battle than to accept it.<lb/>
But if we do read the Bill a second time I venture to say that we shall have grave Amendments to propose. We believe that in this atmosphere it can hardly be seriously argued that such questions as the power and position of the Crown, the establishment of National Councils in Ireland, Wales and Scotland, and other Constitutional issues can possibly be left to the hazard of a chance majority in the House of Commons at a given moment. I am not stating the gist of our Amendments, but merely mentioning subjects which cannot possibly in this discussion escape the most serious and prolonged attention of this House. I would say on my own part that if the House of Lords is to be a reality in the future and not a sham, we must have some other tribunal than the Speaker of the House of Commons to act as arbiter between the two Houses.<lb/>
There is one other subject I should like to mention before I sit down. If we are to negotiate with the Government, surely we must be allowed to do so on something like equality. We cannot negotiate on the terms which the noble Viscount has suggested to us. The Government say, "Pass the Bill, and we will come to an understanding with you." But we should then go into the matter as bond slaves, and not as free agents of a great Assembly. The noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, begged us to accept this Bill as a mere evolution of the Constitution. We are prepared for evolution, but this Bill is not evolution. It is simply a catastrophe so far as this House is concerned. If the Government refuse to negotiate, it will not be the last chapter of this Bill. On the contrary, they will have opened a chapter which will never be closed until some fair and just scheme, fair and just to both Parties, can be discovered. We ask for a permanent settlement. You are proposing what can only be a permanent sore, and what must always leave, so long as it remains on the Statute Book, a sense of inequality and injustice. You are proposing to apply to the great majority in this House fetters which you have not dared to put on the white population in Africa or in Australia. Do we not present a sorry spectacle at this moment, when the representatives of the great Dominions overseas are here amongst us,
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0365"/>
<col>721</col>
and you have proposed to this House conditions which would not be accepted in any of the countries from which they come, and which we have not imposed upon them?<lb/>
We were asked whether we had said our last word on our Reconstitution Bill. I venture to hope that the Government have not said their last word on this Bill. You can, of course, as Lord Beaconsfield said of the Liberals in his day&#x2014;you can agitate against a class in the interests of a class. "But that," he said, "is not a precaution, it is not policy, it is vengeance." I venture to tell the Government that they will not settle this question by merely introducing a punitive measure of this kind. If they wish to make a permanent settlement, if they wish to free themselves and their legislation to which they attach importance from the continual and galling attacks of the Opposition, they cannot do that by trying to force down the throats of a free Assembly a measure which asks it to give up its privileges and leaves it none of its rights. They can only give the country a permanent, a just, and a statesmanlike settlement by acting as the agents and the spokesmen of the great majority of the people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01271"><member>LORD MARCHAMLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House has listened with deep interest to the remarkable speeches which have been delivered by leaders on both sides of the House, and I very much regret that the exigences of Party debate should have made it necessary that in my few modest and short observations I should have to follow the noble Viscount opposite. I am sure that the House will acquit me of anything like unseemliness or impertinence if I venture to express the opinion that the Unionist Party throughout the country, particularly noble Lords opposite, have only themselves to thank for the fact that we are this afternoon discussing this Bill. I think I shall gain acquiescence from the opposite side of the House when I say that this is a most remarkable Bill. It is, if I can describe it in a colloquial phrase, a chicken-coming-home-to-roost Bill. It is the retribution, the headache that follows a somewhat protracted political debauch.<lb/>
From the speech of the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, I do not think that noble Lords opposite have even yet really appreciated or fully gauged the position of Liberalism and of the Liberal Party throughout the last five or six years. The noble
<col>722</col>
Viscount, in a very able speech, talked as if the Unionist Party were the injured Party. That is not so. During the past six years the lot of the Liberal Party has been indeed a cruel, painful, and pitiable one; it has been almost ridiculous. Our position has involved the negation of the supposed inherent right of the British people to govern themselves. In 1906 the Liberal Government were put into office by one of the largest majorities ever recorded. At two subsequent elections the Government were continued in power by majorities, perhaps not on such a large scale, but of considerable significance. In 1906 we came into power chiefly upon the education question, allied with the general unpopularity of the Unionist Government. But although we have been in office six years, to what extent have we been able to give effect to our ideas and our policy upon educational affairs? We have made no progress whatever, and we never shall under our present Constitution and with the present relationship between the two Houses. With this House constituted as it is, we Liberals would never be able to give effect to our ideas and policy on the education question, or carry out our ideas and policy with regard to plural voting. For all the good that Liberal electors have done throughout the country during the last three elections upon these vital matters, they might as well have been playing marbles or spinning tops.<lb/>
I well remember during the short period before the Transvaal War when there was a general demand on the part of the Uitlanders in the Transvaal for the franchise, a noted American said that had he been President Kruger he would have given them all the franchise and all the votes they wanted, but he would have kept the counting in his own hands. That is exactly what your Lordships do. You have no objection to our voting. You do not even object to our returning a Government to power, but you keep the counting practically in your own hands, and by your majority decide whether Liberals shall or shall not give effect to their policies and ideas. The noble Viscount opposite spoke a good deal of fair play. But how does it appeal to your Lordships' sense of impartiality and fair play that when you are in office you are in a position of unchecked power, but that when we are in office&#x2014;in so-called power&#x2014;we really have no power whatever? We might as well be employed
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0366"/>
<col>723</col>
in building sand castles for noble Lords opposite to knock down. I shall not forget the first session of the Parliament of 1906, because I was then Chief Whip. We sent up to your Lordships a large number of subsidiary measures, all of which you passed; but all our measures of primary importance, to the extent of four, your Lordships either directly or indirectly rejected. This House might almost have been skittle experts, with such deftness of precision did you knock down all our big Bills when they came up. Still, the country did not show commotion, and I really marvelled at the time that that should be so. If seemed difficult to flog it into a recognition of the overwhelming difficulties with which we had to contend.<lb/>
Then your Lordships became bolder; your appetite seemed to grow in eating, and in 1909 you rejected the Budget. A more stupendous act of foolishness never was perpetrated by any House of Parliament. So long as your Lordships only claimed to deal with the ordinary measures we sent up, perhaps no difficulty would have arisen, but when you laid hands on the ark of the covenant itself&#x2014;the right of the British people to supervise and control their own financial powers and the taxation of the country&#x2014;you then claimed that you had power, not only to dismiss the Commons when you wished so to do, but to hold up the finances of the country in order to secure your own ends and aims. It is a pity that noble Lords opposite, particularly those on the Front Bench, could not have consulted some crystal gazer when about to take that action. If the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition could have had a peep into the future, could have seen himself moving the Second Reading of the Bill which he moved a few days ago, I think it would have made him hesitate. I know how difficult it is for leaders to control the turbulent and fighting spirit of their followers, but I cannot think that the action of the leaders of the Tory Party was wise when they rejected the Budget two years ago. Hotheadedness and inexperience got the better of a calm judicial frame of mind and of experience. I believe it was Palmer the Rugeley murderer who on being found guilty exclaimed, referring to the speech of the prosecuting counsel, "It is the riding that did it." I cannot but think it was bad riding on the Front Bench opposite that has brought about the present position. Whether your Lordships do or
<col>724</col>
do not pass this Bill one thing is bound to ensue. Your power of crippling and curtailing Liberal legislation is absolutely gone.<lb/>
My Lords, I think this Bill is in a measure a good Bill, and it is my intention to vote for it. I am bound to say it is not altogether the Bill that I should have liked to have seen introduced into this House to settle the difficulties which have occurred during the last five or six years. At the beginning of last year I ventured to forward to the Press a little alternative scheme of my own which would have more fully dealt with and met the difficulties and the deadlock winch have occurred. I did so not from any altruistic motive, but from somewhat of a selfish motive as a Party man. I feared very much that the Liberal Party would not be able to hold their own and carry the election if they introduced into the House of Commons anything like a single-Chamber form of Bill which was embodied in the "C. B." Resolutions passed a few years ago. I thought they would be defeated if they went to the country upon this single-Chamber Bill, and because of that I ventured to urge an alternative scheme of my own. If defeated, it would have been the greatest disaster that any Party would ever have had to face, and we should have had grafted on our financial affairs a system of Tariff Reform, which to many people spells disaster to the country. But I must frankly say that I was utterly and entirely wrong. The country did not reject the Bill which had been introduced into the House of Commons by the Government, and therefore I shall never claim to be a prophet on these matters again. I had not appreciated the strength of the feeling throughout the country that your Lordships' power for altering democratic measures and Liberal legislation should be determined.<lb/>
Now we have a Bill passed through the House of Commons and introduced into this House which does give, I frankly acknowledge, single-Chamber government in one shape or form, but single-Chamber government tempered by two years' delay. May I ask your Lordships to consider for one moment how far that delay of two years does remove it from the category of a single-Chamber measure? As an old electioneerer, I say it goes a long way to remove this Bill from that category. That two years' delay is very much more important than appears upon the face of it. I do not think we need fear that any revolutionary
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0367"/>
<col>725</col>
legislation will be rushed through the two Houses of Parliament even if this Bill is accepted <i>in toto</i> by your Lordships. Noble Lords who have not been in the House of Commons do not know the peculiar relationship that exists between Members and their constituents. It is of a very delicate and sensitive character. A Member is largely concerned, no doubt, for the safety of the Government of which he is a supporter, but he is very much more concerned for the safety of the seat which he occupies, and if any Bill were likely to prove obnoxious to a section of his constituents he would be very soon made aware of it, long before two years had passed over. Deputations would wait upon him, pressure would be brought to bear upon him, and, realising the state of affairs, he would come up to London and see the Whips, and they would have a most uncomfortable time. He would say to them, "It is absolutely impossible for me to hold my seat if you propose to push on with this Bill. When the Second Reading comes on, or any other stage of the measure, you must not look to me for support." Long before six months had passed over it would be well known whether the Government could carry the Bill to its Second or Third Reading in the other House. Not only that. Legislation is like a good many things. If you hang it up for too long it becomes stale, and I do not think any Bill, unless it were one of cardinal importance and hacked up most strongly by the people throughout the country, would stand two years' delay, with three times passing through the House of Commons.<lb/>
But apart from this, I ask your Lordships to consider the circumstances in which this Bill was passed by the House of Commons and ratified and adopted by the country. If there are degrees in what you may call an <i>ad hoc</i> election, surely the last election presented the superlative degree. It was an election taken upon one specific matter alone; the verdict of the country was sought upon the Bill of the Government and upon nothing else. It is all very well to say, as did the noble Viscount opposite, that other considerations had sway. But that is not so. The question was one between the Lords and the Commons, and that was the only one debated at the election in January last. Do your Lordships contend for one moment that you can stand against the deliberately expressed will of the people, expressed as it has been practically in two
<col>726</col>
elections? You cannot do so. It is absolutely impossible that you should be able to do so, and if you could it would be a most lamentable fact. If it were possible for you to maintain that position and reject this Bill, you would be heading straight for revolution, because there is no other means by which the power of the people could be made to prevail. The noble Marquess, in his speech the other day&#x2014;a speech to which I listened with close concern&#x2014;said that in his opinion this House had lost ground with the country. I rather think he gave, as the reason the House had suffered discredit in the country, the fact of the continued and frequent additions to it from the House of Commons and elsewhere. I am one of the incursionists. I am of the "frequent additions." But you are not the only sufferers. We likewise, coming from the House of Commons, are in some respects sufferers, because we find your Lordships very dull. I sat in the House of Commons&#x2014;no doubt every Member will think the same of his own constituency&#x2014;for the most intelligent constituency in the United Kingdom. It is a constituency that only recently, within the last fortnight, has received its long delayed raced of recognition in one of the articles of the "Punch-cum-Belloc" series in <i>Punch.</i> It is a constituency that delights and glories in the name of Pudsey. I often wish when listening to debates in this House that I was back in the sun-flecked groves or the Elysian fields of Pudsey.<lb/>
Although, as I say, I was not entirely in favour of this Bill, I press it on your Lordships because I recognise that it is an honest attempt on the part of the Government to solve the difficulty, and I believe the two years delay will remove any suspicion of single-Chamber government. Unless your Lordships are going to stand in the way of the expression of the popular will you are bound to accept it, for no Bill has ever come before you with greater popular credentials. It may be that when you are passing the Bill you will state your formal objections to it. You may say that at the present time you are submitting to major force, but that the time may come when, as the noble Viscount pointed out, you may have another period in office and be able to mould the relationship between the two Houses of Parliament in the way you desire. But at the present juncture the wisest and the most statesmanlike thing
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0368"/>
<col>727</col>
you can do is to take this Bill which comes hot from the crucible of the country and pass it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01272"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships will, I think, agree with me that any atmosphere of unreality which might have hung over our recent discussion with regard to the composition of the House of Lords has now been entirely dispelled by the consideration of a far more important aspect of the Constitutional struggle&#x2014;namely, not as to who shall sit in the House of Lords but what they shall do when they are there. As to the functions of this House, we on this side at any rate are agreed upon this proposition&#x2014;that the House of Lords, whether hereditary, nominative, or purely elective, shall be of sufficient authority to exercise those powers which are appropriate to Second Chambers in all well-regulated countries.<lb/>
We heard just now from one speaker&#x2014;and it was alluded to in the brilliant speech we have just listened to from my noble friend Lord Midleton&#x2014;that there is a certain amount of apathy in the country among the electors with regard to this matter of the House of Lords, and the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack has constantly, and I venture to think with great truth, taken the view that the people do not care so very much about Constitutional questions provided they get what they want. That is a view with which I find myself in hearty accord. The electors are quite right. They think that the reform of the Poor-law is a great deal more important than the reform of the House of Lords. The "man in the street" takes what has always been the Tory view of the British Constitution. In this matter the "man in the street" is on the side of the angels. He takes the same view as Lord Bolingbroke and Lord Beaconsfield took&#x2014;that the British Constitution exists to promote the social welfare of the people. From the slight study I have made I have been led to the same conclusion as Lord Beaconsfield&#x2014;I hope I may say this without disrespect to noble Lords opposite&#x2014;that the Whig tradition with regard to the Constitution is that it is a contrivance for the purpose of keeping the Radical Party in office, and that it ought to be manipulated from time to time in order that it may properly discharge the function of keeping the Party opposite in their places.<lb/>
But although it is true, in a sense, that there is a certain amount of apathy about
<col>728</col>
this question, I was glad to hear my noble friend Lord Midleton make this point, that he had not at any rate received any letters from anybody begging him to pass this Bill. I can only tell you that I have received a great many letters from all parts of England imploring me to use what small influence I have to secure the destruction of this measure&#x2014;letters in which noble Lords opposite and their friends are described in perfectly accurate terms, which I will not repeat on the present occasion, and letters which evidently show that a great many people are watching this struggle with a great deal more interest than some of us, at any rate, give them credit for. The frame of mind of the ordinary elector with regard to the present controversy is either one of contempt for it as a struggle between Party politicians for Party purposes, or of bewilderment with regard to the many counter proposals which are put before him; or else he entirely fails to realise the magnitude of the fraud which it is proposed to commit upon him on the present occasion. But there is no doubt of this, that, whatever the man in the street may think of what is going on here, we are face to face with one of those periodical encroachments which the Radical Party have made from time to time on the ancient Constitution of this country, and the less it is realised out of doors the more it is the duty of noble Lords who belong to the Constitutional Party on this side of the House to protect the interests of the people, which are, unconsciously to them, being sought to be taken away from them by noble Lords opposite.<lb/>
We will do the supporters of this measure the fullest justice that we possibly can, but I do not think I am understating their case when I suggest that it is not based on any national demand for a national settlement. That argument is not open to them, because if they say that one-half of the people are in their favour we are perfectly entitled to say that the other half are in our favour. This, therefore, cannot be a national settlement when approximately half the electors are dead against you. What runs through Radical speeches, both indoors and out of doors, is that this proposal is based on nothing else except the necessitous condition of the Radical Party. We have heard that argument over and over again. It was repeated for the thousandth time by the noble Lord who has just sat down, that the Radical Party with regard to the House of Lords suffer a permanent disability in&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0369"/>
<col>729</col>
shall I say?&#x2014;the game of Party politics; that they go into the struggle with one hand tied behind their backs, on account of the House of Lords. That is not our fault. They have had an equal chance&#x2014;a greater chance than we have had&#x2014;since 1832 of packing the House of Lords with their own supporters. You have taken full advantage of all the opportunities that have been offered to you in this respect, and you are easily first in the race of sending your former supporters in the House of Commons and others who can be relied upon to support you up to the House of Lords. You have no right whatever to find fault with the majority against you in the House of Lords to-day, because so many of them are creations of your own Party.<lb/>
But when it comes to all this talk about the handicaps and disabilities of the two political Parties in the State, what I want to know is, How about the Irish? You say we have a permanent advantage in having the House of Lords on our side. We say you have a permanent advantage on your side, if you are going to look on statesmanship as nothing else except a game, in having eighty Irish votes that Mr. Gladstone bought for you when he first capitulated with regard to Home Rule for Ireland becoming part of the programme of the Radical Party; and it is subject to these eighty Irish Members, who very much over-represent the number of electors behind them and who have to be treated by the Radical Party on the strict United States interpretation of most-favoured-nation treatment, that you have in the House of Commons the majority you at present have. We are always hearing the argument&#x2014;the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack is particularly fond of giving expression to it&#x2014;that the existence of the Radical Party with a House of Lords is an impossibility. I have never been convinced that the existence of the Radical Party is a necessity to the State at all. I have always felt inclined to agree with what I believe Talleyrand said to a deputation who waited on him and explained that they must live. <i>"Je n'en vois par la necessite,"</i> was his reply. We may, I think, say the same thing with regard to the Radical Party. Instead of regarding their existence as a national necessity, I think a great many on this side of the House and a great many people in the country regard their existence at the present juncture as something very like an Imperial calamity.<lb/>
<col>730</col>
I submit, with great respect, that noble Lords opposite have very little case against the House of Lords at all. The argument runs through all their speeches that they are never able to do anything while in office on account of the House of Lords. That was insisted upon in its most naked form by the noble Lord who has just sat down. I know noble Lords opposite can take extracts from former speeches of Statesmen illustrative of almost any point of view they desireto support. Let me take an extract from a recent speech of the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, at Fakenham. I take it from the <i>Morning Leader.</i> His Lordship is reported to have said that in 1906 when the Liberals were returned to power with a great majority&#x2014;
<quote>"great changes commenced, and looking back over five years he saw a great record of work accomplished."</quote>
That does not tally with what has been said by other speakers&#x2014;
<quote>"Though the Government in some cases have failed&#x2014;they had not, for instance, succeeded in putting the educational system on a proper foundation&#x2014;there had been other things which had changed the face of the earth, and each year had brought its crop of measures of social reform."</quote>
That is what the noble Viscount said. Radical speakers always assume that the House of Lords possesses and exercises an absolute Veto over legislation. Nobody knows better than the noble Lords opposite how misleading that is. We have no absolute Veto. I am one of those who heartily wish we had an absolute Veto over a great deal of legislation. Everybody knows perfectly well that neither the Conservative Party nor the House of Lords has ever opposed any measure for the social welfare of the people. As my noble friend Lord Midleton reminded your Lordships so eloquently just now, the Tory Party and the House of Lords have always been the pioneers with regard to measures for the social welfare of the people. I was about to illustrate that argument by the historical instance which he brought forward, but as he expressed it so much more eloquently than I could hope to do I will leave that recollection in your Lordships' minds. But the immediate necessities of noble Lords opposite, for which I understand they desire this Bill to pass into law, have nothing to do with the social welfare of the people. We shall never oppose your national insurance scheme or anything of that kind. The Bills which you think the House of Lords will probably
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0370"/>
<col>731</col>
demand a reference to the people upon have nothing to do with the welfare of the people. Home Rule for Ireland, for instance, is not going to add a single day's work or a single shilling of wages to the working classes of this country. Disestablishment of the Church in Wales is not going to add work or wages to the working classes, and the same remark equally applies to "One man one vote."<lb/>
I should like to say a word with regard to the argument which is always dinned into our ears that the House of Lords committed suicide when they rejected the Budget. I, for one, am absolutely and entirely unrepentant with regard to having, not rejected, but referred the Budget to the people, and I should have been prepared to support the noble Marquess, not only in referring the Budget once to the people, but, if he had thought fit to do so, in referring it twice to the people, because after that celebrated Budget I do not suppose the Radical Party ever went to the polls with a greater chance of a sweeping victory, or at any rate maintaining their position. They had all the prestige of an enormous majority in the House of Commons; they had the people's Budget, and all the arguments about black bread and horse flesh and that kind of thing; they had the cry of "Peers against the People," and class against class; yet in spite of that you came back to the House of Commons having lost 100 seats, and you could not pass your Budget for four or five months until you had managed somehow or other&#x2014;I am sure I do not know how&#x2014;to placate that portion of your supporters who hated the Budget and were very unwilling to vote for it until they had been able to extract their own terms from the Radical Government. The House of Lords would have done a most signal service, in my humble opinion, in the cause of free government by giving the people of this country a second chance of considering that Budget.<lb/>
The Budget either was or was not a revolution. If it was a revolution then the House of Lords was quite right in referring it to the people. If you cannot refer a revolution to the people then you had better not have a Second Chamber at all. If it was not a revolution, then for the Radical Ministers and their supporters to go about the country proclaiming almost in terms that it was a revolution partakes
<col>732</col>
very much of the nature of a conspiracy against the Constitution of this country. If they did that with a desire to draw the House of Lords into the position of rejecting the Budget in order to rake up a case against the House of Lords afterwards&#x2014;they evidently did so, because the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his eloquent way described the House of Lords as "rats caught in a trap"&#x2014;I say that was a treasonable conspiracy against the Constitution of this country, the proper way of dealing with which should have been by impeachment. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, in proposing this Bill, said that after all there was nothing new about trying to do away with the House of Lords&#x2014;I am, perhaps, paraphrasing what he said in a slightly exaggerated way&#x2014;that there was nothing new about the present proposal, because it was analogous to something that had been brought forward by Mr. John Bright in 1836&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01274"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Viscount's pardon. It does not very much matter whether it was brought forward in 1836 or in 1883. The reason why it did not take effect either in 1836 or in 1883 was that the people of the country realised that it was a single-Chamber conspiracy. They are determined to have double-Chamber government. On the only occasions when the people of this country have had to do without double-Chamber government for any length of time they have always come back to it in the long run, and, not only that, they have always come back to the hereditary House of Lords, because the institution set up in its place was absolutely valueless. Everybody knows quite well that it was not on account of the rejection of this or that particular measure that the campaign against the House of Lords has taken place. The fiery cross, the destruction of this part of the Constitution, went out when Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Government came into power in 1906, and it was perfectly evident that they did not intend to exercise their power in the first instance for the common welfare of the country but in order to destroy the House of Lords. They had one of the finest majorities that has ever been returned to the House of Commons, and after having had two encounters with the people they
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0371"/>

are obliged to come back to Parliament and say that the whole world is wrong, that they cannot govern with the machine that was good enough for the great Statesmen who governed this country in the past, and that for the future the British Constitution is to be modelled on the lines of such countries as Greece and Costa Rica.<lb/>
You say that you always have single-Chamber government whenever the Conservative Party is in office. I do not think that is a very good argument for Radical Cabinet Ministers to bring forward on this or on any other occasion. If the decrees of the Conservative Government go through, then it tallies with your own theory of government that the laws which are passed by the representatives of the people in the House of Commons ought to become law; and as I ventured to put before your Lordships just now it is not available for the Party opposite to criticise the majority in the House of Lords seeing how very many Peers they themselves have sent up to this House. The principle of this Bill is to limit and whittle away the powers of the House of Lords in such a manner that any decree, not so much of the House of Commons but of the Cabinet, shall become law in two years' time provided it is passed by the other House three times. The noble Viscount, in his explanation of the Bill, did not lay very much stress upon Clause 1, which provides that any measure of a purely financial kind shall become law without the House of Lords being any party to it. I would remind those who think this a reasonable proposal that this gives full play to the entire doctrines of the school of Mr. Philip Snowden, who have for their object the abolition of capital by means of taxation. But the powers of the House of Lords in this country are so small that they will not stand any whittling away or else they will be gone altogether. It is the deliberate opinion of Mr. Marriott, who has written a very admirable book on Second Chambers&#x2014;I have no doubt many of your Lordships have read it&#x2014;that of all Second Chambers the ancient House of Lords has less power than any other.<lb/>
The point I wish to put to noble Lords opposite is this. If you think it is really a fair proposal that any measure which has been through the House of Commons three times, although rejected by the House of Lords three times, shall still pass into law, then the first Bill which ought to
<col>734</col>
be the subject of the provisions of the Parliament Bill is the Parliament Bill itself; the Parliament Bill ought not to be passed into law until it has been sent up to this House from the House of Commons at least three times. The Prime Minister is always going up and down the country saying that the Royal Prerogative has disappeared, that it is no longer exercised and has fallen into disuse. It may be that the divine right of Kings no longer exists, but a great many people in this country would much sooner submit themselves to the divine right of Kings than submit themselves to the divine right of the Radical caucus. This Bill is calculated not to diminish any exercise of the Royal Prerogative; it is actually calculated to revive it. Let me take this instance. We will suppose that this Bill is passed and that a Home Rule Bill is then produced in the House of Commons and sent up to the House of Lords. In the House of Lords it is rejected, we will say for the sake of argument, three times. In the meantime there has been a prodigious agitation against the Bill in the country, and we will also come to the supposition, which is not an extravagant one, that the Radical Party decline to drop the Bill and still proceed with it. Very well. You are then face to face with this situation that, instead of there being a House of Lords to refer the Bill back to the people, the only power which is what Mr. Bagot used to call "getatable" will be the power which used to reside in the Sovereign himself; and if the House of Commons stand firm, there is nothing between the electors who do not desire the Bill and the passing of the measure but the actual Royal Prerogative. So that instead of this measure placing the Royal Prerogative beyond the reach of the people, it would actually tend to bring it more into play, to revive it and make it a living thing.<lb/>
There is no argument that we have heard in favour of legislation without any appeal to the people. The only argument you are able to bring forward is your own majority in the House of Commons. There is we admit in the House of Commons a majority in favour of the Bill, but we have a much larger majority in this House against the Bill, and you have a Bill which in the country would be rejected by the electors. We need not analyse the majorities in the two Houses. The majority in
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0372"/>
<col>735</col>
the House of Commons is subject to quite as destructive and critical analysis as is our majority in the House of Lords; and, as the late Lord Salisbury used to say, "It is not the House of Lords who have left the Radical Party; it is the Radical Party who have left the House of Lords." One by one the Radical Party have thrown over in the House of Commons all the great principles which used to be common ground between the two Parties, such as the unity of the United Kingdom, the Establishment of the Church, the authority of the Law Courts, and the protection of private property. You have got, in your desire to destroy the House of Lords, nearer to success at the present moment than ever you have done before. If you pass this Bill, it will be passed by noble Lords opposite and their Party entirely on their own responsibility, and I trust that noble Lords on this side will be no party whatever to passing this Bill in the shape in which it is at the present moment. The creation of Peers may be the way in which you may choose to force it on the electors of this country, but I submit that the time for the creation of Peers to pass this Bill is not yet. It has only been before the people in a purely, technical sense at the last General Election, and the usage of the Constitution is that the question of the creation of Peers does not arise until a Bill passed by the House of Commons is rejected by the Peers, then submitted to a General Election, and rejected by the House of Peers a second time.<lb/>
We are asked to read this Bill a second time. My noble friend Lord Midleton observed, with great truth, that it was placing a considerable strain upon some noble Lords on this side of the House, and speaking for myself I would have willingly supported the rejection of the Bill on Second Reading. Still on the Committee stage we shall at any rate have a full and a free examination of the clauses of the Bill. A full and free examination is possible here, because we have no closure like they have in the House of Commons, and we shall remember in this matter that we are trustees for a great many people. There are forty-five million inhabitants of this country and only seven million electors, and the House of Lords represents that portion of the inhabitants who are not electors just as much as do the House of Commons. This is not a struggle, as it is always represented to be, between the Peers and the people;
<col>736</col>
it is not a struggle between the Lords and the Commons. It is a struggle, as Mr. Lowell put in his book about the English Constitution, between the Lords and the Cabinet. I will go further than that. It is a struggle between the Cabinet and that vast body of opinion which still realises what free government means in a free country. The only argument you can produce in favour of this Bill is the argument of necessity, which Pitt used to observe, very truly, was the argument of tyrants and the creed of slaves. You may adopt the argument of tyrants if you desire to do so, but we on our side do not wish to adopt the creed of slaves. We do not wish to pass this Bill, because we are afraid that some day or other a worse thing may overcome us. The Parliament Bill will destroy the House of Lords itself, because nobody would care in the future to sit in a House of Lords which cannot exercise those powers which all the second Chambers in His Majesty's Dominions oversea and in every country of Europe where representative government is carried on can exercise and do exercise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01275"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope I may be permitted, as an old Parliamentarian, to say a few words on the Bill before us. In the first place, I desire to repudiate the suggestion of Lord Midleton that there has been any great change in the attitude of the Government to its supporters or any stricter application of Party man&#x0153;uvres in another place in respect of Bills before the House as compared with past times. Still less is it true that this Bill has been forced through the House of Commons by an improper use of the guillotine or the other processes for the purpose of stopping discussion. My recollection of the House of Commons goes back to the days of Lord Palmerston. Lord Palmerston's Government, I need hardly point out, was kept in office for something like ten years by a majority of not much more than twenty-five, and that Government could only have been carried on by the strictest application of the Party whip, and I undertake to say that during the forty or fifty years which have elapsed since then there has been no practical change in the attitude of Governments to their Parties or any great change in the application of the Party whip. So far as I have observed, the state of things in the House of Commons now is very much what it was at the time I speak of. I have never known a Bill such as that before us which had been more
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0373"/>
<col>737</col>
fully and ably discussed in the House of Commons.<lb/>
I also repudiate the suggestion made a few days ago by the Duke of Northumberland and also by Lord Ampthill, that there has been any deterioration in the <i>personnel</i> of the House of Commons. I undertake to say there is not a word of truth in those statements. No doubt there have been great changes in the House of Commons during the last fifty years. New classes have come in. The Irish Nationalists, the Labour members, and the Welsh members form new classes who seem to me to have added to the ability and variety of the House of Commons without detracting from it in any respect whatever. The noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, devoted a considerable part of his speech to meeting the statements made by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack that the Liberal Government for some time past, and Liberal measures, had been unfairly treated. The noble Viscount pointed out a number of measures that had been before the House of Commons for twenty, thirty, and forty years, and then went on to say that it was not unreasonable that the House of Lords should be given an opportunity of delaying those measures for a further number of years. I should have thought, if such measures had been discussed so long in the House of Commons and had only reached ripeness after so many years, that the argument ought rather to have qeen that public opinion had been concentrated upon them, and that they might reasonably be passed into law after such long discussion and consideration. But the noble Viscount seemed to think, notwithstanding all the discussion that those measures had had, that time House of Lords would be justified in yet further delaying them. Four years ago when the Education Bill was under discussion I made a careful examination of the number of Bills which have been passed by the House of Commons and rejected by the House of Lords, and I found that since the year 1832 about sixty measures had been passed by the House of Commons and rejected by your Lordships. Of those sixty Bills I found that all, with only two exceptions, were subsequently passed by your Lordships after delays sometimes of five years, sometimes of ten, and even of thirty and forty years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01276"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Were they all passed in the same form?</membercontribution></p>
<col>738</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01277"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member><membercontribution>: Generally they were passed in a very much stronger form than when originally passed by the House of Commons and rejected by your Lordships' House. I could quote several instances in support of that, and I would say that as a general rule delay has caused the measures to be passed in a stronger form ultimately than the form in which they were originally propounded. Only two of those measures, as I have said, which were originally rejected by the House of Lords still remain unpassed. Those are the Home Rule Bill of 1894 and a measure for the abolition of the Lord Lieutenancy in Ireland, which was passed by the House of Commons in 1850. The difference between the two Houses has been greatly accentuated of late years. It began in Lord Melbourne's Government as regards Irish measures. The wise counsels of the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel in the days of the Reform Act of 1832 prevented any issue between the two Houses upon English and Scottish measures, but Irish measures were abandoned to the free will of the House of Lords and numerous cases occurred in which those measures were rejected.<lb/>
The action of the Lords was still more accentuated in the Government of Mr. Gladstone, between the years 1869 and 1874, again in 1880 and 1884, and again in the later Government in 1894 which was presided over by my noble friend Lord Rosebery. My noble friend Lord Morley has called attention to the speeches made by Lord Rosebery on that occasion. I need hardly remind the House that several measures of that Government which came from the House of Commons were rejected by the House of Lords, including the Home Rule Bill of 1894 and other Bills of importance. It became a question with that Government how best to deal with the matter, and after grave consideration the Government came to the conclusion that it was not by reform of the House of Lords, but by dealing with the Veto, by restricting the Veto, that an alteration could be made, and Lord Rosebery was commissioned by the then Government to lay the case before the country. Lord Rosebery spoke at several large meetings in different parts of the country on the subject. I have myself a perfect recollection in the matter, because the first of those great meetings addressed by Lord Rosebery was at Bradford, which I then represented. It was at Bradford that Lord Rosebery opened his campaign against
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0374"/>
<col>739</col>
the House of Lords and presented the policy of his Government and of his colleagues. He devoted himself, in the first of those great speeches at Bradford, mainly to an attack upon your Lordships' House and upon the policy of rejecting Liberal measures; but later, in the two speeches which he made at Glasgow and Devonport, he propounded the remedy of his Government and stated that his colleagues were all united in the belief that the crisis could only be met by the suspension of the Veto of the House of Lords. The noble Lord made use of these words&#x2014;
<quote>"I say confidently that no such act of insanity as our proposing reform of the House of Lords has ever for an instant occurred to any of us. We want to readjust the relations of the House of Commons to the House of Lords, so that the deliberate will of the House of Commons shall not be overborne by the action of the House of Lords. In our opinion the time has come when the right of the Lords to oppose an absolute Veto to the wishes and to the legislation of the House of Commons shall for ever cease."</quote>
That is exactly the policy of the present Government. For my part I have no wish to twit the noble Earl with any change of mind upon the subject. The noble Earl has a perfect right to change his opinions, and, after all, sixteen years is a long interval in which to effect this. He has been seated during that time on the Cross Benches, and probably his divergence from his old friends has become greater. But, none the less, the statement made by Lord Rosebery on that occasion on behalf of his colleagues and representing all their views has a significance which cannot be disregarded. His statements then were made on behalf of all his colleagues after full consultation with them and represented their views on the subject, and his colleagues included among their number such men as Lord Spencer, Lord Granville, Lord Kimberley, and Lord Ripon, the mainstays in those days of the Whig Party, and with whom I am sorry to say there are very few to be compared at the present time. In my judgment what has taken place has immensely strengthened the case in that direction. Lord Rosebery's Government was followed by ten years of Unionist Government. At the end of that time a Liberal Government came into power under Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. It came into power with an immense majority and with a definite programme, but your Lordships set to work deliberately to destroy the measures of that Government. One after another they were presented to this House and were
<col>740</col>
rejected by large majorities here after having been carried by enormous majorities in the House of Commons. It seemed to me that the position of the Government in those circumstances was most humiliating, and one which they could not possibly endure.<lb/>
The time has at last come when the issue must be taken. The issue has been before the country at two General Elections, and it seems to me a definite and clear one. The fact that your Lordships have passed a Reform Bill in the House of Lords seems to me to be an admission of the case which we have made. It is an admission that great evils exist from the present state of things and that a remedy must be found. In our opinion the remedy is not in the direction of reform of your Lordships' House, but in the direction of the suspension of the Veto in the manner suggested by the Bill now before us. In my humble judgment, if the Government were not to persist in this measure and carry it to a conclusion, they would lose the confidence of their supporters, and would be considered traitors to the cause which they were sent to Parliament to represent. In my belief, therefore, they will do well to press this Veto Bill to a proper conclusion, and I feel very confident that one way or another it will pass into law before the end of the present session.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01278"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure there is no member of your Lordships' House&#x2014;certainly no one sitting on this side&#x2014;who does not feel that the discussion which is taking place on this Parliament Bill is the most important and perhaps the most critical that has ever taken place in this House. For, after all, what does the Parliament Bill mean? It is nothing more or less than an attack on our Constitution. It proposes to alter that system of Government under which for so many centuries this country has lived so well, so happily, and so free. Whatever guise the Government may choose to give it, they propose to hand over the administration of this country to the tender mercies of a Single Chamber. As my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke said, we have only to study the course pursued by every other important civilised Power to see the necessity of double-Chamber government.<lb/>
It is somewhat interesting to notice the manner in which the various members who form the present Ministry view the question
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0375"/>
<col>741</col>
of a Second Chamber. The Labour Party are honest. They say frankly that they prefer single-Chamber government, and I think we must admire them for their straightforwardness. But what is the attitude of noble Lords opposite, and of those who hold their views? They say they desire double-Chamber government. Sir Edward Grey spoke very strongly against single-Chamber government. The noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, has also put forward that view. But with all deference to them, I think they are endeavouring to throw dust in the eyes of the people of this country, for they must know full well that if this Parliament Bill becomes law in its proper sense it will certainly mean single-Chamber government at the end of two years. If a Bill is sent up three times to your Lordships' House in the short space of two years, on the last two occasions it will very likely be rushed through the House of Commons&#x2014;as we have seen this Bill rushed through, by means of the closure, the guillotine, and the other modes of procedure adopted by the present Government. The Government will be able to carry through Parliament measures which very likely they know the country does not want and upon which they certainly have taken great care not to consult the country. I venture to suggest that that condition of affairs is nothing more or less than single-Chamber government. Why is this measure brought forward? We know full well that one of the greatest complaints urged in the country by supporters of noble Lords opposite is that the House of Lords offer what they call a blank wall to Liberal measures. That is a very curious statement to make. The noble Earl opposite, the Minister for Agriculture, has frequently boasted in this House of the harvest of Bills that have become law since his Party have been in power.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01279"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: Only my own Bills.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01280"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble Earl can congratulate his colleagues also for I find that in the last five years 226 Government Bills have been passed into law by your Lordships' House. Only eight Bills have failed to pass this House, three of them because the two Houses could not agree with regard to Amendments. That being so, what becomes of the suggestion that the House of Lords presents a blank wall to Liberal measures? Certainly there was one Bill your Lordships
<col>742</col>
rejected&#x2014;the Licensing Bill. But what was that Bill? It was a Bill which we considered, and I think rightly so, to be of a vindictive and unjust character, a Bill which did not promote the cause of temperance. It would have brought ruin to a great number of people who had invested their money in an absolutely honest undertaking.<lb/>
What was the feeling in the country when we rejected the Licensing Bill? My noble friend Lord Midleton alluded to the appeal of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, who said he hoped your Lordships would not allow the unpopularity of the Bill to prevent its passing into law. We had a further proof that we had the country at our back in rejecting the Licensing Bill. During the time that Bill was before the country the present Home Secretary, Mr. Winston Churchill, fought a by-election at Manchester on being appointed President of the Board of Trade. What was the result? He was defeated. Then as to another measure. We are always being told that your Lordships rejected the Education Bill of 1906. That Bill was not rejected. It was amended, and was dropped by the Government because they would not accept the Amendments which your Lordships rightly insisted upon&#x2014;namely, the provision that in a free country parents should have the right of choosing the kind of religious instruction which their children should receive in the schools. The action of your Lordships was fully vindicated, for two years afterwards Mr. Runeiman introduced an Education Bill in which were embodied those very Amendments upon which your Lordships had insisted in the case of the previous Bill.<lb/>
One noble Lord pointed out that your Lordships had never resisted the will of the people when that will had been clearly expressed. He quoted with truth the case of the Irish Church Bill. Your Lordships rejected that Bill, but after the General Election took place in which the people clearly showed that they wished that Church disestablished, you acceded to the will of the people. Again, turn to the Trades Disputes Bill as it was called. Your Lordships passed that measure although it had been declared by the Government themselves to be an inefficient measure, altered during its progress through the House of Commons. When the General Election took place undoubtedly the Trades Disputes Bill occupied a very prominent
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0376"/>
<col>743</col>
part among the important questions of the day, and your Lordships put on one side your own ideas and passed that measure because you considered that it had received the support of the country. Can it be maintained, then, that the cry against your Lordships' House of permanently rejecting Liberal measures is justified? The noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, does not think so, for at Rhyl on October 30, 1907, he said&#x2014;
<quote>"Whenever the nation had been in earnest with a measure the House of Lords had in the end been no permanent obstacle."</quote>
How, then, can noble Lords opposite who support that view of Lord Haldane reconcile their consciences to bringing forward a measure to deprive your Lordships of the powers you have always possessed, and which it is admitted you have never brought to bear against Bills upon winch the country has decided? But Lord Haldane found salvation because of the action of the House of Lords in respect of the Budget. In the House of Commons he said, on April 6, 1910, that he would willingly have left the House of Lords alone had it not been for their action on the Budget. In his mind, then, so far as general legislation was concerned, the House of Lords had only exercised those functions of revision and delay which it was proper for a Second Chamber to perform.<lb/>
I am not going into the action of this House on the occasion of the Budget of 1909, because Lord Willoughby de Broke said everything as to that, and what he said entirely commends itself to me, and, I think, to noble Lords on this side of the House. But I would remind your Lordships that the House of Lords proved that it was a better judge of the will of the people with regard to the Budget than the Government of noble Lords opposite. The Budget is now law. But no one will contradict me when I say that it did not become the law of the laud on its merits. It passed the House of Commons on the first occasion by a majority of 230, but after the General Election it passed through the House of Commons by a majority of only 93. How was that majority obtained? It was obtained by a policy of log-rolling, by squaring Mr. Redmond in order to induce the Nationalists to vote for the Budget. I do not think any one will dispute that had that log-rolling not taken place the Budget would not be the law of the land at the present time. Mr. Redmond himself
<col>744</col>
said in Dublin that if Home Rule were put on one side he would fight the Budget, but if it were a question of the Budget and Home Rule he would accept the Budget. Therefore I maintain that the Budget only passed the House of Commons because the Government promised Home Rule. There is another point, and it was alluded to by my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke. Long before the Budget was referred by this House to the country attacks were made on your Lordships by some of the most important leaders of the Party opposite. As far back as January, 1907, Mr. Lloyd George, speaking at Carnarvon, said&#x2014;
<quote>"He would say this to his fellow-countrymen. If they found the Government man&#x0153;uvring their artillery into position for leading an attack on the Lords, the Welshman who worried them into attending to anything else until the citadel had been stormed ought to be put into the guard-room."</quote>
Therefore this attack was made on your Lordships long before you referred the Budget to the country.<lb/>
I do not think it can be said for a moment that this Parliament Bill can be looked upon as even intended to be a permanent settlement of this great Constitutional question. To my mind the Bill establishes a system of Parliamentary procedure whereby an autocratic Prime Minister at the head of a subservient majority can carry any measure he chooses through the House of Commons, and eventually it would become law. Or there might be the case of a weak Prime Minister held in the hollow of the hand of a Party of extremists and revolutionists, not unlike the present situation I venture to say, who would insist on the measures they brought forward becoming the law of the land whether the House of Lords desired them or not. If the Government had desired to arrive at a settlement of this question they ought to have dealt with certain other complaints that have been made. One of those complaints is that there are too many Unionists in your Lordships' House. As my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke said, that is not the fault of the Unionist Party. We have frequently found that, when free from the pressure of the Radical Whips in another place, noble Lords having entered tins House have changed their politics and become Unionists. Why? Because they do not desire to see the Constitution undermined. The Parliament Bill offers no settlement of tins question. It does not
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0377"/>
<col>745</col>
propose to equalise the two Parties in this House. No; the Bill that proposes to do that is the Bill of my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition. That Bill deals with this question, a question which the Parliament Bill has entirely left out.<lb/>
Then there is another point of complaint&#x2014;namely, with regard to the hereditary principle. We hear of many speeches made by members of the Party opposite on this subject, notably the not very eloquent one of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in which he talked about the "first of a litter," but we do not see anything in this Bill which proposes to deal with the matter, however much the Radical Party may complain of it out of doors. Again, the Bill of my noble friend Lord Lansdowne does deal with the hereditary principle&#x2014;a matter which, if you had wished this to be a permanent settlement, ought to have appeared in your own Bill. It is as well to look the facts in the face, and I think the "man in the street" if he studies the question will come to the conclusion that this Bill is proposed to be passed for purely Party purposes. The Prime Minister told us that it was not an end in itself, but a means to an end. What is to be that end? Mr. Balfour, in his speech at the Albert Hall the other day, put the matter in a nutshell. His expression was&#x2014;
<quote>"If there had been no question of Home Rule there would have been no Parliament Bill."</quote>
My Lords, I believe that to be absolutely true. The object of this Parliament Bill is to pass Home Rule in order to obey the mandates of Mr. Redmond, who forced the Prime Minister to toe the line before he would give his support in the House of Commons. This is the repayment to Mr. Redmond. I maintain that the question of Home Rule is the most important question of the day, and that this measure is brought forward for the purpose of securing Home Rule I do not think even the Prime Minister himself would for one moment deny.<lb/>
I trust your Lordships will insist on this matter being thoroughly thrashed out in this House when we go into Committee. I sincerely hope that Home Rule will never be permitted to become the law of the land until the people of the country have said with no uncertain voice that they desire it. I believe if the people were asked that question to-morrow they would reply as
<col>746</col>
they did in 1886 and 1895. Therefore I say to endeavour to obtain Home Rule by such a measure as this is a betrayal, not only of the trust of the Government, but of the people themselves. I have not only ties of blood with Ireland myself but I have also had the honour of serving the Sovereign in an official capacity in that country, so that I have both a private and official knowledge of Ireland; and I can say from my experience that if Home Rule were granted to Ireland it would turn what is now a prosperous country into a country of ruin and misery and bring about in all probability civil war. That is why I maintain that this question should be brought prominently before the people of the country before Home Rule is ever permitted to become the law of the land. In that connection I may refer to a letter to <i>The Times</i> on November 25, 1891, in which the present Prime Minister made use of this expression&#x2014;
<quote>"I retain the opinion which I have more than Once expressed, that it is desirable, both upon tactical and other grounds, that before the General Election comes the country should be made aware of the general outline of the proposed settlement."</quote>
It is Home Rule that he was referring to. Speaking at the Manchester Reform Club earlier in the same year he gave expression to the same opinion. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"He confessed he was one of those who had felt that it would be desirable before the next General Election to give a general outline of the Home Rule Bill."</quote>
No outline has been given of what their idea of Home Rule is, and I conclude by again expressing the hope that your Lordships will stand firm on this question and insist, so far as lies in your power, that Home Rule shall never become the law of the land until the people of this country have declared for it with no uncertain voice.<lb/>

<title>PARLIAMENT BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01295">Debate on the Motion for the Second Reading <i>resumed</i> (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01296"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to draw attention to one branch of this subject, the importance of which is, I venture to think, as yet very inadequately appreciated by the public generally. I allude to the complete abandonment of such financial control as has heretofore been exercised by your Lordships' House. It may perhaps be thought that it is useless to say anything on this subject because, in the somewhat loose phraseology of the day, the public has made up its mind that finance is exclusively the province of the House of Commons, and that the House of Lords should have nothing to say in the matter. That may be so, but I very greatly doubt whether the very grave consequences which may and probably will ensue by withdrawing from this House the functions in respect to finance exercised by every other Second Chamber in the world are fully appreciated. In any case, my Lords, holding, as I do, that sound finance is the basis of all good government, I cannot reconcile myself to allowing this Bill to receive a Second Reading without littering a note of warning on this subject.<lb/>
My Lords, I do not propose to make a Budget speech, but I cannot enforce the argument to which I wish to draw your Lordships' attention without alluding briefly to the main facts of the present financial situation. I leave out of account the figures for the current year, merely observing that I cannot help fearing that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has greatly under-estimated the cost of his invalidity and unemployment insurance scheme. Looking to the past five years, I wish to point out that the Imperial expenditure has increased during that period by about thirty-one million pounds, or at the altogether unprecedented rate of more than six millions a year; that, in spite of the onerous taxes imposed, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has only been able to balance his accounts by reducing the amount heretofore applied to Sinking Fund by three and a-half millions a year, besides making some very formidable raids on the old Sinking Fund, which is being largely diverted from its original object; and that simultaneously with this enormous increase of Imperial there has been a very large increase of local taxation and expenditure. It is very generally thought
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0379"/>
<col>749</col>
that this huge increase in the public burden a mainly, if not entirely, on account of armaments. This view, however, is wholly incorrect. The increase of naval and military expenditure during the last five years has only been ten millions, as compared to an increase of twenty-one millions in civil expenditure.<lb/>
I am aware that hardy optimists, who either cannot or will not look the real facts of the situation in the face, airily brush aside all warnings based on these Stupendous figures with the comforting commonplace reflection that similar warnings have often been given before, and that in past times the event has falsified the predictions made by prophets of evil. I do not in the least deny it. I was reading not long ago that in the middle of the eighteenth century a member of your Lordships' House, Lord Bathurst, said that one of the most distinguished mathematicians of the day had foretold that the country would be irretrievably ruined if an attempt was made to raise a revenue of five millions in any one year, and fifty years ago Mr. Gladstone, whose very sound financial principles have been cast to the winds by his successors, said&#x2014;
<quote>"There is no country that can go on raising seventy millions in time of peace with impunity. England cannot, and, if England cannot, no country can."</quote>
I wonder what Mr. Gladstone would think if he could be told that in time of peace we are raising, not seventy millions, but 152 millions, exclusive of some thirty millions of revenue not derived from taxation properly so-called. The fallacy which underlies all the conclusions based on the falsity of past predictions is this&#x2014;that whereas it may be said, broadly speaking, that in the past the increase of the public burthens has been in some degree proportionate to the growing wealth and prosperity of the country, such is by no means the case at present. We have a falling birth-rate; we have to deal with a population which is but slowly increasing by comparison with former times. The growth of expenditure has by far outstripped that of population. Some twenty years ago the total Imperial expenditure amounted to no more than &#x00A3;2 11s. per head of population. It is now considerably over &#x00A3;3 per head.<lb/>
I am not going into the question of whether all this increase of expenditure has or has not been justified. I quite
<col>750</col>
admit that in view of the urgent need for social reform, which is universally recognised, much of it was justifiable. Neither will I deal with the methods adopted for raising the revenue required to meet this expenditure beyond saying that, however objectionable some features in those methods may have been, I have always recognised that the income of the income Tax-paving classes has enormously increased of late years, and that I therefore hold that, supposing the money to have been really required, the Chancellor of the Exchequer was perfectly justified in placing the main burthen on those who pay direct taxes, But I do say that, in view of the perfectly reckless manner in which liabilities of unknown amount have been incurred without any provision being made to meet them, and in view moreover, of the manner in which the large revenue derived from the Sugar Duties was unnecessarily sacrificed, there never was a moment in our history when strict financial control over the proceedings, not only of the Government, but of the House of Commons was more urgently required than at present. Yet this is the moment chosen to sweep entirely away the financial control heretofore exercised by your Lordships' House. I do not say that, in view of the very limited powers claimed by this House, that control could ever have been very effective or complete. It could never have interfered, nor did it ever claim to interfere, in detail. But, my Lords, it was better than nothing. It was, at all events, a control exercised by a body less exposed than the other House to ephemeral gusts of passion.<lb/>
We are often told&#x2014;and we have heard a good deal on the subject in this debate&#x2014;that your Lordships' House is not sufficiently in touch with popular feeling. I do not deny that there is some force in the criticism, but I am not at all sure that being in touch with popular feeling is the quality exclusively required in those who have to watch over the increase of the public burthens. It is a quality apt to degenerate into a complete inability to resist unreasonable popular demands, especially in matters of finance. Reading over a short while ago for the second time that very remarkable life of Mr. Gladstone, written by the noble Viscount opposite, I came across the following passag&#x2014;
<quote>"No Chancellor of the Exchequer" ['Mr. Gladstone said]" is worth his salt who makes his own popularity either his first consideration or any consideration at all in administering public affairs:"</quote>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0380"/>
<col>751</col>
Those were the opinions held by one of the greatest State financiers whom this country has ever produced, at whose feet I sat in my youth, and the adoption of whose financial principles led, I may remark incidentally, to the rescue of Egypt from a state of bankruptcy. Can it be maintained for one moment that the present Chancellor of the Exchequer has acted in accordance with this very sound principle? To the outside public it would certainly appear that the present Government, of which the Chancellor of the Exchequer is one of the most important members, have given a more prominent place to the popularity than to the soundness of their financial proposals. Concession after concession has been made&#x2014;each popular, each costly, and each, as it appears to me, based on the temporary Parliamentary or electoral necessities of the moment rather than on a statesmanlike appreciation of the permanent interests of the country. The last measure is that of payment of Members of Parliament, as to which Mr. Gladstone once said that&#x2014;
<quote>"of all the changes that may in the course of generations be made in the constitution of this country, he trusted that the very last and latest will be the payment of Members of Parliament."</quote>
My Lords, I am waiting with some anxiety to know whether this vitally important change, which is more important in its political than in its financial aspects, will be regarded as a measure wholly within the competence of the House of Commons, and will thus be abstracted from the cognisance of your Lordships' House. If the latter proceeding is adopted, it appears to me that a more flagrant instance of "tacking" could scarcely be conceived. One is tempted to ask oneself how long will this last&#x2014;<i>Quousque tandem?</i> Will a moment ever arrive when His Majesty's Government will realise that there are other considerations more important than the fleeting popularity of the moment? Throughout the whole of the proceedings of the Government I see no indication whatever of the fundamental truth that that redoubtable, I believe well-intentioned but often misguided giant, Democracy, cannot safely be governed by yielding at the first onslaught to all its wishes and caprices, but that unless disaster is to ensue it must be guided, and at times even saved from the consequences of its own rashness. And yet, in spite of these extreme concessions to democratic sentiment, when we, believing that the people are often much more sensible than their representatives&#x2014;as has been shown
<col>752</col>
to be the case in Australia&#x2014;ask that they should really be able to express their opinions by means of the Referendum, the Government, with an inconsistency which cannot be explained away, are horrified at so democratic a measure.<lb/>
Let me now, in illustration of the use which may be made of the financial control heretofore exercised by this House, call to your Lordships' recollection what occurred in connection with the Old Age Pensions Act. It was that Act, passed in 1908, which necessarily led to the Budget of 1909, and which has brought about the whole of the present Constitutional crisis. Your Lordships may remember that I was not one of those who thought that the Budget of 1909 should have been rejected. I did not think that that was the best way to safeguard the important Conservative and moderate interests, of which your Lordships are now, in reality, the only representatives in this country. But I did think that, looking exclusively to the merits of the case, there were far stronger reasons for exercising the authority of your Lordships' House as regards the legislation of 1908. Then was the time to make an effective protest; in 1909 it was too late. When once the spendthrift legislation of 1908 was passed the money had to be provided somehow, and the production of a Budget in 1909 which would bring about a collision between the two Houses of Parliament was inevitable. There is no subject, however, on which there has been a greater amount of misrepresentation of the views entertained in this House than on this question of Old Age Pensions. It has been stated on every platform in the country that your Lordships were opposed to granting Old Age Pensions. No statement could be more false. What we objected to was taking liabilities without any real knowledge of their extent, and without any idea of how they were to be met when they fell due.<lb/>
Moreover, we objected to passing a hasty, ill-considered measure, and we thought that if more time had been given for reflection a much more thorough and beneficial scheme could be worked out by adopting the principle of contributory payments. My Lords, will any impartial man, who is not carried away by party spirit, now have the assurance to say that we were not quite right? I venture to say that we have been right on every point. The original estimate of the cost of Old Age Pensions was
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0381"/>
<col>753</col>
6 millions. My noble friend, Lord Curzon, the other day said, if I remember rightly, that it would cost 10 millions. I ventured to correct him and said 12. My Lords, I was wrong; I ought to have said 13 millions. But we now never think in less than seven figures, and the mere addition of a million appears to be considered a matter of but trifling importance. Moreover, we were told two years ago that it was quite impossible to prepare a scheme on a contributory basis; yet what has now happened? Only two years have elapsed, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, after paying a hurried visit to Germany, comes forward with a plan which, so far as its general principle is concerned, has met with universal acceptance, and which ratifies the very principle which was scornfully rejected but a short time ago.<lb/>
There is one further point in connection with this measure to which I should like to draw attention. An Amendment was moved by myself in your Lordships' House and carried by a large majority, not in any way hostile to the principle of Old Age Pensions, but merely providing that the scheme introduced in 1908 should lapse in a few years, and thus enable a more thorough plan, based on a contributory principle, to be worked out. If that Amendment had been accepted by
the. House of Commons the result would have been that in course of time a far better scheme than that which now exists would have been created, and that the wholly gratuitous principle would have gradually disappeared without any harm being done to the actual holders of pensions. I cannot help thinking that future Chancellors of the Exchequer will have reason to regret that that Amendment was not passed into law. My Lords, this Amendment was not rejected because any solid arguments were produced against it. Many of your Lordships may remember the debate which took place in this House; they may remember the halting defence which was made by noble Lords opposite of the proposals of the present Government; they may remember that the ominous silence of some of the most distinguished of noble Lords opposite certainly engendered the suspicion that some members of the present Government were not very enthusiastic supporters of the policy of their colleagues. But though, as I venture to think, worsted in argument, our proposal was rejected merely because it emanated from the House of Lords. I venture to say that although
<col>754</col>
we were overborne on this point, the mere fact that criticisms of the nature of those to which I now allude were made in this House shows that the financial control of the House of Lords may at times be highly beneficial to the public interests. It is now, however, to be swept away, and what is it proposed to put in its place? Absolutely nothing. Experience has taught us to what an extent the present Government can be considered as efficient guardians of the public purse, and as to the control of the House of Commons it is quite clear that it is not only absolutely illusory, but that that body, whatever may be its other merits, will always encourage rather than check reckless expenditure. So far as I know, the only criticisms that have been made by the leading Radicals of that House have been directed against that branch of the national expenditure which, however regrettable, is absolutely necessary in order to ensure our existence as an independent nation&#x2014;I mean naval and military expenditure.<lb/>
For these reasons, my Lords, as I said at the commencement of my remarks, I am unwilling to allow this Bill to be read a second time without entering an earnest protest against the destruction of the only feeble barrier which now exists to check the growth of the public burthens. And, my Lords, in doing so, let me add that I feel assured that a day of reckoning will come. Matters will, I do not doubt, go fairly well as long as times are prosperous and no great political or commercial crisis ensues. But if ever this country is engaged in war, it will be found than as the result of the financial policy of the present Government there will be no fiscal reserve on which to fall back, and that we shall have to pay for war expenditure, not, as heretofore, largely out of revenue, but entirely out of borrowed money, which, in view of the great depreciation of the national credit which has taken place, we shall have to raise at a ruinous rate of interest. Then, my Lords, I think sober-minded people will begin to reflect that a great error was made in bestowing unrestricted financial power upon a Single Chamber and upon a Government which must owe its existence to the extent to which it will be able to gratify the extravagance of which that Chamber is certain to approve.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01297"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to give a silent vote, if a vote be required at all, upon this notable Bill. When questions
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0382"/>
<col>755</col>
of sheer or mere Party politics are before the House I retain the view I have always expressed that the less the Bishops take part in the clash of arms upon such topics the better. This is not such an occasion. A great change in the Constitutional relations of the two Houses of Legislature is proposed, a change&#x2014;and this is the point I want to make&#x2014;which has already virtually received the approval, in very many of its parts, of both sides in polities. I can neither reduce such a proposal to the petty dimensions of some Party strife, nor can I feel that the Bishops, who, after all, are the oldest part of the Legislature of the kingdom, ought to allow it to pass without some word or comment.<lb/>
I desire to draw a contrast between the picture of facts as they were two years ago and the picture of facts as they are to-day. Two years ago the country rang with denunciations of the House of Lords. Some of them were so grossly exaggerated as to be merely travesties or burlesques of the facts. Others, whether highly coloured or not, were so far intended to be honest and accurate that they were, at all events, deserving of respect and attention, and they gave the orators' view of the situation. Such descriptions were agreed in this. All depicted, and, with something more than a measure of truth, all were directed to denunciations of a house purely hereditary, a House that claimed the right to reject Money Bills as well as others, and a House which claimed unlimited power in regard to all legislation other than Money Bills. That picture lent itself well to lurid street hoardings, and to vociferous oratory, and people will long remember the period of those denunciations and their sequel. That picture does explain&#x2014;I am prepared, for the sake of argument, to say it even justifies&#x2014;the claim that was then put forward, the need that was then expressed of root and branch legislation to restrain, to cripple a body of men who, simply as hereditary legislators, were so acting. Many members of this House on the Government Benches made speeches to that effect.<lb/>
Turn to the actual facts to-day, painted as accurately, as cold-bloodedly, as you can. The House of Lords, whether rightly or wrongly&#x2014;that is not my point at all&#x2014;has deliberately divested itself of no small part of its claims and attributes. If it has its way, if its Resolutions are made effective, it will no longer exercise the power of rejecting Money Bills. That is gone, and
<col>756</col>
gone by its own act. With regard to other legislation, it has cut down, I will not say abandoned but largely cut down&#x2014;we may even say that it has actually abandoned&#x2014;its claim finally to reject Bills by its own vote alone. It makes definite and far-reaching, and surely conciliatory, proposals, whether they are wise or unwise is no matter, for destroying, either by Joint Sessions or the Referendum, the powers it has hitherto used of free and unrestrained rejection of legislation of an ordinary kind. But above all it has declared, not by Resolution, but by a Bill read unanimously a second time, that it will, if it has its way, be no longer the mere hereditary House which was denounced, but will, in its largest part, consist of members brought in by election or nomination from outside. Right or wrong, wise or unwise, these proposals at present hold the field, and they are the handiwork of the House itself.<lb/>
The two pictures are so widely different that it might be said that they have very little in common, and yet, by a judicious use of generalities, the declamatory speeches, the vituperative articles, sometimes even the caricatures which did duty two years ago, are made to do duty still, and are applied to conditions almost as different as can be imagined from those for which they were originally compiled or given forth. That applies in some degree even to speeches in Parliament, even to speeches in this House. Nothing less like a declamatory harangue could be imagined than the calm and reasoned and considerate speech of the noble Viscount who spoke yesterday on behalf of His Majesty's Government; but his main argument seemed to me to be one which might with equal effectiveness, and perhaps with more appropriateness, have been used two years ago, than it could be used now. In an opening sentence of his speech the noble Viscount, in grave tones, stated that the Bill was rendered necessary by the rejection of the Budget in 1909. I was no party to that rejection, and I am not discussing it, for good or for evil, now, but, when that incident is claimed as now necessitating this Bill, it is surely material to remember that the House itself has said that the claim to act in that particular way is now dropped or abandoned for good.<lb/>
My plea is this. We want to look at the facts with straightforward honesty and simplicity. We want to reduce the outstanding
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0383"/>
<col>757</col>
divergence to its true dimensions and to see the facts as they really are to-day. I am a poor mathematician, but I recall the rule, Reduce your fractions to their lowest terms. So reduced, does the outstanding difference between the policy to-day declared by the two Parties in the State, important as that difference may be, loom large enough to justify the chaos and the confusion with which we are threatened if no arrangement of any kind be arrived at? How does the matter stand, putting incidental and trifling parts of it on one side? The Government introduce a Bill providing, first, no rejection henceforward by the House of Lords of purely Money Bills. So says the House itself. It has gone the whole length to meet you in this way, and, if you will, the remedy that you suggest is already granted. The Government Bill next proposes the curtailment of the power of rejecting other Bills. The House has gone far to meet that too. I am not discussing the methods of the proposed <i>via salutis,</i> whether by Joint Sessions, the Referendum, or the rest; but, at all events, it is prepared to go a very long way in that direction. And, most important of all, though that is not in the Bill, is the point that the House to be dealt with in the future will no longer be the hereditary body which has been so lustily bethumped in the past, but it will be a different body, to which the old speeches will, surely, be quite inapplicable.<lb/>
Then notice that all the changed conditions in the controversy, all these advances and concessions, if you call them so, have come from one side. The Opposition has said, "We recognise the difficulty of the situation; we recognise, if you will, the inequality of which complaint has been made. We propose a way to meet it." You cannot, after that, argue as if these proposals had not been made as an inherent part of the controversy which we have now to face and settle. Of course, there remain the points of possible, of, I dare say, probable difference in large details of the Bill. We may have suggestions&#x2014;they were almost foreshadowed last night&#x2014;of modifications, about which I know nothing. They seem to relate to what might be called "the wholesaleness" of some of the Bill's provisions. About that I have no knowledge whatever, but surely these must be matters which are capable of negotiation, of arrangement, add of mutual concession.<lb/>
I venture, I hope not wrongly, to draw
<col>758</col>
good augury in that direction from the notable speech of Lord Morley, to which I have already referred. Let the take two examples of what I mean&#x2014;matters in that speech which seem to me to offer good hope that this question is at least capable of a solution other than that of mere force and strife. The noble Viscount quoted with care and in detail the speech made by the then Leader of the House, Lord Crewe, in November, 1909, with regard to the difficulties under which the Front Bench of the Liberal Party were placed in this House. But that speech was made, and was presumably endorsed by the noble Viscount in the same sense, not as complaining of the position of those Peers when their Government is in office, but when they are in Opposition. Here are the words&#x2014;
<quote>"We retired into exile for several years; and in fifteen years of Opposition I can say with all honesty that I cannot recall a single case when or my noble friends&#x2026;did the slightest good to any human being by attendance in the House cannot recall a case when anything we said here had the slightest effect. I cannot recall a case when any Amendment of substance to any of the Bills of the then Government, were modified at our instance."</quote>
Your Lordships will note that this is a complaint, not of the difficulty of the position of noble Lords on the Liberal side when their Government is in office, but of their difficulty when they are in Opposition. It may be a serious grievance that no Amendment of substance to any Government Bill was carried at their instance, but I should have thought that, real as that grievance may be for an Opposition, it is not peculiar to the House of Lords. I should imagine that the minority on the Opposition Benches in the House of Commons ordinarily, at all events, find some little difficulty in carrying Amendments of substance as against a Government measure. But, if it be, as the noble Viscount feels and as Lord Crewe felt, a grievance that such Amendments of substance were not readily accepted from the Opposition in this House, it is impossible to suppose that that grievance will be allowed to recur now. There was then a very small Opposition, there is now a very large Opposition, and if it was a grievance that; noble Lords on the Opposition Benches were unable to obtain a fair and successful hearing for Amendments which they proposed to a Government Bill, we have the noble Viscount's virtual responsibility for feeling that such a grievance would not, presumably be allowed to be repeated under other circumstances now.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0384"/>
<col>759</col>
Then the noble Viscount referred to the very important incident of 1869, the Irish Church negotiations, his point being that this House has known on great occasions how to yield, when yielding was for the public good and for the nation's gain. I hold in my hand the actual half sheets upon which Mr. Gladstone and Lord Cairns respectively made the annotations as to what they thought was possible by way of negotiation with a view to a settlement of that controversy. I have retained these half sheets, in the handwriting of those notable men, as an interesting record of a great Parliamentary incident, but I have kept them, too, as evidence of the willingness and power of a great Prime Minister&#x2014;one of the greatest Prime Ministers in English history&#x2014;in the very moment of his triumph, to deal in a reasonable and conciliatory spirit with conscientious opponents who desired amendment in his Bill rather than plunge the country into fresh and disastrous strife. Have we not ground for saying it is of good augury that the noble Viscount should refer so markedly to that particular incident in connection with the perplexities of to-day? What I am trying to urge now is that honesty of statement does require at this juncture the admission that the field of controversy has been surprisingly narrowed. The acceptance of the opponents' position has been most remarkable, at least on one side of the House. Is it out of place, is it presumptuous, that a man who sits in this House with no hereditary qualifications and certainly with no outstanding personal claim, but who sits here upon the oldest tenure of any member of the House, yes, and sits here with his friends on the Episcopal Benches in order to further what is true and peaceable and for the common good, should make an appeal to both sides at this moment of great Constitutional difficulty? Hitherto, so far as I can see, all concession in this controversy has emanated from one side. Yes; so far. Now the opportunity has come, or will come, for that fair play which we have heard so often asked for. It is certainly not least with His Majesty's Government that the power of using or missing that opportunity will rest.</membercontribution></p>

Let me recall as uncontroversially as I can the history of this Bill. In the year 1909 we found ourselves driven to break up a great majority after a period of four years of Parliamentary life. Try, my Lords, to put yourselves in our position. Put yourselves in the position of a Liberal who really did care for the measures which were before this House, but did not pass through this House from 1906 down to 1909. We had been practically out of office for twenty years. We had a crop of measures which commended themselves to our own convictions as being essential for the welfare of the country. You may have differed from us, but those were the opinions which we entertained. I will not dwell upon the subject unduly, but your Lordships all
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0385"/>
<col>761</col>
know what happened to the three or four Bills the last of which was the Finance Bill in the year 1909. We were frustrated and humiliated, and my own feeling at the time was that if this kind of thing went on Parliamentary labour had no further attractions for me at all. It meant that after great labour and toil in preparing complicated and difficult measures, after great exhaustion in the House of Commons, sitting sometimes right through the year, depriving ourselves of holidays, sitting sometimes all night, we found we had no chance if there was any real opposition on the part of certain strong vested interests of getting our measures through this House. It breaks the hearts of reformers to be defeated and broken at every point and unable to carry anything they desire to see added to the Statute-book. We were driven to the country.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, last night said that we had not given the Opposition the opportunity of preparing their alternative. Why, it was they who were the authors of the Dissolution of January, 1910. Had they not themselves prepared the alternative policy which they were going to propound to the country
for the reform of the House of Lords when they themselves prepared the Dissolution which took place? My Lords, they had that opportunity; they propounded no alternative policy then. Then in the spring of 1910 Lord Rosebery brought forward his Resolutions, which I quite agree were a distinct advance. But the criticism I made at the time was this&#x2014;you could not tell from those Resolutions what was to be the structure of the new House of Lords which was adumbrated. You did not know the crucial point&#x2014;namely, what was to be the relative strength of Liberals and Conservatives in the reformed House of Lords. Then came the Conference. That seems to be an incident altogether forgotten. The Conference failed because the leaders on both sides were unable to come to terms. They avowed their desire but were unable to come to terms and the Conference therefore broke up.<lb/>
What was the position that left us in? Supposing we had begun again to negotiate, what was the use? We had just seen the impossibility of arriving at a conclusion by negotiation and agreement. The General Election of January, 1910, was treated as having no significance at all. Is it really true that a General Election is to mean everything
<col>762</col>
when the Conservative Party wins and to mean nothing when the Liberal Party wins? We were driven to another election at the end of 1910, and then again the country repeated, one might say <i>totidem verbis,</i> or <i>totidem suffragiis</i> at all events, the verdict which they had before given and which had been inoperative and disregarded and spurned by Mr. Balfour as having no significance or importance. Here we are now five months after that election. If ever there was a direction given by a vote of the community to a Government which appealed to them, a direction was given to bring in the Bill which is now before your Lordships. It was lying in black and white available for everybody to criticise and had been so for six months. It was made the main and crucial point&#x2014;and no election ever turns on one point alone&#x2014;at the General Election by both sides, and now we are only asking your Lordships to carry out that which you have always professed your readiness to do, the opinion expressed by the people directly at the General Election. I am sure your Lordships will not think I am disrespectful when I say that this will be a test of the sincerity&#x2014;which I do not question&#x2014;of those declarations is it to be said that after this has happened your Lordships will defy the expression of opinion which has been faithfully rendered by the House of Commons on the direct instruction of the people at large?<lb/>
Let me turn to another side of this subject and point out that notwithstanding that this stage of the controversy is really concluded by the circumstances to which I have referred, yet that does not preclude the possibility of agreement upon the ulterior problems concerning this subject. There are hopeful signs that there may be matter for consent hereafter. Not only is the Bill of the noble Marquess a very great advance, but, in the concluding passages in the speech he made to the House, just before it gave a Second Reading to that Bill, he used some very significant language. He conveyed that he would not attach any very excessive importance to the question of numbers of either side, Liberal or Conservative, when the composition of the new House of Lords was being considered. I must not put too strict or too extensive an interpretation upon that language, but from our point of view it is a very hopeful sign. The real point upon that part of the speech is this, Will the Conservative Party give us as good an
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0386"/>
<col>763</col>
opportunity as they themselves have of passing measures through the reconstructed House of Lords? Will they equalise between the two Parties the restraint that is hereafter to be possessed by the reconstructed House of Lords? Let there be a Second Chamber that is fair to all Parties and it may well be that then some method of procedure which involves less delay and which is more expeditious than that proposed by the present Bill may be found to commend itself to all Parties. Of this I am sure, that it is only by recognising the real needs of equality and fair play between the two Parties that there will be any possibility of that result. If that real equality is given it may well be that fresh relations may hereafter, by common consent, be established.<lb/>
The noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, spoke last night as if his chief dread of this Bill was that it might be used to further a Home Rule Bill. I do not wish the House to be under misapprehension. They know the policy of the Government involves Home Rule for Ireland; not only so, but I venture to say that when that subject comes forward we shall find a very different tone and temper towards it from the country at large and from the Conservative Party than prevailed in the unhappy efforts which we have made before. The younger members of the Conservative Party are largely in favour of some measure which may fairly be called Home Rule, and some of the more experienced and leading members of the Party are so too, and the Press and many Conservative influences in quite recent times have shown that they are not prepared to offer the obstinate resistance that has been offered in the past to a measure of this kind. Our people are beginning to see that there are very vital causes why we should endeavour to deal with this question in a way satisfactory to Ireland. There are the Imperial reasons that we may not have this as a constant source of weakness and reproach; there are the Irish reasons why we should apply that principle of reconciliation which has been so successful in South Africa and everywhere else all over the British Dominions to Ireland as well; and there are the Parliamentary reasons, visible to anybody who chooses to consider the present congestion of business of the House of Commons and the urgent need for the reform of that House in that respect. For my part, I should think that Parliamentary reform would be of comparatively
<col>764</col>
little value if it did not enable us to handle and deal with a subject of that kind in a way which for five-and-twenty years I have desired myself to see it settled. I should greatly regret if the spirit which the most rev. Primate indicated were absent from this House either now or at any time, but I do feel it would be encouraging an illusion if I said that His Majesty's Government could depart from this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01301"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that no noble Lord on this side listens to the Lord Chancellor without a feeling of respect. That respect arises from the fact that we know that he is a really honest Radical. In this House no one is cried down for any unpopular opinions he may happen to hold, and though there be a large majority on this side of the House, the noble and learned Lord knows well, and the noble Viscount has expressed it to-night, that this House always accords a fair hearing to any member of it, whatever his opinions and in whatever part of the House he may sit. But I must say that I was rather disappointed at the first words of the Lord Chancellor, although I think he partly withdrew them afterwards. The speech of the most rev. Primate enlarged upon the necessity of conciliation, and in it the most rev. Primate pointed out, what is perfectly true, that all the concessions and all the offers so far had come from this side of the House alone. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, in the debate on the reform of this House, made a speech which, I think, was rather unfortunate in the sternness of the attitude taken up. To-night he ended his speech by saying that the Government adhered to the Bill as it is now before the House, and he added, "You cannot expect us to give up the fruits of victory." He said something of that sort. But then the noble and learned Lord proceeded to enlarge upon the sins of commission of this House. He said that you had rejected Bill after Bill which had been introduced by the Government, but I have noticed that in the country and even in this House noble Lords opposite have acknowledged how your Lordships acceded to their Bills. I myself obtained a Return a year or two ago which showed that more Bills had been passed by this House with less consideration and in a shorter time in this Parliament than in any Parliament during the last century. It is therefore hardly fair to make this charge against your Lordships. Let me take the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0387"/>
<col>765</col>
two most important Bills, next to the Budget, which were not passed by this House. Will the noble and learned Lord say that the Licensing Bill was really popular in the country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01302"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I do not know. I think it very likely that in some quarters it was unpopular, but it was a Bill that was needed for the health of the people, and it is the duty of Parliament to pass such a Bill whether it is popular or not. May I respectfully suggest that to the noble Earl?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01303"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The noble and learned Lord says that the Licensing Bill was needed for the health of the people. Is he certain that the people thought so? After all, whether it be the Referendum or any other means that you take, surely the people have a right to express their opinion. You must also remember that that Bill was not a Licensing Bill pure and simple; it had a part of a Budget tacked on. Then there was the Education Bill, on which there were prolonged negotiations between the two Houses. I do not know exactly the grounds on which they split, but I believe it was something connected with the tenure of teachers. Surely it is not fair to say, because your Lordships thought that teachers ought to be allowed a certain tenure that that is flouting the other House. Then we come to the Budget. It is always being reiterated that this House threw out the Budget. This House did nothing of the kind. What this House did was this. Believing that the principles involved in the Budget were not in favour with the country, it wished the country to decide upon that matter. The country did decide What was the result? The result of the election showed that the Parliament of 1906 did not represent the opinion of the country. It is true that noble Lords opposite came back with a majority of 100 or thereabouts, but that majority was a diminished one, and the new Parliament was entirely different in constitution and temper.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord was, I think, also a little unfortunate when he referred to the question of the reform of the House of Lords. I should like to know what the Liberal Party has ever done to assist in reforming the House of Lords. When the Committee was appointed, Lord Crewe, who was then leading the House, threw cold
<col>766</col>
water upon it in every form he could, and he dissuaded his friends from joining. I venture to say, with all respect, that the noble Earl on that occasion unconsciously did great disservice to the House. He certainly did a great disservice to the Committee, because the Committee were prevented from having the full advantage of Liberals upon it. I would appeal to Lord Courtney and one or two other Liberals who did come, whether their proposals were not received with great attention, and whether they ever sat on a Committee which in its constitution, in its methods of doing business, and in its consideration of the whole case, was more impartial or more absolutely without any regard to Party? Then the noble and learned Lord referred to the Conference of last year. I venture to say that your Lordships approach the discussion of this Bill under a great disadvantage, because you have never been informed what took place at that Conference. This House placed its rights and its liberties to a great extent in the hands of that Conference, and I think it has been a great mistake in the public interest that we have never known from that day to this what took place there. I am sure that this secrecy was not owing to the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne; nor, I dare say, was it due to Lord Crewe; but they bound themselves to secrecy with regard to their proceedings because they thought that if the proceedings at such a Conference were revealed, such Conferences would become impossible in the future. But the eight gentlemen who took part in it were appointed by Parliament, and surely their colleagues in Parliament had a right to know what occurred. I do not say that there should have been a verbatim report, but surely there ought to have been some official report of what Motions were made and so on, that we might have been in a better position to discuss this matter.<lb/>
With regard to the Election of 1910, I do not think the circumstances reflect very great credit on His Majesty's Government. They came from the Conference and dissolved in a great hurry in order, for some reason best known to themselves, to obtain a decision on an old and practically dead register. But whatever the reason, I think that if they had really wished to obtain the verdict of the country they would not have endeavoured to snatch the verdict in the way they did upon a register which was almost at its end. The noble and learned
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0388"/>
<col>767</col>
Lord said that the noble Marquess had made some remark which had given him hope. The noble Marquess, I believe, said that he was not very particular about the exact numbers of Peers. I believe he said that in the thoroughly impartial and honest spirit which always characterises his speeches. If it was merely a matter of numbers I do not think there would have been any difficulty. At all events, I cannot believe there would have been any in arriving at an arrangement. But what did the noble and learned Lord and the Government do with regard to that matter? They declined to take any part whatsoever in putting forward that Bill. They say that they must have in this House a balance which is fair to all Parties. I am at a loss to understand what this equality of opportunity and so on means. Wherever you have an Assembly which is made up of men who are not obliged to have recourse to electors, their attitude is one which it is much more difficult to calculate upon than the attitude of those who are elected. It is a well known fact that a great many men who at one time sat on that side of the House have come across to this side. Do noble Lords mean that the House must be divided into two equal parties, whatever may be the principles of the measures put forward? So far as I understand it, that is what their words mean. Do noble Lords mean that whenever a measure is brought in such as the late Mr. Gladstone's Home Rule Bill and noble Lords cross the floor of the House that the balance of the House is then to be redressed by some automatic process? I will not follow the noble and learned Lord into what he said about Home Rule, but it is evident that one of the main reasons for putting forward this Bill is to drive Home Rule through Parliament. Your Lordships are recognised, at all events by the Irish, to be the main obstacle to the passing of such a measure. I think that on such a Constitutional measure as that of Home Rule the people ought always to have something to say about it.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, in his introduction of the Parliament Bill, said that on examination it would be found not to be so revolutionary as we supposed. I cannot agree with the most rev. Primate that there was a great deal of conciliation in Lord Morley's speech, for the noble Viscount said clearly and distinctly&#x2014;he has said it on a previous occasion&#x2014;that, whether reformed or unreformed, the House of Lords
<col>768</col>
must have its powers of stopping legislation taken away. I cannot conceive a greater revolution. If that is not revolution, then what is? Whether you look at this Bill from the point of view of drafting, or to the substance of it, it is without precedent. Take the Preamble. If it went upstairs to one of your Private Bill Committees three-fourths of it would be cut out at once as having nothing to do with the Bill. The Preamble runs&#x2014;
<quote>Whereas it is expedient that provision should be made for regulating the relations between the two Houses of Parliament:</quote>
<quote>And whereas it is intended to substitute for the House of Lords as it at present exists a Second Chamber constituted on a popular instead of hereditary basis, but such substitution cannot be immediately brought into operation:</quote>
Did any one ever read such a Preamble? Why, I would like to know, were words put into the Preamble of the Bill when they have nothing whatsoever to do with its contents? We were told&#x2014;I do not know whether it is correct or not, but it certainly was currently reported&#x2014;that those paragraphs were put in to conciliate the scruples of the moderate men. If that is so, it was a work of supererogation, because though those men talk a great deal, when it comes to action they toe the line and vote with the most extreme men in the Party. What, for instance, has become of the Liberal Imperialists? On that point, perhaps, the noble Earl on the Cross Benches could give us some very interesting information were he so disposed. A Chamber such as that which appears in this Bill is not to be found in any country which is possessed of representative institutions. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, said that they had not invented this. All I can say is that no one ever saw such a Chamber as you propose.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, said that such powers as it is proposed to leave to this House would rest no longer on the disputed survival of an antiquated right but on the firmly defined creation of a modern Statute. But how long is that Statute likely to last? Is the authority of that Statute any greater than the authority of those principles on which our Constitution is established? What is to prevent a noble Lord three or four years hence coming here and saving that we have used these powers of delay in an unwise and improper manner and introducing a further Bill to take away the remaining powers of the House? This Bill is really founded on the necessities of the Government, who have to depend for
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0389"/>
<col>769</col>
their existence upon the Nationalist vote. It is through the Irish and also the Welsh and Labour Members that Ministers live and move and have their being. Mr. John Redmond and his satellites have reminded the Government of that in language the reverse of complimentary, but they have always taken it lying down. The noble Viscount seemed surprised at our cheering when he referred to his Party being described as a log-rolling coalition; but what else is it? Let me quote to him his own words; they describe this coalition so well that it leaves nothing to be desired&#x2014;
<quote>"The more numerous the reasons that bring a great body of men together, the more obvious it is that their concentrating on one particular point shows the depth of the feeling that they have for their own interests and for the interests of the other groups that work with them."</quote>
Certainly, they have the very greatest regard for their own interests, and they promote them quite independently of the general good of the country. With regard to their caring for the interests of the other groups, I am not quite sure of that. I have seen disputes between them as to which was to come first, and I have seen arrangements made that one was to come first and the other was to follow immediately afterwards. If that is not log-rolling, pray what is? The Party in power is formed of several Parties, each having a particular interest of its own and putting that interest forward quite irrespective of the general public advantage. As for concentrating on one point, they have all concentrated on this House because, weak Second Chamber as it is, it is the only obstacle which intervenes between them and the attainment of their wishes.<lb/>
It is said that this House is partisan, and that there must be equality of chances. But how do you obtain this equality of chances? By loading the dice and
upsetting the Constitution? There is no surer way of getting rid of an enemy than by throttling him, and that is exactly what this Bill proposes to do to this House. We are told that if we would only pass this Bill we should repair and render stable the Constitution, we should bring about tranquillity, and very probably conduce to co-operation. But what substance is there in those fine words? How is it proposed to carry these things out? Is the Constitution likely to be more stable when the Government have forced down the throats of this House a Bill which offends the
<col>770</col>
opinions of at least half of the people? Is tranquillity or co-operation likely to be secured by an act not of statesmanship but of violence? This Bill is a violent Bill. No other word will describe it. You may pass the Bill now, but if you do you cannot help creating a burning sense of wrong and injustice that will rankle in the minds of your political opponents and I believe in the minds of at least half the people of this country, and you will introduce a new and a bitter spirit into politics. How that will bring about better relations between the two Parties I for one fail to understand. It would be much better for the Government to at once abolish the Second Chamber, to act straightforwardly and do what they mean. Just see what the position is. The Government say that they are opposed to the hereditary principle, but that they are not going to touch it, at all events for the present&#x2014;it may be that they consider that it may be useful to them in a variety of ways hereafter. With regard to a Second Chamber they say, "We are in favour of a Second Chamber, but at the smile time by this Bill we will take away all effectual power from the Second Chamber." It is foolish to attempt to disguise that this Bill will take away all effectual powers from the Second Chamber.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01304"><member>LORD ILKESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened to the debate which took place on the Bill introduced by the noble Marquess, and I think there was one feature of it which must have struck every member of this House. In spite of the ability and the eloquence with which the noble Marquess introduced the Reconstitution Bill, in spite of many great and vigorous speeches, that debate was unreal from beginning to end. It lacked real substance and real earnestness, and all through it there was the flavour and the thought of this Bill now before us and the discussion to follow. In those circumstances it is very natural that that debate should have been unreal in its character and tone. There is, however, a marked contrast in the debate which is now proceeding. This debate has what the other debate lacked&#x2014;a certain amount of earnestness, nay, almost a grim earnestness, in the way in which it is being carried out and the way the Bill has been received and supported and denounced. I think that is very natural.<lb/>
Although I am a very new member of this House and one who is bound to look upon
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0390"/>
<col>771</col>
this Bill more from the point of view of an old politician than as a member of the House of Lords, yet I am bound to admit that I have the greatest sympathy with noble Lords who denounce this measure as an invasion of their rights and a revolutionary proposal. It is natural. There is as much human nature in this House as elsewhere, and I never knew anybody yet who had to face the possibility of losing his rights and privileges who did not denounce the proposer and emphatically object. But while that is so, I am very much astonished at the way
in which this Bill has been received by noble Lords opposite. I would specially refer to the speech of the noble Viscount who followed the Leader of the House. He began his speech with all that declamatory eloquence which we used to listen to and admire so much in the House of Commons. I had the pleasure of sitting opposite to the noble Viscount for many years in the other House and listening to language, possibly a little stronger, a little more forcible, but of the same class as the language he used yesterday. That language was in denunciation of this Bill and its proposer in this House, Lord Morley. It began in the superlative degree, and ended very lowly in the positive. It was very strong in the beginning, but the conclusion of that speech was one that one could never have anticipated from the manner in which he denounced the Bill in the beginning. He reminded me, when he said that neither he nor his friends proposed to object to the Second Reading of this revolutionary measure, very much of Pistol who, in that discussion he had with Fluellen, said this: "By this leek, I will most horribly revenge: I eat and eat, I swear." The noble Viscount's speech concluded with that threat of revenge, and, like Pistol, although practically eating the leek on this occasion, he said that in the future he and his friends would take a proper and adequate revenge for the indignity forced upon them now. I hope that that spirit, as time goes on, will wear down and become gentle, and that this House will endeavour to co-operate with those sitting on this side in bringing about through this a lasting peace, and an end to our troubles and our grievances.<lb/>
This Bill, described in such strong terms by some of the speakers, is naturally open to attack, because I am honestly bound to confess that I regard it as the beginning of the end of the old system. The old
<col>772</col>
system must pass away and give place to influences and methods that are new, but I think this departure from the old system which is hurrying on the advent of the new system is due largely to the action of this House in using its powers unwisely during the last few years. Ever since that great trouble that we had in 1886 there has been growing up in this House in its relations to the other House a spirit of arrogant resistance which has led us to the present position. Time after time we have had exhibitions of that, and none more striking or more serious than those which have occurred during the last few years. I believe that a wiser and more careful use of the powers of this House might have kept unchanged the absolute Veto for many years longer. Unfortunately that course has not been pursued, and we find ourselves in the position in which we are now joined in an issue that must be fought to the end. When once begun, it must be finished. It has been going on ever since 1886, when the balance of Parties in this House was so greatly changed by the action of the Liberal Party in advocating Home Rule. That stripped the Benches on this side, filled up the Cross Benches, and flooded the Opposite Benches with members who had up to that time been followers of the Liberal Party. The moment that great change took place the attitude of this House, as was natural, inevitably became altered in relation to the House of Commons. But numbers were mistaken for strength, and gradually, year by year, this House grew more arrogant in its relations to the elected House, more determined to exercise to the full its powers of absolute Veto against legislation that it did not like. As I say, it was almost inevitable that numbers should be mistaken for strength, and for years this House has revelled in its power of checking and thwarting Liberal legislation.<lb/>
Yet all the time that this was going on in this Chamber, there was growing up outside a stronger and a more organised democracy than this country has ever seen. During those years under a Liberal Government measures were passed winch took into every small village in the country, as well as into every great city a breath of democracy illustrated by the establishment of parish councils, urban district councils, and municipalities, until the people by their daily life and in every function from day to day became impregnated with the right and just notion that the proper persons to
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0391"/>
<col>773</col>
look after their interests were persons elected by themselves, representatives of the great democracy. That democratic spirit has spread throughout the length and breadth of the land, and since 1886 has become so potent that this country is no longer what it was in the olden times, but is a great democracy governed by freely elected representatives in every county, in every village, and every borough. But, as I say, while the movement outside these walls was going in that direction, inside these walls the attitude of a privileged class, not elected, and not representative, was more than ever strongly opposed to legislation sent up to them in the name of the elected representatives of the people. You cannot have two opposing currents of thought more likely to bring about a clash and a conflict than those which were going on at the same time&#x2014;one inside this Chamber, the other outside in the country at large. And the people, trained in this way, naturally more and more looked to the elected Chamber to be the master of their destiny. Once you have a question in dispute repeated from time to time between a Chamber of non-elected Peers and a Chamber elected by seven and a-half millions of voters, the issue must be joined. No man who has ever read history, or who has ever thought over the progress of events, can have any doubt, when that issue is joined as between the elected representatives of a Chamber representing seven and a-half millions and a Chamber consisting of 600 men, not elected and not representative, as to that issue being in the end in favour of the people. You cannot have any other result. No other result is conceivable to those who really understand the feelings of the great democracy. And this is why we want this measure passed. We are pressing it in the interests of peace, and, I think, of goodwill between the people outside this Chamber and those who sit within.<lb/>
In his speech the other day, the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, said that we confused the House of Commons with the people. Well, I am not ashamed to meet that challenge. I take the House of Commons to be what one of the greatest authorities we ever had in this country, speaking on such a subject, described it, "the complete image of the nation." That was Burke's view of the House of Commons, and when I think of taking an opinion as to what the House of Commons is and what
<col>774</col>
its powers ought to be I am bound to prefer the authority of Burke to that of Lord Midleton. It is "the image of the nation" that is asking us now to so alter our position that it may have a way through this House, a slow and a deliberate, aye, a tardy and delayed way, for legislation passed in the other House. It is impossible for me, with my training in the House of Commons, to conceive a House resting on "the broad basis of the people's will" and elected by seven and a-half million electors remaining any longer at the mercy of a non-elected Chamber. In 1894 Mr. Gladstone, in one of his last speeches in the House of Commons, used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"It is a state of things which cannot continue."</quote>
He said that after your Lordships had mutilated and partly destroyed the Parish Councils Bill. That Bill came back to us mutilated and defaced by Amendments inserted in this House&#x2014;a Bill on which I spent forty days and forty nights in Committee in the House of Commons trying to get it into shape and get it passed in a form which I knew the villages of England wanted. That Bill came back from this House not nearly as good, according to the popular desire, as the Bill we sent up. The country does not forget those things, and when Mr. Gladstone said that that was a state of things which could not continue he spoke the words of prophecy. It cannot continue if the safety of the nation is to be considered. It is true it has lasted from then till now, but that only shows how patient the British people are. I have always said there is no animal in the world so patient as John Bull. He will do almost anything he is told. He is obedient; you can tie his hands and his feet, and he does not grumble as long as he is not hurt; but once you say to him, "You shan't do a thing" John Bull is a totally different animal. And if this House says to the people of this country," You shan't have legislation," the country will one day wake up in all the plenitude of its wrath and a revolution greater than any we contemplate will result. It is because we hate the prospects of bringing about such a condition as that that we are taking steps to prevent the obstruction of legislation which is desired by the representatives of the people.<lb/>
In this debate many things have been said in reference to the production of this Bill. Some people say it is produced simply
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0392"/>
<col>775</col>
for Party purposes, and that measures will follow which the House of Commons want to pass. It goes much deeper than that. This Bill is the result of slow evolution. It has been growing and growing in the minds of the people for many long years. It started in 1884 when your Lordships were opposed to the Franchise Bill of the Liberal Government of that time, and then it was that Mr. John Bright suggested the proposals of this Bill as the best remedy for meeting the difficulty. He proposed that a Bill passed twice by the House of Commons and twice rejected by the House of Lords should become law immediately after that, without any reference to this Chamber. Those were proposals that at the time appeared exceedingly moderate. There was no outcry in the nation against them. They were even received with complacency and some amount of praise by <i>The Times</i> and the <i>Spectator,</i> and there was no outcry as to their revolutionary character. Now, twenty-seven years after, we come with a Bill which is much more generous than the terms proposed by Mr. Bright. We do not say that a Bill that is rejected twice must of necessity become law without your Lordships' consent, but we say that a Bill should be thrice rejected by the House of Lords, and over a period of not less than two years will that Bill be under consideration before it can finally become law. Under Mr. Bright's scheme it might have happened in a single twelve months, but this Government have had no desire to hurry legislation in that way. All that they have sought by this measure is that the expressed will of the elected House of Commons should be able to make itself effective within the limit of a single Parliament, and this Bill would enable them to carry any great measure in that time under the conditions which are now prescribed. It takes away from your Lordships' House only that power of absolute Veto which I think, with all respect and submission, has been so grossly abused during the last few years.<lb/>
Some people think that if the power of absolute Veto were lost, this Chamber would cease to have functions. I do not agree for a moment. I think this Chamber would have very important and valuable functions still to perform. Every Bill would have to be considered by your Lordships. Every Bill could be amended and discussed. Every Bill you objected to could be rejected twice, over a period of
<col>776</col>
two years, and during the whole of that time the country would know what you were doing. They would read your Lordships' debates with greater interest than they do now, because they would recognise that you were a deliberative Chamber, considering measures on their merits, not with a view to their final extinction for Party ends, but with a view to their amendment and improvement for the benefit of the nation. By the use of those powers wisely exercised strength and influence would be added to this House, so that your Lordships' power with regard to legislation would be greater than it has been for years past&#x2014;not greater in the destructive direction, but towards the construction of better and more adequate legislation. It is that which, after all, ought to be the end and aim of everybody assembled to legislate for a nation&#x2014;to make the construction of legislation as good and as perfect as human ability can devise.<lb/>
People outside say&#x2014;and I think I have heard an echo of that sentiment even in this House&#x2014;that under this Bill we should have hasty and ill-considered legislation. I would ask your Lordships to think for a moment how impossible that would be. Every Bill and every proposal would be discussed in the House of Commons during the three Readings, the Committee stage, and possibly the Report stage, before it came to your Lordships' House for its first consideration. The whole country would know all about its details; it would read the debates, and morning and evening be regaled in the newspapers with articles <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> on the subject of the measure, and that would extend probably over three or four months of the sittings of the House of Commons. Then the measure would have its First Reading in your Lordships' House. It might possibly pass a Second Reading. If not, there would be a thoroughly adequate debate, the whole nation would be apprised of the grounds upon which you objected to the particular Bill under discussion; and if it passed the Second Reading, your Lordships would amend and alter it in Committee in such a way that it might be more useful to the people and more consonant with the general spirit of the constituencies. All that would go on probably for some five or six months during which the country would be occupied with the Bill. In case it were rejected what would happen? In the next Session of Parliament the Bill would go through the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0393"/>
<col>777</col>
same process. If it were a Bill desired by the people there would be meetings in every constituency; every one of the 669 Members of Parliament would be discussing it with his constituents; every great organ of public opinion in the metropolis and in all the towns and villages throughout the country would have articles on it, and if the Bill were not popular mass meetings of the people outside would very soon tell the House of Commons that they did not want the Bill, and no Government would dare to go on with it. If your criticisms were sound, the Bill would be dead after it had once been rejected by your Lordships' 
House. If, on the other hand, popular opinion stuck to the measure and desired its being passed into law, then, after the second rejection by your Lordships and after two years from the introduction of that Bill, then and then only would the Bill become law. There is no danger. None whatever. There is not a tittle of danger of hasty or ill-considered legislation.<lb/>
The noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, in speaking of this Bill the other day&#x2014;and I always have the greatest respect and regard for anything that falls from the Leader of the Opposition in this House&#x2014;said that the terms proposed were humiliating and disgraceful. I thought at the moment that that was probably a slight lapse into rhetoric on the part of the noble Marquess, because I do not think those words were quite justified. It is easy to talk of humiliation. For twenty-five years some of us sitting on these benches have tasted the dregs of humiliation. We have had our measures contumeliously treated in this House. As I said before, for forty days and forty nights we sat up in the other House with the Parish Councils Bill, and we had it mutiliated and practically destroyed by your Lordships' House. We have seen other measures, suited, as we thought, to the best interests of the people, rejected by your Lordships&#x2014;for example, the Licensing Bill, and, what still more rankles in my mind, the Plural Voting Bill, which was a Bill that had no reference whatever to your Lordships' House. That was a Bill to say how the House of Commons was to be elected; how the voters were to vote for their own representatives. It was not a matter which concerned this House, but you treated it with all the indignity in your power. And then you talk to us of humiliation&#x0021; I say it is we who have suffered humiliation daring the last twenty-five years in the
<col>778</col>
House of Commons. We do not come here, however, on that account in any spirit of revenge, but I would ask noble Lords who talk of humiliation to remember that we have suffered it for a very long period.<lb/>
With regard to the terms being disgraceful, I submit that in a case like this it is well to meet your enemy at the gate. It is not for the members of the Opposition in this House to dictate terms. They cannot produce in a Bill for the reform of the House of Lords any alternative to this measure. The challenge
which has produced our Bill came from your side. That challenge was taken up, and the answer is this Bill which I hope your Lordships will read a second time. So far from the terms being disgraceful, I think they will leave to this Chamber, if it likes, great powers for public good, powers of initiating and modelling legislation, and of seeing that that legislation is directed to such ends as will conduce to the benefit of all classes of the community. If wise counsels prevail, I can conceive this Chamber growing in power and popularity and esteem, if it works under the conditions enunciated in this Bill, for it will then be able to carry out its chief function&#x2014;protect all classes of the community by judicious criticism of any proposals that may be submitted to it, and its criticism under those conditions will have a weight and authority that it has never hitherto possessed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01305"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think your Lordships are to be congratulated upon the speech to which we have just listened. It is a source of satisfaction, I am sure, to all of us to hear the noble Lord opposite, who, I think, for the first time has taken part this evening in our debates. [Several NOBLE LORDS: No, no.] I am told that is not so. I beg the noble Lord's pardon. I ought to have said that this is the first time I have had the pleasure of hearing him. I think it is also a source of satisfaction to us that one of the supporters of the Government immediately behind them should have spoken in favour of their policy. That is not a very usual proceeding in your Lordships' House. I was cudgelling my brains during the earlier part of his speech as to how it was he occupied so exceptional a position, and light did not come to me until he began to remind us of that awful act of sacrilege which your Lordships' House committed seventeen
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0394"/>
<col>779</col>
years ago in actually having the face to amend the Parish Councils Bill for which the noble Lord himself was so largely responsible. Little did their Lordships of those days think of the dreadful Nemesis which would await them seventeen years afterwards, or that they would bring upon the heads of their successors the unholy wrath of the noble Lord. I am afraid I do not remember what the Amendments were which were inserted in that Bill, and I am quite sure I have never heard those provisions called in question in any part of the United Kingdom since that day. Indeed we hear very little about the Act at all. I doubt whether it deserves the feelings of remorse and indignation which the noble Lord has expended upon it, for from that day to this I do not believe the Parish Councils Act has been the slightest use to any community throughout the length and breadth of this country. But passing that by, I do think that the noble Lord's speech affords a great contrast, and a pleasing contrast, to the speech which was delivered by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack.<lb/>
What has been the most striking and dramatic circumstance of this afternoon's proceedings? There has been a most dignified, and, may I say, a most eloquent appeal delivered in moving language by the most rev. Primate. He spoke from the elevated position which his office and his own personal character give him in your Lordships' House. He made a solemn appeal to both sides to approach this subject in a spirit of moderation. He was followed by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, the head of the Judiciary of this country, and one bound, one would think, to take a constitutional and non-partisan view of almost any subject submitted to him. Did he clasp the hand which was held out to him by the Archbishop? Did he advance a single step to meet him? Did he, in those fluent,
sweet, and honeyed words which we always hear from his lips give the least hope or opening for conciliation? Not one word. He banged the door, he bolted it, he locked it. So far as he was concerned, notwithstanding his great position, notwithstanding the enormous importance of the occasion on which he was speaking, he would have nothing to do with conciliation. He left that to Archbishops and non-partisan persons of that description. He, the partisan representative of a partisan Government,
<col>780</col>
intended to have his will, his whole will, and nothing but his will. What was the reason of this extremely unconciliatory attitude of the noble and learned Lord? It was the old story. It was what he called the intolerable wrong which he and his colleagues had suffered since 1906.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01306"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: The fear of intolerable wrong in the future unless we pass this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01307"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: No doubt the noble and learned Lord had his eye on the future, but he did not say so. I do not remember whether he said it on this occasion, but it has been often said, that no Liberal Government with any self-respect would continue to hold office under such conditions as have prevailed since 1906. I confess I do not think very much of self-respect which limits public service on this account. Difficulties, of course, have to be encountered in carrying on Government. That is of the very essence of our Constitution. Difficulties do not alone exist in your Lordships' House. They are equally great in another place. Other Governments have had difficulty in passing their legislation, and for the present Government, because of opposition or obstruction of their legislation to come forward and talk about their self-respect being fatally wounded is, to my mind, an entire misconception of recent history. They think it a matter of surprise and a matter for great indignation that in regard to a certain number&#x2014;a very limited number&#x2014;of Bills your Lordships' House did resist the wishes of the majority of the House of Commons. As has been said before&#x2014;I am sure your Lordships will forgive me for repeating it&#x2014;the truth is that we are entering upon a new epoch. I believe the two noble Lords who have spoken for the Government said so this afternoon. We know the noble Viscount opposite, Lord Haldane, has said so, because he used a most admirable quotation from the speech of my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke.<lb/>
If, then, we are entering upon a new epoch in which new ideals are to be translated into law, is it surprising that there is a little difficulty in getting all the legislative measures which embody these profound changes passed into law? I appeal to the sense of fairness of every noble Lord who hears me, especially to the Government themselves. If you are really engaged
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0395"/>
<col>781</col>
upon establishing a new state of things, would not any Second Chamber in the world make some demur to some of the changes proposed? If half of your claim be true that you are establishing a new and better state of things, with widely extending changes, it would be not only a matter of surprise but a matter of great blame to any Second Chamber who passed all that you proposed without demur. Of course, they must have thrown out some of your Bills, and from your point of view, from the point of view of Progressives and Liberals&#x2014;or strong Radicals really, because that is what you all are, and I do not think noble Lords opposite would reject the phrase&#x2014;it is a testimony to the vigour of the measures which you propose that there should be some difficulty on the part of the Second Chamber in translating them into Acts of Parliament. Great changes have been proposed, and the House of Lords has said, "We cannot sanction all these changes until we are satisfied that the country wants them." Is that unreasonable? Could any Second Chamber have said anything else? I do not say that your Lordships' House was always perfectly right. It is possible that we on this side may have made mistakes in certain instances, but, broadly speaking, there cannot be any doubt that a Second Chamber, however constructed, whether on the hereditary or a nominative or an elective basis, would have been bound to throw out some of the more emphatically wide proposals which you desired to pass into law. But they were not refused finally. They were not refused absolutely, as the phrase is. We have always said that we are willing to act upon what the decision of the country might be upon them.<lb/>
When the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack gave us the history of the last few years as the ground for the situation in which we stand, I thought he entirely misunderstood what had really taken place. He said, "You lost the election of 1910," and then he seemed to think that the reform of the House of Lords ought instantly to follow. I do not quote his words accurately, but he went on to say, "What did we, the Liberal Party, get by the Dissolution of January, 1910? Why, we got the Budget. We got the very thing we went to the country upon." Of course you did; but the noble and learned Lord said they went to the country upon the House of Lords. They know perfectly well that we asked you to go to the country on the
<col>782</col>
Budget. It was the Budget we referred to the country, and the moment the country gave their decision we passed the Budget. Why did you not pass the other legislation which we refused? For example, the Education Bill? Because the
country did not want it. It was quite manifest that the country did not want it, and it is notorious that if noble Lords opposite were now to propose the education legislation which they tried to force through this House, it would be rejected in the House of Commons. That is why the Education Bill has not had exactly the same history as the Budget. Why has not the Licensing Bill been reintroduced? The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack does not even pretend that the country wanted it. He said with some heat that, however unpopular it was, you ought to have passed it because it was for the health of the country. That is what we call begging the question. We did not think it was for the health of the country. He has not convinced us that we were wrong in that respect, nor can he show that our masters and his&#x2014;the country&#x2014;wanted it. Therefore his whole argument on that, as far as the Licensing Bill is concerned, absolutely collapses.<lb/>
But, of course, we have to deal with the present situation. I, for one, entirely recognise that after the decision of the country at the last election we are bound to accept a great deal which we might not have been willing to accept had that election never taken place. That is perfectly true; but it is entirely consistent with everything I have said to-night, and with every speech which has been made from these Benches. Some Bill, some Parliament Bill, or some change in the relations of the two Houses of Parliament has undoubtedly been sanctioned by the country and must be carried into law. Here we come to the most amazing feature of the speech of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. He advocated on behalf of the Government the Second Reading of this Bill, but he said not one word as to any of its provisions. More than that, he was following within a few hours a most cogent speech delivered by the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, who gave a very careful, and, I thought, damaging criticism of the Bill. Your Lordships would certainly have expected that the noble and learned Lord, speaking on behalf of the Government, would have had some answer to make to some of my noble friend's
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0396"/>
<col>783</col>
criticisms. Not a word. He did not deal with a single point contained in my noble friend's speech. There were the old dry bones of the intolerable wrongs of the last six years which I have already described, but there was nothing at all upon the Bill or upon the debate. Is it not amazing that a man of the enormous ability and acuteness of the noble and learned Lord could not find a single word to say in favour of the Government Bill which he is defending? I earnestly hope that the organs of public opinion will make a special note of that fact, that the most distinguished member of His Majesty's Government in your Lordships' House, speaking upon this Bill, which is most particularly his own subject for he is always telling us about the iniquities of your Lordships' House, has not found a single argument in favour of the Bill.<lb/>
I am not going to repeat the arguments of my noble friend Lord Midleton, but perhaps the most important point was that the Bill proceeds upon the basis that the House of Commons is not merely representative of the people but is a counterpart of the people&#x2014;that we must assume that everything that the majority of the House of Commons say is the view of the people. Of course, I ought to have limited it to the first two years. That was the main part of the principle of the Government Bill which my noble friend criticised, and the Lord Chancellor has nothing to say to convince you that as a matter of fact the House of Commons was a counterpart of the people. I should like to ask whether there are any grounds for thinking so? I would call as my witness in this respect no less a person than the Prime Minister, who was asked recently in a debate in the House of Commons whether he thought that the Unionist Education Bill of 1902 represented the wishes of the people. Observe, that Bill was passed within two years of the meeting of that Parliament, and therefore would have come within the provisions of this Bill. Of course, he was bound to say he did not think so. He was bound to say that, because he had said it so many times before. How did he get out of that difficulty? He did not get out of it. His only argument was that it was an exception. I do not want to be misunderstood, but the charge is that the General Election of 1900 took place solely upon the question of the Boer War. That was not the case. I want to guard myself. I am a person of no importance but I put the Education Act
<col>784</col>
into my election address. As a matter of fact I consulted no less a person than Mr. Balfour, and it was quite clear that the election was not taken merely upon the Boer War but upon the general record of the Government. But this by the way. I put that in to guard myself. I do not admit that the Unionist Government had no right to legislate on the education question, but the point is that the Liberal Party and Mr. Asquith, and I have no doubt the Lord Chancellor, have said over and over again that the Unionist Party, the majority of the House of Commons of that day, had no moral right to deal with the education question. How does that affect their present contention that every Parliament within two years of its being elected may be taken as an absolute counterpart of the wishes of the people in the country? If I required any further ground for this contention I should find it in the speech of the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, who said most frankly last night that Parliaments were continually elected upon one particular issue and yet legislated upon any number of other issues after being elected, which, of course, is a complete answer to the position which the Prime Minister took up.<lb/>
So what it amounts to is that it is admitted on all hands that a House of Commons is elected without, as the phrase is, any mandate for particular measures, and yet is entitled to deal with them. I have no objection to that myself. By all means let them deal with them; but you must not say that the House of Commons in these respects represents the exact opinion of the people. It does not follow. It may be so; it may not be so. And according to our ancient Constitution the only means of preventing a miscarriage of justice in consequence of the possibility of the House of Commons legislating in conflict with the wishes of the people lay in the power of your Lordships' House to refer such Bills to the people. I should like, if I could, to convince impartial minds opposite of the truth of what I am saying. Let me give them an example which I think will come home to them. The noble Lord who preceded me in this debate spoke of our being in conflict with the representatives of seven and a-half million electors. I need hardly remind him&#x2014;he must know it&#x2014;that nearly half of the electors agree with us, and the important thing to remember for the purpose of this illustration is that a
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0397"/>
<col>785</col>
very little might convert that relative minority into a majority. What might do that? For example, the Army policy of the noble Viscount opposite might break down. It is quite possible that a certain number of electors might be converted on that point. Then there might be the question of Woman Suffrage. I should not be surprised at a similar effect resulting if the electorate thought the Government were acting badly in the matter of giving facilities for certain proceedings in another place. Or take the case of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. If I may say so with respect, I have always thought that he behaved in a manner which deserved the admiration of all right thinking men. He might have difficulties with gentlemen in another place who think he has not put enough Radicals on the magisterial Bench. All these things might happen, and the result might be that at a General Election we change sides. Does the noble Lord opposite, or the Lord Chancellor, think it would be right, the election having turned on issues like that, that the entire fiscal system of this country should be immediately revolutionised, and that Tariff Reform in its most extreme provisions should be introduced as part of our law? I am sure noble Lords opposite do not think so. Would they say that my friends if they introduced the Tariff Reform system represented the exact counterpart of the wishes of the country? Yet to be consistent with their present argument they would be bound to say so. I do not desire to have Tariff Reform rushed on the country. I do not desire to have Radical measures rushed on the country. A Second Chamber to thoroughly come up to what I believe to be the requirements of the case ought to be able to refer all drastic measures of legislation to the people unless it is quite certain that the people approve of them. Your Lordships opposite have not faced such a contingency as I have described. We have. We are pledged, as you know, that before Tariff Reform is carried it shall be submitted to the country, to the direct vote of the country. I only give this to show how little you have really faced the consequences of your proposed action.<lb/>
We submit to you a policy of reform and a policy of Referendum. As to reform, I am not speaking of any special measures. I do not pretend that the scheme of the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, is the best that could have been made. That is not
<col>786</col>
my own personal view; but by making those proposals my noble friend has established beyond all possibility of cavil the good faith of the Party who sit on this side of the House in advocating full, fundamental, and complete reform of your Lordships' House. We are in favour of the Referendum. That is to say, we do not believe that the House of Commons is necessarily the counterpart of the people. We agree that it is the greatest representative Assembly in the world. Those of us who were Members for many years of that Assembly are, of course, by old association devoted to the House of Commons as an institution, but we do not believe it is infallible in its judgment of the wishes of the people, and we say that if you will no longer allow the House of Lords with its old deep sense of responsibility to act as it has done in the past then you must have a system of Referendum. There must be some method where the issues are sufficiently grave&#x2014;an issue on which the very fabric of the United Kingdom depends&#x2014;by which those issues could be referred to the direct vote of the people before decision is arrived at. It is with that policy that we come before your Lordships. When, we approach the Committee stage, I can assure you we shall enter into the discussion with a profound sense of responsibility and of the importance of what we are doing. Whatever the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack may be, we shall be moderate. We shall approach this subject with a deep sense of the difficulties with which we have to deal and in a spirit of moderation. But moderation on our side deserves to be met by moderation on the other side. If it is so met, well and good; but if not, then the responsibility for the resulting chaos must rest upon the shoulders of noble Lords opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01308"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to detain you more than a few minutes, but I do not like to give an entirely silent vote on the matter which is now before the House. In listening to the speeches from the Government Front Bench I have been struck with the attention which has been paid to denunciations of your Lordships' House as a partisan Assembly, from the fact of its being out of sympathy with the electorate, and the arguments that a change was necessary in order to allow Liberal legislation to have what is called fair play. We have had the Lord Chancellor telling us that owing to the attitude of your Lordships' House many
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0398"/>
<col>787</col>
earnest reformers felt themselves stifled and choked in their endeavours to obtain reform. Earnest reformers, I am afraid, are very often like inventors. Every inventor thinks that his own particular invention is better than anybody else's, and I think earnest reformers generally imagine that those who disagree with them are people of a mulish and obstinate nature and are guided by vested interests which prevent them looking at matters in a proper light. It is, I think, usually the fact that earnest reformers for a long period of their existence are considerably in advance of their time. Because noble Lords opposite desire certain measures which appeal to them but do not appeal to noble Lords on this side of the House, it does not at all follow that they are not in advance of the opinion of the country.<lb/>
I should like to say for myself that I was not one of those who would have opposed the Bill of the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, had it gone to a Division. For a long time I have been of opinion that in view of the altered state of democratic feeling in this country it was absolutely necessary to depart from the old Party lines from which these questions were regarded, and that if this House was to fulfil its proper place as a Second Chamber it was equally necessary that some great and far-reaching modification should take place with regard to the hereditary system. We have to face facts. Many Conservatives of the old school, it is true, deplore the action which has been taken, and are at the present moment inclined to go about wringing their hands and saying, "Where is Conservatism?" But I think if we ask that question we might ask, "Where is the old Liberalism?" because it was very different from the Liberalism of the present day. We have to realise that it is absolutely necessary, if we do not wish to see far graver dangers than any of us would care to see, that some considerable change should take place. With that view, I, as a humble member of this House, welcomed the Bill of the noble Marquess, and we hope that people will regard it as a proof of the sincerity of your Lordships' House and of our willingness to make very considerable sacrifices in the interests of safe and stable Government. The fact of the Bill of the noble Marquess having been read a second time makes two-thirds of the observations from the Front Bench opposite to-day beside the mark.<lb/>
<col>788</col>
What we on this side have to do at the present time is to prevent the attention of the country being diverted from the real question before us at this moment&#x2014;the powers of the House of Lords. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, rated the noble Marquess somewhat upon his reading of recent history with regard to the particular crisis before us, and he said that it dated from the action of your Lordships' House in referring the Budget of 1909 to the country, whereby, he said, we committed the unpardonable crime of challenging the House of Commons. I do not know that there is any very great crime in a Second Chamber challenging a popular Chamber on measures which contain any element of doubt with regard to a change of novel and far-reaching effect. But the noble Viscount omitted the complete history of the present crisis. He has since been reminded by various speakers of the undeniable fact that when the Government did go to the country they lost 100 seats and came back unable to pass their Budget except with the help of the Irish vote. I suggest that the real history of the crisis begins then.<lb/>
Immediately that happened the Government were told in unmistakable terms that they had to toe the line in order to cripple the powers of the House of Lords and to force through a Home Rule Bill. His Majesty's Government may declare with all the emphasis of which they are capable that there is no direct arrangement with the Irish Party, but I am afraid they will obtain very little credence among intelligent electors, or at all events amongst those who are able to see the course of events and realise what is going on. We now have His Majesty's Government in the position which was so eloquently denounced by Mr. Gladstone in the year 1885 at Edinburgh. He was supposing that owing to some cause the then Government had disappeared and a Liberal Party Was called to deal with the great constitutional question of the Government of Ireland in a position where it was a minority dependent on the Irish vote for converting it into a majority. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"I tell you seriously and solemnly that, though I believe the Liberal Party to be honourable, patriotic, and trustworthy, in such a position as that it would not be safe for it to enter on the consideration of a measure in respect to which, at the first step of its progress, it would be in the power of a Party coming from Ireland to say 'unless you do this and unless you do that we will turn you out to-morrow.'"</quote>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0399"/>
<col>789</col>
A few days later, at Dalkeith, Mr. Gladstone said&#x2014;
<quote>"Nothing, I think could be more dangerous to the public weal than that they [Irish questions] should be handled in a Parliament where there was no Party strong enough to direct its action according to judgment and conscience, without being liable to be seduced from the right path by time temptation which might be offered to it by the vote of Irish Members."</quote>
There are other quotations familiar to all students of political history, but I do not know that they have been referred to so far in this debate. It is important to realise that the dangerous position which Mr. Gladstone so eloquently warned the country against is the one into which this Government is now drifting and in which they are attempting to deal with this important question.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, in that conciliatory and mellifluous speech to which we listened with so much pleasure the other day, would have been more convincing if we could have had any sort of assurance that he had the weight of the Cabinet with him. He spoke of the overworked House of Commons and the necessity for devolution&#x2014;a subject also referred to by the Lord Chancellor. I think that anybody who watches the proceedings of Parliament and sees important and imperial questions being constantly hurried through the House of Commons without adequate discussion owing to the congested state of business there will admit that the question of some devolution of local affairs is looming in the distance and will probably have to be faced at some not very distant period. But it is not mere devolution of local affairs that Mr. Redmond demands for the Irish Party. He says he will not be satisfied with anything but a Parliament with full control over the Executive. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack talks of Home Rule and says that his Party intend to bring in Home Rule, but there is a careful avoidance of giving any idea of what that means, although there was some glimmer of a definition by the noble and learned Lord to-night when he referred to the South African Constitution and seemed to infer that the privileges which His Majesty's Government established there were what he wished conferred upon Ireland. All I can say is that I cannot understand the frame of mind of any serious Statesman who regards the case of a distant Colony like South Africa as being exactly similar

to the case of Ireland which is within easy reach of our own shores and occupies such a strategical position with regard to the British Isles.<lb/>
When Home Rule is spoken of the argument is constantly put forward by some persons that if Canada and other Colonies are fit to be trusted with self-government, why not Ireland? Is it possible that devolution in Wales and in Scotland also means full control over the Executive? If not, why is their case to be different from that of Ireland? I have the very best wishes in the world towards Ireland, but from the mere instinct of self preservation I contend that what this House must insist upon in the interests of the British people is that Home Rule, or devolution, or whatever you like to call it, when brought before Parliament by the present Government should be considered on its merits, and not at the point of the bayonet with which we are threatened in this case. We have to consider many things in connection with that vital question when it conies up. We have to consider what the position of this country would be in the event of any serious European complication or conflagration in which the British Government might have to come to some momentous decision which might involve this country in war, or which might bring us to our knees in some dishonourable surrender. We might be put in the position of fighting for our lives, into a position where the fact of an Irish Parliament not being able to see eye to eye with us might make all the difference in the world with regard to the possibility of our defending ourselves and maintaining our position. Therefore we have to consider whether such a measure, if it comes into operation, would make the British nation stronger or weaker than it is at the present moment in the event of foreign complications. It is a most suicidal thing to suppose that it would be safe to consider this measure except from an absolutely detached position, and we ought to do everything we can to warn the British electors of the danger to which they would be drifting if they allowed the British Parliament to be dictated to by the Nationalist Party, which says to the Government, "You must toe the line. You must give us Home Rule, or we will turn you out to-morrow." It is because we realise the importance of this question with regard to the Parliament Bill that we look upon the Bill as most dangerous.<lb/>

<col>791</col>
The noble Lord opposite, Lord Ilkeston, said that a measure such as this was put
forward by Mr. John Bright in 1884 and that everybody then regarded it as moderate and harmless. There was then no Irish Party dictating to the English Government. That was before the date of the surrender to Home Rule by one of the great English Parties. Circumstances have completely changed, and what might perhaps have been regarded then with toleration cannot be regarded in the same light to-day. We regard this Bill as a dangerous and mischievous Bill, as one forced upon us by nothing short of a conspiracy between His Majesty's Government and the extremists whom they cannot resist; and if we pass the Second Reading under protest I hope that Amendments will be introduced for the purpose of securing that when the question of Home Rule or any similar question comes before the country it will be made impossible for a Government, at the dictation of a Party in the House of Commons, to force down the throats of the British nation some measure which they regard as dangerous and on which they have never been consulted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01309"><member>THE EARL OF ANCASTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount who introduced this Bill said truly that its provisions had already been so largely and fully discussed in the public Press, on public platforms, and even in both Houses of Parliament, that it seemed hardly necessary to enter at any great length into its provisions. I thoroughly agree with that statement, and in my few remarks to-night I shall refer more to the question of tactics than to the provisions of the Bill, though there are one or two points in its provisions on which I should like to say a few words.<lb/>
Speaking as a humble "backwoodsman" I may say that I was extremely pleased to notice in the excellent speech of the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, that it was to be the advice of the leaders of the Opposition that this Bill should be accorded a Second Reading. I am pleased about that. In my opinion it would have been unwise and deplorable to reject it at this early stage, because I believe that if we go further into the details of the Bill and lay the case before His Majesty's Ministers there may yet be found some ground for compromise. If advice had been given to make a stand and reject the Second Reading, I confess that I, for one, would dread the creation of perhaps
<col>792</col>
500 Peers. There are only two alternatives &#x2014;the creation of 500 Peers, or another General Election; and I am bound to say that I could not face either of those alternatives at the present time with equanimity.<lb/>
I think it was the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack who told us, or rather hinted, in the earlier part of this debate that there were certain younger members of the Tory Party who were coquetting with Home Rule. I forget his exact words, but he said they were not entirely opposed to it. Personally I am thoroughly opposed to it as I always have been, and I shall be until I can see a feasible Bill, and that I do not believe is possible. Home Rule defeated Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Parnell, and I think it is probable it will defeat Mr. Asquith and Mr. Redmond. But, however that may be, I am bound to say that, speaking as a strong Unionist, my fear is that if a conflict were provoked at the present time and it resulted in the creation of 500 Peers the effort to maintain the Union of Great Britain would be worse than it is under this Bill, because if Peers were created the Parliament Bill would be passed and Home Rule would be put through the House of Commons next summer. It would come up here and become law in the following August. Therefore, if for no other reason, I am extremely pleased that, for the time being at any rate, there will be no further talk of the creation of 500 Peers.<lb/>
With regard to the alternative of another General Election, as one who took a small part in the last two elections, I cannot see that there are any signs that so far there has been any great reaction in the country, and that we should be likely to gain any great advantage from another election at present. In the election of January, 1910, I felt that I was one of the old guard, and I rather feared I was marching with a forlorn hope. I am afraid we were fighting on ground carefully chosen by our adversaries. The present Chancellor of the Exchequer provoked the conflict, and in order to do that, like the skilful toreador, he waved the red flag. Speaking with regard to the January election I am Speaking to say that my prophecies were wrong; not only that, but the old guard came through very triumphantly and we received an accession of 100 to the cause of the Unionists. In the following election in December I was a great deal more hopeful. I thought that we had got
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0401"/>
<col>793</col>
rid at last of some of those rather stupid cries of the previous election, and that we would greatly improve our position. We held our position, and that is all that can be said for it. Therefore I cannot share the very bright opinions which are held by the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, on the excellence of elections. But that is the only way of getting at the true opinions of the people. The noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, said he had taken part in eight election contests. I believe in Scotland they are very strong and quiet people, and do not require to be roused up to that state of enthusiastic election intoxication that they do in England. When I look back on the display of election literature and the canvassing which goes on at elections and consider the personal issue which is very often involved, I am bound to say that the free and independent electors are not always able very clearly to ascertain what are the chief items on which they are voting. But, however that may be, the fact
remains that the election of December resulted very much the same as that in January. Therefore I do not see, if a conflict at this early stage was followed by another appeal to the country, that we should fare much better than we did last January. At the same time, I fully recognise that there are the very greatest dangers in this Bill, and if the Government do not agree to some compromise and meet us in some way, I do not at all think that the conditions then in an appeal to the country would be the same as at the present time.<lb/>
In introducing the Bill the noble Viscount read an extract from a speech made by the noble Earl, Lord Crewe, whose absence we regret, in which the noble Earl said that he had sat here for about seventeen years and always found himself absolutely powerless; that he never could do anything, and that it was almost useless coming to the House. That, no doubt, was very galling. It was through no lack of eloquence or enthusiasm that the noble Earl was unable to obtain a majority, but I think it might have been partly owing to lack of argument. If the noble Earl had used better arguments, instead of finding himself in a minority he would perhaps have found himself in a majority on some occasions. I think his complaint is rather like that of the juryman who held out against his eleven colleagues and after being kept locked up for three days and nights complained to the others that they were the most obstinate men it
<col>794</col>
had ever been his fate to encounter. Lord Crewe said it was useless to come here at all. But under the Parliament Bill that complaint will be shared by every one who sits in your Lordships' House, because if we are to have no power I cannot see the use of coming to this Assembly and making speeches and holding debates. We might as well join debating societies nearer our own homes.<lb/>
There are, I think, certain grave defects in the Bill. The noble Viscount, of course, tried to put the best possible construction upon it, but I am very much afraid that with a little pressure in the House of Commons from some ardent reformers who are in a hurry this suspensory period of two years may be very considerably shortened if not swept away altogether. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent this happening within the next two or three years. I feel perfectly certain that, if your Lordships hang up a Bill, pressure will be put on Governments in the future to introduce an amending Bill to abolish this suspensory period. Another grave danger is the question of what is a Money. Bill. Since the Bill was first brought to light Amendments have, I think, been inserted in this clause in another place, but. I still consider that there is grave danger that Bills which do not come strictly under the description of
Money Bills will be put into that category and be sent to this House. Your Lordships may be told that you can debate them but that you must do nothing else. It ought to be very clearly defined what is actually a Money Bill.<lb/>
I will give examples. There is a proposal on foot for the payment of members of the House of Commons. I never did master the mysteries of procedure in the House of Commons, but the best information that I could get was that on an important question like that they always proceeded by a separate Bill. This year the provision is to be placed in the Budget. I am not quite sure whether I should be debarred from doing so by the rules of this House, but when the Appropriation Bill comes up here I should like to move an Amendment to delete the provision applying money for this purpose. Unless the Money Bill clause of the Parliament Bill is made very strict, is defined within very fine limits there is grave danger that all Bills which the Government desire to push through the House of
Commons will be described as. Money Bills. Again, take Welsh Disestablishment.
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0402"/>
<col>795</col>
My recollection of the last Bill is that it was almost completely a matter of finance; it was chiefly concerned in taking money from the Church and devoting it to other purposes. Cleanliness, I suppose, was considered next to Godliness, for some of the money was to be taken to provide public baths and washhouses. It is easy to see that a Bill of that description might very well be turned into a Money Bill and passed through both Houses without any consideration at all. We ought, therefore, when we reach the Committee stage, to lay down as firmly as we can the principle that this suspensory power of two years is not to be altered and also define very carefully what are Money Bills.<lb/>
Most of the speeches on the question of a Second Chamber have been confined to talking about the majority. I should like to plead to your Lordships on behalf of the minority. I do not believe that a free people who have enjoyed liberties for many generations would think for one moment of placing their liberties in the hands of a Single Chamber alone. I feel certain they will demand a Court of Appeal. This House, not as we are sitting now, but in its legal capacity, is the final Court of Appeal. I believe the country will demand a Court of Appeal in cases against the House of Commons so that matters shall be tried by the highest
tribunal. Liberals often describe the giving of votes at Parliamentary elections as constituting freedom. Many of the Bills which they have passed appoint a large number of bureaucrats and inspectors and plenty of tax collectors and officials, and the bulk of these measures are part and parcel of the result of living under a Liberal Government who are so fond of talking about freedom. Take the greatest democracy in the world&#x2014;the United States of America. I believe that the private lives of many people in that country are much more strongly protected, not only by the law, but by the Constitution, than can be said of the rights of private individuals in this country. I believe that a Parliamentary majority may be just as great a tyrant as any in the Middle Ages. A popular phrase we sometimes hear is that minorities must suffer, but, after all, minorities of to-day may be majorities to-morrow, and I am certain that a minority, be it great or small, ought to have some Court of Appeal and ought to be able, if they feel they are suffering grave injustice, to carry that appeal to the highest Court of
<col>796</col>
all&#x2014;namely, to a Court of their fellow-countrymen.<lb/>
I remember a speech on a public platform by the late Lord Randolph Churchill when a charge was made against him that the Conservative minority of that day were engaged in obstructing Liberal measures in the House of Commons. What was his answer? He said it was perfectly ridiculous to talk about a minority, consisting of very nearly half of the House of Commons, carrying on obstructive tactics. He said that to talk about obstruction by men representing half the people in the United Kingdom was absurd, and that that could not be called obstruction in any fair sense of the word. What happened in those days when there was formidable obstruction from a substantial minority representing a large body of opinion in the country? They had not got all these rules of kangaroo closures and closure by compartments under which a Bill is born on Monday, christened on Tuesday, married on Wednesday, taken ill on Thursday, dies on Friday, and is buried on Saturday. They had not the procedure which the House has to-day, whereby no matter what force the Opposition are in, no matter how many millions of voters they represent, the Government can absolutely disregard the opinions of those men and their representatives. In those days a strong minority could put pressure on the Government, and it was only by reasonable compromise, by discussing matters in a friendly spirit and coming to terms, that they could manage to get their Bills through.<lb/>
I believe that we are in the same position at the present time. The Government of the day have their majority, and their Parliament Bill which is before us holds the field. At the same time, if they desire a permanent settlement of this question and do not wish to provoke a conflict, they must take some heed of the opinions of the Opposition and of the minority. The noble Lord opposite, Lord Ilkeston, carried our memories back to the Parish Councils Bill. I would recall his memory to another period when we dealt with the Employers' Liability Bill. Undoubtedly during the last few years the minority in this country who have been attacked by Radical legislation has consisted to a large extent of men of property and wealth, and, although I for one consider they should bear their fair
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0403"/>
<col>797</col>
share of taxation, at the same time they have the same rights and liberties as any body else in the country. It is only fair that they should have a Court of Appeal like everybody else. During the last two or three years, as I have said, Liberal legislation has been applied against men possessed of riches and wealth, but that has not always been the case. There have often been minorities belonging to your Lordships' House whose capital and wealth consists of the labour of their hands. Lord Ilkeston said that in 1894 Mr. Gladstone stated with regard to the Parish Councils Bill, when protesting against the Amendments of your Lordships' House, that this was a state of things which could not and should no longer continue. I believe it was not made on that Bill, but on the far more important question of the contracting-out clauses of the Employers Liability Bill. My recollection of that, time was that Mr. Gladstone tried to provoke a conflict with this House by saying that that Bill was tainted and poisoned. I remember also Mr. Balfour retorting that it was tainted with freedom, and the poison was the poison of liberty. In those days your Lordships were standing up for the rights and the freedom of those workmen who, if they could make better terms than they had been able to make before, were to be allowed to make those terms under the Bill, and that is liberty. People in this country, whether rich or poor, in times like that do require a Second Chamber, a Chamber that will hear their appeal, a Chamber that will be composed of their fellow-countrymen. Though I am pleased that this Bill is receiving a Second Reading, at the same time I hope that the spirit of compromise will not be altogether absent from these walls, and that the noble Viscount in charge of the Bill will, in the course of our discussions in the Committee stage, see that some Amendments are inserted in the Bill to ensure that no restrictions can be placed upon the liberties of the people.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01311"><member>THE EARL OF LEVEN AND MELVILLE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I trust I may be forgiven for venturing to address your Lordships twice within a very few days. My excuse must be the importance of the subjects which have been before the House in these two days. I will promise, however, to detain
<col>798</col>
your Lordships for only a few moments. As I understand, two chief reasons are
put forward by His Majesty's Government for the introduction of this Bill. They
take up two main lines of defence. They say, first, in a lofty, a national, and a patriotic spirit, that it is your Lordships' fault this Bill has had to be introduced, that you have gone on provoking the people until it has become absolutely necessary that something should be done. It is the old cry, "Peers against the people." The Peers have irritated the people until at last noble Lords opposite are forced to come down to this House, and their colleagues in another place are forced to go down to the House of Commons, and take drastic steps to prevent anything of the kind happening again.<lb/>
There is another line taken up in a less lofty, though perhaps a truer spirit. It is the line that they will be traitors and poltroons if they give up the Party advantage they have gained. I would venture to suggest that there is a third, and, from their point of view, a more cogent reason for which they have produced this Bill. That reason is this. It is the only possible means of control they have over the various parties which go to form the Coalition they command in another place. I do not know if your Lordships may have noticed at the recent elections a caricature in which the Prime Minister was shown driving a team, I think of three horses, evidently with a good deal of difficulty. I will not enter into the question how many horses the Prime Minister ought to be driving, but I should say that really he ought to have more than three. I will not enter either into the different peculiarities of those horses; but there is one alteration I should like to suggest in that caricature. As I saw it, Mr. Asquith had in his hands two reins to the bit of every horse. I would suggest that he should have only one rein, and that should be labelled Parliament Bill. The fact is, he has only one means of control by which he can direct the various steeds in his Parliamentary stable at one time&#x2014;that is the Parliament Bill. On no other subject can His Majesty's Government get a level pull at the mouths of those various horses at one and the same time. That is the reason why they are forced to bring in the Bill, why they dare not bring in a scheme of reform of this House first, why they dare not give us any suggestion of the scheme of reform they propose to bring in, if they ever do bring in such a scheme.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0404"/>
<col>799</col>
You can see quite plainly, if you look at the difference between the body of the Bill and the Preamble, that the Preamble is concocted merely with a view to uniting the various discordant elements which support the Government in another place. My noble friend Lord Camperdown pointed out this evening that in any Select Committee of your Lordships' House that Preamble would be immediately cut out as having nothing whatever to do with the rest of the Bill. I have at the present time the honour to be a member of a Select Committee of this House, and. I have noticed in the several petitions against the Bill which the Committee are considering this section, "The Preamble of this Bill is untrue and cannot be supported by evidence." Now, as to these words, "Whereas it is intended," &amp;c.&#x2014;I need not remind your Lordships of the full contents of the Preamble&#x2014;I submit that the section I have quoted as appearing in petitions applies probably a great deal better to this particular Bill than to any Bill which has ever been considered by a Select Committee of this House. It could not possibly be applied more accurately. The Preamble of this Bill is untrue and cannot be supported by evidence. I ask what confidence has anybody ever had in the intentions of the Government with regard to the "Whereas it is intended" part of the Bill. Not the slightest possible due as to the future has been afforded to anybody. Though the Government have been pressed again and again, both in this House and in the House of Commons, they have refused to give any idea of any scheme which they can produce for the reform of this House. I think, my Lords, there is a very good reason why they have given no clue. They dare not do so. If they had produced anything in the least resembling a plan for the reform of this House, a large number of their supporters would immediately disagree, and would destroy their majority in another place.<lb/>
I will venture to suggest, my Lords, that it is very improbable this Government will ever bring in, as it stands now apart, a scheme for the reform of this House. Mr. Asquith has told us in the House of Commons that he hopes, if time permits, to bring in such a scheme within the life of this Parliament. There are, as anybody can see, a good many loopholes in that statement. "If time permits"&#x2014;that is a pretty big loophole. He can easily make
<col>800</col>
the excuse that time does not permit last over the present Parliament. If he is going to bring in a Home Rule scheme for Ireland first, I think it will take up the whole of his time, even if his remaining time in office be long, of which I am not at al1 certain. There is another reason which leads me to suppose that this promised scheme of reform will never be brought in. The Government do not wish to give up the Party advantage they have gained. It seems to me that if they bring in any scheme of reform at all, they will give up some part of that advantage. We have had recently a very good example of the state of affairs that can be brought about when might is right. The way in which this very Bill has been treated in another place has shown us what a Radical Government will do when might is right. Surely it cannot be contended that this is not a controversial measure, and, after it had been introduced, naturally an enormous number of Amendments were put down. Those Amendments were moved by a set of very able men in very able speeches, but not to one Amendment did the Government pay the slightest attention. Indeed, if I am not mistaken, they announced beforehand that they did not intend to accept any Amendments, and this intention they did not depart from. Anyhow the Bill remains exactly as it was, with all its faults and imperfections.<lb/>
That does not look as if any spirit of compromise is going to be shown by His Majesty's Government on this subject. If we seek for the reason for their attitude we always come back to the same thing&#x2014;namely, they dare not give way, because if they did they know they would lose their majority in another place. I, for one, shall be glad to see this Bill go through a Second Reading, because I hope it may be possible in the Committee stage to bring forward Amendments which I trust His Majesty's Government will treat with a little more respect than they did the Amendments moved in another place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01312"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COLCHESTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture to think that tins Bill in the shape in which it is now brought before your Lordships' House is one which means nothing else than the entire overthrow of our Parliamentary system as it has been known throughout the whole constitutional history of the country. I can heartily join with the noble Earl who preceded me in
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0405"/>
<col>801</col>
saying that in the face of the utterances we have had from His Majesty's Government to-night and last night it does not look as if there is any prospect of Amendments from this side being assented to. As that is the position I must say that, in the shape in which it stands now, I shall be disposed to meet the Bill with nothing but uncompromising opposition. I should not, I confess, have taken that view if the Bill had come before this House in a slightly different form. If instead of the principle of the Bill being that the will of the majority of the House of Commons&#x2014;not of the people&#x2014;must prevail in the duration of one Parliament, the principle had been that it should prevail in the duration of two Parliaments I should not speak thus on the Bill. In that case, though I might have some hesitation still as to whether there should not be an exception in regard to Bills affecting the powers and constitution of the House itself, I should feel that, while nominally limiting the Veto of this House, it would really leave things practically as they always were. This House has not claimed an absolute Veto in the sense of a Veto without reference to length of time or numbers of majorities. If it has learned in time what has been the settled will of the people on a particular question this House has not, I think, ever opposed it. We cannot, however, recognise the settled will of the people in the decisions of a single House of Parliament.<lb/>
There may be one great cry at the time of a General Election which may indicate the voice of the people on one particular subject, but at any rate it goes no farther. I was much struck with the remarks of the noble Viscount opposite when, speaking of a time which he well remembers, he told us how the first Ministry of Mr. Gladstone was raised to power on the one question of the Disestablishment of the Irish Church. After that Government had dealt with the Irish Church it passed in addition a number of important measures which became part of the Statute Book of this country. That time, my Lords, is also within my memory. As I listened to the noble Viscount I thought he had for the moment overlooked what the verdict of the country on that Government was. We know that after passing those measures the time came when it appealed to the people, and at the General Election it was swept from power. Its opponents secured what they had not
<col>802</col>
had for a generation&#x2014;a decisive majority, giving them not only office but a real control over affairs. I do not attack that Government or any Government for introducing measures which were not prominently before the country at a General Election. They cannot, of course, be expected to limit their legislation to the one or two topics then occupying public attention. It would be absurd so to restrict the course that it might be their duty to take. But they cannot claim, merely on the ground of support by the House of Commons, that they speak the will of the people. That must be sought, if needed, by a more direct appeal. If by an alteration of the Bill it were provided that a measure should become law within the duration of two Parliaments instead of one, it would be only by the voice of the people in the constituencies, and not by the will of the other branch of the Legislature, that the Upper House, whatever it may be, would be overridden.<lb/>
I think there is something very curious about the attitude of noble Lords opposite and others in the country who profess to hold the democratic creed in its widest form, whenever the question of such an appeal as I have mentioned, and especially the proposal of a Referendum, is introduced. Their creed, as we understand it here, is that the will of the people is perfectly wise so long as it gives a blank cheque, so to speak, to some Minister or candidate to carry out whatever measures he thinks fit. But as soon as they begin to hear talk about the judgment of the people on the merits of a Bill they fall back on the language used by able men like Lord Sherbrooke when demanding the extension of the borough franchise more than forty years ago. I do not pretend to have grown up in the democratic creed, and I can see a certain force in some of their arguments where the question of democracy is still an open one, but I think all the arguments we have heard against the Referendum are arguments against popular government.<lb/>
The attitude of the opponents of the Referendum reminds me of the motto which used to be attributed to some Royalists in Germany, "Long live the absolute Monarchy while it does what we please." Supporters of His Majesty's Government have the same point of view with regard to the Referendum. They are all for democracy when it will back them up in carrying out
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0406"/>
<col>803</col>
the laws they wish to impose on the country; they are not for it when uncertain of its action in regard to their legislative proposals. It may or may not be a good thing to think that the will of the people should be supreme. But if we admit the supremacy of the popular will, surely it should be the real will of the people and not a fiction. We know that some men vote for a Party because of one thing they like in the Party programme, and others vote for it because of totally different proposals put forward by the Party. Some vote for a man because he is a temperance reformer, others because he supports Home Rule, Disestablishment, Free Trade, or something else. Does that mean that any one of those proposals would command the support of a majority in the country? Is it not rather the case that no real verdict is given on any one of them? As the late Lord Salisbury said some years ago, they are like a jury required to find a uniform verdict in all cases brought before them, whatever the merits might be.<lb/>
It has been said that there is a tendency now to depreciate the House of Commons. If there were any such tendency I should be the last to have a right to support it, sitting as I do here on the ground of being the representative of a former Speaker of that House. But it is proposed to place the House of Commons in a new position, one it has never held, as entitled to absolutely unchecked and unlimited power over all legislation. While we may admire the functions the House of Commons has had to discharge under our existing Constitution, we cannot agree to confer on it this totally new power. It follows upon this proposal of His Majesty's Government that the House of Commons must necessarily be judged by a much severer standard. We cannot forget the frequent disparity between the proportion of members on each side and the votes they represent. Nor is this only because constituencies are unequal in size. It is because a majority of two equals in effect a majority of two to one, while a large minority, scattered equally in many constituencies, may be utterly unrepresented.<lb/>
I will now, my Lords, say one or two words concerning the charges against this House. It has been said that it was we who gave the challenge by the rejection of the Budget. But I would remind your Lordships that before the rejection of the Budget we had the Campbell-Bannerman
<col>804</col>
Resolutions, and I, for one, always regarded those Resolutions as a simple declaration of war, without prospect of truce or quarter. It was after those Resolutions had been passed in the House of Commons that the Budget was rejected
by this House. The action of this House on that Budget was taken simply with the object of giving the nation what otherwise it would never have had, that is an opportunity of expressing an opinion upon that measure. As a result of the General Election the Government came back with only a shattered remnant of its former overwhelming strength, but nevertheless, there being still a majority, if a greatly attenuated one, your Lordships passed the Budget.<lb/>
I suppose the other grievance is the Government's Education Bill. I always regretted that the Act of 1902 was not passed, as it was intended to be when introduced, as a permissive Bill. But when the present Government came into office, were they content with repealing the provisions of that Act to which their supporters objected? What did they do? They went very much further than that Act. They proposed a state of things in which practically only the schools of one party&#x2014;the schools of the undenominational party&#x2014;should be supported by the rates, thus inflicting a grievous wrong on the supporters of another very large and important class of schools. This House amended the Bill. It did not reject it on the Third Reading, though a few noble Lords voted against it. I myself thought, after the Amendments we had passed, that it was not right under the circumstances to vote against it. The Bill went back to the House of Commons, but the Government refused to come to any agreement, and the result was the measure fell through. The country was indifferent about it. There was a tornado of passion in one or two quarters of the House of Commons, but there was no strong popular feeling in the country over the fate of that Bill. We might have supposed that there was going to be an agitation like that in connection with the Reform Bill of 1831, but the whole thing fell flat, and we have never had that Bill sent up again.<lb/>
As to the present Bill, as I have said, I see no indications of any important Amendment being accepted on the other side. For my part I confess I do not see that any worse consequences could be apprehended
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0407"/>
<col>805</col>
from the rejection of the Bill than from passing it. I am not sure it would not be better, if the Bill is to become law, that it should do so by virtue of some of the strange and unheard of methods of which we have had rumours, rather than that we should appear to acquiesce in passing such revolutionary proposals. The Bill, as it stands, is one introducing a new form of Government, and sweeping away from our Constitutional system all checks against the despotic supremacy of one branch of the Legislature. Because in the form in which we are asked to pass it the Bill destroys the safeguards of well-ordered freedom, I feel bound, unless it is transformed and remodelled, to protest against its passing into law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01313"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should not have ventured to address you again to-night if it had not been for the fact that I stand in a somewhat peculiar position. I understand it is agreed that we should not challenge the Second Reading of this Bill. I am sorry to say, having given the subject the best attention which I am capable of giving to it, I have come to the conclusion that I cannot fall in with that course. I cannot feel myself justified in being a party to reading this Bill a second time without a challenge, and if any noble Lords challenge a Division I shall vote with them. But as at present advised, I do not know that I should even find a teller to tell with me. Therefore, I ask your Lordships' leave to take this opportunity of expressing my belief that we are not justified in reading this Bill a second time, of separating myself from the policy which understand we have adopted of assenting to its Second Reading, and of making it perfectly plain that if I do not go into the Lobby against it I am not to be thought in any way to have assented to its adoption.<lb/>
I will give two reasons, and only two, why I feel compelled to take this course. I will, if you please, give you the weaker reason first. The attitude of His Majesty's Government on this matter is one which I have always found it very difficult to describe. I do not know what it is there is about His Majesty's Government, but I al ways experience a difficulty in describing their conduct in good King's English. Perhaps it is because their methods of procedure are so novel and so advanced that it requires more modern
<col>806</col>
terms than are embraced in classical English to describe them. But in this instance I cannot say that the conduct of the Government is due to pride, or to arrogance, or that it is haughty in character. I really think it would be complimentary to use any of those terms. The word braggadocio hardly meets the case either. I can only think of one term. It is a slang term, and I apologise to your Lordships for using it. It is what is commonly called "bounce." The whole attitude of His Majesty's Government is one of bounce. I am sure no one will imagine that I accuse the noble Viscount the Leader of the House of bounce either in manner or in language, for nothing could be more opposite to what the noble Viscount is well noted for. But I must say that if his language and manner do not partake of bounce, his matter can only be described by that term. The noble Viscount has in fact said, "Hands up," and has threatened to present a pistol at our heads. It is true that the pistol is at present up the sleeve of the Government. We do not know whether it is a popgun or a much deadlier weapon; but the attitude is one of menace, and the demand they make is for surrender. It may be that I have too much of the old Adam in me, but I must say I personally object to that sort of attitude, and I object to it especially when the demand is made by an Administration as weak and as inefficient as I believe this Administration has shown itself to be.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, two or three nights ago, remarked that the Government had been accused both of, I think he said, oligarchical despotism and of weakness, and he said the two accusations were not compatible. I was surprised at that remark. I should have thought weakness and violence were the commonest associates; indeed, that one might almost be said to be the complement of the other. The conduct of His Majesty's Government all through its career, and especially at the present time, is characterised by precisely that mixture of violence and weakness which weak Administrations are apt to show. I am sure I need not detain your Lordships with ancient history to show that some of the worst despots in the world have been so because they were weak. Perhaps I need only refer to the history of our country&#x2014;to the history of the Stuarts. Why were the Stuarts violent? Because they were weak. It is the greatest mistake
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0408"/>
<col>807</col>
in the world to imagine that violence and weakness are incompatible.<lb/>
What is the sign of weakness His Majesty's Government show? Sometimes I feel as if I had, like Rip Van Winkle, gone to sleep and wakened up in a new world altogether from that world which existed when I was younger in Parliamentary days. There were great men before Agamemnon; there have been Prime Ministers before Mr. Asquith. How have other Prime Ministers managed to get on with this House? Has there been no friction in former times between the two Houses? Have there been no difficulties? Had Mr. Gladstone no difficulties to face between the Upper House and the Lower House? But Mr. Gladstone, whatever we may think of his policy, was a strong man. He knew how to deal with men and with parties, and how, without putting a pistol at the head of the Opposition, to carry his point. It is precisely because the present Government in all its proceedings have been absolutely unable to do anything of the sort that they can only resort to methods of violence, that they can only practically manufacture an emergency&#x2014;because there is really no emergency whatever&#x2014;and then when they have manufactured that emergency, solve it by what can only be called practically revolution.<lb/>
The Government are inconsistent. The Government say they can do nothing. Their own confession, or rather their own complaint, is that they are allowed to do nothing. Yet, as was mentioned by the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, or by another noble Lord, the other night, Lord Haldane took credit outside the House for the enormous number of things the Government had done. I will return the noble Viscount's words, and say that these two assertions are not compatible. What is the result? I was rather struck by the admission of the noble Viscount the Leader of the House the other night when he told us that wise men refused to bring matters to extremities. I thought it a most remarkable sentence in the noble Viscount's mouth. Will he forgive me if I return it to him? Only let me point out there is this difference. In my mouth it is a warning; in the noble Viscount's mouth it is a menace. I do not think I need detain your Lordships at this stage with further disquisitions on the weakness of the Government. I could say much on that
<col>808</col>
subject, but I will reserve it for some future occasion. I have no doubt we shall have many opportunities of discussing the conduct of the Government in connection with this measure at a later stage. I cannot help repeating that the Government are guilty of the old dodge, which is known to all those who wish to seize what I may call despotic or overweening power&#x2014;power to do what they like unchecked. They are guilty of the old dodge of creating a difficulty and then saying it is unsurmountable without utterly exceptional measures.<lb/>
I turn from that, from my own reluctance to support a measure which is presented to us in the manner I have described by a Government of the character I have endeavoured to depict&#x2014;I turn from that to my greater reason for desiring not to be responsible for the Second Reading of this Bill. The other night I ventured to address your Lordships on the reform of the House of Lords. I endeavoured to convey to your Lordships my opinion that we should not stand upon privilege or upon our rights&#x2014;our right to seats or our right to our votes&#x2014;if it could be shown, as I believed it could be, that reform was desirable and that reform might end in our sacrificing our present position. I do not believe very much in the importance of individuals. I believe that, whatever happened to the individual member of this House, this House, if it remained in the same position with the same powers, would, go on very much as before. I have lived long enough to have known great and distinguished men whom people said would when gathered to their fathers, make an irreparable gap in the ranks of their Party; it has been said that the efficiency of the Party to which they belonged, or the House of which they were members, would suffer permanently and irremediably. My Lords, it is quite curious how easily the ranks are filled up, and how small a gap even the greatest men make in the history of a country. If that be the case, I certainly think it is much more true of the rank and file of our noble selves. But the reason that I have regarded the question of reform readily is that I believe reform will strengthen this House. I cannot believe that reading this Bill a second time will strengthen this House. I cannot see how any measure which has for its object the weakening of the power of this
House can by any possibility in Committee be made
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0409"/>
<col>809</col>
even innocuous, much less a measure which support this House, and I am afraid that if we read this Bill a second time, whatever we may say&#x2014;for I fear that with the public our votes carry more weight than our speeches&#x2014;it will be thrown in our teeth that we have admitted that it is desirable to lessen the power of this House, and that all we have objected to is the means by which it is to be done. That, I am afraid, will be the impression which will be given to the public, and as I cannot be a party to giving that impression even by my single vote or single voice I protest here most solemnly against it.<lb/>
In this matter of the power of the House we ought to remember that our positions here are a trust. I ventured the other night to quote a passage from a man who is not a politician as to the tendencies of democracy. I will not repeat the quotation, but I say that the function of this House is to delay, if we cannot prevent, the process of disintegration of which he spoke, and it is a trust and a responsibility of which we cannot rid ourselves. Moreover, let it be remembered that we also represent, or shall very shortly represent, not only the independence of the country&#x2014;for this has been the most independent Assembly in the world&#x2014;but the unpaid independence of the country. Henceforth the Lower House is to be formed of professional politicians&#x2014;politicians who make, or may be supposed to make., their bread and butter by their votes and by their political conduct. I think every one who has ever had a seat in the House of Commons, unless he has had a very singularly secure seat, must know how greatly is the fear of his constituents constantly before his eyes. Those of us who have been in the House of Commons must recollect men having come up to us and said, "I hope to goodness you will vote against this Bill. I am afraid I cannot&#x2014;I dare not. I should risk my seat." That is the necessary defect of representative institutions. I am not saying for a moment that it is a fatal defect, but I say it is a necessary defect, and you are going to make it ten thousand times worse. You are going not only to perpetuate what you must perpetuate, the fear of the elector, but you are also going to make a man feel that if he gives an independent vote he may be sacrificing the means of livelihood of his wile and children, and that will be
<col>810</col>
a pressure upon the very men, remember, for whom this new paid system is invented. It will be a pressure upon them which will destroy all independence of every sort and kind. That makes it the more necessary that we should stand up for the independence of the only free Assembly left in this country.<lb/>
We represent, my Lords, in a peculiar degree the education and the intelligence of the country. I am not afraid to make that assumption, although I know it is quite possible to turn it easily into ridicule. I say that as a House this House is a highly educated House and of high intelligence, and if in any particular instances that education or that intelligence be not as much shown as it might be, it does not alter the fact that as a House this House represents a high degree of education and intelligence. Not only that, but it represents in a peculiar way the property, the wealth, of the country&#x2014;that property which it is necessary to preserve, and which, as I said the other night, the tendency of of all democracies is to attack, and which the end of all democracies is to annihilate. We represent these particular interests, and, as I have already said, we are in trust for those we represent, and we have no right to give up our powers. In the case of the great majority of your Lordships you did not seek the position which you occupy. It has been conferred upon you by Providence, and you are responsible to the source from which you derive it for the exercise which you make of your opportunities. The experience of ages has shown that the powers possessed by this House are essential to the liberties of the people, and a necessary safeguard against violent and confiscatory legislation. Those safeguards were never more necessary than now. According to the best of my judgment, we have no right by any act of omission or commission to jeopardise them, but, on the contrary, to hand them down, if possible, intact to future generations. Therefore I repeat, in conclusion, as I began, that I shall vote against the Second Reading of this Bill if I have an opportunity, and, if I have not, I beg it may not be taken that I agree or assent to the policy of reading it a second time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01314"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture to think His Majesty's Government have more than one reason to congratulate
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0410"/>
<col>811</col>
themselves upon the course which the debate has taken during the last two days. We have nothing to complain of with regard to the terms of the speeches made against the Bill, and we have every reason to congratulate ourselves upon the result which is foreshadowed in those speeches. We understand that a Second Reading will be given to the Bill, and although the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, who spoke last night, indicated the possibility of various Amendments, His Majesty's Government hope that when the time comes they may be able to persuade your Lordships not to press those Amendments to the ultimate issue. We have, after all, reached, as the most rev. Primate said this evening, a certain amount of agreement upon this subject. Both Parties admit the existence of a grievance. We both admit that it is necessary to find a remedy. The noble Duke who has just spoken introduced a note of discord. He told us the other night that flattery was the vice of all statesmen. I am sure we who sit on this side may acquit him of any share in that particular vice. He certainly never flatters His Majesty's Government, and from what I remember of his speech last week he certainly did not flatter the Bill of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition. But, if he will allow me to say so, he did express to-night views and opinions to which we listened with the utmost respect. They are views which ought to be put forward in your Lordships' House on an occasion of this kind, and however little we may find ourselves able to agree with them we were, at any rate, able to listen to them with a great deal of respect and attention. But will the noble Duke allow me to say that in the conclusion to which he arrived&#x2014;namely, that, if possible, he would vote against the Bill of the Government&#x2014;he would have received more sympathy from noble Lords on this side if he had proceeded to the same extremity with regard to the Bill of last week, against which also he had a great deal of hostility.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01317"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: But the noble Earl is not entitled to allege because I did not show great affection for that Bill, that therefore I showed great hostility to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01318"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I think I am well within the recollection of your Lordships' House when I say that the reception which was given by the noble Duke to the Bill of the noble Marquess last week was far from being cordial. But the point really is, which view is to prevail? We had last week the solution which was proposed by the noble Marquess on behalf of the Opposition, and this week your Lordships are discussing the solution which is put forward by His Majesty's Government. Both Parties are now agreed that the will of the House of Commons or of the people must prevail within the limits of a single Parliament. That is common matter between both Parties. [Opposition cries of "No."] Noble Lords surely forget that it is not very long ago that a Bill dealing with the Referendum and Joint Sessions was introduced in your Lordships' House, and that noble Lords opposite did not then insist upon a further General Election. That seems to me to mark a very distinct step in advance. Until now noble Lords opposite have always said there must be a General Election. I understand that is a position they now give up, and that if we have Joint Sessions and the Referendum they would not demand a General Election before they give way on a Bill, which has been through another place. The Referendum, as we have already explained to your Lordships, is not a measure which we wish to see introduced as a common part of our political life. We have recognised its possibilities and its advantages in special circumstances, such as those in the Colony of Natal, where before the Federation it had a very distinct value; but we have had opportunities of explaining to your Lordships why we are unable to accept either the Referendum or the rest of your programme which was introduced in the Bill of last week.<lb/>
The solution which His Majesty's Government offer is before your Lordships in the Bill which we are now discussing, and I venture to think that in deciding to read this Bill a second time your Lordships have taken a very wise decision. I have an extract, which I shall venture to read to
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0411"/>
<col>813</col>
your Lordships, from a speech which was made by the late Lord Salisbury on the Irish Church Bill. It affects so vitally the issue before the House that I think it may be of some value. The late Lord Salisbury said, on June 17, 1869&#x2014;
<quote>"But when once we have come to the conclusion from all the circumstances of the case that the House of Commons is at one with the nation, it appears to me that&#x2014;save in some very exceptional cases, save in the highest cases of morality&#x2014;in those cases in which a man would not set his hand to a certain proposition, 'though a revolution should follow from his refusal&#x2014;it appears to me that the vocation of this House has passed away, that it must, devolve the responsibility upon the nation, and may fairly accept the conclusion at which the nation has arrived. My Lords, I cannot think that in thus stepping aside we are abdicating our duty. It is no courage, it is no dignity, to withstand the real opinion of the nation. All that you are doing thereby is to delay an inevitable issue&#x2014;for all history teaches us that no nation was ever thus induced to revoke its decision&#x2014;and to invite besides a period of disturbance, discontent, and possibly of worse than discontent."</quote>
This Bill, at any rate, was the main issue at the General Election, and I think it is admitted by everybody that the Government are pledged to pursue it to an ultimate issue. What else can your Lordships expect us to do? Would you have us throw it over and accept some other measure? We might possibly, were it not that we feel ourselves pledged in this matter, propose some other solution which finds favour with noble Lords opposite&#x2014;the solution which is now in existence under the circumstances of the South African Constitution; but by their method of Joint Sessions, let me remind noble Lords opposite, the will of the House of Commons would prevail, not within a limit of three sessions, but at the end of one session; and although we admit that this Bill is not a remedy for all the defects that require remedy at present, we cannot but think it is the best method of dealing with the subject at the present time.<lb/>
This Bill does not remedy all the defects. We have more than once said that although this Bill deals with the situation when a Liberal Government is in office, it does not deal with the difficulty which undoubtedly arises when there is a Conservative Government in office. Noble Lords opposite are fond of speaking of the blow which this Bill deals to the dignity of your Lordships' House. I do not know that any blow which was ever delivered by His Majesty's Government was as deep as the blow which
<col>814</col>
was delivered by the Conservative Government in 1901. A Factory and Workshops Bill was introduced into your Lordships' House in that year which dealt with the whole law as to factories and workshops. It consisted of more than 100 clauses. It was read a second time, put through Committee, and read a third time on the same afternoon, and the Conservative Government refused to consider a single Amendment being introduced into that very important. Bill. I venture to think that was far from a dignified or proper way of treating your Lordships' House. We propose this Bill as a step forward, and a necessary step forward, in dealing with this matter. We deal with relations rather than with reconstitution.<lb/>
Noble Lords opposite criticise the fact that we have omitted to deal with the reconstitution of the House of Lords, but may suggest to them that there is some common sense in settling what the machine is to do before making up your minds as to what the machine is to be like? When once you have made up your minds what the functions of the machine are to be you will be better able to make up your minds as to what it should be like. Nor do we think that any reconstruction such as is suggested, without dealing with the proposals we suggest, will affect the vital issue. In the course of the discussion more than one noble Lord has suggested that during the last twenty years any Second Chamber would have acted as this House has acted. Let me, like other noble Lords, briefly go through the period from 1895 to 1910, which divides itself into two periods&#x2014;one during which this House gradually sank into a condition of coma, and the other during which its action has been somewhat feverish. When a Tory Government were in office noble Lords will remember how readily they accepted the Bills introduced by noble Lords opposite. The noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, in the course of his speech this evening, told us that any Government establishing a new state of things ought to meet with difficulties in so doing. I am not disposed to quarrel with that statement, but the criticism which I should make upon it is that a Conservative Government meets with no difficulties in this House when it does try to establish a new state of things. It is only a Liberal
Government which meets with difficulties. Noble Lords will remember perfectly well how the Education Act of 1902, the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0412"/>
<col>815</col>
Licensing Act of noble Lords opposite, and even the institution of Chinese labour met with no direct frustration on the part of members of your Lordships' House. I have always regarded the Archbishop of Canterbury as more responsible than any man in England after the Colonial Secretary for the establishment of Chinese labour in the Transvaal. The right rev. Prelate spoke on more than one occasion, but he was as unable as the Liberal Party to effect any change in the policy of the Government.<lb/>
Then, during the last few years, we have seen this activity on the part of your Lordships' House. The noble Duke who has just spoken tried to charge my noble friend Lord Carrington, and I think also my noble friend Lord Haldane, with inconsistency on the ground that they had spoken with some pride of the achievements of His Majesty's Government. We do not deny that His Majesty's Government have been able to pass a considerable number of small Bills through this House as well as the other House. What we complain of is our larger Bills have not only been rejected, but have been largely amended by your Lordships' House, and it has struck me as curious in the course of this debate when noble Lords opposite have been attacking the position of the House of Commons that when His Majesty's Government introduced a Bill to make the House of Commons more representative of the people the Bill was immediately thrown out by your Lordships' House. But we had the General Election of January last year, the Conference which failed, and then the General Election of last December, when, I think we are all agreed, generally speaking the policy of His Majesty's Government was the main subject before the country.<lb/>
A noble Lord who has some official connection with the Front Bench opposite introduced a new note, it is true, into the discussion. I am sorry he is not now in the House. Lord Hindlip brought the case of Mr. Crippen into an election and told us that no doubt if Crippen had had 100 votes the Government would have interfered to save his life. But apart from an occasional eccentric such as the noble Lord, I think we are all agreed that the real question before the country was the policy of His Majesty's Government; and we have brought in our alternative, which, after all, secured the largest number of votes. There has been considerable discussion on the
<col>816</col>
question during the past few months. There has been discussion also in previous years. In another place it was discussed in 1907 as well as in 1910. In this House it was also discussed last year, and there were also the discussions which took place at various times upon the reform proposals of the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, and also of Lord Newton, so that I think nobody now can say that the proposals of His Majesty's Government were not within the full cognisance of the people of this country.<lb/>
In spite of that, however, we had the noble Marquess who spoke earlier this evening telling us that nearly one-half of the country was in his favour. Let me venture to give your Lordships the figures relating to this point. During the last General Election the total majority for the Liberal and Labour Party was 350,171, and that, of course, is ignoring the plural voter, who as an individual is now thrown over in connection with the Referendum. If we take into account the plural voters&#x2014;and if it is a question of individuals it is not unfair to do so&#x2014;taking the calculation of Mr. F. E. Smith, the number of such votes cast at the General Election was 400,000. I make a present of 300,000 to noble Lords opposite, and retain 100,000 for ourselves. That is not an unfair estimate to make. Under those circumstances we find that the majority of the electors voted for His Majesty's Government and their policy rather than for the policy of noble Lords opposite. Let me remind the noble Marquess opposite what the majorities have been during the past few General Elections. In 1892, when the Liberal Party was returned to power, the majority was 200,000. In 1895 the Unionist majority was 104,000; in 1900, it was 123,000; so that on both those occasions, if we make allowance for the plural voter, we find that the noble Marquess and his friends were maintained in office, not by a majority of votes, but merely by the aid of the plural voter. I should not have entered into this question if the noble Marquess himself, following other noble Lords, had not done so.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01322"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I have no complaint to make on this occasion. Let me turn for one moment to a statement made by Lord Leven and Melville. He told your Lordships that no Amendment had been made to the best of his belief, in the course of the Committee stage of this Bill in another place. Will the noble Earl allow me to advise him on another occasion to read the debates in another place before he makes a statement of that kind? I do not think he would have found a single book of reference or newspaper which would not have pointed out to him his inaccuracy on matters of fact, and important fact. Let me point out that the Government did accept Amendments&#x2014;one dealing with the date of Bills and the other dealing with the matter of rating. The noble Earl, perhaps, in view of those inaccuracies, will excuse me if I say no more on the subject of the speech which he made. Let me say one word upon the question of rating. I am sure I shall have the agreement of noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite when I say that few questions are so difficult for us all to deal with as those which come within the debatable ground of whether Bills are or are not Money Bills. On such a Bill, for instance, as the Housing and Town Planning Bill we have had real difficulty in knowing whether Amendments were privileged or not. I venture to think that what is in the Parliament Bill will clear up that difficulty to a very large extent. All these questions of rating have been removed, and there will be, I believe, much less difficulty in dealing with these questions in the future.<lb/>
After all, what will be the practical result of this Bill if it becomes law? We agree that a Bill which is introduced in the first session of a Parliament will, in the circumstances set out, ultimately, in spite of the resistance of your Lordships, become law. So also if it is introduced in the second year it will ultimately become law.
<col>818</col>
But is it quite fair to describe that as entirely a system of single-Chamber government? There are at least half the number of years during which a Parliament exists in which the powers of this House remain exactly as they were before. You will have every opportunity of amending and rejecting Bills during the last two years of any Parliament. You will also have during the first two years every opportunity of Amendment and of delay. Indeed, one noble Lord on the Front Bench opposite is of opinion that it gives considerable powers to your Lordships' House. Last week Lord Curzon said&#x2014;
<quote>"Is it not certain that by your tyrannical measures, as we think them, you will breed an obdurate and reactionary spirit in the House of lords as it then exists? Is it not certain that your Lordships House will be a greater bar to Radical legislation, within its powers, in the future than it has been in the past?"</quote>
Mr. Balfour has also expressed the opinion that we are increasing the power of the House of Lords in the things in which we do not want to increase it. In those circumstances I do not think it is any exaggeration on our part to say that the system we are proposing is very far removed from a system of single-Chamber government.<lb/>
What do noble Lords opposite mean when they say they wish for the continuance of a system of double-Chamber government? There is at present no equality between the two Chambers; they are not equal in any kind of way. This House has admitted that it has nothing to do with finance. Its connection with administration is comparatively small. Occasionally your Lordships pass an Address to the Crown protesting against a small Order in connection with a scheme of education. But in the administration of the Foreign Office, in the great questions of war, of peace and of defence, your Lordships have nothing like the same powers as the House of Commons, and practically the power of originating Bills in this House has died away. No Bill of first-class importance has for some time been originated in this House. Therefore, only certain legislation would be affected by this Bill. Vetoes have gone, and have left the powers which used to exercise them even stronger than before. Your Lordships know very well the system of checks which exists in this country&#x2014;the check upon the Commons, upon the Cabinet, upon this House and upon the Crown. Is it not a
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0414"/>
<col>819</col>
question well worth consideration whether, after all, the check proposed in this Bill might not become in time a far better check upon this House than the check which at present exists? I think your Lordships might well consider in time to come that such a check as that in this Bill is far better than the one which exists, and which might conceivably, according to the text books, at any rate, be used.<lb/>
What we ask your Lordships to do is to make only one of many steps and of many concessions which have been made by the House of Lords. Mr. Lecky, a well-known Unionist, spoke of the magnitude of the power theoretically vested in the House of Lords as an obstacle to its moderate exercise, and he expressed the opinion that a Veto defined and limited by law would be more fearlessly and generously exercised. That is an expression of opinion not altogether unworthy the attention of your Lordships' House. What in our opinion is really wrong at the present time is not the position of your Lordships' House, for the moment at any rate. I do not wish to complain of the position of your Lordship? House. What we say has gone wrong is the attitude which you have taken up with regard to measures which come to you from another place. It is the relations between the two Houses which are wrong; and it is those relations which we are anxious to improve, it is that difficulty rather which we are anxious to solve. We hope that this Bill will be a solution of the difficulty. The futility of political prophecy is proverbial, but at any rate I would venture to say this. If this weapon were used too tyrannically or too harshly it would break in our hand, and it would be we who would be hurt rather than noble Lords opposite who have always protested against its use.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01323"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened with the greatest interest to the noble Earl who has just sat down, and before I comment on his remarks I must say I cannot congratulate him upon the number of supporters sitting behind him on such an auspicious occasion. I see nobody at all behind the Front Bench opposite. I am addressing the occupants of the Front Bench, it is true, and I feel honoured at being allowed to do so, but I am addressing nobody else on the opposite side.<lb/>
The noble Earl who has just spoken congratulated the House on the fact that this
<col>820</col>
Bill was going to be read a second time, and he went on to say that he hoped we should not press Amendments. I imagine that if we give this Bill a Second Reading we shall certainly in Committee press Amendments&#x2014;Amendments which the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, foreshadowed would be grave Amendments. The noble Earl referred to the Referendum and to Joint Sittings. But he said, on behalf of the Government, that they would not have anything to do either with the Referendum or with Joint Sittings. The fact of the matter is, the noble Earl wants the Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill. Then the noble Earl&#x2014;and in this I could not follow him&#x2014;referred to the reform of your Lordships' House and said he wanted to know what the machine was to do before considering what the machine was to be like. I cannot understand that. When I buy a machine I am anxious to know what it is like, so that I can form some opinion of what it is likely to do. There is nothing whatever in that argument of the noble Earl. Then what was the use of dragging in Crippen? Crippen is hanged, and there is an end of him. The noble Earl said he was anxious to solve difficulties. There is one very easy way of solving a difficulty with your enemy, and that is to knock him down and stamp upon him. After all the abuse that has been poured upon this House and the charges that we have left undone those things that we ought to have done and done those things we ought not to have done, we are face to face with this Bill, which is the outcome of all the threats and abuse that have been poured upon your Lordships throughout the country for many months past.<lb/>
The noble Viscount moved the Second Reading of this Bill in stern and uncompromising words. The only thing that is to be said for the Bill is that it is short enough and plain enough. That is really the only praise which one can give the Bill. But I, and I think a great many others, dislike being vetoed and reduced to the position of being able only to re-edit the Bills which the House of Commons sends up to us. The noble Viscount the Leader of the House said yesterday&#x2014;
<quote>"This House has now admitted, in the most formal and definite manner that I can imagine, that its moral authority in discussing and opposing this Bill is not what it was before the noble Marquess's Bill received a Second Reading."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0415"/>
<col>821</col>
I beg with all humbleness to differ from the noble Viscount. Lord Lansdowne's Bill makes this House stronger. How can we have lost our moral power when the proposals contained in Lord Lansdowne's Bill make this House stronger although smaller in numbers? How have we lost our moral power in discussing this Bill because we gave a Second Reading to Lord Lansdowne's Bill? Our powers would remain as strong as ever under that Bill although the <i>personnel</i> of the House would be entirely altered. The noble. Viscount also told us that this Bill was not final, and that this Chamber was to be reconstituted after the Bill had become law. But no matter how this Chamber is reconstituted, it will still have the Veto overshadowing it. I suppose that if this Chamber consisted of angels, with archangels sitting on the Front Benches, the deliberations of that august Assembly would be reduced by this Bill to the mere flapping of wings.<lb/>
We have been told that the subject of the Veto of the House of Lords has been before the country at two General Elections, and especially at the last election. The noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War, in his speech on Lord Lansdowne's Bill, made a great point of that, but I cannot see that the people are evincing very great interest in the matter. We do not see crowds outside the House waiting for the verdict upon this Bill. The noble Viscount mentioned the Reform Bill of 1832, and stated that the Duke of Wellington by his wise action saved the country from a great disaster&#x2014;that was when the House of Lords at first refused to pass the Reform Bill. I admit that there were riots; Bristol was half burned down, and the country was in an uproar. But there is nothing of that sort going on now. And does the noble Viscount suppose that if we did not pass this Bill, or did not pass it without amendment, there would be riots or rows of that sort?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01324"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Certainly not. I do not think there would be great riots as there were in 1832. What I said was that there might be, and probably would be, grave confusion and grave difficulties for the nation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01325"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount says there would be grave confusion and great difficulties; but when a mob
<col>822</col>
get into great confusion and difficulties I think there is very likely to be what we call in Ireland a row. Perhaps the people do not understand the gravity of the situation. Who will really govern if this Bill becomes law in its present form? The noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, admitted that the private Members' rights in the House of Commons had disappeared, that the time of the House of Commons must be taken up by Government business, and he also said that devolution was necessary. Great Government measures and great changes such as Home Rule might, under this Bill, be introduced and passed through the House of Commons and sent up to this House, talked about here and delayed for, say, two years, but then those measures would become law automatically, and all the arguments used against them in your Lordships' House would be of no avail. That is an immense power to put in the hands of a few, and those few the Cabinet of the country. I quite appreciate that it is a power worth while making a great effort to obtain. I do not think the people of this country appreciate that if this Bill becomes law that power will be handed over to these few men.<lb/>
I cannot help feeling that behind this Bill there is some force pushing the Government on. It is not the feeling of the whole of the people of this country. The noble Viscount mentioned groups. It is not because the Welsh group want Disestablishment; not because the Scottish supporters of His Majesty's Government want a change in their land laws. I venture to say it is because the Nationalist Party demand Home Rule for Ireland and cannot obtain it unless this Bill becomes law. They are a force which the Government cannot do without. They have to be reckoned with. The noble Viscount said this was an idle remark. It is no idle remark. The public utterances of the Leader of the Nationalist Party make the situation perfectly clear. They have intimated to the Government that unless the power of this House is taken away and unless they are granted Home Rule, they will deal with the Government as they think fit. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack stated that the feeling against Home Rule was weakening in Ireland amongst Unionists, and especially amongst the young Unionists and loyalists of that country. I can assure the noble and
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0416"/>
<col>823</col>
learned Lord&#x2014;I wish he were now in his place&#x2014;that nothing of the sort has occurred. Devolution has been laughed out of the field of Irish politics entirely, laughed out by Unionists and Nationalists alike; and the Nationalist Party recognise that there is a strong Party in Ireland who are determined not to have Home Rule. I am not speaking particularly of the North of Ireland, which, as noble Lords opposite know, is bitterly opposed to Home Rule; but there is a strong party and a scattered party in the south just as determined that they will not have Home Rule.<lb/>
I will tell your Lordships why they will not have Home Rule. They will not have it because they do not wish the government of their country handed over to men who are the avowed enemies of this country. That there is a weakening of opinion against Home Rule in Ireland I deny most absolutely. Ireland is a fair land, and it is worth fighting for. It is a land that we all love, and we would not like to see it handed over to the men to whom I have referred. I live a great part of the year in Ireland, and I can confidently state that these farmers who have bought their land under the purchase laws are not nearly so keen about Home Rule as they used to be, and I venture to say that if you were to call a meeting in my own county to advocate Home Rule you would not have that sort of meeting that you could have got together in the old days. You would not have the strong and respectable farmers of the county attending the meeting and giving the object their support. The meetings that are held in the counties where the land purchase system has had full swing consist of rabble.<lb/>
I give my support to the Second Reading of this Bill on condition that Amendments, and Amendments of a grave character, are introduced in Committee, and I hope we shall insist upon the insertion of an Amendment which will prevent a Home Rule Bill being brought in under the system which will be set up by this Bill and which would preclude your Lordships from any effective voice in the matter. I think that would be disastrous. This Bill is disastrous enough as it is, but were it to bring in its train a Bill which would disintegrate the United Kingdom it would be a very serious matter. This, therefore, is a question which deserves most earnest
<col>824</col>
attention when we go into Committee on this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01326"><member>LORD HARRIS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I ask your permission to detain you for a few moments, partly because I feel disposed to make a confession and partly because I desire to make an appeal to the leaders on the other side. I confess that I am immensely relieved at the policy indicated by our leaders on the Front Bench as regards the general question covering the two Bills which have been under discussion during the last two weeks. If the noble Marquess's Bill had been challenged the other night I should have supported it without any hesitation. I have been under the conviction for some time that it was inevitable that something must be done to counteract the enormous majority on this side of the House, which instead of being its strength has really been its weakness. I recognise that in that I am not altogether in sympathy with a good many Peers on this side who do not like that Bill. In saying that I should have supported Lord Lansdowne's Bill I must not be understood as holding it to be the last word on the question of the reform of this House, but it was an honest attempt, and a very excellent attempt as a first attempt, to suggest a reasonable reform, and it has been so recognised by the two noble Viscounts on the Front Bench opposite. Well, it seems to me that tactically our position is very much stronger in consequence. We have shown the whole of the country that we are ready in a practical manner to undertake our own reform. That seems to me to put us in a very much stronger position in the constituencies than we were in before.<lb/>
Passing on to the Bill under discussion to-day, I am equally relieved to find that I can support the leaders of the Opposition as regards their policy upon this measure. I have here to make my confession&#x2014;that I do not think I am altogether in sympathy with the whole of those with whom I have sat and voted for so long. I am not altogether in sympathy with the attacks that have been made on His Majesty's Government for introducing this Bill. I confess I do not see, having regard to all the circumstances of the last four years and having regard to the division of Parties, what else the Government could have done but try and put a limit upon the delay which this House has the power
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0417"/>
<col>825</col>
of imposing upon legislation. That is the construction&#x2014;a mild one, I dare say&#x2014;which I put on this Bill. I think they were bound to do something of the kind, and having regard to the fact that proposals of this nature have been made previously by prominent Liberal Statesmen I am not surprised at the form which they prefer. It has been suggested&#x2014;and this is one matter in which I am not altogether in sympathy with some of those on this side of the House&#x2014;that the leaders of the Government are really in favour of single-Chamber government. I do not think that attack can be pressed. We have had an authoritative statement on that point from the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for. War. He has practically pledged the Prime Minister to bring in a Bill for the reform of this House at the earliest opportunity. That is the pledge which the noble Viscount gave, and I should imagine it is one which he felt himself entitled to make and which his leader will recognise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01327"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I pointed out that on the Third Reading of this Bill the other day the Prime Minister pledged himself to do that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01328"><member>LORD HARRIS</member><membercontribution>: Well, I will put it in that way. The noble Viscount took the opportunity of calling the attention of this House to the fact that Mr. Asquith had pledged himself to bring in a measure for the reform of this House at the earliest possible opportunity. In these circumstances I cannot associate myself with the attack upon His Majesty's Government that they are hypocritical in making this statement, and that they have in their hearts a desire for single-Chamber government. As regards this Bill, apart altogether from finance, the construction I place upon it is that it puts a limit on the amount of delay which this House has always been able to impose upon legislation, and that is all that a great many of us in speaking throughout the country have claimed for this House. I cannot speak for other noble Lords, but I have repeatedly stated on public platforms that all that the House of Lords claim to do is to put a drag on, to introduce a delay in regard to hasty legislation; and in respect of a great deal of the legislation that will come up to this House I submit that that is what this Bill does. If the maximum amount of delay which is to be legally entrusted to this
<col>826</col>
House is imposed on every legislative measure, it is obvious that no legislation but finance can pass through except under two years. That is an absurd idea. But I submit that for a great deal of the legislation that does come up to this House two years and more&#x2014;for it is more than two years&#x2014;is ample in which to discuss, amend, and endeavour to compromise, and that in the course of that time the opinion of the country must be manifested sufficiently strongly to show the Government of the day whether or not they are wise in pressing continuously the same Bill which they had introduced on the first occasion.<lb/>
But having shown that amount of sympathy with the Government, for what it is worth from a humble individual like myself, that is the limit of it; and I do venture to hope that they will not turn a deaf ear altogether to those who are anxious to see some Amendments introduced into this Bill. It seems to me that, to use a time-honoured phrase, His Majesty's Government are inebriated with the exuberance of the verbosity of their hilarious following. They think themselves all-powerful, and they are pressing their attack rather recklessly, I think, and without paying sufficient attention to their defence. They must admit that under this Bill, once it becomes law, it is possible in the course of the time limited by the Bill to introduce very dangerous legislation. I do not think that they can possibly dispute that if a Government were so minded they could introduce very dangerous legislation. There is nothing to stop them if they have a majority behind them. May I express the hope that the Government will consider the advisability of accepting Amendments of their Bill, which they are so satisfied is all-wise and which they pledge themselves is the cure for all the ills?<lb/>
I must here interpolate that it does seem to me that the Government have not been very dignified in the way they have whined about what this House has done. They are for ever harping upon it; and an illustration of how the constituencies of this country are educated was given by the noble Lord on the Back Benches to-night, Lord Ilkeston, who referred to the Reform Bill of 1884 as an instance of how his feelings were affected towards the Rouse of Lords. The noble Lord knows just as well as any other Peer
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0418"/>
<col>827</col>
that what the House did then was simply to demand a Redistribution Bill at the same time as the Reform Bill. That was all that was done, and Mr. Gladstone admitted that it was legitimate. May I point out that this Bill if it should become an Act is capable of being subsequently amended out of recognition unless safeguards are put in. The Government say, of course, that that is impossible, but the impossible in legislation sometimes becomes the possible; and I venture to point out that for their own safety as legislators, for
<col>828</col>
their own credit, for the safety of the country, it will be wise to consider whether they should not remove the possibility of reckless legislation and take care that any new legislation of that kind affecting the Constitution should be referred to the Country.</membercontribution></p>

I venture to hope that your Lordships will consider, if there should be any difference of opinion on the points raised in this Bill, that they had better be discussed in Committee. It is purely a technical Bill dealing with certain practical difficulties which have arisen in the conduct of trustee business. I am bringing in the Bill on behalf of all the great insurance companies and banks who are doing trustee business. They are practically unanimous in support of this Bill, and have asked me to bring it in. I have not heard of any opposition to it, and the Public Trustee, I understand, has been communicated with and sees no reason for opposing the Second Reading. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack has also been good enough to inform me that he sees no reason why the Second Reading should not be agreed to, and, of course, any discussion on clauses might come in Committee. I hope, in these circumstances, your Lordships will be good enough to agree to the Second Reading of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PARLIAMENT BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01434">Debate on the Motion for the Second Reading <i>resumed</i> (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01435"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think your Lordships will have noticed a very strange feature in the conduct of their case for this Bill by the members of His Majesty's Government. I do not think one of them has attempted to explain the provisions of the Bill or to defend them, and therefore your Lordships will pardon me if for a few moments I bring your attention back to some of those features of the Bill which make it probably the most extraordinary Bill as well as a Bill of the gravest import that has ever been presented to Parliament. I ask the members of His Majesty's Government whether, if the Parliament Bill became law in its present
<col>840</col>
shape, the House of Commons as it would then exist would resemble any other First Chamber in the civilised world. Would there be any other First Chamber so absolutely unfettered and uncontrolled in the exercise of the powers entrusted to it? Your Lordships know that no other example can be quoted. Secondly, I would ask, Is there to be found in the whole civilised world any Second Chamber remotely resembling the House of Lords as it would be then&#x2014;any Second Chamber so impotent for effective influence over legislation, any Second Chamber that could be more correctly described as a sham than this House would be if this Bill became law. Though no supporter of the Government can be found to question either of those propositions, there is not one who will not indignantly repudiate the suggestion that this is nothing but a Bill for the establishment of single-Chamber government. "Misunderstood" is their attitude whenever we make such a suggestion, but, after all, the matter is capable of comparatively simple proof.<lb/>
Is it true or not that if this Bill became law the House of Commons, by the affirmation of a Bill thrice repeated, could abolish this House in its entirety? Is it true or not that the same House of Commons by the same process could prolong its own tenure of life indefinitely? If those powers were possessed by a King instead of a Chamber, what member of the Bench opposite would not denounce it as government by a single man? We were told last night by Lord Ilkeston, and we have been told several times, how great would be the opportunity for influence that this House might possess during the two years when a Bill passed by the House of Commons would be suspended. We have had a pretty picture drawn of the serious consideration the House of Commons would give to Amendments passed by this House. We have been told how sensitive the House of Commons would be to public feeling in the country, and how impossible&#x2014;that is the word that has been used&#x2014;it would be for the House of Commons to persist in carrying any measure as to which signs of disapproval were manifest in the country. It is a very pretty picture, my Lords, but one not remotely resembling the truth.<lb/>
What would be the real position? Let us endeavour to forecast the history of the next three years, supposing this Bill became
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0425"/>
<col>841</col>
law. The first measure that His Majesty's Government would endeavour to pass through the House of Commons and present to this House would be a Bill for the establishment of a Parliament and an Executive in Dublin. We will assume that your Lordships rejected this Bill. For two years His Majesty's Government would have the Irish members in the palm of their hand. The whole interest of every Nationalist Member would be to keep that Government in office at any cost for two years in order to get their Bill. The next measure might be a Bill for the disestablishment of the four dioceses of the Church of England in Wales. That measure might also be rejected by your Lordships on the ground that the country had never had it submitted to them. But once that measure had been launched on its two years' course, we know that the strength of feeling of the Welsh Radical Members&#x2014;perfectly conscientious feeling&#x2014;would induce them during those two years to do everything they could to keep the Government in office. Then there is a third measure. The Government have just introduced a measure dealing with those great industrial questions which centre round the Osborne Judgment if have not seen the measure, and therefore what I say has no relation to that measure. It has been suggested that His Majesty's Government might introduce a Bill for the reversal of the Osborne Judgment. Supposing they had done so or did so in the future. Supposing that on this Bill which they have just introduced they proved as squeezable in the House of Commons as they were upon the Taff Vale Bill, and that that Bill was also launched on its two years' career. Why nothing that they could do in the next two years would make the Labour Party and the Socialists vote against them. Therefore there would be a series of groups of Members intensely interested in particular Bills, who would combine to prevent the Government from going out of office or from changing their policy, even if they wished to do so. So far from the Government being influenced by the opinion of the country, no not if every by-election was going against them would these groups in the House of Commons for one moment allow them to relax their energy in prosecuting these measures.<lb/>
Whatever their views about the controversy between the two Parties or between the two Houses may be, I say with conviction that the country have not realised that the whole Constitution is to
<col>842</col>
be subjected to the same treatment as, and is under no better safeguards than, any other subject of legislation; that this House will have no effective power to safeguard anypart of the Constitution which the House of Commons of its own sole will in three years chooses to tamper with, alter, or revolutionise. We alone will present the astonishing spectacle to civilised man that we will have given to a Single Chamber the authority to treat the most sacred parts of the Constitution by exactly the same process as they would treat a gas and water Bill. When it was proposed in the House of Commons to differentiate between the Constitution and normal legislation, the Prime Minister, who is not afraid to play the part of a revolutionary with regard to the essence of the Constitution, was positively shocked at the idea that anybody could be found to make such a proposal as to separate Constitutional from ordinary questions.<lb/>
Not one other civilised country treats its Constitution like that&#x2014;not one of our Dominions, not the Liberal Party when they are dealing with their own private affairs. I hold in my hand a copy of the rules of the National Liberal Club. It is not a very recent copy, but. I do not think it is probable that this rule has been changed. Rule 45 runs as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"Except as herein provided no now rule, or alteration of an existing rule, and no resolution having the effect of altering an existing rule, shall be made or passed, unless it is made or passed by two-thirds of the members voting at an annual or special general meeting, at which not less than one hundred vote in the majority."</quote>
You will see the wisdom and scrupulous care with which the Radical Party protect their private affairs at the National Liberal Club; but when it comes to the foundations of the Constitution they are not prepared to give any greater security than is extended to the most trivial subject of legislation which comes before Parliament.<lb/>
It was pointed out in another place that it was possible that the House of Commons might abuse its power. On this subject Mr. Asquith waxed most indignant. He said that the presumption was that the House of Commons would use its great power with great moderation, and that it was impossible and absurd to suppose that they could be guilty of such an abuse of it as, for instance, to prolong their own tenure of office. My Lords, there is the very human opinion of a very capable man,
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0426"/>
<col>843</col>
who thinks that he, at any rate, among the human race is not unfit for despotic power. That is a mere <i>obiter dictum</i> of the Prime Minister. The whole teachings of history contradict him. You cannot find, in all the volumes of history, under any form of government&#x2014;aristocracy, democracy, autocracy&#x2014;a single case in which unchecked and uncontrolled power has not in the long run been abused. All despotisms are the same, whether it is the despotism of one man or of one Chamber. The thing about which the Prime Minister waxed so eloquent has actually occurred in our own England, for the only Parliament that has hitherto been endowed with the same uncontrolled power that the Government now claim for the House of Commons abused it in a manner which is notorious in history.<lb/>
What is the excuse that the Government give for dealing with this great question in the manner they have chosen to deal with it? The Lord Chancellor has told us several times. He has said, "We had no chance of talking with our enemy in the gate till we have put ourselves on a level with him by some such Bill as this." The meaning of that is that, if the Government had brought in a measure dealing with the whole question in a permanent form&#x2014;a measure for the reconstruction of this House and for regulating the relations between the two Houses&#x2014;without first making this House an impotent feature in the Constitution, they would have been at our mercy, that they would have had no means of forcing their measure and their plan through this House. I understand that the Government have some plan for forcing this Bill through this House. What that plan is I do not know, but it is quite obvious that they could have got a measure dealing with the whole question in a fair and statesmanlike manner passed into law by whatever plan they propose to get the Parliament Bill passed into law, and therefore that argument will not bear examination.<lb/>
I think we are justified, by all that has hitherto taken place, in saying that the Government and their Party are determined, if they can, to make a Party settlement of this great Constitutional question. Why? The Government and their Party have always homage to democracy on their lips, but in their hearts they honestly and fervently believe that they know much better than the democracy what is good for it; and what they want is the opportunity of passing into law a
<col>844</col>
whole series of measures, which they may conscientiously believe to be good, whether the electors want them or not. Take Home Rule as an illustration. In 1886, after full discussion in the House of Commons and in the country, Home Rule was rejected by the electorate of the United Kingdom. In 1895, after two years' discussion of a Home Rule measure which had passed through the House of Commons and had been rejected by this House, the electors again rejected Home Rule. In 1912, if the Government have their way, there will again be a Home Rule Bill which will pass into law in the year 1914, and the electors are never to be given a chance of saying whether they wish for it or not. The Government are not prepared in these matters to accept the final will of the electors. It is their will, their belief of what is good for the electors, that at all costs they are prepared to impose upon the country.<lb/>
And what is the excuse that Mr. Asquith gives for this? "Oh," in effect says Mr. Asquith&#x2014;
<quote>"it is quite true that at the General Election in December, 1910, there was no Home Rule Bill before the electors."</quote>
Indeed, there was not, my Lords, because no Bill had been printed, or published, or even drafted. And what in effect is Mr. Asquith's conclusion?
<quote>"Every elector who voted for me or my followers knew that I was in favour of Home Rule, and, therefore, I and my Party have a mandate for Home Rule."</quote>
If that doctrine is correct, then Mr. Gladstone had a mandate for Home Rule in 1892. Were the electors who voted for the noble Viscount opposite and his colleagues in 1892 under any doubt as to the opinions of Mr. Gladstone and his friends on the subject of Home Rule? Yet, when the next election came, it was proved conclusively, so that no denial ever comes even from those Benches, that the electors of this country were not in favour at that time of the policy of Home Rule, which the then Government had endeavoured to pass into law. What becomes of the Prime Minister's doctrine now that, because the electors knew that he was in favour of Home Rule, last December they gave him and his Government a mandate to pass a Home Rule Bill? The Prime Minister's argument is flimsy enough, but if you want the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> I would ask you to look at the speech which the Leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, made on the same
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0427"/>
<col>845</col>
occasion. He improved on the Prime Minister's theory, and I understand him to have said that in his opinion the electors had given a mandate for every proposal that appeared in the speeches or in the election address of any Radical candidate at the last election. This elaborate theory, so admirably exposed last night by my noble friend, that the House of Commons, during the first two years of its existence is necessarily and completely the counterpart of the electors of this country, will not bear the weight that you try to put upon it. It is a position which is untenable and which you must abandon.<lb/>
Then we have the Lord Chancellor, who, I think, will take it as a compliment from me if I describe him as the most inveterate opponent of the principle of the Referendum. The Lord Chancellor tells us that this Bill was referred to the people in a Referendum last December and was approved by them. It is quite true that this Bill had been printed and published, but it is also true that, not only had the electors not been furnished with a copy of the Bill, but it had not been discussed for a single day in the House of Commons. That is a perfect travesty of the Referendum. The Referendum which we propose would always be after full and complete discussion in both Houses of Parliament&#x2014;a Referendum such as could have been taken on Home Rule in 1893, or as might be taken on any great Constitutional question after it had been debated in both Houses. If the Lord Chancellor is going to apply, even in this travestied manner, our arguments for a Referendum to the election of last December, I would remind him that in that election something perilously near half the electors voted against the Bill.<lb/>
The fact is that the Government are the worst possible defenders&#x2014;I would say the most clumsy defenders&#x2014;of the representative principle in the House of Commons to which they attach so much importance. I, also, am an admirer of the representative principle; I, also, believe with the noble Viscount that it is the best form of government that has yet been devised for a democratic State. But what I do say is this. The great danger of representative government is that it should pass under the control of the Party machine and the man who runs the Party machine. I say more. I say that representative government and democracy are incompatible if a Single Chamber is subjected to the danger of passing under the
<col>846</col>
control of the Party machine and the man who manages the Party machine. The point I would make in this connection is this, that if you want to preserve a really strong House of Commons, that is one in which the representatives of the people are not the mere puppets of the Party machine, it is essential that you should have a strong Second Chamber in order to have those checks and counterbalances in the Constitution without which the representatives of the people will lose their independence. For the very existence of a strong House of Commons you must have a strong House of Lords.<lb/>
In the course of this debate we have had eloquent appeals to us to approach this matter with moderation and to recognise the gravity of the crisis. I do not think noble Lords opposite would accuse us of having, on the whole, taken up a different attitude as yet. But when they appeal to us to be moderate, when the Lord Chancellor and his colleagues talk of the years of humiliation and trial they have gone through, I ask the Government whether they forget the flood of vituperative mendacity which has been poured on this House by their Party during the last two years. In almost every speech, article, or cartoon, it is not the exercise of your Lordships' powers that has been held up to invective and ridicule; it is not your mistakes that have been deplored, but your personal honour, your personal intelligence, and your patriotism. Every cartoon has represented only one class of Peer, the bloated or the idiotic. The Chancellor of the Exchequer excelled himself in his flights of low invective against the individuals of whom your Lordships' House is composed. The Home Secretary also indulged in carefully studied insults which he levelled at those who only a few years before he had called his friends.<lb/>
And other members of the Government, in speech after speech, as the commonplace of their arguments, named reform after reform&#x2014;the emancipation of the Roman Catholics, the admission of the Jews to the privileges of citizenship, the removal from the Dissenters of the disabilities under which they laboured&#x2014;as instances of the obstruction of the House of Lords. These and a hundred others have been used, and our countrymen have been told that the House of Lords had for three, four, five, or six years obstructed the reforms which a
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0428"/>
<col>847</col>
beneficent House of Commons was burning to grant; but they forgot to tell the electors that the same House of Commons had refused the same reforms for any period varying from 50 to 200 years. We do not forget these things; we shall not forget them, but they will not influence us in the course which we may think it our duty to take on this occasion. We shall put those insults and those lies aside. We shall endeavour to continue to deserve the character which noble Lords opposite, while deploring our politics, have constantly given us throughout these discussions. We have two classes of opponents to deal with. One part of the Radical Party, but I fear the majority, know exactly what they want, and, if they can, mean to get it. What they want is single-Chamber government, naked and unashamed, and they do not pretend that they want anything else. But there are other members, who, I think, do not agree with them. They really think that this is in itself not an immoderate proposal. They regard it as a stepping stone to something that may be universally accepted as a reasonable settlement of the Constitutional question. There are many such in this House. If this Bill becomes law and no opportunity is afforded of restoring stability to the Constitution, those noble Lords will live most bitterly to rue and deplore the part they took in the establishment of single-Chamber government.<lb/>
Last night, if I understood him rightly, the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack told us that all that he and his Party asked for was fair play in this House between both the great Parties in the State. Then, said the Lord Chancellor, they might consider whether some shorter method of settling differences might not be devised than that contemplated in the Parliament Bill. We have all through this controversy been prepared, we are now prepared, to go far to meet you in reconstructing this House so that it shall be fair to both Parties alike when they are in office, and also in constructing Constitutional machinery for adjusting differences of opinion between the two Houses, or for ascertaining the definite opinion of the electors on grave issues. But if your conception of the solution of those grave issues is merely to tack on a reconstructed House of Lords to the present Parliament Bill, then we cannot Meet you. What we regard as essential to the stability of the Constitution and the
<col>848</col>
existence of liberty in our country is that the House of Lords, however reconstructed, should possess adequate powers, such powers as are universally possessed by Second Chambers in all civilised foreign countries, and in every Dominion of the Empire, such powers as you yourselves advised the King to grant to the Second Chamber of the Transvaal just four years ago.<lb/>
We have advised your Lordships, so far as it lies within our competence fitly to do so, to read this Bill a second time. We have given that advice because we realise the gravity, the dreadful gravity, of the Constitutional crisis, and because it is not we who are going to slain the door in the face of a national instead of a Party settlement. If the door is slammed on this question of powers, it will be by the Party opposite. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack spoke of the General Election and reminded us of the majority which his Party had acquired at that General Election. It is true that you got a majority of 120 or thereabouts at that election. But we go behind that majority. We know that the actual size of that majority was due to a great extent to the astonishing manner in which the seats are distributed. We know that we have behind us in this great struggle no less than one-half of the whole population of this country. That is a knowledge which inspires us. We should be false trustees to these millions of our fellow-countrymen who agree with us in this crisis if under that inspiration we were not strong.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01436"><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, for several reasons it is not my intention to intervene for any length of time in this discussion. The position of the Government has been stated by the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, and by his colleagues not only with fulness but I think with clearness and in unmistakable and identical terms. The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, condemned us for not having dealt with and explained the measure which is now before the House, but I think he rather fell into the same error himself. His remarks did not seem to me to be directed to any large extent to the proposals in the Bill. I do not complain of that, because, after all, this is the end of a long chapter of recent political controversy and the proposals of the Government must be intimately
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0429"/>
<col>849</col>
and in detail well known to your Lordships. There is another reason why I think it is unnecessary to intervene for any length of time in this discussion at this moment, and that is that it is the intention of the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition and his colleagues to vote for the Second Reading of this Bill. That has greatly limited the interest and usefulness of this discussion, and the public mind is moving on to the consideration of the next stage of this Bill.<lb/>
The noble Earl who has just sat down, in the earlier portion of his remarks, asked us to point to any House of Commons, or indeed to any House of Lords, which, if this Bill were passed, would occupy an analogous position. I submit with great respect that however useful a study of the Constitutions of other countries may be, when all is said and done there are no real analogies. There are no Constitutions which are really analogous to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, for when you are considering institutions you must consider and bear in mind history and tradition, circumstances of one kind or of another, and it is not possible to draw but the most superficial contributions to this discussion from an examination of the Constitution of, we will say, South Africa, or any other parts of the Empire, and still less, let me suggest, from the constitution of the National Liberal Club. The noble Earl holds up to us the fear that if this Bill were passed the other House of Parliament might proceed under the powers which it would then have to abolish this House, but surely it is the case that at the present time a great deal might be done which would be very foolish by this House, or by the other House in conjunction, if they had a mind to. It would be quite possible for the House of Commons or the House of Lords to pass most extravagant legislation, instances of which might easily be imagined by any of your Lordships. The truth is that the ultimate guarantee for the wisdom and judgment with which legislation is carried on in this country is not to be found solely in the form of the House of Commons or the House of Lords. Constitutions are of great importance, but of equal importance at least is the way in which Constitutions are worked; and the ultimate guarantee for the good government of this country must always lie in the good sense and good judgment of the people themselves.<lb/>
<col>850</col>
It is a great satisfaction to us to find that whatever differences exist between the two sides in regard to this measure, the House is to be allowed to proceed to the next stage before anything is done which may emphasise or stereotype those differences. I make bold to express the hope that when we get to the next stage these proceedings will not be unduly protracted or aggravated by a reluctance on the part of noble Lords opposite to make concessions which are altogether unavoidable. Discussions of this question are apt to be the cause of friction and ill-feeling. Many speeches are inevitably made under such conditions which are based upon a disparagement of the House of Commons. Such discussions cannot further good feeling and reduce differences to their lowest possible limit. I do say for those who have spoken on this side of the House that I think it is a little unfair to taunt them&#x2014;as I remember my noble friend Lord St. Davids was taunted&#x2014;upon their friendly feeling to this House as an institution. I cannot see why what goes on in every other branch of life in this country should not be allowed to operate here. There is no body of men in this country who work together among whom there is not engendered a feeling of loyalty to the institution with which they are associated, and you will find on this side of the House just as great friendliness and loyalty to the legitimate influence of this House in legislation and in the government of the country as you will in any other quarter of it. It is quite true, as has been said in this debate, that this controversy is the result of long moving and silent forces, but however long and silent this movement may have been, what precipitated this conflict was the rejection by your Lordships of the Budget two years ago. For that rejection you have not to thank any who sit upon this side of the House. That rejection strengthened our cause, and aroused public attention, in a way which no efforts of ours would ever have succeded in doing, to the issues involved.<lb/>
We have been reproached in this debate for not having contributed our share in the advance which has been made towards common ground in this controversy. I think that reproach is wholly unfounded. The noble Viscount who introduced this Bill recounted the history of these proposals, going back to the forties and
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0430"/>
<col>851</col>
reminding your Lordships that Mr. Bright in the early eighties outlined the proposals which are now, in a somewhat different form, embodied in the Bill before the House. It should also be remembered that in the year 1907, four years ago, the late Prime Minister unfolded the proposals which are the foundation of this Bill to the House of Commons. They have been before three Parliaments. They have obtained the assent by overwhelming majorities of the House of Commons in three successive Parliaments. Two General Elections have been held, when these proposals were fully before the electors of this country. Only one thing can be done at the time. There is no other Constitutional method at this time of ascertaining the will of the people but by a General Election, and there is no other Constitutional instrument except the present House of Commons to transmit the will of the people to Parliament. In December of last year, before your reform Resolutions had been brought before this House, our proposals for the adjustment of the relations between the two Houses were quite specifically before the country. I ask your Lordships to reflect how very large the sacrifices have been of the Government in taking these steps, painfully and laboriously handicapped with all the obvious disadvantages and difficulties of our position. We have laid aside all other work in spite of the impatience and eagerness of our followers and the various groups to which the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, alluded. The country has been put to the turmoil and the expense of two General Elections. Bearing these considerations in mind, I ask have we not contributed our full share to the sacrifices which have been necessary to bring this question to the present stage of maturity? The country has expressed its view. The question is ripe, and overripe for settlement.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01441"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: From the introduction of the Resolutions up to the time of the General Election noble Lords on this side of the House had no opportunity, except in the last few days, of putting forward their views.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01442"><member>LORD PENTLAND</member><membercontribution>: I think there is very little substance in the criticism of the noble Lord, and with the greatest respect I will tell him why. It was on June 24, 1907, that the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman first outlined this proposal to the House of Commons. He then gave full notice to Parliament and to the country that the Government, in their own time, and as soon as they might find it convenient, would proceed to lay proposals on those definite lines before Parliament. But I venture to suggest to the noble Viscount another answer. There is no man in this House better acquainted with the methods of political controversy than the noble Viscount. For many years he sat in the House of Commons, and I am sure he is perfectly fair-minded. I would ask him whether there is any comparison between the maturity of one set of proposals and the other? It takes years in this country before the public becomes accustomed to specific proposals. It is more than seventy years since these proposals were first outlined; more than forty years ago they had the great authority of Mr. John Bright; they have repeatedly been referred to in public controversy ever since, and for four years they have been an active issue&#x2014;actively in the background of all political controversy in this country. And then the noble Viscount seeks to place before the country as equally ripe for the judgment of the people the proposals which were outlined in some haste by two noble Lords who brought forward two sets of Resolutions. I confess I should not have touched upon this point, but I believe it will be found that nothing has surprised and even shocked the good sense of the country so much as the haste with which those Resolutions and proposals were
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0431"/>
<col>853</col>
formulated and brought before the country eight months ago.<lb/>
In the first place, the country has decided against your Lordships' proposals, and we are obliged to work with the machinery we have. In the second place, your proposals do not meet the real issue. What is wanted is greater facility for the passage of legislation. Your proposals offer no greater facilities for the passage of legislation in the immediate future, and I submit to you that there is urgent public need to consider this point. We have been reminded over and over again in this debate of the long tenure of office of the Unionist Party after the General Election in 1895. It is not an unreasonable view, from our standpoint, that these were years of reaction, and the complete acquiescence of the country in administrative action which we have taken since in direct reversal of the acts of the Unionist Government tends to strengthen the contention that those were years of reaction, and reaction of a character not approved by the country. Take the abolition of Chinese labour and the granting of self-government to South Africa. It is perfectly well-known that those two acts, which were administrative acts in their first stages, were acts which had the disapproval of this House, and yet they have won the approval of the people concerned both in South Africa and in this country.<lb/>
Your Lordships have, offered, instead of any modification of the relations of the two Houses, proposals for a reform of the constitution of this House. That does not meet the real issue. For years we have endeavoured to get rid of what we consider the injustice of plural voting. Over and over again this House has rejected proposals of that character, and they have always been rejected on the plea that equal electoral districts is also a reform which is required. In just the same way we are met on this occasion with proposals which do not meet the real point and the real purpose of the legislation for which we ask. Another reason why I think the proposals which your Lordships discussed last week have complicated the situation is this, that they have enormously exaggerated the proportions of the whole controversy. They have exaggerated the perspective of the whole question. The proposals which you make call for much greater sacrifice from individual members
<col>854</col>
of this House than do the proposals embodied in this Bill. They interfere with the relations of both Houses with the Crown, and if there are any critics either in this House or outside who wish to express their wrath against revolutionary proposals and violent change, such criticism is much more properly directed in my judgment against the authors of the Resolutions and the Bill which was discussed last week than against the proposals which are contained in the Bill now before the House. Our proposals are modest by the side of the proposals which you have put forward.<lb/>
For a moment may I ask your Lordships to look at our proposals from our point of view? It may be, as we have been warned, that we are taking great risks in seeking to establish this system, and that the machinery of the Bill will be used, not on exceptional occasions, but on all occasions. That, no doubt, is a risk we run, but as a matter of fact the charge that this is a single-Chamber proposal rests, if it is calmly examined, on very slender foundations. The House of Lords has no power of Veto at present on acts of administration. The whole range of the Executive and administrative work of the Government is outside the Veto of this House. I should imagine that under this new system Departmental legislation and legislation of a minor or secondary character will still be adjusted, as it is now, by communications and conferences between the two Houses. It will be, I believe, only on matters of prime controversial legislative importance that this machinery will be invoked; and all that it does is that in such cases it permits the will of the newly-elected House of Commons to prevail. Every Government will wish to avoid delay in regard to its measures. It will not seek to apply this machinery on every occasion. There will still be the same incentives to the Government to do its work and get it out of the way as exist at present. No Government will be likely to stake its fortunes on a Bill which is unpopular in the country. It will always be in touch with the country. During the three sessions through which the machinery of this Bill is to take legislation, there will be constant by-elections, constant indications of public opinion. The Government will not wish to bring this machinery into play on every occasion, and under the Bill itself it will rest very largely with this
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0432"/>
<col>855</col>
House whether the machinery shall or shall not be brought into play.<lb/>
It is admitted that some change of this kind is necessary, and this is, in our view, the only immediate practical proposal. It asks for the minimum of advance and runs the minimum of risk from the point of view of Constitutional change. Every reason of expediency, in my humble judgment, is at the back of this Bill. But there are other reasons, and I will mention one of them. I agree with the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack in the statement, for which he has been so much criticised during this debate, that Liberal Ministers find themselves now in a position of great inferiority in this House. I will carry his argument a step further if he will allow me. I ask your Lordships to consider for a moment the effect of that inferiority upon the electorate of the country. The sense of justice and fair play which so characterises the electors of this country is outraged in every village at the present time by the position of inferiority in which the Liberal voter is placed as compared with his Conservative neighbour. The Conservative voter registers his vote at elections and knows that that vote will tell and carry; that the votes of those who agree with him will tarry the measures for which he has a preference, not only through' one House of Parliament, but through the other. The Liberal voter knows by bitter experience that his vote has no such power. He is placed in a position of cruel and degrading inferiority, at which the self-respect of the electors of the country revolts; and not the least important result of the passage of this Bill will be that by the effort it makes to establish, not complete fairness, but more complete fairness than at present exists, it will bring about some measure of reconciliation between the Parliament and the people of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01443"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just sat down observed that a considerable amount of interest had departed from this debate in view of the fact that no Division is to be challenged. Well, even if that be the case there is at all events one charge which nobody can bring against this debate though it has been frequently made in the case of others&#x2014;nobody can say that this has not been a real debate. In fact, I can recollect no debate in which there has been such a
<col>856</col>
complete absence of imposture of all kinds. As an ordinary rule when Ministers bring in a first-class measure they indulge in a series of elaborate portentous platitudes for the purpose of pointing out the extraordinary advantages which they are conferring upon the general community. In this debate, I am bound to admit, noble Lords have not for a single moment or in one single instance said anything of that kind. This Bill, the Government have openly admitted, is a Bill to pay off old scores and to secure the predominance,&#x2014;the eternal predominance, if it can be secured&#x2014;of the Liberal Party. Yet this is the Bill which Lord Pentland, with artless simplicity, described as constituting a great sacrifice on the part of the Party to which he belongs. All I have to say with regard to that is that my ideas of sacrifice are fundamentally different from those of Lord Pentland. My idea of a sacrifice is that you are giving something up whether you like it or not. Lord Pentland's idea of a sacrifice is this. His Party, utilising their majority with the most relentless purpose, bring in a Bill for the purpose of establishing the indefinite predominance of their Party, and say, "You may make as many objections as you like, you may say whatever you please, but our chance has come; we mean to take advantage of it, and you are greatly mistaken if you think you are going to get any concessions whatever out of us."<lb/>
There have been a few somewhat perfunctory consolations offered to us by noble Lords opposite. Lord Pentland was extremely profuse in his expressions of extreme, indeed intense, friendliness towards this House and his brother Peers, but I am bound to say that the attitude adopted by the noble Lord and some of his colleagues suggests to me the case of a heartless surgeon who might say to his prospective patient, "It is true that I propose to cut off your arms, and whilst I am about it I think I may as well cut off your legs; but you have absolutely nothing to complain of, because you will still be able to talk as much as yon please." But if there is not much consolation to be obtained from noble Lords opposite, there is even less consolation to be derived from the speech made by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack yesterday. I say it with great regret, because I entertain a high respect for the noble and learned.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0433"/>
<col>857</col>
Lord&#x2014;a higher respect for him than I do for any other member of His Majesty's Government. The noble and learned Lord's speech amounted to an uncompromising attitude which almost reached the point of vindictiveness. I hope that when the other noble and learned Lord, Viscount Haldane, speaks later in the debate he may display a rather more judicial and at the same time a rather more Christian spirit.<lb/>
The burden of the complaint of the Lord Chancellor has always been the same. He has often spoken of the intolerable ignominy which has pursued his Party during the last few years, and he has recited, not once but on several occasions, a catalogue of his complaints against us. What, in reality, do these complaints amount to? I am one of those persons who have never denied that the Liberal Party have a legitimate grievance against this House. But let us examine the statement. What is the net loss of the Liberal Party since they came into office in 1906? I contend, looking at the history of these past years in a perfectly impartial spirit, that the only net loss which they can fairly claim in addition to the unknown Bills with regard to Scotland which nobody but the noble Lord opposite could name to save his life, is that of the Plural Voting Bill. I decline to include the Education Bill as a Bill that was lost, because so far as I know there is nothing to prevent an Education Bill passing with the consent of the two Parties whenever the Government set themselves to the work. I also decline to admit that the Licensing Bill represents a loss, because the Government were able to introduce the punitive clauses of that Bill into "the People's Budget."<lb/>
Well, if the net loss of the Liberal Party does not amount to more than I have stated during the last few years, what is their prospective loss? What is the particular boon and blessing for which the people and the Liberal Party are pining at the present moment? It is fairly obvious, I think, that that particular boon is certainly not Home Rule, whatever may be the feeling of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. It obviously cannot be Home Rule, because Home Rule is merely a species of blackmail levied upon the Liberal Party. When the Liberal Party is in a prosperous position and in possession of a large independent majority,
<col>858</col>
the blackmailer is kept successfully at a distance. He is warned off. No allusion is made, to him in electoral addresses. In fact, members of the Liberal Party go so far as to state that they are in opposition to anything of the kind. But when the circumstances of the Liberal Party are less prosperous, then it is necessary to treat the blackmailer as a sort of friend, a welcome friend, and to gush over him and pretend that you are delighted to enjoy his society, whereas everybody knows perfectly well that there is nothing that the Liberal Party detests so much. This particular form of imposture is a thing which does not take in any sensible person or any one who knows anything about politics at all, because everybody, however stupid he may be, naturally must have realised by this time that if it were not for the blackmailing pressure of the Irish Party we should not be discussing this Bill at the present moment.<lb/>
When I consider the situation in which we are placed&#x2014;and when I say "we" I mean our Party&#x2014;at the present time I confess to a feeling of exasperation that we have been beaten, not upon merits, but because we have been out-man&#x0153;uvred and jockeyed throughout the last few years. I know that the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack will deny it, but as a matter of fact even the ignorant person whom I quoted just now knows perfectly well that when the Liberals came in in 1906 they came in with the clear and avowed intention of forcing a fight with this House. They started on their campaign as soon as they could, but for a considerable time met with scarcely any success. The Education Bill was lost without apparently those feelings of indignation which are attributed to the Liberal voter by the noble Lord opposite, Lord Pentland. The same phenomenon attended the loss of the Licensing Bill. Nobody raised a hand, so to speak, in favour of that measure. The two particular measures which were sent up here for the purpose of forcing on the fight were, greatly to the dissatisfaction of the Liberal Party and their followers, accepted by this House&#x2014;I am alluding, of course, to the Eight Hours (Mines) Bill and the Trades Disputes Bill.<lb/>
It was not until the idea of "the People's Budget" took root in the mind of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer that there appeared even a probability of
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0434"/>
<col>859</col>
success in the campaign against this House. Unfortunately for us that Budget gave to the Chancellor of the Exchequer an opportunity, of which, so far as I know, no British Minister had ever before availed himself, to appeal, and appeal with success, to the predatory instincts of the British voter. Any one who remembers the character and the tenor of the speeches made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer during this particular phase of the controversy will hardly differ from me when I say that the gist of all those speeches was&#x2014;"Vote for me and I will put the property of your political opponents in your pockets. The only obstacle in the way of my carrying this out is the House of Lords, which is composed of hereditary despots who stand in your light and desire to shift the burden of taxation from their shoulders on to yours." There really is no resisting this species of electioneering. It is a Napoleonic method which it is almost impossible to combat successfully. Indeed, I have wondered privately why so ninny people voted for us in view of the inducements which were held out to them from the other side. Filially we were goaded and jockeyed, so to speak, into throwing out the Budget, and we embarked upon the fight in circumstances as unfavourable as could well have been imagined, and we emerged from that fight more successfully than the most sanguine could have hoped&#x2014;at all events more successfully than I ever permitted myself to hope.<lb/>
Then following this process to which I have alluded we were induced to enter into a Conference, when it was fairly obvious that the Irish and the Labour allies of the Government would never permit a compromise to be arrived at, and we were further induced to maintain secrecy as regards the proceedings during that Conference. We were induced to suspend hostile operations in the shape of going on with the proposals for the reform of this House whilst those negotiations continued. Then, finally, we had an election sprung upon us when there was no expectation of anything of the kind, and the voter, weary and apathetic, repeated with considerably less emphasis what he had said a year previously. Now the Liberal Party having obtained, as I admit they did, a verdict against this House at the second election, propose to utilise that power for the purpose of dealing with Home Rule and
<col>860</col>
other matters which they are afraid to submit to the country. In view of the great tactical success which has attended the operation of the Government, I confess to feeling some admiration for the way in which it has been carried out. The difference between a Unionist Administration and a Liberal Administration always seems to me to lie this. In a Unionist Administration all the men included in it are persons who entertain the same views, unless they happen to be divided upon the fiscal question, and they advance, so to speak, at the same pace whether they are taking part in a cavalry charge or a funeral procession.<lb/>
But the case is totally different in a Liberal Administration. When a Liberal Administration is formed certain people are put into the Government for the purpose of conciliating the stalwarts and the extreme members of the Party and to make them believe that real business is intended. On the other hand, a certain number of other gentlemen are put in to persuade the old women of the Party that real business is not intended. These gentlemen, who are usually described as moderate Liberals enjoy a particularly enviable position in tie political world, for whenever they do right, which is not very often by the way, they are invariably supported by the whole force of the Unionist Party here and elsewhere. They are treated as sacrosanct individuals to criticise whom is next door to blasphemy. But then occasionally, or perhaps it would be more correct to say frequently, these so-called moderate Liberals do not do the right thing, but do the wrong thing. A speaker in the House of Commons not so very long ago described them as gentlemen who were put into the Government for the purpose of acting as watchdogs, but who really did nothing but watch to see which way the cat would jump. I would give a great deal to hear the absolutely candid and truthful opinion of my noble friend Lord Rosebery on the moderate Liberal. He has had more to do with them than anybody else, and I suspect that on the whole he has suffered more from them. I have no hesitation in saying, and I do not say it in any offensive sense, that in my opinion the moderate Liberal is without exception far and away the biggest political fraud that exists, and he exercises about as much influence upon the direction of Liberal policy as the figurehead of a steamer exercises upon the means by which it is propelled.
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0435"/>
<col>861</col>
I cannot help admiring the skill with which these two wings of the Liberal Party have been brought together over this Bill by means of the mystic Preamble. This Preamble is to be carried into effect as and when the proper time arrives. It is so easy to catch the timid and moderate voter, and reassure him by the mystic words included in the Preamble. The Party wirepuller goes to these people and says, "Why are you nervous? What is there to be afraid of? The Government is full of Second Chamber men. Look at Mr. A, and Mr. B, and Sir Somebody Something, and Lord Somebody Else&#x2014;they are all sound Second Chamber men, and they are absolutely committed to the principle of an effective Second Chamber."<lb/>
The position of the moderate Liberal with regard to the creation of an effective Second Chamber reminds me of a personal experience of my own. I was once travelling in a European country the ruler of which honoured me with his friendship, and on one occasion he said, "It is a curious thing that you who do not appear to be absolutely devoid of intelligence are, I understand, a Conservative. Now, I am a Liberal, and I find it very difficult to understand how anybody with any sense and intelligence can fail to be a Liberal too." I replied, "Sir, it is a curious fact, but I have just been visiting your prison, and all the prisoners undergoing the heaviest sentences and wearing the heaviest manacles inform me they are suffering their punishment because they are Liberals and for no other reason." My illustrious friend was a trifle perplexed, but he said, "The case is not so complicated as you imagine. It is perfectly true that I am a Liberal, but I am only a Liberal in principle. I never put it into practice, and if any of my subjects endeavour to put Liberalism into practice I put them into prison and leave them there until they arrive at a different frame of mind." The position of the moderate Liberals with regard to a Second Chamber seems to be analogous to the position of these unfortunate people. I cannot help thinking that if any moderate Liberal insisted upon setting up a thoroughly effective Second Chamber he would very soon find himself cast into the outer darkness, and he would be a singularly fortunate individual if he was able to take refuge in the comparative seclusion of this Assembly.<lb/>
I am not at all sure that we ought to accept this, not exactly proffered but hinted,
<col>862</col>
gift of an effective Second Chamber at the hands of our opponents. For my part I look upon it as a gift of the Trojan horse description. The noble Lord used these words yesterday&#x2014;
<quote>"When some method of procedure which involves less delay and which is more expeditious than that proposed by the present Bill may be found to commend itself to all Parties."</quote>
To my mind that has a very sinister and suspicious ring, and connecting it with speeches made by the Prime Minister and by Mr. Churchill in the House of Commons not long ago it seems to me that what the reformers have in their minds is a Chamber which shall be, if possible, even more impotent than this Chamber will be under this Bill. I understand that the Prime Minister has a grievance now, but his grievance will not be removed when the Parliament Bill is passed, for he says&#x2014;
<quote>"You will still have a hereditary Chamber, every man of which is an enemy; and in that case, supposing a Unionist Administration is returned to office, these people will pass any Bill sent from the House of Commons, but will reject anything expressing the will of the people so long as a Liberal Government is in office."</quote>
Therefore we ought to be extremely chary in accepting suggestions of this kind.<lb/>
In the course of this debate a good deal has been said as to whether the question of one or two Chambers was put properly before the electors during the recent election. For my part I do not feel any doubt upon the subject at all. If it was not put properly before the electors then I can only say it must have been our own fault. I, like other noble Lords, took part, not a modest part, in the election, and I endeavoured to the best of my ability to make the blood of my hearers creep in describing the horrors of single-Chamber government, but I am bound to confess that my experience was that the voter was less horrified at the prospect than I imagined would be the case. But on the whole I do not know that that is very surprising. We who sit here, whether we are or not, are supposed to be trained, if imperfectly trained, politicians. The enormity of the principle of single-Chamber government cannot be so apparent to the ordinary voter as it is to us, who look upon it, as it were, through magnifying glasses, whereas the voter only sees it in some blurred indistinct image in the indefinite future, but I have no doubt he will realise what it does mean before very long. What has really told in
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0436"/>
<col>863</col>
myopinion more than anything else has been the apathy and indifference of the electorate generally towards this question. Apathy and indifference are visible everywhere, even in this Chamber, and in the House of Commons during the debates on this Bill that phenomenon was equally observable. If anybody thinks that the country is really seriously considering the question at the present moment I would ask him to spend a few minutes in perusing one of the halfpenny papers. It is true that apathy and indifference are fighting on the side of the Government, but I find it impossible to believe that this is going to be the case indefinitely. I feel very little doubt in my own mind that the voter will awake to the importance of the occasion in time.<lb/>
One thing is plain to me. However the Government mean to terminate this controversy, whether it is going to take the turn which has been so frequently suggested, or whether the Bill is going to pass in a comparatively peaceable mariner, a settlement of this kind can only be of a temporary character. This is not a question of trampling on the bodies of a certain number of middle-aged and possibly uninteresting gentlemen who occupy these benches. It is not a question of taking away rights from these people. If there is one thing more remarkable in British politics than another it is on the whole the extraordinarily equal distribution throughout the country of political opinions. It is true that in some places you get a numerical preponderance, but take the whole electorate through and you will find that the difference between the respective strengths of the two Parties is extremely small. It stands to reason, therefore, that when one Party is only in a small numerical preponderance over the other a settlement of this question on these lines cannot be of an enduring and permanent character; and if it is ever to be solved at all it will not be solved by the tyranny of one Party only, but in the interests of the country generally.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01444"><member>LORD ST. DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure the whole House, without distinction of sides, has greatly enjoyed the speech of the noble Lord who has just sat down, but it is somewhat strange to have to imagine the noble Lord as a poor creature driven and jockeyed by an artful Liberal Government into voting against the Budget. The noble
<col>864</col>
Lord is always full of jokes. He was no doubt jesting when he told us that this Bill in its inception was brought about by the blackmailing pressure of the Irish Party. I know that the noble Lord was jesting, because three sentences later he told us that this Veto Bill was really designed in 1906&#x2014;four years before the Irish Party were in a position to put on blackmailing pressure at all. The noble Lord began his speech by telling us that this Bill was meant to secure "the eternal predominance," if possible, of the Liberal Party. Then he wound up his speech by telling your Lordships, what is perfectly true, that the balance of public opinion in the country is a very narrow one, that it is a very fluctuating one, that at any time it may incline to the other side and then it will be perfectly easy for this Bill to be repealed. He pointed out that the settlement could not therefore be a permanent one. So I think we may assume that it was only another of his little jokes when he began by telling us that this Bill was intended to secure the eternal predominance of the Liberal Party.<lb/>
I will not follow the noble Lord further, because I wish to deal with that part of the Bill which takes away from your Lordships' House altogether the right to deal with finance. Members on the other side, including the noble Marquess, when speaking on the other Bill, said repeatedly that they would not claim for this House or for a reformed House of Lords the right to amend Finance Bills. Of recent years the House of Lords has only once exercised the right of throwing out a Finance Bill. You may say that this is a right that the House should have in the interests of property, but that right has only been exercised once, and I would like to point out that when it was exercised it was unsuccessful and this House did not succeed in securing the eventual rejection of the Budget against which they voted. I was rather struck by a remark which fell from Lord Willoughby de Broke. He said he did not think the Budget of 1909 was a popular one. I am very doubtful whether any Budget is popular. The noble Lord went on to say that he believed its passage was eventually secured by people who, though they did not like it, voted for it out of opposition to your Lordships' House. Is not that a pretty clear argument in favour of the proposition that it is not a security for property that you should retain this power of rejecting a Budget?<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0437"/>
<col>865</col>
It has been said by several noble Lords that they voted against the Budget and were unrepentant. I do not see why they should be repentant. After all, what they did they thought was right and proper, and they were only exercising a right they had; but as regards the wisdom of it, is there not a very grave doubt in looking back on it? Ever since the Budget was rejected by this House, has there not been in the country more and more a tendency to divert attention from other things and concentrate it on taxation? I do not say there is anything like a majority in the country of that way of thinking; but do you not think there is a growing tendency, getting stronger every day, to pay less attention to other matters and more and more attention to whether the money for what is called social reform cannot be obtained by taxation of the wealthier classes of this country? Social reform is a thing that everybody talks about.<lb/>
Social reform is, after all, only another word for taxation, and it seems to me that the noble Earl (Lord Cromer) who spoke last night from the Cross Benches had a great deal of truth and justice in his argument on that point. I agree with him that there is practically no organised Party in this country, and there seems to be very few individuals, in favour of reducing taxation. Certainly in the short time I have been a member of your Lordships' House I have heard in this House proposals for increasing the cost of the government of the country by adding to the Army and Navy, by compulsory military service, and by further facilitating the purchase of land in Ireland. I do not say that they were right or wrong, but these proposals would have had the effect, if carried, of enormously increasing the cost of government. The same thing is seen in the House of Commons on both sides. It seems there is nobody who dislikes taxation. There are only people who dislike the incidence of taxation when it deals with interests in which they themselves have sympathy. The noble Earl, Lord Cromer, said yesterday that he believed all this trouble&#x2014;that is to say, the Budget of 1909 which you rejected, and this Veto Bill which no doubt is the immediate consequence&#x2014;all these things were really caused by the Old Age Pensions Act. He pointed out that that Act when it was brought in was to cost something like &#x00A3;6,000,000, but that already the
<col>866</col>
expenditure had reached nearly &#x00A3;13,000,000. That is true. The noble Earl went on to talk of the Insurance Bill which is at this moment before the House of Commons. As it stands, that Bill is to cost the taxpayers of this country nearly &#x00A3;5,000,000 a year. I am not deploring that. Both sides are in favour of it. You have both sides urging on the Government extensions and amendments, every one of which would cost the taxpayers more money. You have a great class who will be affected&#x2014;the doctors&#x2014;agitating, and if their demands are granted it will surely mean a still heavier burden on the taxpayers. If that Bill would cost now something like &#x00A3;5,000,000 a year, is there anybody who can believe that when it leaves the House of Commons and becomes law it will not cost the country much more than that figure each year? The Bill has admittedly only touched a fringe of a great subject, and probably before the subject is legislated for in its fulness the cost will be much larger than is now proposed. Having the experience of Old-Age Pensions before us and remembering that this is a much bigger and more intricate thing, is it not a fair supposition that before the Insurance Bill has been worked out in its completion, say in five years time from now, it is more likely to be costing the country &#x00A3;10,000,000 or &#x00A3;15,000,000?<lb/>
I am coming to my conclusion, and it is this. As Lord Cromer said, the whole political trouble we are now in is due in its inception to the big Budget of 1909. Some of your Lordships wish to retain for this House the right to reject a Budget. Do you not think that you will have another big Budget before we have done with legislation like the Insurance Bill? Do you not think that within the next two or three years we shall probably have a Budget to raise from &#x00A3;5,000,000 to &#x00A3;15,000,000 more from the taxpayers? We have, I believe, got to a point in taxation when more money cannot be raised by taxation without somebody feeling it more or less severely. You can raise a great deal more money, but you cannot raise it without people noticing it. What, then, is going to happen? I would ask your Lordships to agree with me in this. Though you did not approve of the Budget of 1909, I am sure you will agree that in some respects at any rate that Budget was a fair Budget, in that it did attempt to raise money from all classes.
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0438"/>
<col>867</col>
True it put taxes on property and wealth, but it also put taxes on beer and tobacco, so that it pressed upon the working classes. To that extent I think you will agree it was a fair Budget.<lb/>
We were told by Lord Cromer that in his view the present Chancellor of the Exchequer was always aiming at popularity. Supposing in a few years time we have a Chancellor of the Exchequer who is, we will say, not aiming at popularity but is prudent. If your Lordships have no power to reject a Budget, if the Chancellor of the Exchequer has merely to look to the votes of the House of Commons, he may bring in, as did Mr. Lloyd George in 1909, a Budget that touches all classes. Mr. Lloyd George ran a grave risk in 1909, because when that Budget was rejected it was not the Land Tax or the Super-Tax that was spoken of on Conservative platforms. The Beer Duty and the Tobacco Duty were rubbed into the working man, and no doubt endangered the Budget. If your Lordships can reject a Budget, do you think any future Chancellor of the Exchequer who may have to defend his Budget on public platforms will ever put an additional tax upon the working man? If he has to run the risk of his Budget being thrown out in this House and the Government forced to a General Election upon the Budget, you will have popular Budgets, and do you think it will be a good thing for the propertied interests of this country that what are called popular Budgets should be introduced?<lb/>
Just think what a popular Budget means. It is a Budget that is being settled, not by representatives in Parliament who know a great deal about things, but settled by the man in the street who has only a limited vision. What do you think would be the vote of the man in the street on a popular Budget? We were told last night from the Opposition Front Bench that their Party believes that finance should be settled by the man in the street. I should be sorry for the Budget. What is the view of the man in the street? The great bulk of the electors in this country are men whose incomes are more often than not &#x00A3;1 per week; I should think &#x00A3;2 per week would be the outside. What do you suppose their views would be on finance if you put the Budget to that crucial ordeal? They think that a man with
<col>868</col>
&#x00A3;1,000 a year, or &#x00A3;20 a week, is a man of enormous wealth, who could well bear much more taxation than he bears to-day. As for the man with &#x00A3;10,000 a year, or &#x00A3;200 a week, they think his wealth so enormous that they would not mind anything being taken from him for the necessities of Government. That is the sort of vote you would get from the man in the street on a popular Budget. I know the importance of property and wealth to this country, and I should be sorry to see them rim the risk of any such ordeal. For my own part I would much rather trust the finances of the country to the representatives of the people in Parliament than have them settled as a result of continuous and repeated General Elections. If you have these things settled by the people outside, you have them settled by men to whom sums of money and incomes seem far larger and more splendid than they really are. If you have finance dealt with in that way, I believe you will have dealt an effectual blow at thrift and at the great reservoir of all our wealth. I am therefore strongly opposed to finance being dealt with on those lines. I think it would be much better settled by a representative body, and I am strongly in favour of taking away from this House the power of dealing with finance, which in modern times you have only used once and without success, and which you might very well lay aside.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01445"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the last speaker not unnaturally confined his remarks to a topic of which he is a master, but I do not think it necessary to follow him into a discussion of the financial aspect of the Bill. In this Bill we have to deal with broader aspects which commend themselves to the popular judgment. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, stated these provisions boldly and concisely, and none of the other Ministers who have spoken since have gone into any details upon the question, and I think they are right. It is obvious that their scheme has been to pass by the details of the Bill as if they contained, not Constitutional violence, but merely steps and stages of a somewhat ordinary kind which would do nobody any very great harm and which they hope would do them some good. That entirely obscures the whole question; and I am glad that the noble Earl who resumed the debate to-night, in a speech which I think was extremely powerful and commanding, presented this Bill in its real broad aspects
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0439"/>
<col>869</col>
to the judgment of your Lordships and the country.<lb/>
If this Bill passes, will there be any Parliament in the civilised world like the Parliament of Great Britain? Our Parliament has been the image of all other Parliamentary institutions. Why is our Parliament called the Mother of Parliaments? Because of its history, its Constitution, and its teaching. If this Bill passes there will not be a First Chamber like the House of Commons; there will not be a Second Chamber like this. It is impossible to suggest a change wider or more startling, or one to make the nation more anxious. We all know the history of our Parliament, how our institutions founded on an unwritten law have grown with our growth, gained strength with our strength. The two Houses have gone on working together for the public good. But this Bill is not an amendment of powers; it is not an alteration of powers; it is a complete revolution of the whole Parliamentary machine and as was stated yesterday by a trained Parliamentarian, Lord Marchamley, it means single-Chamber government. The noble Lord who was Chief Whip of the present Government in the House of Commons does not like the whole of this Bill, and he did not disguise the fact that the Bill would mean single-Chamber government. What does that mean? It means that this great old Parliament of ours which has existed for centuries, which is the surprise of the world in the happiness of its creation, which has won the admiration of the world by the way it has worked, is going to be absolutely and entirely changed. Instead of two Chambers with recognised powers we are to have practically a Single Chamber. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, who knows Constitutional history as well as any one, stated the existing powers of the House of Commons. I acknowledge them as every one should acknowledge them, recognising how they have been conferred upon that House in the history of the country. But this Bill goes not only a step further; it makes the House of Commons supreme all round. Can any one conceive a change more stupendous or more revolutionary? Can any one realise a Constitutional growth more appalling?<lb/>
I put the question in another way. Can it be conceived that the House of Commons by any majority, no matter how small, no
<col>870</col>
matter how constituted, should in the future have the power of enforcing against the continued protests of this House, protests repeated in three sessions, its views as to every law that clan be suggested to it? And that is to be done without any Joint Sittings and without a Referendum? Those are vast changes. I do not discuss the Referendum, but would it not be reasonable to say that there should be some interchange of view in a Joint Sitting or by some other recognised Constitutional method before the view of the House of Common should prevail? The noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, whose manner of moderation must command respect from everybody&#x2014;it is a priceless asset hi any public man&#x2014;speaks with a tone that almost wins assent by its calmness. You cannot conceive that a man of that type can be contemplating a revolution that is going to ruin the country. Lord Haldane quite calmly put to us that what the House of Commons desired was to have the power of negotiating with the House of Lords more on a footing of equality. I say that a man wants superb courage to use a sentence like that in reference to this Bill.<lb/>
What is the meaning of the word "negotiate" and the word "equality," and what on the living earth did the noble Viscount mean? Here we have fired off on a Second Chamber a Bill that must be taken without negotiation and without equality. There is not a suggestion of negotiation or of equality. Yet Lord Haldane suggests, quietly and calmly, that this Bill, with all its revolutionary methods and the stupendous changes it proposes, is merely an effort to work out some method of having equality between the two Houses. The noble Viscount said you could not serve two masters. I do not say you can; but it would be well to remember in connection with this question that the supreme master over both Lords and Commons is the nation. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack and Viscount Morley both said, Make the change and then see how moderately we will behave. But I think it is foolish to surrender everything and trust then to your captors' good will as to how you recovery our liberty. The House of Commons might sweep away their own time limit. That has been mentioned already, and it is obvious from what the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, said that he is restive as to that. On the time limit Lord Haldane used most extraordinary words. He said&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0440"/>
<col>871</col>
<quote>"The checks will soon become intolerable unless they are used in a genial spirit and unless points are wet in a genial spirit."</quote>
That is a dangerous and suggestive sentence. What does he mean? He was talking of the safeguard provided in the Bill in the matter of two years being allowed to elapse from the time a Bill was presented and first dealt with here and its becoming law. What is said is this, that the House of Commons will become restive under those restraints unless they are used by your Lordships, or whatever Second Chamber may be here, in a genial spirit. I am all for geniality, and so obviously is the noble Viscount. But what is the meaning of treating Parliamentary checks of time in a genial spirit? Is it intended that they are to be put aside and ignored?<lb/>
All this, I think, shows the wisdom of my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition in presenting his Reconstitution Bill. I admit that that Bill must have been a wrench to many Peers, but it was wise to assist public opinion by showing that the House of Lords was prepared to make great sacrifices to reconstitute itself on a popular basis that could stand criticism and command respect. Supposing it remained a purely hereditary Chamber, with no such offer, then the House of Commons would say, "We regard these statutory checks as intolerable. We will not be stopped for even one or two years by a mere hereditary Chamber. What right have they to stand in the way for one or two years? They must meet us in a genial spirit, or submit to our times and dates." Take the position of the House of Commons with its additional power of abolishing the checks and it is impossible to say where it would end. They might even abolish the nominal Second Chamber which had been reduced to impotence. There would be no way of checking the House of Commons. I am not sure that there would not be power under the Parliament Bill to present a Bill changing the whole position of the Sovereign. What is to prevent its being done if this Bill passes? You make the House of Commons absolutely supreme. You leave no check to the absolute power of the House of Commons. It might do away with the Monarchy. That is an immense question. I have not seen anything which would check the following out of that thought. It is one to make every person think, from the highest in the and to the humblest.<lb/>
<col>872</col>
It is said, "Trust moderate men." We heard my noble friend Lord Newton speak about moderate men. I have been a moderate man myself all my life, and I do not want to be too hard on the class, because in the main they are respectable. But at the same time, I would prefer not to trust very much to the moderation of those who are responsible for the framing of this Bill, under which the House of Commons is to be judge and jury, arbiter and umpire. The moderate men in the Government cannot be regarded as free. As has been said on countless occasions, the Government are not masters of themselves in this case. They are impelled by an irresistible force. I believe everybody is convinced that were no Home Rule Bill in the air there would be no Parliament Bill. Everybody knows the position of the Irish Party. I am not disparaging it. I never disparage my own countrymen. They are clever, capable men, who know what they want, and how to get it, and they will get it if they can. They have the command of the House of Commons and the Government.<lb/>
This is not the time to discuss Home Rule. It is a tremendous question all round. There is the phase as to how it may affect the Empire and the phase as it may affect Ireland. I am not insensible to both aspects. But it is a strange thing to speak of Ireland as if there was one united people. Everyone acquainted with the country knows the wide differences of opinion fostered by difference of race and religion. To ignore these patent facts when you are talking about the Union is idle, and deceives nobody. This is a tremendous question for Ireland and for its welfare and peace; it is too great a question to be set aside or discussed in two or three sentences. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack brought in the analogy of the Transvaal. Where is the analogy? The Transvaal is 6,000 miles away. It is a new and a young country, and the recent developments there show the advantage of union and federation. Where is the connection between that and' Home Rule, which would seek to break up a union existing already? The noble Viscount referred to 1886 and 1893. I remember those occasions very well, their history and growth. In those times, when the country was being asked to judge, the Bills were before the nation. They were seen, known, debated; but now no one, not even His Majesty's Government, can say what are the details of the proposed Home Rule Bill.<lb/>

People are sought to be quieted in reference to this Parliament Bill by being told that Sir Edward Grey and others had insisted on the Preamble. Sir Edward Grey has been conspicuous by his absence from the Parliament Bill debates. Whatever his feelings may be about the Second Chamber or about the Preamble, he has not taken the country into his confidence. The Preamble may mean anything, it may mean nothing. Does it mean a real Second Chamber with real powers? Between the passing of the Parliament Bill and the other Bill which is promised there is an interregnum, a gap. My noble friend Lord Midleton referred to it in the course of his speech, and said that he understood the Government regarded this Bill as temporary, that the matter was to be recast and readjusted as soon as the Second Chamber is reconstituted. I do not know what is the view of the Government upon that question. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, in his opening statement, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The actual methods of the Parliament Bill are not necessarily final."</quote>
What is meant by that? Does it bear the interpretation put upon it by Lord Midleton? That is a question of first-class importance. Or are we to understand that, no matter how constituted, the House of Lords is to go on in the fetters that are manufactured by this Bill? I would be glad to think that the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, is correct and that his interpretation is what we may look to.<lb/>
In the middle of our career, after centuries of two Chambers, to start single-Chamber government would be a revolution. It is contrary to every single precedent in the civilised world. The United States of America has a Senate, a powerful body. It has more than that. It has a Supreme Court that can keep the laws of the United States under supervision. There is the great Republic of France. Then there is Australia, Canada, and the Transvaal. This is a matter of the highest importance bearing in mind what a great writer on representative government, John Stuart Mill, said upon the subject&#x2014;
<quote>"The majority in a Single Assembly when it has received a permanent character easily becomes destructive and over-weening."</quote>
No one has a more thorough knowledge of such questions than the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, or more respect for the name of John Stuart Mill. In setting up single-Chamber government you are acting
<col>874</col>
against the advice of the most thoughtful man who ever wrote on representative government. The great safeguard of every Constitution and of ours is to be found in the power of appeal of the nation against the Government. It is the greatest check. Lords and Commons, we must all bow before the nation. The nation is the master of all, and that is one of the great safeguards of Constitutional government. The other one is the supremacy of the law. Being a lawyer I feel a deep interest in that, because I am alive to its tremendous importance. Every one who knows anything of law must recognise the tremendous importance of keeping our Judiciary absolutely independent and out of the public arena. It is very ominous, on this question of the supremacy of the law, to notice that recently in the House of Commons reflections have been cast upon Judges in the administration of the law, and the speeches that have been made and sometimes the words of Ministers give cause for great anxiety in reference to this important question.<lb/>
There is another point I would like to mention, one which has attracted my attention for some time. It is the position of the Sovereign in regard to legislation&#x2014;a very important and very delicate question. At present under the Constitution our laws are made by King, Lords, and Commons. We all know about the great Conference meeting now in London. That brings home to us in the most obvious way how the Colonial Empire pivots on the Sovereign. It is a matter of first-class importance. The final responsibility for the making of our laws necessarily rests on the Assent of the Crown. But what is the position of the Crown in reference to the making of laws? The laws when tendered to the Sovereign under our existing Constitution come before him as the joint product of two independent Houses, and every Act of Parliament has been approached and discussed with an interchange of opinion and argument between the two Houses, with all the checks, safeguards, and balances that our Constitution has developed in the growth of centuries. If there are no balances and no safeguards, if you sweep away by this Bill the free interchange of independent opinions between the two Houses, what becomes of the great check and the safeguards of the Constitution? It is obvious that the condition not only of the people but of the Sovereign is
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0442"/>
<col>875</col>
seriously changed by this Bill. At present there is, if you like to call it so, a great buffer between the House of Commons and the Crown in the existence of a Second Chamber, an independent Second Chamber with great traditions. This constitutes a great protection, not only of the Sovereign but of the nation; but under this Bill that great protection goes. You take away the independent action and the independent position of the House of Lords. You give the final power to the House of Commons, and you make the House of Commons not only predominant but supreme. That extremely important question has not been adequately discussed in either House, but it is one which must attract attention because of its first-class importance.<lb/>
The most rev. Primate, in words which were worthy of his high position and great character and which must have found responsive echoes in many hearts, suggested that by an approach&#x2014;the word compromise did not fall from him&#x2014;by a conference, a mutual interchange of thought, something should be done that might lead to co-operation in a settlement. And the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, at the close of his remarks used words which showed an appreciation of the position. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Who knows but that both sides may co-operate in carrying out a work of this great magnitude."</quote>
Those were worthy words, and I concur in them. At this time when we are all thinking of festivals that show the unity of the Empire and the peace that has made it so great, it is especially fitting that we should apply our minds in this direction. This is an era of peace, when we hear much of understandings and arbitrations, and I would be sincerely glad if we could begin at home.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01446"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, nothing has struck me more in the speeches I have listened to in the course of this debate than the thinness of the argument of noble Lords opposite who have spoken in support of this Bill. Not a single answer has been given to the criticisms put forward from this side. It is true that Lord St. Davids just now put forward some arguments in favour of taking away the small powers which the House at present possesses over finance, but as far as I could ascertain from those arguments he merely glories in the large amounts which the present Chancellor of the Exchequer has to budget for.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01448"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Lord's pardon. But if he deplores the large amount of taxation, the enormous sums that are being budgetted for at present, I should like to know why he wishes to weaken the financial control of this House? He must remember that though the Government of which he is a supporter came in on the cry of "Economy and retrenchment," their administration has been noted so far for their wild extravagance. Throughout his speech the noble Lord talked about the vast amounts which future Chancellors of the Exchequer will have to budget for. I quite agree. It is very probable we shall have under the present Government greatly increased taxation. Already we see local bodies calling the attention of the Government to the heavy burden of the rates, which I might point out is largely due to the legislation passed during the last four years. Then the Secretary for Scotland went so far as actually to deprecate any comparison between the Constitution of this country under the Parliament Bill and the Constitution of other countries. When we were talking about Constitutional safeguards he pointed out that you could not possibly compare this country with other countries. If the noble Lord were here I would ask him why not? Are our interests less vast and of less importance than those of other countries?<lb/>
As far as I can understand, the argument put forward from the other side is that the Government have a mandate for this Bill. The Noble Viscount opposite Lord Morley, speaking in the debate on the Reconstitution Bill, informed the House that after the recent elections the Government were bound to give effect to the people's wishes and secure the passage of the Parliament. Bill. I do not wish to traverse over old ground, but I ask the noble Viscount to study some of the platform speeches of his colleagues during the last elections. I set myself to read a good many of those speeches, and I was led to the conclusion that a great deal more energy was devoted to abuse of the hereditary principle titan to any advocacy of the Parliament Bill. I doubt very much whether any large proportion of the electors of this country have ever
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0443"/>
<col>877</col>
troubled themselves to consider the proposals enshrined in that remarkable document. Surely members of both Houses must have been struck by the small amount of interest displayed outside the precincts of Parliament in this Bill. The Government interpret silence as acquiescence, and even go further and assume that it means active support of the proposals they bring forward. But, my Lords, quite another interpretation is the true one.<lb/>
The Parliament Bill in itself does nothing more than effect a revolution in Parliamentary procedure&#x2014;that is to say, in the machinery for producing legislation. The Prime Minister has described this Bill as a machinery Bill. To politicians who pass their lives within the walls of these legislative Chambers the methods of legislative procedure are all important, but the effect is very remote on the man in the street. He is not closely concerned with an alteration in the Parliamentary machine. It is only when the new machine gets to work on matters which concern them that the great mass of the electors will begin to be affected by the Bill. Let me illustrate my point by a reference to the legal procedure in Courts of law. Every practising lawyer will admit, I think, that the question of procedure in the Courts is one which is all important to consider in giving advice to any one who is about to appeal to the law. No one, however, outside the ranks of the legal profession would get wildly excited about an alteration in legal procedure. A non-legal Member of Parliament would probably not consider the matter until he had to have recourse to his lawyer in connection with some forthcoming litigation in which he was concerned. But I venture to say that if on consulting his lawyer he were told that owing to some drastic alteration in legal procedure his position as a litigant was fundamentally altered, I think even the least legally minded Member of Parliament would evince a lively interest in the matter. I believe that is a perfectly true analogy with the position of the average elector in regard to the Parliament Bill. He does not concern himself with the niceties of the Parliamentary machine for producing laws; but when new laws come to be produced by that machine, laws which may seriously affect the welfare and the daily lives of the workers, may affect them in their property and their fortunes, I venture with confidence to assert that the atten-
<col>878</col>
tion of those who are affected by such laws will be quickened and stimulated, perhaps not in a manner entirely agreeable to His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
But on this doctrine of the mandate on which the Government have taken their stand, not only for the introduction of this Bill but also, without any further reference to the people, for setting to work the new machinery created by the Bill, I would ask the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, how far he is prepared to carry this doctrine? For the first two years of the life of a Parliament the Cabinet will have an absolute autocratic power to pass what measures they choose. The Prime Minister has already announced that one of these measures is to be Home Rule for Ireland. May I ask the noble Viscount whether in his opinion the Government have a mandate for a Home Rule Bill? Has it ever been put as a clear and definite issue before the electors? I notice that the Prime Minister has invented a new doctrine, a new form of mandate. When taxed in the House of Commons with not having placed sufficiently before the country the intention of the Government, if returned to power, to proceed with a Home Rule Bill for Ireland, he laid great stress, not on the speeches of himself and his colleague s, but upon the utterances and warnings of Unionist leaders. He said that they, the Unionist leaders, had made it quite clear that a return to power of the Government would involve this disastrous measure. My Lords, it appears that the fragmentary utterances of a Minister, if insufficient in themselves to establish a mandate, are to be made effective out of the mouths of his opponents. This is an entirely new departure. It seems to me that it would result in removing all the responsibility which at present attaches to the public utterances of a Minister. But assuming the existence of a mandate, I would ask the House for what particular form of Home Rule this mandate has been given. Mr. Gladstone had at least two forms of Home Rule. They were alike only in this, that under each form a separate Parliament would have been established in Ireland. But under one of them, Irish members would have continued to sit at Westminster, and under the other form the benches of the Irish Members in the House across the corridor would have been vacated. Then came the more recent proposal of the Irish
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0444"/>
<col>879</col>
Councils Bill, produced by Mr. Birrell, but quickly abandoned. Many Radicals again declare that no measure of Home Rule would be complete short of Home Rule all round, meaning, presumably, a separate Parliament for England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. Perhaps the noble Viscount will tell the House for which of the four the Government claim a mandate. Or are we to understand that the Government were returned to power with four separate mandates?<lb/>
Let us consider the effect of the Parliament Bill on other legislation. The noble Lord, Lord St. Davids, mentioned the National Insurance Bill. That Bill has gone a certain distance, and there seems to be a general consensus of opinion to consider its proposals. I am not going to criticise the Bill, but I think it is germane to the question which we are debating to ask the noble Viscount opposite whether he considers that the Government have also got a mandate from the people for that important measure. If he says "No," I would ask him why he proposes under the Parliament Bill to give the Government power during the first two years to bring in such a Bill without any discussion by the people? If he says "Yes," I would ask him to what extent does that mandate go. Does it authorise the Chancellor of the Exchequer to include death benefits in his insurance scheme? If he has a mandate for an Insurance Bill which the people have not considered presumably he can frame it as he likes. I dare say the noble Viscount is fully aware that at the present time the industrial insurance companies are trembling in their shoes. Their only safeguard, their only protection against any action of this sort, is your Lordships' House. But under the Parliament Bill, with its permanent mandate to the Government, all these people would be at the mercy of a chance majority of the House of Commons. There are about 80,000 industrial insurance agents, and it would be possible for all these men to be thrown out of employment by a stroke of the pen of the Chancellor of the Exchequer under the provisions of his Bill.<lb/>
The question was asked last night, What do noble Lords mean when they say they want a system of double-Chamber government? I think it is very plain what we mean. We mean that in regard to legislation there must be some method of
<col>880</col>
safeguarding the interests of the people of this country. There must be some independent body to safeguard those interests. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, will probably say that these interests are represented by the majority in the House of Commons, but the votes of that majority are representative of one thing and one thing only, and that is the will of the Prime Minister of the day. I admit that the House of Commons has a perfect right to introduce all the measures I have mentioned with or without a mandate from the people, provided you have the usual Constitutional safeguards. That is common sense. But if you are going to take away from the Second Chamber the power which it has at present to delay measures until the people have had a chance to say whether they like them or not, then you must adopt some method such as we have put forward by which a direct vote of the people can be taken on grave issues. We on our side of the House have not been slow in coming forward to meet the grievances put forward by those who are opposed to us in politics, and I think that we on this side have a right to expect that His Majesty's Government will take some step towards meeting us in an endeavour to solve by agreement a problem which otherwise will prove insoluble.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01449"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was very glad when the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition gave us to understand that as regards the principle of this Bill he thought the House ought to accept it, at any rate as far as the Second Reading is concerned. I could not help thinking when listening to many speeches during the last few days that some noble Lords do not realise how far democracy is taking us nowadays. No one who has observed the course of politics during, the last twenty or thirty years can have failed to noticethat in a great measure voting power has been transferred from the agricultural districts in which your Lordships are known to large industrial centres. I resented, as I dare say many members of this House on both sides did, the abuse to which this House and many of its members were subjected at the recent General Elections, and I noticed that the good results for the Party with which I am associated were obtained more in the country districts than in large industrial centres. What did that show? I was very much struck with a personal ex-
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0445"/>
<col>881</col>
perience I had on the occasion of the last election. It was with regard to a boy employed in my own office in London, and it struck me as typical of what must be the condition of mind of voters in the East-end of London and other places where Lords are rare and comparatively unknown. This little boy went home to his mother and said he was employed in the office of a noble Lord, and the mother asked him, "Have you seen him wear his coronet?" "No," replied the boy. "Then he can't be a real Lord," said the mother. That is typical of the state of mind of thousands of the electorate. We must recognise this change of opinion, particularly in the towns. If the members of this House would make themselves as fully acquainted with the conditions of industrial life as they are admittedly acquainted with the conditions of agricultural life, a great change would take place in the electorate, and the town centres would rally round those who from the personal advantages of wealth and education have done well for the country. If we want to re-establish our position and form a strong Second Chamber we must go out into the country and show ourselves and do some real work. If this Bill is passed&#x2014;and it will be in some form or another&#x2014;it cannot be regarded as a permanent settlement.<lb/>
There is another point which should not be forgotten. A large number of members of this House have had great experience in administration in the country, but have taken very little part in administration in the towns. I therefore welcomed the Bill of the noble Marquess, which included in the Schedule of qualified Peers such persons as mayors of towns and chairmen of county councils. I still believe that there is no great feeling in the country against the members of this House. I am perhaps more in touch with the industrial classes than some members of this House, and I can say that a great deal of the apathy in the country in this matter arises from the fact that the people look upon this quarrel between the two Houses as a matter of domestic concern, and also think that on the whole the Parliament Bill leaves us with as much power as they want us to be entrusted with. That is not, I know, the view that is held in this House, but in all the circumstances I confess I expected a Bill much more stringent and much more drastic. Under this Bill we shall still have a considerable amount of power. There is the
<col>882</col>
period of two years. Even if the Government have a mandate, that period of two years is a very serious obstacle to get over, and it will be a difficult thing for a Government to carry a measure unless it is one of first-class importance in the third year. Then, again, there is the shortened duration of Parliaments which will in future be about four and a-half years.<lb/>
I think that in this matter every effort ought to be made to get a settlement by consent. I believe it is not beyond the talents of the noble Marquess or the noble Viscount on the other side to influence their Party in this direction. If that were done I should be quite content to belong to the House of Lords in the future. But they ought to recognise the inevitable drift of things. The Liberal Party are driven to producing this Bill. They have to bring it forward whether they like it or not. Let us look for a moment at the effect of this Bill upon members of the House of Commons. There will be an increased responsibility, and I think they will realise it. They will not be able to say in the future as they have done in the past, "It does not matter. We can vote for this or that, because the House of Lords will throw it out." A member of the House of Commons will have to realise his responsibilities at any rate diving the first two years of a Parliament. I am quite convinced that sooner or later a collision between this House and the House of Commons was bound to come, but it might have come in a far more dangerous form than now presents itself. It is lucky it has come as it has, and if this House rises to its responsibilities, which I think it will, this Parliament Bill, evil as we may think it to-day, will in the long run prove to be a blessing in disguise.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01451"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD STANMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, an eminent French writer and thinker, Alexis de Tocqueville, in his famous book, <i>L'ancien R&#x00E9;gime et la Revolution,</i> has defined the objects and work of the French Revolution in one short and pithy sentence. He says that the work of the Revolution&#x2014;a work which, he says, is still going on, and will go on&#x2014;is the destruction and removal of every trace, of every vestige, of what is derived from feudality and aristocracy&#x2014;even the least vestige&#x2014;words which he emphasises by printing them in italics.
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0446"/>
<col>883</col>
M. de Tocqueville's prophecy may or may not be true. For my own part I confess that I do implicitly believe it. I believe that in the course of time the relics of a feudal and aristocratic system will be wiped out. But though I say it I do not like it, and not liking it, and believing that it will be a calamity to the nation and do mischief to all whom it concerns, I should be glad to see that change effected as slowly, as gradually, with as little friction and with as little consciousness as possible, rather than violently, suddenly, and at once.<lb/>
That some reform in the constitution of this House is necessary. I think we shall all admit. Not only the immense augmentation of the numbers of the Peerage&#x2014;an augmentation for which both Parties are equally guilty&#x2014;but other circumstances render its representation by delegation almost a necessity, and certainly desirable. I believe that the creation of life Peers would have been desirable. I believe, too, that some application of the system of qualification, or rather of disqualification&#x2014;for I would rather have gone upon lines which should exclude than upon those which would admit&#x2014;was not only necessary but called for. Such proposals, involving as they would enormous changes in the constitution of this House, would, if submitted a short time ago, have been sufficient, in my opinion, as the next step to be taken, and would have prevented that more hasty and more sweeping measure which, as my quotation from de Tocqueville shows, looms before us in the future. But that rather refers to the Bill of my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition than to the Bill immediately before us, and it is with the Bill before us that we have to deal.<lb/>
This Bill is, as has been pointed out by others, a very remarkable production, and it is remarkable, I think, for nothing more than the extraordinarily uncertain sound which pervades its clauses, and which also is echoed in the speeches of noble Lords who have spoken in its favour. What do the clauses say? We are told by the Bill that the House is to remain as it is at present constituted, but that it is to be shorn of certain of its powers. Good. But what does the Preamble of the Bill say? The Preamble says that, instead of the present House, there is to be one founded on a popular basis&#x2014;a new institution, a new-
<col>884</col>
fangled, newly manufactured Senate instead of the House of Lords and which, we have been informed on the high authority of the Lord President of the Council, is not to exceed 200 in number. Yet several noble Lords have endeavoured to persuade us that what is intended is really quite a trifling change. Here we are, say they, and we shall all remain here, only some privileges which we have practically already abandoned will be formally taken from us. We have practically given up all control over finance&#x2014;so let it go. We have practically shown that we do not resist the will of the House of Commons when repeatedly expressed&#x2014;well, let the power to do so go too, and let that be made the law which has hitherto been the custom. That is what some say. That is the mild soft, honey-sweet voice we hear nowadays in this House. We especially hear it from one whose absence we all regret, but one whom I hope to see in his place almost immediately, Lord Crewe. He told us that really the powers we should retain were powers large enough to satisfy the most craving ambition. Which of these views is to be taken? Which is the real fact? Is the House of Lords as the House of Lords has been to be continued with certain privileges chopped off, or is there to be, within if possible the duration of the present Parliament, as the Prime Minister said, a new scheme&#x2014;one of which we have no inkling, and which is to supersede the House of Lords as it exists? That is what I call remarkable ambiguity.<lb/>
But there is another remarkable thing about the Preamble. We are told in the Preamble that it is "intended" to supersede this House. Can you put into a Bill that it is "intended?" By whom intended? Are we to assert that we intend it? Is the Crown to assert that the Crown intends it? The House of Commons, I presume, does intend it, but the phrase seems to me somewhat extraordinary. How, before debate, before a decision, before a settlement with this House, can it be laid down that anything is intended to be done? It may be wished for and it may be intended by the Government, but how can it be said to be intended in a Bill? In short, the question is supposing this Bill to pass, how long is the state of things which it inaugurates to continue? Apparently, from what we have heard, no very long time. I venture to say, however, there was no time when the check which a Second Chamber affords was more needed than it is now, and
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0447"/>
<col>885</col>
it will be still more needed in the future. The more democratic your constituencies become, the more evenly they are balanced in the way of size and numbers, the wider the franchise is extended, the less truly will the opinion of the people be represented in the House of Commons. That sounds I admit, a paradox, almost a startling paradox, but it is simple fact, because with more democratic constituencies, with more even electoral divisions and the single vote, you have a much greater chance of the Party which is for the moment popular in the country being represented by a small majority in a great many constituencies, the result of which will be that the aggregate result in the House of Commons will not be a representation of the people as a whole, but simply of the majority. The tendency to represent the majority rather than the majority and minority will increase in proportion as the representation becomes more even and more democratic.<lb/>
We see this illustrated in our Colonies. In one of the Constitutional Colonies of which I have had the honour of being Governor, we had an election in which popular feeling was highly roused, and the Government party returned its candidate in almost every constituency. The number of the minority was, if I remember aright, six out of a House of 100 or more. The following year there was another Dissolution and the parties were reversed. The Opposition of six in the previous Parliament came back an overwhelming majority. Now do your Lordships suppose that either of these Parliaments represented the people of the country? Certainly not. The people were practically equally divided, but the electioneering machinery was such that the party which was slightly in advance gained almost all the seats in one case, and lost almost all of them in the next. But we need not go as far as our Colonies. The case of Wales seems to me to be quite enough. I forget the exact number of Conservative Members for Wales&#x2014;four, I think.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01453"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD STANMORE</member><membercontribution>: All the rest are Liberals. But do your Lordships suppose that the population of Wales is divided in that proportion between Liberals and Conservatives? Certainly not. It is another case in point. I quote those cases to show
<col>886</col>
that though what I said sounded like a paradox, when you come to apply the facts you find it is a matter of substance, and renders an effective Second Chamber more necessary than at any other time.<lb/>
Another remarkable thing with regard to this debate is that, though we have had three days' discussion of an interesting, and, as Lord Newton quite rightly said, of a real and substantial nature, there are some points which have not been touched upon at all. The question of the abolition of our powers in dealing with finance has been very lightly touched upon. Another point of great importance in the Bill&#x2014;the limitation of the duration of Parliaments&#x2014;has, so far as I have heard, not been mentioned at all. Nothing has been argued in its favour and nothing has been said in opposition to it. But that in itself is an enormous change, and one which will require a great deal of thought and debate, and I am surprised that it has not formed the substance of the speeches of some noble Lords. As to one thing, however, I do rejoice, and it is that the debate has been conducted with the utmost moderation of language in most cases, and with good feeling and good spirit. We have not heard here the accusations against members of this House which are so freely scattered out of doors. But, freely scattered as they are out of doors, I would beg to call attention to the very important fact that these insinuations and charges have not been made out of doors with at all the same sort of force or virulence, or with at all the same sort of conviction, that was the case when the House of Lords was so violently attacked at the time of the Reform Bill. At that time the attacks on the House of Lords far exceeded any attacks that have been made upon it lately. They were far more violent, far more bitter, and far more dangerous. If the House at that time had given way to alarm and what might be thought popular feeling, it would probably have anticipated the present time by seventy or eighty years. But the then Leaders of the Conservative Party were the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel, not men either to be frightened or to give up what they thought to be right and just. They would not make compromise which only spelt concession. I wish merely to draw this moral, that the feeling being less bitter and less violent at this time it might possibly have been resisted with equal success. But to revert to what I said at the beginning of my
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0448"/>
<col>887</col>
observations, I do not think that it is of very great importance, because, I believe the time is coming, and perhaps is come, to ring the knell of this long-descended and illustrious House. It may be our own fault. It may be&#x2014;I believe it is to a great extent&#x2014;our own doing. I abhor the thought of it, but that does not make me the less sensible of its truth. I am not going to weary your Lordships by entering into the charges that have been levelled against us, but among the charges that as to our hereditary character is one of the chief. I quite see everything that may be said against the hereditary character of the House, but I would ask, when the question is under discussion, that two or three things should be remembered. First, that the principle of heredity is one which has prevailed in every age, and, I believe, more or less in every country on the face of the globe; and certainly His Majesty's Government are not qualified to utter&#x2014;and I do not think they have to any great extent uttered&#x2014;sneers at heredity, because they themselves owe much to it. In the present Government&#x2014;assuming as the present Government that which has existed since 1906&#x2014;there are at least three members of it who owe much to heredity. Far be it from me to say one syllable or to hint anything against their fitness; one of them&#x2014;the Secretary of State for the Colonies&#x2014;possesses, I think almost every quality that a Statesman should have. At the same time, I think it is perfectly clear that neither Lord Gladstone nor Mr. Harcourt, nor Mr. Churchill, would have obtained high office and seats in the Cabinet as early as they did had they not been the sons of their distinguished fathers.<lb/>
This Bill is calculated to do much mischief. What are its principles? Its three principles are&#x2014;first, to take away from your Lordships all power of control over finance; second, to limit, and to limit severely and with greater restrictions, your Lordships' control over Bills passed by the Lower House; and, third&#x2014;if it can be called a principle&#x2014;the adumbration of our entire destruction, and of our replacement by a Senate newly manufactured and of small size. In those circumstances, is this a Bill the principle of which should be affirmed? Can I, ought I, to vote for it? I quite see the tactical advantage&#x2014;and it is a great ad vantage&#x2014;o causing the rejection of any
<col>888</col>
compromise to be thrown upon the Government rather than upon the Opposition. But can one honestly vote for a Bill which contains such provisions? By reading it a second time we are assumed, according to the practice of the House, to approve in the main the principles of the Bill. The principles I have just enunciated are principles which I, for one, cannot adopt, and they are principles for which I should feel it impossible to vote. On the other hand, of course, I see all the difficulties of voting against the Bill. But I must say that, looking to the effect which it is likely to have, I am quite unable to record a vote in its favour.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01454"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a charge constantly made against this House that your Lordships are actuated too largely by Party motives. I venture to think that the debate which has taken place this evening is a sufficient proof of the fallacy of such a charge. We have had from the other side of the House a speech from Lord St. Davids discussing the financial measures which will be affected by this Bill, and, as far as I understood him, he took his stand in supporting this Bill on the ground that great financial measures&#x2014;measures hitting the country extremely hard in the way of levying still heavier charges&#x2014;would shortly be brought before the House of Commons, and that it would be well for this House if it were able to wash its hands of any share in passing those measures. I have always thought that the policy of washing one's hands of any responsibility is not one that is ever looked upon with any esteem by the remainder of the public, nor is it one which can be considered of any value to the country at large. And then, my Lords, from this side of the House we had a speech just before dinner in which every aspect controverted any statement made from this side. The noble Lord, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, stood for the payment of Members. I wished, as he was speaking, that he had had the advantage of a conversation I had only two days ago with a distinguished member of one of our self-governing Dominions, and that the noble Lord had heard the criticism levelled against payment of Members. He is not a member of his Government, and I naturally am not going to mention his name; but he expressed the opinion that there was no greater revolution ever proposed in this country than the payment of Members, and he laid it down that immediately did away with responsi-
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0449"/>
<col>889</col>
bility that you had an entirely different type of man standing for Parliament, and that many who were best qualified by education and by training, which their financial position, perhaps, had enabled them to acquire, were ruled out by other people standing who said they more truly represented the voters as they were more of their own standing.<lb/>
We have constantly been told that a mandate has been given to the Government to pass this Bill. We have not been told, so far as I am aware, by any supporter of the Government, certainly not in this House, how that mandate was obtained. A good many reasons combined to produce he Government's majority. We have heard nothing whatever of the many constituencies in which speeches on food taxes played a far greater part than any reference to your Lordships' House. I know a constituency which is now represented by a Liberal Member, as it was before, in which so far as I am aware, there was not a single poster which had anything to do with this House. There was, perhaps, one poster which referred to it indirectly. It was a poster which I think many of your Lordships have seen, showing what I can only describe as a mal-formed and drunken-looking dwarf, his head surmounted by a coronet. Is there any member of your Lordships' House to whom that far-fetched caricature could apply? My noble friend Lord Ampthill, or the noble Earl, Lord Dunmore, are far more typical examples of your Lordships' House than that represented in the poster. If a public body is to be judged by its component parts rather than by the action it takes, can nothing be said about the Cabinet or the House of Commons? At any rate we in this House have not got a man whom I could only describe as a perjurer, prepared to come to that Table and to take the oath of allegiance to his Sovereign while all the time he had the deliberate intention of breaking it, as has been the case with Mr. Keir Hardie. I venture to think there is not a Member of your Lordships' House on whichever side he sits, who would not say that votes won in the way I have described are in no sense a mandate for the passing of this Bill. As to criticisms of your Lordships' House, which have been very numerous in the last few years, in many constituencies the attack on this House, even by members of the Cabinet, was far more in the nature of a personal attack upon
<col>890</col>
its members than upon the action which this House has taken in the past.<lb/>
What has been the action of your Lordships during the last six years? We have been told again and again that this House has thrown out all, or the greater part, of the chief Liberal measures. What were the occasions on which the House of Lords refused their assent to Liberal measures? Perhaps your Lordships will allow me to examine one or two. I take first the Education Bill. Which of the four Education Bills the Government have at one time or another introduced is the really considered policy of His Majesty's Government? Is it the Education Bill of 1906, or the Bill of 1907, or is it one of the two introduced in 1908? I imagine supporters of His Majesty's Government will say, "Of course it is the Education Bill of 1906." Is any member of His Majesty's Government prepared to get up in his place and say, whether Home Rule is passed or not, that, if the Education Bill of 1906 were reintroduced in 1911, it should apply not only to England but to Ireland, and then claim that the Government had a majority for the Bill in the present House of Commons? You have only to-refer to the speeches made by Mr. John Redmond to know perfectly well that the Irish Party at any rate would vote solidly against any such proposal, and in that case the Government's majority would disappear. But it is not even necessary to refer to the speeches of Mr. John Redmond, or to the attitude of many bodies who-perhaps in other matters support His Majesty's Government, though they did not agree with the Bill of 1906. I need only refer your Lordships to a speech made in the House of Commons, I think on July 30, 1906, by one whose name is fairly prominent in Liberal circles&#x2014;Mr. Master-man. This is what he said, speaking of Amendments which he hoped would be introduced in this House&#x2014;
<quote>"Still more deplorable was the fact that every concession they on their side received from the Upper House weakened the general democratic appeal against the Constitution of that Chamber. It was sad to think that this great democratic movement which some of them looked upon as the dawn of a new day should have as one of its first results the fact that 2,500,000 Catholics and a more indefinite number of Liberals were saying, 'Thank God for the institution of the House of Lords.'"</quote>
I have been wondering what some of these men think about the Parliament Bill and
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0450"/>
<col>891</col>
the possibility, if it passes, of the introduction of another Education Bill. The speech of Mr. Masterman from which I have quoted, I venture to think, can be taken in more ways than one. It shows how many sections even of the Liberal Party may have real cause to fear a curtailment of the powers of this House. It shows further&#x2014;and this, I think, gives a complete answer to the speech of the noble Lord opposite, Lord Pentland, earlier in the evening&#x2014;that at any rate in 1906 it was not a question of the curtailment of the powers of this House, but of an alteration in its constitution.<lb/>
I now take the Scottish Land Bill. We were told that it was earnestly desired by the country. If it was so earnestly desired, why did the Government refuse to pass that half of it to which your Lordships were fully prepared to agree, and which was actually brought in as a separate Bill in this House and passed through all its stages? Was it that the Government were thinking more about Party tactics than the requirements of Scotland, or was it that the Scottish Land Bill was not so earnestly desired as was represented, and that therefore that part of it could well be dropped?<lb/>
What about the Licensing Bill and the Budget? We have been told that the Government received a mandate for the Licensing Bill. We have also been told that the Budget should not have been interfered with by this House. Which of these two so-called great temperance measures&#x2014;for the Budget is referred to not so much as a great financial measure, but as a great temperance measure, or a great land reform measure&#x2014;was the one for which the Government had received a mandate? Which of the two methods of dealing with the licensing question was the correct one&#x2014;that which was put forward in the Bill of 1908, or that which formed part of the Budget of 1909&#x2013;10. These Bills differed in principle, and if there was a mandate for the Licensing Bill there was obviously a mandate against the Budget. If for no other reason the House of Lords was justified by the speeches of Ministers themselves in refusing to pass the Budget until it had received the assent of the electors. This House was not in a position to judge whether the Government were right in stating that there was a
<col>892</col>
mandate for the Licensing Bill of 1908, and that the country required the Budget of 1909&#x2013;10. The Government informed us that they had a mandate for both. Obviously the only way of really solving the difficulty was to have an appeal to the country in order to test whether the country desired one or other of these measures. It was for the country to decide the point, and your Lordships gave the country an opportunity to do so.<lb/>
What are the duties of a Second Chamber? We have been told by no less an authority than the Prime Minister himself what the functions of an ideal House of Lords should be. Speaking in 1894 he said&#x2014;
<quote>"The functions of the House of Lords are merely these&#x2014;first of all, that it should act as a revising authority over the details of legislation; and, in the next place, where there, is reasonable doubt whether upon any question the House of Commons is representing the majority of the electorate the House of Lords should have the power of interposing such delay as will enable that doubt to be authoritatively solved."</quote>
The question at once arises whether this House carries out its duties to an equal extent when a Unionist Government is in power. We on this side maintain that we have done no more than carry out the functions of an ideal Upper House as laid down by the Prime Minister in the action we have taken on various occasions during the last six years. Noble Lords on the other side say we never take such action when a Unionist Government is in power. If that is the case, it should not be a question of a limitation of the powers of this House but of the constitution of this House, and of greater equality between the Parties who sit within it. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack said that the action of the House of Lords on this Bill would be the test of sincerity as to whether this House really is ready to carry out the will of the people. I venture to think that is an entirely erroneous opinion.<lb/>
If the country decided anything in regard to the House of Lords at the last regard election it decided that the House, as at present constituted, is not such as to be able to deal fairly between proposals brought forward by various political Parties. It did not decide that the powers of this House should be limited; it decided that the House as at present constituted was unfair. That was the gist of almost
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0451"/>
<col>893</col>
every speech I read from any supporter of the Government in attacking this House, and if the speeches of those who solicited the votes of the electors had anything whatever to do with the procuring of those votes, then it cannot be said that the country voted for the limitation of the powers of this House. Your Lordships have already expressed your desire to bow to the will of the people, so far as it was expressed at the last election by giving a Second Reading to the Bill of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition.<lb/>
What does the Parliament Bill do? Does it leave to this House functions which Mr. Asquith in 1894 said should be the functions of an ideal Second Chamber? Does it leave to this House the power of revising legislation? We know perfectly well that if any Amendment was introduced into a Bill in this House to which the House of Commons objected, this House would have no power whatever to have that Amendment carried through when the Bill became law. Does it leave to this House the power of interposing delay where there is reasonable doubt upon any question as to whether the House of Commons is representing the majority of the electorate to enable that doubt to be authoritatively solved? Under this Bill the House of Commons has power, after-two years delay, to pass any Bill it pleases without consulting the electorate at all. What is there in this Bill to prevent the House of Commons abolishing the Crown, as it did on the last occasion on which the power of the House of Lords was abolished and the other House was left with absolute power? You may say that such a suggestion is ridiculous, but you cannot have too many safeguards on so vital a matter. This, I venture to think, is a matter which the noble Lord who spoke just before dinner might well consider before he votes on this Bill, or on any Amendment to this Bill.<lb/>
Again I would ask, Does the Bill ensure that an attack may not be made on the Protestant succession? Does it ensure that the House of Commons, incited as it will be by receiving an annual salary, may not desire to extend the life of a Parliament beyond the term of five years laid down in this Bill? The noble Viscount who introduced the Bill said it would leave powers to this House which, if wisely used,
<col>894</col>
would enable the House to exercise a constant and very important influence upon the whole character and shape of legislation. Who is to be the arbiter as to whether this House acts wisely or not? It must be, under this Bill, nothing else but the House of Commons. Supposing they consider it necessary at any future time to reduce the limit of delay allowed by the Bill from two years to one, and finally to abolish it altogether, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent them doing it. The House of Lords has no say whatever in regard to any alteration in the period of delay which is allowed under the Bill as it now stands, and the House of Commons might in future curtail its powers still further. Noble Lords opposite may say these are matters which are very unlikely to happen and therefore it is rather absurd to press them. I venture to think matters affecting the continuance of the Crown, and other things I have referred to, are so important that you cannot have too many safeguards to ensure that they are preserved to this country. Besides, if noble Lords think such possibilities are remote and improbable they can have no objection to safeguarding against them by placing them outside the scope of this Bill.<lb/>
Let me turn to the other side&#x2014;to those measures which are not common between the two sides of this House, such for instance as Home Rule for Ireland. If a mandate was given for Home Rule at the last election, then no mandate was given to tamper with this House in any way whatever. If, on the other hand, a mandate was given to deal with the constitution or powers of the House of Lords, then no mandate was given for Home Rule. You cannot have it both ways. If any elector had applied to those paragons of virtue, the supporters of the Gladstone League, and had said, "I am strongly opposed to Home Rule, but I am anxious to deal with the House of Lords, which way am I to vote?" I venture to think any member of the League would have replied, "Oh, you vote for the Liberal Party." Supposing any elector had come up and said, "I am strongly in favour of Home Rule, but. I am equally strongly against any serious tampering with the House of Lords," he would promptly have been told, "Really what is going to be done to the House of Lords is a very trivial matter, and you will be perfectly safe in voting for the Liberal Party." How can you say you have a mandate for either of
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0452"/>
<col>895</col>
those things, if you are going to try to claim mandates for both? Let us be clear on this matter. Do the Government still adhere to the principles laid down by Mr. Asquith as to the powers of a Second Chamber, or do they the not; and if not, what do they mean by a Second Chamber? Let us have a definition, not in political language which differs as much as a political conscience from that in ordinary use, but in language which can be understood by the people, as to what is meant by a Second Chamber. Do they really believe in a Second Chamber, or do they agree with a noble Lord, Lord Marchamley, who, speaking with greater frankness than most of Ins colleagues, said that this Bill gives single chamber government in one shape or form, but tempered by two years' delay, which, as we know, may at any time be abolished?<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, in introducing the Bill, said&#x2014;
<quote>"What a shallow view it is that an institution like the House of Lords, so famous, so entrenched in the roots of traditional power in a nation that is so attached to old institutions as our country is, should fall before the blast of a few Party trumpets&#x0021;"</quote>
Then he proceeded to blow his own Party trumpet and said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Bill is there; the Bill stands."</quote>
I refuse to take that shallow view. I refuse to think this House is right in giving up all the functions which have been entrusted to it throughout the centuries at the blast of a Party trumpet such as that sounded by the noble Viscount. I believe that in supporting the Bill of the noble Marquess for the reform of this House, and in opposing this Bill as it at present stands, I am more faithfully interpreting the wishes of the people as expressed at the last election, so far as they expressed any at all, than noble Lords opposite who take no part in the reconstitution of this House but only desire a limitation of its powers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01455"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I only rise to state in as few words as possible, the reasons which would have obliged me, owing to the convictions I hold on these matters, to vote against this Bill were a Division challenged on the Second Reading had we not heard on the first evening of the debate from the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, who spoke on behalf of our leaders, the pledge that he or some of his colleagues, would, if the Bill was read a second time, move and insist upon Amendments in Committee to exclude as I under-
<col>896</col>
stand from the purview of the Bill various important Constitutional problems which are to be defined hereafter. I should have voted against the Bill, and I do not for one moment believe that I should have been alone on this side in taking that stand, if we had not received the assurance from the noble Viscount to which I have referred. There are two or three reasons which would have compelled me to do so, and these I will as briefly as possible mention to your Lordships.<lb/>
In the first place, I am sure every member of this House must in his heart of hearts acknowledge that, after all, we are only trustees of the power we have exercised as members of this House, trustees for thousands, for tens of thousands, for I might say, hundreds of thousands of voters, as the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, very eloquently explained to the House. I think we should have been false to our trust had we been willing to give up those powers of trusteeship until a far more definite mandate had been given by the electors, at all events of this island, to order us to give up that trust. In the second place, I should have voted against the Second Reading of this Bill because there is no doubt whatever, despite any remarks to the contrary, that the Bill as it stands does set up single Chamber government, subject, as my noble friend Lord Stanhope said, to a suspensory Veto of two or three years. Noble Lords opposite and their supporters hardly take the trouble to deny that the Bill as it stands would set up single Chamber government. We have heard speeches from the opposite benches over and over again in the course of this debate in which it has, in effect, been said, "After all, why do you complain that this Bill would set up a system of single Chamber government when during the many years that Unionist Governments held office in this country we were, practically existing under a system of one Chamber government all the time? "Of course, the whole difference is very easy to see. Even if it were true that during certain Administrations we were living under a system of single Chamber government, at all events the powers of this House were preserved in their entirety. They were only, if you like to put it so, dormant on certain occasions; but under the present Bill they are to be abolished. On this as on other subjects you should endeavour to judge, not from the point of view of the partisan, but as anxious, like the great
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0453"/>
<col>897</col>
majority of moderate people in this country, to see a system of stability preserved in our country.<lb/>
It seems to me that the answer to noble Lords opposite is perfectly easy. It is such a case as you might see in every foreign country where there are two Chambers. Whenever a Conservative Government is in power the Senate, which under any system must be a more Conservative body than the popularly-elected Chamber, obviously exercises its power on many fewer occasions in opposition to the Lower Chamber than in the case when a Radical Government is in power and measures come up from the Lower House which to the minds of those who form the majority of the Upper House appear to threaten the stability of the country. This Bill in its present state practically sweeps away the one remaining check which stands between us and the omnipotence of the Cabinet. More than that, it is the only remaining check which stands between us and the possibilities of revolution. I am not going to contend this evening, in the few words I shall add to what I have already said, that His Majesty's present advisers are contemplating at this moment, or I hope during the remaining term of their office, anything of a revolutionary character, but you must remember that the strength of a chain depends on the strength of its weakest link. The possibilities of Radical legislation include the intentions, not only of the more moderate members of the Party, of whom my noble friend Lord Newton drew such an amusing portrait this evening, but of the most violent members of the Party. It is against the possible intentions of the latter that, if you pass this Bill in its present shape, you are removing the last safeguard.<lb/>
It is idle for noble Lords opposite to tell us that the suspensory Veto provides any real check. The suspensory Veto offered us by this Bill is, I venture to say, a useless and a derisory check, likely, I really believe, to do more harm than good. Take for one moment a concrete case. Supposing the Parliament Bill in its present shape becomes law. The next step, as we are all aware, would be the introduction of a Home Rule Bill, which would be rushed through the House of Commons, as legislation is rushed through nowadays, with practically no discussion at all. That Bill would then automatically become law at the outside at the end of two years. Just consider for
<col>898</col>
a moment what would be the position of Ireland during those two years. I cannot help thinking that during the suspensory period of two years, given that the opponents of the Home Rule Bill had no power or chance of influencing public opinion to stop it, the whole of Ireland would be in a welter of confusion, riots and rows and difficulties of every sort going on, and the country would be lucky if it escaped bloodshed, even if the suspension of the Veto did not, as it very likely would do, bring about civil war. A suspensory Veto would be absolutely useless from our point of view unless many important constitutional problems are excluded from the operation of this Bill by Amendments to be provided hereafter.<lb/>
There is only one other point on which I will venture to say a word. As I read history, the princes and statesmen who generation after generation, with the consent of the people, have brought the existing Constitution of this country into the shape in which we now know it, have worked with one main object always before their eyes&#x2014;namely, to endeavour to secure the stability of that Constitution, the safety of these kingdoms, the security of property, equal rights for all classes&#x2014;in a word, to provide that these islands should be well administered. Their object was not to devise that alternate facilities should be given to Conservative and Radical Governments enabling them to carry through measures that might please their followers in succession and incidentally lengthen their tenure of office. In all the wide field of administration it has never been contended by noble Lords opposite that the House of Lords has ever attempted to interfere with Conservative or Radical Governments. But as regards the reform of the constitution of the Houses of Parliament themselves, both Houses have rights; and I am not prepared to give consent to the Second Reading of this measure except on the understanding that when we go into Committee we shall be at liberty to vote for those Amendments that our leaders intend to move to take away from the operation of the Bill various matters of the gravest Constitutional importance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01456"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland said that the proposals of the noble Marquess involved greater sacrifices by individuals than those contained in this Bill. There I agree with him. But the voluntary
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0454"/>
<col>899</col>
sacrifice of an individual for the benefit of his country has always been looked upon as one of the highest forms of virtue. It was praised by the old classical writers, and it is also praised by not a few of the modern ones. Lord Pentland's appeal will fail. Distasteful as the proposals may be to us personally, we who sit on the Back Benches on this side are not to be cajoled by the bribe of remaining in a powerless Chamber in preference to attempting to constitute in place of this House one of greater efficiency. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack asked for fair play between the Parties. Give it to us yourselves. Pass a Redistribution Bill reducing your majority in another place to the proportion you are fairly entitled to according to your numbers in the country.<lb/>
This House is said to be prepared to commit political suicide. Yes; but only on condition of being allowed to make its own will and to have something to say as to the nomination of its executors. If this House dies it should bequeath its power to the people, and not to the House of Commons. It is, I understand, only prepared to abdicate on condition of passing its present power on unimpaired either to another House or to the people themselves in the form of a Referendum, which should be compulsory in all cases where changes in the Constitution are contemplated. If this Bill is passed unaltered our unwritten Constitution is destroyed by making a part of it dependent on Statute Law. If part of our Constitution is to be dependent on Statute Law, then the whole of it, and not merely such portions as suit one Party, should be made into law. That written Constitution should be completed by the Referendum, by a redistribution of seats, proportional representation, and a reconstitution of the House of Lords. I mention these subjects in what I consider to be the order of their importance. At present I shall only touch on the most important of these&#x2014;the Referendum.<lb/>
I should like to see Lord Balfour of Burleigh's Reference to the People Bill passed and incorporated with the Bill now before us with the addition of two clauses. The first of these clauses would be to the effect that all changes in the Constitution should be referred to a poll of the people; the second that the Crown should have the power of referring any measure or action
<col>900</col>
taken to a poll of the people, either with or without the consent of the Prime Minister. At present the Prerogative of the Crown is looked upon by some people as if it were the private property of the Prime Minister. Suppose that this Parliament Bill becomes law without any alteration being made in it and that three factious factions of the House of Commons wish to pass three Bills without delay, one to please each section of their Party but to each of which a majority of the country is opposed, and that the Prime Minister, desirous of remaining in office and only able to do so by means of this unholy alliance, insists on the creation of several hundred Peers, so as to avoid the postponement of these three Bills. I do not myself think that Mr. Redmond will be at all prepared to wait for two years for his Bills, but will continue to put pressure on the Government and force them to do as he wishes. Would it not be desirable that the Crown should have the power of consulting the people by Referendum before consenting to such a high-handed proceeding? Under this Bill the Prime Minister would have far more power than can be safely entrusted to any one man in a free country, and, I do not look for moderation in a Government whose existence depends on the support of Irish Home Rulers and Socialists.<lb/>
Take another case. Imagine some future House of Commons, or perhaps the present one, conscious of its own unpopularity, a majority of whom were afraid of losing their &#x00A3;400 a year, or it may be &#x00A3;4,000 a year by that time, to have passed a Bill postponing the election. Ought there not to be a power behind the House of Commons capable of appealing to the people under such circumstances, on such a matter? Or would an appeal to the people by means of a Referendum be looked upon as an intolerable wrong? In actual practice I think that the Crown would seldom require to use the Referendum. The knowledge that the Crown had the Referendum in reserve would make a Prime Minister cautious as to what advice he gave. It has been said that there would be a difficulty in getting the people to understand what they were voting about when the Referendum was put before them. It would be no greater in Great Britain than in our Colonies and in other countries who use the Referendum; none of whom, after having experienced its benefits, are at all
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0455"/>
<col>901</col>
likely to give it up. The people of this country are not less intelligent than the inhabitants of our Colonies or of America or Switzerland and would be able to vote with quite as much ease as is the case in those countries on the Referendum. It will be as simple as putting the Third Reading of a Bill before either House at the present moment. The people will be asked to say Aye or No to a Bill which has been for a long time before them. It will be a sort of Fourth Reading. At least a month's notice should be given of a Referendum, so that the people should have time to study the points of the Bill. The last election was rushed before people had time to learn what the Referendum meant; even before platform speakers had time to give the matter the attention that it deserved.<lb/>
The noble Viscount the Minister of War has made the admission that the private Member is now extinct in the House of Commons. Is that progress, or is it retrogression? If he cannot be resuscitated the country is on the high road towards losing its liberties and succumbing under a despotism disguised as a democracy. History shows that that has been the fate of most democracies. The noble Viscount has said that the only remedy for the House of Commons is Devolution. There is another remedy, and a better one&#x2014;reduction of numbers, say to 500. But would the members of that Assembly be prepared to emulate the patriotism of the House of Lords by passing a self-denying ordinance which would lessen their personal chances of continuing to sit in the House of Commons? The second remedy is to increase the use of the time limit for speeches in the House of Commons. We are asked by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack to look upon the House of Commons as absolutely representing the wishes of the people. My Lords, it distorts the wishes of the people. A molehill of a majority in the country becomes a mountain of a majority in the House of Commons.<lb/>
Your Lordships have doubtless seen I what are called magic mirrors at shows or fairs. According as they are convex or concave or otherwise curved, so do they misrepresent the appearance of those who look at them. The House of Commons as at present elected gives a magic mirror reflection of the wishes of the people, and that is why a Referendum should be introduced into this country so as to give a true
<col>902</col>
and accurate reflection of the mind of the people. The House of Commons is nearly as much in need of reform as it was before 1832, and can in no sense be looked upon as representing the people to the same extent as a Referendum. Look at the unrepresented minorities of Wales and the South of Ireland. Of course minorities must expect to be outvoted, but they should not be unheard. "Strike, but hear me," said Themistocles on a memorable occasion. It is not only that they have no one to speak for them in the House itself, but an English Member can find no one on his side of the House to give him information on Welsh or South Irish matters, either on the terrace or in the smoking room. A vote by Referendum would restore these minorities to political life.<lb/>
In conclusion, I wish to express the hope, when Amendments are being considered in the Committee stage of this Bill, that the two clauses to which I have alluded may find favour in this House. First, that every alteration to the Constitution, including this Parliament Bill, should be submitted to the people by Referendum before becoming law. And, secondly, that the Crown, in cases of perplexity, should have the power of consulting the people by Referendum with or without the advice of the Prime Minister.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01457"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not at this late hour intend to trouble the House more than a few minutes. It is difficult, after the very long debate we have had, to say much that is new or that has not already been referred to. Perhaps I may be allowed to glance at some of the deeper causes which have led to this unfortunate dispute and which I do not think have been dwelt upon, or, if they have, not at any great length. I think nobody who looks dispassionately at the whole state of affairs can fail to see that it has arisen owing to the gross abuse of the Party system in this country&#x2014;an abuse which has reached dimensions of an altogether deplorable character, and might even be said to be of a scandalous nature. I am not going to deny that there are difficulties in the constitution of this House. Indeed I should like to endorse what fell from my noble friend Lord Harris last night. I understood him to say that it had long been his opinion that the extreme preponderance of Conservative views in this House, although not alt-r
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0456"/>
<col>903</col>
gether to the exclusion of Liberal views, would sooner or later lead inevitably to some attempt at a readjustment of the difficulty.<lb/>
But when we see what is really proposed by this Bill it is simply a question of Party, Party, Party, What has been the appeal of speaker after speaker on the Government side as a reason for passing this very drastic measure? I think it is not an unfair statement to say that if one thing is more dwelt upon than another it is that the Party at present in power in the other House have not, according to the speakers' views, had fair play, that they have brought forward measures which have met, as they say, an untoward fate in this House, and that that is an intolerable state of affairs which they resent. But it is impossible not to see also that in trying to remedy that abuse&#x2014;and if it is an abuse it ought to be remedied in a fair and statesmanlike way&#x2014;they immediately go to the other extreme, and what they are really wishing to do is, not merely to give their Party a fair chance, but to make it absolutely supreme, and, if possible, irrevocably so. It is simply a question of a fight between one side and another&#x2014;one side to prevail to the exclusion of everybody who disagrees with them. I think this is beginning to be felt throughout the country generally.<lb/>
Some of your Lordships may have seen a letter in one of the newspapers from a candidate at the last General Election. The letter appeared, I think, a short time after the election was finished. I do not think the writer gave his name, and it does not very much matter who he was. He detailed how, at the commencement of his campaign, he endeavoured to approach the subject from what he considered a high point of view, by impressing upon the electors the great trust they had and how they should approach the questions of the day in a spirit of statesmanlike equity, and not merely as a Party fight. As time went on he found that these views were not very popular either with his antagonists or with his own side, and his Party leaders intimated to him in very strong terms that that line of argument would not do and that he must resort to other means. He went on to say that, to his great regret, he had to go back to the old methods of simply bitter vituperation
<col>904</col>
of his adversaries, making them out to be everything that was bad, and that that sort of argument was received with tumultuous applause and eventually he won his election. I am not sure which side he was on, but that does not very much matter. I almost suspect, from the sentiment with which he began, that he was a candidate of the Liberal Party. He ended up, in words rather more forcible than polite, that evidently the people of this country and the powers that be regarded an election simply as a "dog-fight." That, perhaps, is a somewhat extreme manner of expressing oneself, but I think it does express exactly how unthinking people who take part in politics do regard these great questions.<lb/>
It is said that all this has arisen through the fault of your Lordships and because you have done wrong. Of course, the main argument brought forward is that because the House of Lords were wicked enough to throw out the Budget a short time ago they strained their Constitutional powers and must not wonder if they are punished for it. I am not going to enter into the question as to whether we were right or wrong in throwing out the Budget. Opinions differ throughout the country. But assuming for a moment, for the sake of argument, that it was a wrong course to pursue, is that really a reason why the powers of this ancient House which has been a part of the Constitution for so many hundreds of years should be, if not in form, in substance, practically destroyed? Is it seriously contended by responsible members of the Government that the government of this great country, including the welfare of millions of innocent men, women, and children, is simply to be regarded as a matter of reprisals between one Party and another? If you are preaching that doctrine it is dangerously near to a doctrine of anarchy. Nothing will prosper if things are to be regarded in that way and every question of stability to be set at nought. Does that system commend itself to any man of business in ordinary life? Take any great commercial venture&#x2014;for instance, a great railway. It may be admitted that the traffic or the business of a railway has been open to abuse, that it has not been properly conducted, and that there are various things which certainly call for a remedy. Would that be an argument for entirely doing away with the whole railway system? The argument will not bear looking at for a moment.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0457"/>
<col>905</col>
I think that in the view of all moderate and sensible men it must be seen sooner or later that this Bill goes a great deal too far. Quite apart from any Party question, it is much more likely to do harm than good. I hope I am wrong, but sometimes the idea is borne in upon one that there is something rather more than meets the eye in the whole of this controversy, and it may be that what is really aimed at is nothing more or less than a dictatorship on the part of two or three individuals taking advantage of the Party system. I earnestly hope I am wrong in this, and that it is a fancy which has no real truth in it, because, supposing for a moment there is any truth in the idea, the people of the country, although taken in for the time being, would certainly not approve of such a state of affairs and would sweep it away with a very drastic hand.<lb/>
The evils which might arise from an indiscriminate use of this Bill if it became law have already been pointed out. There is, of course, the very serious question of Home Rule&#x2014;namely, giving the government of a portion of His Majesty's Dominions to men who unfortunately are avowedly hostile to this kingdom. One of the most curious things about that part of the story is that there is no concealment about it on the part of these gentlemen. We cannot blame them for want of candour at any rate. We are very sorry that they should take such a hostile view to this country, but they have gone out of their way from time to time on hundreds of platforms to tell us that they intend to take every advantage they can of the situation to have their own way inimical to the interests of England. There is, you might almost say, a certain amount of chivalry in the way they have brought forward this question. They conceal nothing; it rather reminds one of the old ideas of combat in the Middle Ages when it was customary to warn your adversary, "Draw and defend yourself."<lb/>
There is also the question of Church disestablishment in Wales, which, I am afraid, strikes a blow at religious feeling in one part of the Kingdom which might be fraught with the most serious consequences. There is another point arising out of the question of the reversal of the Osborne judgment and all that is comprised in that serious matter as affecting the trade of this country. To this unfortunate category one might add one or two other things. There might be
<col>906</col>
a very alarming state of finance brought about, not necessarily merely by means of a Budget or by means of Money Bills over which this House is supposed not to have any control. One of the grave dangers to this country is the reckless state of finance, especially among local authorities; and if the jurisdiction of this House were practically taken away I think the country would be in a far more serious position financially than it is at the present moment. It might be a matter of grave and serious danger which I think should be considered by all thoughtful lovers of their country. It might even lead to some tampering with such a serious affair as the National Debt, and there are many other things of which it is difficult to see the end.<lb/>
One or two remedies have been pointed out for the present state of affairs. There is, of course, the Reconstitution Bill of which we have heard so much lately, and of which I suppose we shall hear a certain amount more, and that I hope may do good. But I venture to think that the real remedy for this unfortunate state of affairs is, if you could possibly bring it about&#x2014;and I do not think it is really beyond the wit of man to do it&#x2014;to have an equalisation of Parties in both Houses of Parliament. If you could bring about a condition of things in this House so as to have Liberal and Conservative ideas more equally balanced than they are at present that would take the sting out of a great deal of what is evil in this House, and which must be admitted to be evil, and would go a great way towards solving this problem. But more than that, the real remedy of all, in my view, would be secured if you could possibly produce a strong Reform Bill by which you could obtain in the other House of Parliament something like an equal representation of the two Parties in every constituency. This may sound a very big aim and a very big thing to suggest, but again I say I do not think that it would be beyond the wit of man to contrive. Various great changes have been brought about in the last few years in this country which would have astonished our forefathers, changes which would a short time ago have been considered absolutely impossible, but which have, nevertheless, been brought forward and received the sanction of law. Is it absolutely impossible that such a state of affairs as I have foreshadowed should be ultimately brought about, and that we should have the Party system put upon such
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0458"/>
<col>907</col>
a basis? The present Party system is, perhaps, one of the best that we can have so long as it is not abused. It appears to me to be one of the conditions of success of the Party system that you should have something like equality on both sides, because if you are to have a fight on one side and the other; sometimes one side predominating and sometimes the other, it seems to me that you will always have these difficulties and conflicts created between the two Parties and the two Chambers, which, if they have any effect at all, have a bad effect upon the stability of the country and its general welfare.<lb/>
I earnestly hope that the Government and the Statesmen of this country will consider this point, and see whether such a position might not ultimately be arrived at. I trust that in the meanwhile, even at the eleventh hour of this great controversy, some sensible views and prudent counsels may prevail. Various hints have been thrown out on one side and the other possibly indicating that even at the last moment there may be some sort of fair
<col>908</col>
compromise in this matter; but no sooner were those brought forward than another speaker hastened to correct them and say that there was absolutely nothing of the sort to be thought of. I am anxious, as I need not say, that such a course may ultimately prevail. I think if this question could be settled in an amicable and fair way, instead of in a mere polemical and spiteful manner, things might still go right with the country. Otherwise, if this is done simply in a spirit of hostility and spite, however much the people of this country may endorse a Bill which they do not understand at the present moment, they will ultimately take a very serious view of this question, and we may hear them re-echo that sad cry which was uttered by our neighbours, the French, in their hour of need, <i>Nous sommes trahis.</i><lb/>

<title>PARLIAMENT BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01483">Debate on the Motion for the Second Reading <i>resumed</i> (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01484"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure we all greatly regret that Lord Halsbury, who was to have resumed this debate this afternoon, is unfortunately not well enough to be present. In these circumstances I am painfully conscious that I must ask your Lordships on this occasion for even more than the usual indulgence which you are good enough to give me. This Bill, however the Government may attempt to disguise the fact, certainly introduces single-Chamber government, and what makes the step the more remarkable is that the very same Government which has given a Second Chamber to our self-governing Colonies is taking it away from the Mother Country. What are the functions and powers claimed for this House? Your Lordships never would resist, and never have resisted, the clearly expressed wishes of the country. There cannot, therefore, be any permanent conflict between the two Houses. Take even the case of the Budget of 1909. Your Lordships regarded it as so confiscatory, so inquisitional, and so unwise that you referred it to the country. Wisely or unwisely the country approved it, and your Lordships gave way. The worst, then, that could happen under existing circumstances is a delay of a year or two. This, however, is of little consequence in the history of a nation, while on the other hand a false step might lead to disastrous consequences and would be difficult to recall. In private life we all know that it is better to sleep over a step beforehand than to be kept awake by it afterwards. So far as mere delay is concerned there is little difference; whether it is two or four years matters little in the history of the country; but what is essential in this case is that the four years implies the possibility of reference to the country. What this Bill really abolishes is not the Veto of the House of Lords, but the Veto of the country.<lb/>
For its present functions this House is admirably qualified. This was admitted by Lord Crewe. Even Mr. Redmond a few years ago said&#x2014;
<quote>"Remember for one moment what the House of Lords is. It is an integral portion of the Constitution of England. It holds a large place in English history. Most of the present holders of the titles in the House of Lords are the descendants of the men who wrung the Charter from John on the
<col>912</col>
plains of Runnymede. They are the descendants of men who in the past history of Britain fought the battles of England against the world, and I say to abolish that portion of the Constitution, which is older probably in point of antiquity, in point of history, than the House of Commons itself&#x2014;to abolish that means a revolution greater than any that has taken place in the whole constitutional history of England."</quote>
This, however, he does not expect to do, but he believes he <i>can</i> coerce the House of Commons, and his object therefore is to destroy this House in order to carry Home Rule by the House of Commons alone, and, as he knows, against the views of the people of Great Britain. We have tried single-Chamber government once, so did France&#x2014;in both cases with disastrous results. In our case the House of Commons prolonged its own existence, and beheaded the King; having got rid of the Lords they expelled the Opposition, then they ejected the minority, and finally the Rump were themselves driven out by military force.<lb/>
It is alleged that a Liberal Government cannot pass its measures. This argument has been completely disposed of over and over again. For instance, Mr. Brooks in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> showed that the Government have passed 233 Bills out of 236. Moreover, it must be remembered that there are also Bills passed by this House which are lost in the House of Commons. Then we are told that the policy of the Government as shown in this Bill has been twice affirmed by the country. But on the first occasion the Government lost no less than 100 seats. The election of last December turned on several questions. I believe the result was due very much to the fear of Protection, but at any rate though the Government won back two seats their voters were 150,000 less. No&#x0021; the real reason for this Bill is that the House of Lords is to be reduced to a chrysalis state in order that Home Rule may be passed against the wishes of the people. I believe that Nemesis will follow but the mischief will be done, and the Government will have secured a year or two more of office. The Government victory, if so it can be called, was due, first, to the fear of higher prices of food; second, to a campaign of calumny and misrepresentation. Mr. Lloyd George attacks the House of Lords because he says that Peers "are not in touch with the realities of life." He says&#x2014;
<quote>"The earning of bread by the sweat of their brow is unknown to them. &#x2026; They know nothing of the responsibility and the anxiety of
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0461"/>
<col>913</col>
conducting a business, great or small. They know nothing of the daily worries of the trader's existence&#x2014;the care and thought spent, the knowledge and experience gathered in a million ways in earning a living."</quote>
These statements, even if true, have nothing to do with the issue now before the country, since the House of Lords has intimated its readiness to consider any wise, even if drastic, proposals for reconstruction.<lb/>
But are Mr. Lloyd George's statements true? Has he correctly stated the facts? Certainly not. The House of Lords numbers among its members four presidents or ex-presidents of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, three of the London Chamber of Commerce, the chairman of the London Bankers, the chairman of the Country Bankers, the president of the Association of English Bankers, the chairmen of several of our great railway companies&#x2014;the London and North Western, the Great Western, the Great Northern, &amp;c.&#x2014;the heads of our greatest shipping and shipbuilding companies&#x2014;Harland &amp; Wolff, Cunard, Furness, Wilson, &amp;c.&#x2014;and, amongst banks and financial houses, the heads of the London County and Westminster Bank, of the London Joint Stock Bank, and of Rothschilds, Barings, Glyns, Robarts, Gibbs, Hubbards, &amp;c.<lb/>
This Bill deprives your Lordships of all power as regards finance. No other Second Chamber is so limited. Moreover, it is precisely as regards finance that a Second Chamber is of importance. There are a good many countries with but a Single Chamber. Are they prosperous? Are they examples we should wish to follow? I do not dwell on Turkey or Bulgaria, because in them representative government is so recent. The others are Servia, Greece, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Salvador, Panama and St. Domingo. Most of them are bankrupt. No wonder, then, that this Bill is viewed with great apprehension in financial and commercial circles, no wonder that our national credit is falling. The abolition of all power on the part of the House of Lords will certainly lead to ill-considered expenditure and increased taxation. It is significant that the first use made of it by the House of Commons is to vote themselves salaries. Admitted that the imposition of taxes is primarily a matter for the House of Commons, still questions of policy and of expenditure ought to come before both
<col>914</col>
Houses. Almost everything is more or less a question of finance.<lb/>
Then we are told that this House is hereditary and not representative. If this were a fair statement, is it any justification for the violent attacks made on your Lordships? We did not make the Constitution. But I submit that the statement is misleading. Our system of election makes the so-called representation of the people a mere mockery. The House of Commons is not really representative. The anomalies are extraordinary. Romford has 56,000 voters; Kilkenny, 1,600. The Irish Nationalist voters are about as numerous as those of London, but the Nationalists have 75 Members and Loudon only 15. Taking the House of Commons as a whole, the Radical voters are 3,300,000; the Unionist, 2,900,000. This would give the Government a majority of 38, whereas they have 126. Thus they have 88 seats too many. Moreover, twice of late years a minority in the country has secured a majority in the House of Commons. Thus under this Bill a minority of electors might, and certainly sometimes would, become absolute masters of the country. In fact, the House of Lords is representative though not elective, while the House of Commons is elective but not representative.<lb/>
The Government at present have a temporary and casual majority. The most rev. Primate the other day made a striking and powerful appeal to the Government to exercise moderation in these circumstances. I am sorry that I do not see any signs on the part of the Government that they are willing to do anything of the kind, They seem determined to press their advantage to the bitter end. It cannot however, be a final settlement. This want of consideration for the rights of minorities, this determination to press any temporary advantage to the utmost, is one of the main reasons why democracies in the history of the world have never been permanent. We may all look forward with hope but we cannot disguise from ourselves that there are elements of anxiety. Our Oversea Dominions are in one sense a source of strength, and we are all proud of them; but they may, and do raise questions of much difficulty. At home also there are problems of great complexity which require careful and cautious consideration. This Bill will inevitably lead to ill-considered expenditure and hasty legislation. Your Lordships
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0462"/>
<col>915</col>
have shown that you are prepared to make any personal sacrifices; but I believe that single-Chamber government has always proved unsuccessful, and often disastrous, and that a strong Second Chamber is absolutely necessary to the prosperity of a country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01485"><member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to add my protest to those of noble Lords who on this side have already spoken against the measure now before your Lordships. The noble Viscount the Leader of the House told us when introducing this Bill that in his opinion this House would, under the Bill, still retain great powers in future legislation. I must honestly confess that I fail to understand how that can be. It appears that if this Bill is passed unamended and as it now stands, it cannot but have one result, and that is to set up for the second time in the history of this country the tyranny of an unchecked House of Commons&#x2014;a House which I contend does not, and cannot until there is a Redistribution Bill, represent the true will of the people.<lb/>
There can be little doubt that the underlying principle of this Bill is nothing more or less than a conspiracy against your Lordships' House, and for that reason I regard it, as all must do, as an outrage against our Constitution. As many noble Lords have already said, the Bill has undoubtedly been conceived in a spirit of vindictiveness and partisanship. For those reasons alone, I for one, had it not been for noble Lords on the Front Opposition Bench assuring us that when we come to the Committee stage stringent Amendments will be brought forward, would certainly have joined the Duke of Northumberland and voted against the Second Reading of this Bill. Although I recognise that I am a "backwoodsman," I must confess I am at a loss to understand by what Constitutional law one House has the right, with or without the Royal Assent, to deprive the other House of its powers without its assent. I maintain that the country has not fairly considered this question, and I believe that when the people once understand the true meaning of this Bill they will be quick to realise that it is a folly to abandon that which we have had in this country for so many hundreds of years&#x2014;the safeguardianship of two-Chamber government, which has always been regarded as the pride of our forefathers and the model of all the free people of the civilised world.<lb/>

The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, has told us pretty frequently of late that this Bill has been brought forward because a crisis has arisen owing to our action with regard to the Budget of 1909. That line of argument has been repudiated already by many noble Lords on this side and has been proved to be a fallacy, for there can be little doubt that the present situation was inevitable ever since the General Election of 1906. The Government at that time clearly showed that they were determined, against all Constitutional precedents, to reverse the legislation of their predecessors, instead of, as former Governments had done, proceeding with their own. I contend that by submitting the Budget to the people before allowing it to pass into law this House earned the estimation of the people as a whole. No one can say that they showed much resentment by our so doing; certainly not the Irish, no matter what tactics they may have adopted subsequently. Personally I am pleased to think that when speaking in the Budget debate I rightly gauged the opinion of those in that part of the country in which I live&#x2014;namely, the county of Kent. I said in the course of the debate that I felt sure the people regarded it as our duty to refer the Budget to the electorate before allowing it to pass into law. The result of that appeal in my county was that the fifteen constituencies there returned fifteen Members to the House of Commons pledged to vote against that measure. If the noble Viscount, instead of alluding to the Budget, had told us that the position had become more acute in 1909 and that for that reason it had been announced in the King's Speech that the Government intended to reconstruct the House of Lords, I venture to think, with all respect to him, he would have been nearer the mark.<lb/>
But, as your Lordships are aware, the Government have complied with the demands of their Nationalist and Socialist allies, and instead of reconstructing this House they have introduced a Bill under which this House will retain all those anomalies of composition which the last two General Elections have clearly shown supply such useful material for gross misrepresentation by certain Cabinet Ministers on public platforms. I am glad that the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, mentioned this the other evening, for in my opinion the gross misrepresentation which took place was a disgrace to Party politics. This Bill
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0463"/>
<col>917</col>
clearly shows that the policy of the present Government is a destructive one, whilst that of the Bill of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition is a constructive one. I am well aware that there are certain noble Lords on this side of the House who do not agree with the introduction of the noble Marquess's Bill. In my opinion the noble Marquess was absolutely justified in introducing that measure. It was but a frank admission of the fact shown at the last two General Elections, that the retention of a purely hereditary Chamber is not in harmony with the spirit of the age&#x2014;that is to say, birth alone should be no qualification for a seat in your Lordships' House. That to my mind is the real view of the electorate on this question.<lb/>
I do not believe for one moment that there is any ill-feeling in the country against your Lordships' House in any sort of way. Such being the case I was somewhat surprised to hear the speeches of certain noble Lords on the other side&#x2014;I refer more especially to their "backwoodsmen," for I presume they have some and that we on this side are not alone distinguished for those much abused individuals&#x2014;in speaking against the noble Marquess's Bill the other day. The speech I refer to more particularly was that of Lord St. Davids, who expressed the opinion that distinguished soldiers, sailors, lawyers, and diplomats should be retained in this House. In fact, if I may say so, he seemed to express the opinion that this House as a Second Chamber was a model Assembly, and I am not at all sure that the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War did not express very much the same view. At any rate, the noble Viscount told us that he thought there was a great omission in the Schedule at the end of the noble Marquess's Bill, inasmuch as it did not include the chairmen of the County Associations. This clearly indicates to my mind that those two noble Lords at any rate do not advocate a large reduction in the numbers of your Lordships' House. We were told the other day by the noble Viscount the Leader of the House that the Government favoured a membership of about 150. Therefore the two noble Viscounts on the Front Government Bench do not find themselves much in agreement on the subject of numbers.<lb/>
I think it will be generally agreed that Lord Rosebery was right when he said that if this Bill unamended becomes part of the
<col>918</col>
fundamental law of the land., Lord Lansdowne's Bill or any other Bill would become insignificant. Unless noble Lords on the other side of the House can refute that argument, and I am sure that is not the case, then it is perfectly plain that we in this country are about to pass into an era of single-Chamber government, in which the Government, and more especially the Cabinet, will become omnipotent&#x2014;in fact, absolute masters of our destiny. The noble Viscount, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, told us that in his opinion the last two General Elections endorsed the Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill. I do not admit that for a moment. But I would like to ask the noble Viscount whether, if his statement is correct, he claims that the last General Election also gave the Government the tacit commission to separate Ireland from Great Britain, to plunder the established Church, and at the same time to saddle the already oppressed taxpayers by giving annual salaries to Members of Parliament. If he does claim that, then I think your Lordships' House is justified in asking what sort of Home Rule the Government propose. If the noble Viscount refrains from answering that question, I think it is our duty, as guardians of the liberties of the people of this country, to so amend this Bill that we shall know where we stand, for it is by this means, and this means alone, that we shall be able to prevent the possibility of such disastrous consequences arising.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01486"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had not intended to speak in this debate, but the speech which was delivered by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack last Wednesday seems to me to call for an answer from those who claim to represent Irish Unionist opinion in this House. Not only did the noble and learned Lord tell us that His Majesty's Government intended to utilise this Bill when it was passed into law for the purpose of passing, without reference to the people and probably against their will, a measure of Home Rule, which he said had been near and dear to his heart for the last twenty years, a measure which has twice been submitted to the people of this country and twice by them rejected by overwhelming majorities on the ground that it was sure to result in oppression of the Unionist minority and eventually in the disintegration of the United Kingdom&#x2014;not only did he tell us that, but he went on
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0464"/>
<col>919</col>
to state that the Unionist opposition to Home Rule, particularly on the part of the younger members of our Party, had of late years greatly diminished. This is the statement which I think calls at once for as categorical a contradiction as Parliamentary good manners permit to be made.<lb/>
I venture to say that the Unionist opposition to Home Rule has in no way diminished. So far as the younger members of the Party are concerned, they may not have discussed it so much because they have been brought up to believe that it is a heresy of which the greater part of the Liberal Party had purged itself. Nobody would say of either the Prime Minister or the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War that he was a keen Home Ruler; but they are obliged to take action at the orders of their Nationalist masters, and I am certain that at the present minute they are trying to arrange a Bill of as much of the gas and water description as those masters will allow them to bring forward. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack will, I am sure, agree with me when I say that with regard to this matter he occupies the position of an armchair politician. Neither his life nor his property will be affected should a Home Rule measure pass into law, but for us who live in Ireland and who love the country it means death, disaster, and damnation to those hopes we had entertained of a brighter and regenerated Ireland, proud to be able to take her place as an integral part of the United Kingdom. The opposition to Home Rule has not diminished, but what has diminished is the demand for it on the part of the Nationalists in Ireland, more especially of those farmers who have bought their holdings and who find that they have nothing to gain by it; on the other hand, they know that it will mean increased taxation while at the same time there will be a cessation of that golden flow from this country to which they owe their present comfortable position.<lb/>
We are told that this Bill is to become law for the purpose of rendering more easy the passage of Radical measures, but I should like to ask what kind of measures, because it seems to me there are two kinds. In addition to those which are supposed to be desired by the majority of the people, the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack told us the other day that there were certain Bills which should be passed which were
<col>920</col>
needed for the health of the people. It is a very curious thing that the Bills which the Radicals think are necessary for the health of the people nearly always inflict serious damage on sections of the population who are supposed to be antagonistic to the Radical Party. For instance, we had the Education Bill, which was brought forward with the intention of educating all the children of this country in the doctrines I will not say of Nonconformity, but of Undenominationalism. I have no doubt the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack looks after the spiritual health as well as the bodily health of the people, and he may have thought that that Bill was an extremely good thing for their spiritual health, but many Radicals thought it an extremely good thing to inflict a blow at the Church of England. Then when the Licensing Bill was brought forward the noble and learned Lord told us that it was for the health of the people, but many Radicals, again, enjoyed the prospect that it would have the effect of inflicting a crushing blow on the "trade." I could multiply examples, but I do not think it necessary. When we are talking of health, I would like to remind the noble and learned Lord that doctors sometimes disagree, and for my part I would prefer my prescriptions to be compounded by the people of this country rather than by the faddists, idealists, and wirepullers of the Radical Party.<lb/>
The noble Marquess has advised us to agree to the Second Reading of this Bill, and though that advice is unpalatable I have no doubt it is very sound. Amendments will be moved in Committee, and how far we shall be able to insist on those Amendments lies at present on the knees of the gods. But there is one point on which the Unionist Party want to be reassured, and I hope when the noble Marquess speaks this evening he will be able to give us some assurance on this point. Whatever powers your Lordships may be willing to surrender at the present time under this temporary Bill, we want to be assured that the Unionist Party are determined that a reconstituted House of Lords shall enjoy at least the same powers over finance as have up to the present been enjoyed by your Lordships. If we are reassured on this point, we shall fight this Bill with the knowledge that we have nearly half the electorate of this country at our back, and if we are beaten by the Coalition
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0465"/>
<col>921</col>
we shall look forward to the day, perhaps not very far distant, when the Unionist Party will be once more in power and able to remove from the Statute Book this measure which degrades our glorious Constitution to the level of those of Greece and Costa Rica.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01487"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think your Lordships will all feel that after the prolonged debate that has ranged on two questions which are substantially the same throughout the last fortnight there are no new arguments to be adduced, and even if there were it would be useless to employ them, because it is quite certain that no force of logic and no power of argument will have the slightest influence over the steel-clad nature of His Majesty's Government. Therefore I regard it as a piece of presumption to address you for a second time. But, my Lords, this is a solemn moment in the lives of many of us. If the Parliament Bill passes, it puts an end, a definite end, to the Chamber in which we have sat, some of us all our lives, and which, when it is once put au end to, all the King's horses and all the King's men can never set on its legs again. Therefore, we who are speaking here to-night feel that we are speaking for the last time in this House as we have known it, and perhaps for the last time in these walls at all.<lb/>
I wish, therefore, in the final farewell that my voice, at least, shall be raised for the last time in a definite protest, unavailing though it certainly will be, against this most ill-judged, revolutionary, and partisan measure. The debate has ranged over a very wide circle, if I may borrow an expression from Lord Save and Sele. By the way, allow me to congratulate the Minister for Agriculture upon having found such an apt pupil in his peculiar style of agricultural rhetoric, and I think if the noble Lord will cultivate the same emphatic delivery of elocution as my noble friend who rules over the Department of Agriculture he may prove a formidable rival to the noble Earl. There has certainly been a strange kaleidoscope not only on this side of the House, to which the expression was applied, but also, I venture to say, on the other side. You can draw a distinct line, as distinct as the Equator, between the speeches of the noble Lords Opposite last week and the week before. The week before last all was milk and
<col>922</col>
honey. My face was one long blush when I listened to their speeches and heard the constant commendations of the membership of this House. Nothing was ever known that was so admirable and delightful as individuals as the members of this House. It seems to me hardly worth while to disturb a choir of archangels such as this for such small reasoning as was displayed by noble Lords opposite. Even in the moment of dissolution it is pleasant to listen to your praises sounded by anxious and inexorable opponents. I will ask noble Lords behind me whether they did not feel better and nobler men as they left the House on Monday night than they ever did before. But on Tuesday there came a change. Noble Lords opposite were all Jacobins. It was then nothing but a long list of misdeeds, crimes, errors, and want of judgment. Last week it was blessings; this week it was stripes; and considering the quarter from which both the blessings and the stripes came I do not discriminate greatly between them.<lb/>
With regard to the subject-matter of the debate I am disposed to make great concessions in argument to noble Lords opposite. I quite agree that it is not possible for them, in view of their Party situation, either to withdraw this Bill or to suffer any material amendment in it. They would not be sustained by their Party. I think they would suffer that violent death which used to attend Eastern monarchs who did not act according to the wishes of their subjects. I also concede this, that the reform and regulation of this House is a measure that has long been overdue. I also concede this, that the two elections to which they have referred so constantly are&#x2014;though I think it is easy to over-estimate their force and weight&#x2014;a great fact which it is impossible to disregard. But, my Lords, when I have said this I confess that I have gone as far as I can.<lb/>
Putting aside the Bill, the considerations to which I have alluded do lead up to a great Constitutional crisis. They lead up to Constitutional revision, calling for the most solemn deliberation and possibly the co-operation which my noble friend the Lord President of the Council said would be essential at some later period of the measure, and which I think would be even more important at an earlier stage. These
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0466"/>
<col>923</col>
premises lead up to a Constitutional revision such as I think no other country, certainly not one other country across the Atlantic nearly related to our own, would be guilty of proceeding with in this way. I am sorry to say that the Government have chosen a path not better, but worse. They have shown no trace in the debates in this House, nor do I think in the other, that they recognise this as one of the most gigantic questions that can occur in the lifetime of any generation&#x2014;the readjustment of the balance of the Constitution to meet the necessities of the growing intelligence of the country and the necessity for a great revision based on the Constitution of the day. No; they have preferred to proceed on the lines of Party rancour and Party revenge. I do not use these expressions from my own inner consciousness, but I appeal to your Lordships if any speech has been delivered from that side during the second week that has not set out in lurid terms a long list of Liberal measures which have been mutilated or rejected or disregarded by this House without any reference whatever to that much longer list of measures which is always kept for the platform, which represents the abundant harvest the Government have reaped in spite of the House of Lords. If the Government triumph they will have preferred to reap a Party triumph to the more permanent glories they might have received. Instead of attempting to bring back the Constitution to its original conception of double-Chamber government, equally, or as equally as possible, balanced between popular aspirations and judicial control, they prefer to gather the scalps of their enemies; treading down the vanquished according, I suppose, to the recognised canons of Party warfare, and returning to their wigwams with scalps when they might have brought back a measure which might have been the glory of their Government and their time.<lb/>
The great charge I have to make, and the only charge to-night, against the Government, is that they have deliberately effaced two estates of the Realm and one branch of the Legisature without attempting in any way whatever to replace them by anything. When we bring that charge forward we are told to console ourselves with the Preamble. I never found my stomach much filled by the Preamble. I do not know that the Preamble alludes to anything of substance at all. I think it is
<col>924</col>
simply a vague and pious aspiration which the Party of my noble friends will never allow them to carry out. It is a skeleton in their cupboard which they keep carefully locked up. All through the debate, although we have heard all the best speakers on the Government side and all the ablest Ministers, we have never had the remotest or vaguest allusion to the Preamble. That is a matter for domestic consumption in Downing Street. After all, when you are attempting a grave Constitutional revision the Preamble and all that it portends is the very essence of the matter. I do not think that anybody here who knows what the Parliament Bill is cares very much to know what the scheme of the Government is for a new Second Chamber on an elective basis, because I repeat most emphatically the words quoted by Lord Hardinge just now that if this Bill passes in its present form and becomes part of the fundamental law of the Realm it does not matter one farthing or one straw what the Second Chamber is going to be.<lb/>
The Lord President of the Council the other day very good-naturedly rallied me for what he considered a slight change of attitude on my part to this House. I think I might make the retort courteous. He is the inventor of the famous phrase "mending or ending" the House of Lords. Will he tell me what he is doing now, mending or ending? My noble friend will have an opportunity of answering later in the debate and I will not press it now. But I will, at any rate, admit this inconsistency, if it be an inconsistency, in view of the change of circumstances. I was a "mender" in the days when those words were uttered. Now that I am face to face with the Parliament Bill, and with the knowledge that it is destined to become law I have frankly come over to my noble friend's former position and have become an "ender." I can see no use in prolonging the existence of this House as a useless sham to delude the people of this country into the belief that they still have a Second Chamber with control over the First. Far better let the naked truth appear. Far better let it be seen by this country that this House is a mere phantasy from which all substance has been stripped than allow it to remain in the paralysed condition in which noble Lords opposite, and noble Lords opposite alone, wish to preserve it for their own purposes. And in this opinion I am
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0467"/>
<col>925</col>
fortified by a person much more important than myself&#x2014;
<quote>"I say, speaking for myself, and I believe for a great many other people also, I would far rather live under the absolute and untempered autocracy of a Single Chamber, which, after all, is elected by and responsible to the people of this country, than have super-added to it a kind of constitutional appendage which is a <i>simulacrum</i> of a Second Chamber."</quote>
I adopt every one of those words. They were applied, I say it in candour, not to the House of Lords as it is to be, but to the House of Lords as it was last year. But true as they may have been of the House of Lords last year, they are a thousand times more true of the House of Lords as it is going to be under the operation of this Bill. The prophet, the seer, who used the expressions under which I have sheltered myself was no less a person than the Prime Minister, Mr. Asquith himself.<lb/>
Let me go a step further. I think in your course, though you may be justified by Party feeling, you have no other justification. Your course was clear and easy before you. No Ministers, no Liberal Ministers, have ever had such a chance before. You had no opposition to deal with except among your own followers, and I gather from expressions used by Lord Marchamley the other night, and he ought to know, there are means for dealing with recalcitrant followers that are not wholly inoperative. You had only to deal with your own followers&#x2014;I think they could have been managed&#x2014;and on the other side you had a most unexampled agreement. The House of Lords had come forward with offers of the largest and the most liberal kind, offers which no Government in my time ever had the opportunity of accepting. There never was such a chance of effecting a settlement by consent. The House of Lords had abdicated. The hereditary House of Lords was dead, and yet you preferred to pursue this Party line of activity instead of reaping greater glory.<lb/>
In all this melancholy there is a slight consolation which affords some balm to my mind. It may seem rather alien to the subject, but I will mention it for what it is worth. I see in the papers that Americans are not coming over to this country in any great number this year because they have been alarmed by the charges which it is said are being made by the hotels or by other considerations. Personally, I am always glad to see our Trans-Atlantic friends, but
<col>926</col>
this year I rejoice they are not coming, because they would this year see the Mother of their Parliament, the source of all Parliaments, being treated, after an existence of centuries, in a way in which dishonest servants are hardly treated. They would remember the anxious preparations that the great fathers of the Constitution in America gave to the framing of their Constitution, which remains, after a century and a quarter, the pride of their country; the anxious forethought and care with which they built up, to counterbalance what was then a much smaller democracy than exists in the United States now, the strongest Second. Chamber the world has ever seen. And they would contrast all this with what they would see in this old country. They would remember their own Hamiltons and Madisons, and I venture to think they would go away with a contempt for those who are now dealing with the Constitution which it would be impossible to measure or, perhaps, to describe. That may seem to any one here but a very small consolation, but drowning men have to catch at straws, and I at any rate am not disposed to disregard any source of comfort in a moment of trial, and almost of agony, such as this.<lb/>
I suppose the justification of the Government would be that we are passing through something in the nature of a revolution. I myself think that that is their best justification. We who speak of revolution are always taunted with being croakers and crying "Wolf" on every occasion until the world has become sick of the word revolution. I cannot plead guilty to that taunt, if you mean by this that I consider that we are passing through a revolution such as has more than once occurred in a sister country. I do not. But revolutions are not necessarily associated with bloodshed or barricades or the guillotine. They are merely violent reversals of the political or social systems of the country in which they occur, and in this country since the execution of Charles I they have always occurred, I think, without bloodshed or without great violence. None the less true is it that we are on a wave of revolution which may, for all I know, be extending all over Europe, of which the Government I do not think are the promoters, but on the top of which they are riding and the end of which I do not think it is possible to foresee.<lb/>
The revolution is partly social and partly political. It was inaugurated by the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0468"/>
<col>927</col>
Budget. I think my noble friend the Lord President of the Council dates everything from the Budget, and regards it with much the same feeling as devout Mahomedans regard the Hegira, from which they date all their chronology. I think my noble friend will be interested to hear that I take that point of departure. It was a sudden change not merely from the orthodox finance of the country, but from the three Budgets which had been put forward by the Prime Minister. It made a huge demand on the resources of the country quite suddenly, and in the minds of many of us without much justification. They had, it is true, drawn a bill at six months for what they said would be &#x00A3;6,000,000. It turned out to be &#x00A3;13,000,000. But I do not think that justifies their finance, because what I remember about that Bill is this, that it was first introduced and passed in Parliament and that then its author, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, went on a holiday tour to Germany and came back announcing that the German scheme was infinitely superior, infinitely more practical, and much more economical than the one he had recently passed through Parliament at the instigation of His Majesty's Government. I think we may feel therefore that there was some want of justification for the great demand made on the country at that time. At any rate, I remember some of us wished that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had taken his holiday in Germany before he introduced his measure and not afterwards.<lb/>
We had the Budget. We had an Income Tax of 1<i>s.</i>&#x2014;a war rate, double the ordinary rate that used to be. It was raised in a moment to 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for a great mass of proprietors, and to 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for another great mass of proprietors. The Death Duties at the same time were raised in some cases to a maximum of 25 per cent., a quarter of the whole fortune bequeathed, and this in a time of profound peace&#x0021; Can it be denied by anybody who knows the state of the fortunes of the landed gentry of this country, for example, that that is a social revolution of the first magnitude, and that inevitably it must put an end to that class of landed gentry which has been one of the backbones of the State&#x2014;the State has more than one backbone&#x2014;in the past and which has supplied our Ministers, our generals, our officers all through the history of England? We must say it has made a great social revolution in this country&#x2014;it may be for the benefit of all. I am not prejudging the
<col>928</col>
character of the revolution; I am only asserting that it has taken place at the instigation of His Majesty's Government. There cannot but be further burdens than the &#x00A3;6,000,000 spoken of in 1909 and swelled up to &#x00A3;13,000,000 in 1911. The cost of the present scheme before the House of Commons, which I think the Minister for Scotland had forgotten when he spoke, is said to be &#x00A3;6,000,000, but it was predicted by Lord St. Davids, an ardent follower of His Majesty's Government and a high financial authority, to be likely to extend to &#x00A3;17,000,000. Therefore in two articles of expenditure, which may be beneficial, but hitherto unknown, the Government have spent, or are spending, something like &#x00A3;33,000,000 without asking where our resources are to come from in time of war. We are justified in calling attention to that expenditure as constituting a social revolution of the first magnitude.<lb/>
And what is your political revolution? You are, as I say, effacing one House of Parliament without attempting to replace it by anything else. You are, indeed, constituting by the Parliament Bill a single supreme Chamber in the State with all the characteristics and all the temptations of the Long Parliament under which we suffered so much. I venture to say there is no instance in the civilised world of any country of the first magnitude&#x2014;I believe there are some smaller States which are venturing upon the same thing&#x2014;deliberately turning its back on the experience of all countries, on the wisdom of all ages, on the testimony of all statesmen, and establishing in this era of its history a single supreme Chamber, effacing the other, the only check that exists. This is not a single revolution. While you are degrading and defacing the House of Lords you certainly are not elevating the House of Commons. That proud and independent body which has existed for so many centuries, proud of its independence, its <i>status,</i> and its unlikeness in this respect to all other Parliaments in the world, you have now placed on the footing of a paid and salaried board. So that while on the one hand you have reduced to impotence a body which, whatever its faults, had the merit of independence, you are at the same time taking away a very large amount&#x2014;I will not say of the independence but of the repute for independence which the House of Commons possesses.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0469"/>
<col>929</col>
I know you base all this policy on a very simple argument. You have had two elections in the space of eleven months. By the unexampled and unprecedented favour of the Crown&#x2014;so far as I know&#x2014;the same Government, having at the time a Parliament elected under its own auspices, has had a second and a third election in the space of eleven months, and on this basis you declare you have a mandate to do this one thing. You always insist on that. The elections were for this one issue. Everybody on the Government side of the House declares that every elector at the last election had the opportunity of reading the Parliament Bill, and it is therefore taken for granted that they did. Lord Marchamley said that on local platforms nothing was spoken of but the Parliament Bill. I envy the noble Lord the opportunity he must have enjoyed of keeping his finger on the pulse of the country. I had not that advantage, but I have the strongest suspicion that there were a good many other subjects talked about on the platforms of the election; and even when this subject was talked about it was not always discussed with that unvarying regard for accuracy which should characterise the speeches of Ministers when discussing an important Constitutional question.<lb/>
But I think there were other subjects much in the minds of the electors. The electors were terrified by being told that Old-Age Pensions were likely to be withdrawn from them when the Unionist Party came into power. They do not seem to have been frightened by the pious opinion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the German plan was better than ours. I also think a great many elections turned one way or the other on Tariff Reform. I do not like to say anything personally offensive to my noble friends on the Front Opposition Bench, but I do not feel quite sure that they have recovered their personal popularity in the country. But I am quite certain there was one question in the minds of the electors more than the Parliament Bill, and that was the question of food. I do not in the least pretend to prejudge the policy which is called Imperial Preference. I have no opinion on that subject, it is outside my range. But at any rate I am sure of this, that it is capable of being represented to the people of this country as likely to raise the price of the loaf. When you threaten the price of the loaf&#x2014;
<col>930</col>
I do not care what your other argument may be about integrity of Empire, or drawing us closer together, or the counterbalancing freedom of tea&#x2014;I do not care what your argument may be, but the moment you touch the loaf you touch every home from the highest to the lowest; and it is one of the curses of the present situation that the future of our ancient Constitution by the force and irony of circumstances is inseparably bound up with what appears to the electors to be a tax on food.<lb/>
Then I am forced to allude to the somewhat inaccurate way in which the issue of the House of Lords was presented to the country. I will not refer to the attempts to stir up war between class and class in a way never attempted before by any responsible person, much less by a highly placed Minister. That is familiar to you all. But there was no man, highly placed or lowly placed, who did not go about the country saying that the true issue was one between the elected representatives of the people and 600 hereditary despots wielding an irresponsible Veto. I am not aware of any Minister who took the trouble to announce to the country that as regards the hereditary principle the House of Lords had abdicated its position, and that as regards its irresponsible Veto it had made the largest and most liberal offer ever spontaneously made by any Second Chamber in the world. But if it were your single issue, two questions arise. One is this&#x2014;Why, if you desire to refer to the nation on this single issue, you so emphatically refuse and shrink from that direct reference to the people, the Referendum? In that case there could be no counterbalancing issue or confusing argument. It would be the clear and definite line&#x2014;"Do you wish for a Single Chamber as established under the Parliament Bill or do you wish for the two-Chamber Constitution to be continued as at present? "I am under the impression that the answer in that case would greatly surprise His Majesty's Government. There is another question. If the House of Lords be the single issue, is it not clear that the Government have no mandate for Home Rule? as they certainly have no mandate for the payment of Members, which was always felt by Mr. Gladstone to be one of the greatest Constitutional changes that could ever be made in this country. It is quite easy, on the principle adopted by my noble
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0470"/>
<col>931</col>
friend the Lord President of the Council, to say that that does not in the least matter, because as I understand his theory of the Constitution it is that the constituencies have only got to elect a Member and when that Member is elected they have no more to do with him or with his behaviour until he returns to them for re-election. But if that be an exaggerated hypothesis of my noble friend's view, I am quite willing to withdraw it.<lb/>
But what are the arguments in support of this very strange measure now before the House? I think, when we listened to the able, ingenious, and conciliatory speech of Lord Haldane the other night, we must all have felt that we could understand why he has been a great Chancery barrister. I do not think the case for the Government could be put forward with more conciliation and with more skill. My noble friend wandered over so vast a variety of topics, some scientific and some theological, that it almost seemed as difficult to follow him as if he were a political chamois. But what was the measure of comfort administered by the noble Viscount? What my noble friend said was this&#x2014;"After all, the Bill is not so bad. Why make such a fuss about it? For three years it is quite true this House will not be able to do anything, but during the last two years the House of Commons will be able to do nothing." And so he drew a sort of balance of consolation. For three-fifths of a Parliament one House would be impotent, but that House might console itself by thinking that for the other two-fifths the other House would be impotent. I am not at all sure that that is exactly the explanation of the measure which would commend itself to the constituencies which support my noble friend or the Party in the House of Commons which also give him their support.<lb/>
But my noble friend omitted one important consideration&#x2014;that of finance. In the last two years of the Parliament, however much the House of Commons may be hampered by the House of Lords, which he held out to us was a pleasing prospect, the House of Commons would always have the power of finance; and in my judgment, and I think in the judgment of every one who has considered the matter, it comes to this, that if the House of Lords is extremely recalcitrant during those three years they may be made to
<col>932</col>
smart financially by the House of Commons without any possibility of interference. So that the picture of Parliament which my noble friend presents as the result of this Bill is that of subjection and degradation for three years and of squabble and retaliation for the last two years.<lb/>
Now let me take the speech of Lord Marchamley, whom I am sure we all welcome to this House. Lord Marchamley said he found this House dull. I do not know what he expected to find here. I rather imagined that he had retired to this House, as great men have retired&#x2014;Diocletian and others&#x2014;precisely because it was dull and that he might have a little repose from the tumult of the House of Commons. I quote the noble Lord because he has occupied a position which, under the evolution of our Constitution, is one of the most important in the country. He has been Chief Whip. The Chief Whip is infinitely more important at this moment than any Minister except the Prime Minister, and sometimes more important than even the Prime Minister himself. The Chief Whip is the secret confessor of the Prime Minister, the slave-driver of the Cabinet, and the Grand Inquisitor of the Party. He exercises a wider authority than any other functionary under the Government. That is one reason why I value the opinion of the noble Lord. What does he say? He avows single-Chamber government. He says he supports this Bill because it will prevent any further meddling or trimming of Liberal measures, and if that be not single-Chamber government I do not know what is. But he proceeded to give us a still stranger consolation. He said that after all the power of delay was much greater than people generally imagine; that a Bill when it has once been through the House of Commons becomes so stale that it is not likely to be renewed with advantage. If I understand his argument, therefore, while the noble Viscount says that two of the five years of Parliament will be unfruitful, Lord Marchamley holds out a still more glowing prospect of a five years Parliament in which there is to be no legislation at all.<lb/>
My noble friend the Lord President of the Council cheered us by saying that there will be a good deal of give and take under this Bill. So I think there will. There will be a good deal of give on one side and a
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0471"/>
<col>933</col>
good deal of take on the other, and I think there will be a perfectly even division of functions in that respect. But towards the end of his speech he used some expressions which pointed in the direction of conciliation and co-operation. If I did not misunderstand him, he said that co-operation at a later stage would be essential. How is that co-operation to come about? What are you going to co-operate about? A man may be executed, but I never heard it suggested that after decapitation the executed man should co-operate in the subsequent process of drawing, quartering, and disembowelling. Honestly, if this Bill passes I do not see what else there is to co-operate about. Co-operation implies condonation of the past. If noble Lords on the Opposition benches co-operate with noble Lords opposite after this Bill is passed, they give a tacit approval of its provisions. They regard it as a sealed document. I do not think so ill of my noble friends behind me as to suppose that they will do anything of the kind.<lb/>
More than that, co-operation implies equality between the co-operators. What equality will there be between the two Front Benches after this Bill is passed? Noble Lords opposite may admit my noble friends on the Opposition side as the burghers of Paris were admitted on one famous occasion with halters round their necks to discuss what further terms of capitulation may be necessary; but how in any event you can expect any cordial co-operation, or any co-operation at all, after this Bill has passed, is more, I confess, than my intellect can compass. Conciliation&#x0021; I do not think anybody is likely to do much in the way of conciliation after what occurred the other night, when the most rev. Primate in one of the ablest, most sagacious, and most conciliatory speeches ever made in this House, deriving weight from the high and unique position he occupies in this Realm, brought forward proposals of conciliation. It was impossible, I think, to go further in that direction than the most rev. Primate went. What was his reward? A mailed fist shot out straight from the Woolsack and levelled the most rev. Primate and all his aspirations to the ground. And as if this was not enough to demolish him, my noble friend Lord Beauchamp, to add insult to injury, at a later period of the evening, announced his opinion that he was the sole author and cause of Chinese slavery in South Africa.
<col>934</col>
If that is really the sort of reception given to the dove and the olive branch&#x2014;to wring the dove's neck and serve him up cooked with the olive branch&#x2014;I do not think you are likely to have many attempts in that direction.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Morley referred with great gentleness and courtesy to some speeches I made in 1895 on this question. Perhaps your Lordships will allow me for a moment to diverge to those speeches, as I may not have another opportunity of explaining them. Indeed, there is no explanation needed. My noble friend thinks there is some inconsistency between my opinions then and my opinions now. I can assure him there is not the least. I held strong opinions then and I hold exactly the same opinions now, except that I am afraid they go more in the direction of ending than mending. I expressed then in strong language then because I was a Party leader, and if I were a Party leader now I dare say I should express them as strongly again. But if my noble friend thinks there has been any change or vacillation in my views about this House from the time I first took my seat in it he is in error. I have always thought that the hereditary principle in this House was wholly indefensible in argument and that it constituted a grave practical weakness, and I have always regretted and deplored the partisan character of this House, which I again thought a great misfortune, not so much for what it did when Liberal Governments were in power as for what it left undone when Conservative Governments were in power. Those have always been my views. They are mine now more strongly, perhaps, than ever.<lb/>
But there is this great difference between myself and my noble friend. I was always a House of Lords reformer. I knew when I made those speeches that it was impossible to expect any reform of the House of Lords by the Liberal Party, because the Liberal Party knew that reform would strengthen the House of Lords which they did not wish, and I equally knew it was hopeless to expect it from noble Lords on this side of the House, because they were in the position of <i>beati possidentes</i> and not wishful to disturb a position so favourable to themselves. Knowing that it was hopeless to expect from either Party any reform, except by pressure from outside, I did by my speeches endeavour to impress the public
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0472"/>
<col>935</col>
feeling in such a way as to produce the pressure that would compel the House of Lords to reform itself. I never had the sympathy of noble Lords opposite. I was a pelican in the wilderness, making an appeal without support of any kind from any quarter. I never had what you have&#x2014;a scheme offered spontaneously by the House of Lords for its own reform and for its own adjustment of relations with the other House, a scheme which I can honestly say, I would gladly have embraced even as Leader of the Liberal Party, and if I had had to forfeit that leadership in consequence; and I appeal to my noble friends opposite in their honour, <i>in foro conscienti&#x0153;</i> can they deny that the Bill of the noble Marquess, which passed its Second Reading last week, offers a fair compromise of this Constitutional question? And if sound Constitutional revision was all that they wanted it should be gladly accepted.<lb/>
Let me pass from the personal topic, which is usually so absorbing, to a much more general one. The noble Lord's excursion into the history of 1894 and 1895 makes me wish for one moment to give my conspectus of the history of this question. In 1832&#x2014;which shall be my Hegira&#x2014;the position of this House was at its very lowest. I do not think that any far-seeing observer at that time would have given the House of Lords five years' purchase. It had just undergone a tremendous humiliation. But the circumstances of 1832 were very different from those of 1911. There was almost an outbreak of violent revolution in this country. Bristol and Nottingham were burning. Derby was running with blood, 200,000 men were marching from Birmingham on London to compel this House to yield to the views of the people. The state of Scotland was hardly less alarming. At this time, in 1831, the great Sir Robert Peel, whose son we are fortunate enough to preserve in this dishonoured and discredited Assembly, predicted all that has come to pass in regard to this question. In 1836 Mr. O'Connell proposed that an elected Chamber should be substituted for the House of Lords; the House of Lords seemed to be past praying for.<lb/>
In 1839, however, there was one of those strange changes which come over the spirit of this country at odd times. A Motion was brought forward in the House of Lords by Lord Roden for a Committee to inquire into Irish administration, which was carried
<col>936</col>
in a very thin House by a majority of five&#x2014;63 to 58. What was the result? The next day there was a Cabinet, and Lord Melbourne and Lord John Russell, the Liberal Prime Minister and the Liberal Leader in the House of Commons, came down to announce that it was necessary in consequence of this vote that the Cabinet should resign. Think what a change, my Lords, from the time when the House of Lords was at zero seven years before to the time when it was to decide the fate of the Government. That stage passed&#x2014;they found other means of getting out of the scrape&#x2014;but I think it was a notable mark in the history of the House of Lords. Coming to the Bill for the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, the House of Lords, though supposed to be secretly opposed to that measure, patriotically passed it at the instance of the great Duke of Wellington. Then we come to the Reform Bill of 1867, which was passed by the Party on this [the Opposition] side of the House, and which largely enfranchised great masses of the people and increased the weight of the balance against this House. That was followed by the Reform Bill of 1884, when I remember the great processions and demonstrations organised against this House because it suspended the Bill, but which ended once more in a huge addition to the constituencies of the country and therefore to the strength of the House of Commons as against the House of Lords.<lb/>
Then I think we have nothing to detain us until we come to the crisis of 1894&#x2013;5, when Mr. Gladstone made his last speech in the House of Commons on this very question of the House of Lords. I heard that speech, and I well remember the circumstances of that speech. It was a unique speech in Mr. Gladstone's whole career in regard to one particular point. At that time he sounded the trumpet note for a campaign in which he had no intention of taking part and for which he bequeathed no plan. In his recently published letters there is this curious sentence; as if foreseeing this very contingency. In a letter dated October 31, 1885, he wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"I have never been in the habit of blowing the trumpet for a battle in which I could take no part."</quote>
On this occasion Mr. Gladstone did blow a trumpet for a battle in which he was to take no part, and left it to a very inadequate successor. He blew it as well as he could, but feebly, I think, in the opinion of my
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0473"/>
<col>937</col>
noble friends opposite. Whether he blew it strongly or not, the result was overwhelming defeat at the hands of the constituencies. The victory was against the Government, not merely against the Liberal Government, but much more emphatically in favour of the House of Lords. The election of 1895 strengthened the House of Lords immeasurably. Why? Because it rejected Irish Horne Rule. It gave fifteen years more of life, at any rate, to the House of Lords as it then existed; and it will be always a lifelong regret to me that that interval was not employed by my friends behind me to reform and readjust this House.<lb/>
What conclusions do I draw from this tedious but necessary retrospect? The first is that the situation has no analogy to that of 1832. There are distinctly differing conditions, much more pacific conditions; a condition apparently on the part of a great mass of the population of total indifference to the Parliament. Bill and all that it implies. Why the other night, after the debate, driving down to my humble suburban retreat, I passed two or three placards printed in flaming letters, and I thought to myself, "At last the country is aroused. At last the people begin to perceive the revolution through which they are passing and the iniquities of His Majesty's Government." The words in enormous letters were to the effect that Surrey was doing something with Middlesex, or Middlesex something with Surrey. A second placard appealed to an even wider range of the population, for it announced that "Fish is cheaper to-day." However carefully I might examine from the humble vehicle in which I was ensconced, I could see no allusion, direct or indirect, to the modification of the Constitution and the summary ending of your Lordships' House. The second conclusion draw is that there are periods of strong reaction in favour of a Second Chamber, and even in favour sometimes of the House of Lords with its weak hereditary Constitution. I derive some hope from that that there will be a similar reaction in the future, and that once more we may have the Constitution restored. The third conclusion I draw is this. I am extremely doubtful, to say the least, that a clear reference to the country on the question of a Double Chamber in the Constitution or a Single Chamber would not meet with a very different result from that of the appeal just made by the Government.<lb/>
<col>938</col>
I come at last to the practical question, What is to be done? That has already been settled in effect by the Leaders of the Opposition, and I think on the whole wisely settled. I confess that the "old Adam" in me pointed to a different conclusion not long ago, and even now if I were in the House this evening when the question is put I should be disposed to join the Duke of Northumberland in the cry, the melancholy cry of "Not content" to the Second Reading of this Bill. I confess there was some attraction to me in the idea of driving the Government to their last resources and compelling them by the action of this House to do that which would make them supremely absurd. I confess there was some attraction in&#x2014;and my sense of humour played over&#x2014;that list, which we have been assured is in existence, of those hundreds of gentlemen who are willing to undergo the humiliation of entering an hereditary Chamber at the summons of the Prime Minister. I like to picture to myself the triumvirate&#x2014;one of whom, of course, would be the Prime Minister, another the Master of Elibank, and the third of whom I would rather leave to conjecture&#x2014;sitting in an apartment in Downing-street, pricking their lists, not of those to be proscribed, but of the Conscript Fathers that are to be. I could not help allowing my fancy to dwell on the procession entering from Westminster Hall, inspected by the Master of Elibank and led, I think, by the Secretary of State for War as a Territorial battalion to take their position. The last charge of the Old Guard at Waterloo would be little compared to that serried column entering that door, and the labours of the Lord Chancellor, sitting day and night to admit these new acolytes&#x2014;I trust the expression is not offensive&#x2014;to this Chamber, would be a spectacle which would inspire one with profound sympathy with his position. I think that all that would cover the Government and their policy with ridicule, from which I do not think they would ever recover.<lb/>
Yes. But there is also this to be considered. These are questions of practical politics, not of humour. We have to consider what would be the effect. It might make the Government ridiculous, and we might make their supporters ridiculous. We should certainly make this House ridiculous and we might compromise what remains of the Constitution. I do not think it is worth running the risk. There
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0474"/>
<col>939</col>
is this practical consideration to be remembered. It is this. After these Conscript Fathers had been admitted, the Barebones Parliament which would result could carry any measure they choose, good, bad, or indifferent, without any resistance or delay in the remaining years of this Parliament. That is too grave a danger to run. I am therefore disposed to entirely acquiesce in the resolution come to by the Leader of the Opposition to allow this Bill to pass its Second Reading. In so grave a matter as this one cannot afford to palter with phrases. We must consider exactly what would ensue if the House of Lords took the responsibility of rejecting this Bill. Suppose the Crown had desired to evade the necessity of creating 400 or 500 Peers, the Ministry would resign. Would it be possible for my noble friends on this side of the House to form a Government? Would they be enabled to appeal to the electors successfully after the last two elections? To speak quite plainly, I do not think they would, and I am not prepared to do anything which would encourage a repetition of the experiment of the great Duke of Wellington. If that hazardous experiment failed, the last condition of the Constitution would be worse than the first, and we should be prostrate at the feet of the Government and their supporters.<lb/>
My Lords, my confidence, such as it is, rests wholly on the common sense and the political instincts of the nation. They have had centuries of political education, and though I think they have not in the slightest degree appreciated the importance of this question or have been instructed on it by those who ought to have been their guides, though I do not think they in the least appreciated the importance to them of this question, yet I feel confident that they will comprehend it, that they will become seized of it, and that in civil as in military operations their sagacity and their courage will at length enable them to muddle through. We have muddled through worse situations than this. I think we shall muddle through this, even though we shall be compelled to bow the neck to the yoke and be prepared to see for a second time the Second Chamber depart out of our Constitutional arrangements. I am sure that the nation will not be prepared to ride at single anchor. I am sure that it will not be deluded by the "painted ship upon a painted ocean," the hollow fancy which this House will be after the Parliament Bill is passed, and
<col>940</col>
that it will not be deceived and believe that it is living under its ancient Constitution. When the people realise that I do feel confident that they will demand once more the ancient guarantees for their liberties which this House represented, and whether it be in the form of the present House of Lords or of a Chamber elected on a wider basis&#x2014;I do not say which I think most probable&#x2014;I believe they will insist on the restoration to the Constitution of the part which has been eradicated by His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01488"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, not even the spell of the oratory of my noble friend can prevent me from missing something in his speech. Between the exordium and the arguments on the one hand, and the conclusion and peroration on the other, there was a considerable hiatus. There was nothing so great as the indictment which the noble Earl drew of the proceedings of the Government; there was nothing so serious as the appeal which he made to your Lordships and to the nation. But the conclusion&#x0021; What is to be done? Nothing. He would trust to the good sense and wisdom of the people. That is a very wise conclusion, but one asks oneself why it required so long an oration to arrive at so simple a result. My noble friend spoke at one stage of his speech of the indifference of the people. He seemed to think that they were engaged in considering football matches much more than this great question, but in an earlier part of his speech the noble Earl spoke of the two elections as a great fact. How are these things to be reconciled? I think in a very simple way.<lb/>
The noble Earl knows well that the people of this country when they have thrashed a thing out in their own minds are not in the habit of troubling themselves with regrets and uncertainties over the conclusions to which they have come; and if instead of looking at hoardings and posters along the road the noble Earl would ask himself what is the state of opinion on this subject in parts of the country he knows well, I do not think he would be in much doubt. There is Scotland, there is the North of England, there are the Eastern Counties, there are the Welsh Counties, there are large parts of the Midlands, and there are large parts of London, in which the verdict has been given in a distinct form. We had a speech earlier in this debate from
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0475"/>
<col>941</col>
Lord Ancaster, in which he warned your Lordships that he had no reason to think that the verdict, if challenged once more, would be very different. I think that may be a very good reason for the conclusion to which my noble friend has come, but I do not think it required so great or so eloquent an effort on his part if that was all he had to demonstrate to this House. He spoke of himself as having been consistent throughout in this matter. I think he has been consistent. He has pursued one policy. Lord Camperdown rather cruelly the other day referred to the premature dissolution of the Liberal League. My noble friend Lord Rosebery was President of that League, and I had the honour to be one of the Vice-Presidents. The dissolution was brought about largely through the instrumentality of ray noble friend, otherwise I should have remained a Vice-President not only because of the usefulness of the League but because of the traditions of its founder. But, although the Liberalism of my noble friend lies mouldering in the grave, it is only the body of that Liberalism that lies mouldering there; the spirit goes marching on.<lb/>
There is a history attaching to Lord Rosebery's attitude on this very question which, I think, will never be forgotten. He it was who had the courage in 1894 when he was much in the same position as His Majesty's Government are in to-day, to take up the question and begin a vigorous campaign on the subject. He was responsible for carrying through Parliament a Death Duties Act which imposed very considerable burdens upon property. For that he was denounced as a revolutionary and by many of the hard names to which we have listened to-day, and perhaps by more, because people had not yet quite realised that these things were more the order of the day than they were prone to suspect. But he took to the platform, and he was spoken of as an "ender," and he was an "ender" then. He pronounced himself as for the only practical policy&#x2014;the abolition of the Veto of this House. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"You cannot carry reform. You of the Liberal Party are not in a position to argue the question of reform with the House of Lords on anything like fair terms. They have a crushing majority."</quote>
We say so now. We desire what Lord Rosebery desired in 1894, to be free from the crushing power of the Veto of this House before we enter upon the discussion of any
<col>942</col>
such topics as reform. As in 1894, so now, the restriction of your Lordships' Veto is the only condition under which it is possible for a Liberal Prime Minister to carry on the conduct of affairs.<lb/>
The noble Earl made a memorable speech at Bradford in the autumn of 1894, a speech so memorable and so illustrative as to the consistency of the attitude of my noble friend to-day that it is worth quoting one or two sentences. He began by reminding his audience that this question had been raised by Mr. Pitt, who had declared that the House of Lords was the part of the Constitution which should first give way. Then be went on to quote Burke, and to warn them that the Liberal Party would be blamed if they did not deal with the House of Lords and ventured to go back to the constituencies with their pledge unfulfilled. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"The House of Lords is a Party body of one complexion, and it is a waste of time to introduce Bills while it continues to control the measures of the representatives of the people."</quote>
He further said that if he were asked to choose between no Second Chamber and a Second Chamber constituted as the House of Lords was then&#x2014;not as the House of Lords will be under the Parliament Bill, but as it actually is at this moment&#x2014;he would not hesitate as to the principle, for the House of Lords was not a Second Chamber at all but a permanent Party organisation controlled for Party purposes and by Party management. He went on to say that they could not wait for riots to make the House of Lords yield, because that meant that Liberal legislation was always to be carried by the menace of revolution; that the Lords would refuse to pass a Bill for the limitation of their Veto, and that therefore they must bring into operation the Constitutional forces of the House of Commons. First, he said, they must frame a Resolution to the effect that the House of Commons in partnership with the House of Lords must be unmistakably the predominant partner, and then the situation would assume a new phase; the Resolution would be submitted to the country and would become a new charter and the first act of a drama in which there would be several acts.<lb/>
I am not going to detain your Lordships by making many quotations, but this was not the only speech my noble friend made.
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0476"/>
<col>943</col>
He proceeded to Glasgow, where he sometimes gives counsel, and he there repeated very emphatically what he had said at Bradford. He then went to Devonport and again emphasised the doctrine of the Bradford speech. He pointed out, as my noble friend has pointed out to-night, that the object he had in view was so to readjust the relations of the House of Commons to the present House of Lords that the deliberate will of the House of Commons should not be overborne by the action of the House of Lords, and he said that the policy on which he was entering was a drama which might have several acts&#x2014;that this was the first act, and with the first act alone he was concerned in introducing to the country the Resolution which was to affirm the predominance of the House of Commons over the House of Lords. I have always been deeply attached to my noble friend, and I have learnt much from him. If he has left the Liberal Party now, I still remain an admirer of many things in his career and of much of what he has said; but I cannot but think that the real traditions of the Party are the traditions which we are carrying on.<lb/>
The first act in the drama was to be the Resolution. Well, the Campbell-Bannerman Resolutions were submitted to the House of Commons and they were before the country at the election of January, 1910. That was the second act in the drama. The third act was the further Resolutions and the Bill introduced in the House of Commons in 1910; the fourth act was the General Election in December, 1910; and the fifth act is this Bill. The sixth act remains to be seen. How do we stand at this moment? What reason is there for the accusation of my noble friend that Party rancour and Party revenge are the basis and foundation of this Bill? We are only carrying out the policy which he himself, more eloquently than any other man, declared to be necessary fifteen years ago. Is the situation different? Many fewer Bills were rejected in those days than have been rejected lately, and the gap between the two Houses was not so great as it has since become. Is it possible for any one at this moment to say that it would have been even within the field of what was practicable to take any other step? As I have already said, it was impossible for us to begin with the policy of reform because we were not on a footing of equality with your Lordships, and you could have forced upon us a Bill which you might have con-
<col>944</col>
sidered perfect but which we did not consider right judged by the standards to which alone we can appeal and by which alone we can be recognised.<lb/>
This Bill is the first step, the necessary and essential step, before we can consider anything else. We have said that our policy turns on it. It is a Bill which has one great drawback. I doubt whether there is any member of this House who dislikes more than I do introducing written amendments into an unwritten Constitution. They always work badly. Lord Salisbury, who never speaks without saying something interesting, made a very good point. He said you might under this Bill, if it becomes law, have a situation such as you had under a Unionist Government in 1902 when the Education Bill was passed two years after what was called the Khaki Election, though the country had not been consulted upon it. There was another case which the noble Marquess did not notice, and that was the Education Bill brought in by a Unionist Government shortly after the great Education Act, for the purpose of placing the educational system in London under the control of the boroughs instead of the London County Council. The feeling against it in Unionist circles was so strong that the Government very wisely withdrew that Bill. These are illustrations of what might happen. I admit that&#x2014;and they may happen more usually under a written than under an unwritten Constitution. Still, as a rule, they do not amount to anything very serious.<lb/>
Now look on the other side of the account. It is a common fallacy in political argument to state difficulties which are real but are small when put into the balance against the difficulties on the other side. It is only by weighing advantages and disadvantages that you can get at the truth about any political proposition. What is the other side? It is that, unless you have this Bill, it is impossible for the two Houses of Parliament to be in the position which the natural evolution of the Constitution requires that they should be. Lord Rosebery himself made something like an admission to that effect. No man has more explicitly affirmed the doctrine that the predominance of the House of Commons is necessary, and the situation has reached a stage in which there can no longer be any doubt about it. This Bill is the only tangible means of which I know of bringing that
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0477"/>
<col>945</col>
about. I admit that it is conceivable that it might happen that something might be done under it on which public opinion has not been very explicitly consulted. My answer is that, even granting that may happen, it is a slight disadvantage compared with the enormous and overwhelming disadvantage of leaving the present condition of affairs unredressed. I think the force of public opinion is so strong that it will be very difficult for any Government to carry through any measure against which public opinion is set, and certainly no measure is likely to be carried under this Bill on which the electors have not been very fully consulted.<lb/>
What is it that you propose? If your Reform Bill does not satisfy the majority of the people, and does not give the House of Commons the predominance to which that House is entitled and which the people are determined that the House of Commons shall have, how can you put it forward as an alternative to a plan the purpose of which is that, after consideration and deliberation, it is to be the function of the House of Commons to assert its will successfully? The proposal of the Government is, as my noble friend behind me showed, older than the time of Mr. Bright by whom it was so strongly advocated. It has been discussed in the columns of the old <i>Spectator</i> and other newspapers, and elsewhere, for many years, and it is the only practical plan arriving at the first act in the drama of which my noble friend spoke. Is it unreasonable to argue that the delaying power of this House should have a period put to it? Your Lordships can never be called to account before any electorate; for you there is no General Election; against your composition there is no appeal to the constituencies; yet, because you are permanently there, because your majority remains unchanged, and perhaps increasingly hostile to every Liberal Government, you have the power of wearing out and destroying even the strongest Liberal Government. It is not to the point to say, as Lord Avebury said, that, if you take account of the Bills which have reached this House, you have rejected only four out of 250. One knows what the relative importance of Bills may be and what were the Bills rejected.<lb/>
The proposal which is before the House is, first, to reduce&#x2014;as I think is right&#x2014;the effective life of the Commons Chamber of Parliament to a period of four years. In the first two years of that life, if it can carry
<col>946</col>
with it public opinion sufficiently to hold its majority together, it can send up Bills again and again, until at the end of two years, if your Lordships continue opposed to them, they will become law. After that time all that the House of Commons can do is to send up to this House Bills which will inevitably come before the tribunal of the electorate before they can become law. It is said that this system will set up single-Chamber government. It will not. It will give you a Second Chamber which will have the full power of expressing its opinion. You will not be able to reject or indefinitely delay Bills which have the sense of the nation and a great majority of its representatives behind them; but you will be able to do everything that is in your power now to bring before the country your views of those measures and to stir up public opinion concerning them. You will be brought nearer to what are your true functions of revising, delaying, and counselling, but not of exercising the supreme dominating will.<lb/>
It is said that under this Bill Parliament will be able to sweep away all Constitutional safeguards, and that the House of Commons could prolong its own life indefinitely. I agree. So could Parliament to day if it were so minded. It could provide &#x00A3;100,000 for each member of each House. But we do not do those things. We have not done them in the past and we shall not do them in the future. This Bill is an effort to put into printed language what has been hitherto the practice and usage of the Constitution, and not to make some great innovation. It merely records upon the Statute-book what is the spirit of the Constitution at present, notwithstanding its violation by your Lordships.<lb/>
This Bill is vitally necessary if we are to, get away from the reproaches and the bitter feeling caused by a House in which one Party is represented by a majority often to one over the other, and is in permanent power. That is a state of things that cannot continue. Nothing could have been done had your Lordships chosen to exercise your powers in a judicial spirit, in the way in which they have been exercised at various periods. Then we should have had the most perfect counselling and revising Second Chamber that could be conceived, by reason of its elasticity and its traditions. But it has not been so. It is not necessary for me to quote the strong expressions of Lord Rosebery as to what he
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0478"/>
<col>947</col>
called the partisan character of the majority of your Lordships' House. I know that those may seem to many of your Lordships to be very unjust words. That is because you do not realise what the people outside think. It shows how wholly you have passed out of relation to those on whose affairs you sit in judgment. With the best intentions you set yourselves to consider their affairs in a spirit wholly different from their own. That is why we had an enormous and crushing majority against the Unionist Party in 1906, repeated in less volume at the beginning of 1910, and again without diminution at the end of last year. The day has gone by for treating this question as one which can be left alone. I do not agree with my noble friend Lord Rosebery that this is a question which is likely to pass and which coming elections are likely to alter. That the Unionist Party will come back to office nobody doubts&#x2014;that their principles, when the time comes, will receive more general acceptance than at present&#x2014;but the political policy of the Unionist Party is one thing and their policy with regard to this House is quite another. We are dealing with a question which has been growing and pressing itself upon us during all these years, and to which it is no longer possible to give the go-by. It is that which to my mind causes the seriousness of the situation. It it very easy to read democracy a lesson or to try to lecture the House of Commons. The question is not who is the wisest. The question is whether you will look the facts in the face and will recognise and accept what the law of the Constitution compels you to recognise as the fact. Lord Cromer gave us a little discourse, in the course of the debate, on the futility of discussions of finance, and on the shortcomings of the Government in regard to finance. I listened to his speech with great interest, because it seemed to me that he was moving in a world different from that in which your Lordships move. If there is one thing on which I thought we were all agreed it is that your Lordships could not amend a Money Bill. I understood the noble Earl to say&#x2014;and I could put no other construction upon his speech&#x2014;that it would be and was desirable that this House should have some power of revising the details of such Bills.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01490"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl gave a series of illustrations which to my mind were unintelligible unless that was what they meant. How could such a doctrine be accepted? To take the case of the Department to which I belong, early in the financial year it is necessary to submit the Estimates to the consideration of the House of Commons, and upon their acceptance by that House Ministers in charge of the War Office and other Departments proceed to make contracts and enter into obligations on the faith that there is no question that the promises made by the House of Commons will be carried out. The noble Viscount opposite knows that quite well, and unless we could rely absolutely on the single and undivided authority of the House of Commons without interference from elsewhere we should be in the position of an agent who is responsible to two boards of directors instead of one and whose policy was confused and stultified thereby. That is so in regard to Supply, and also in regard to Ways and Means, and it is essential that the supervision of finance and its control and administration should rest with the House of Commons alone. I do not devote myself much more to that portion of the Bill that proposes to put the control of finance altogether under the management of the House of Commons. It results from the doctrine that on the House of Commons the Executive of the country depends alone, and that it is the only body to which the Executive can be responsible.<lb/>
We had in the course of the debates some utterances which were of interest because of the vast divergence between the point of view which they disclosed and the point of view of that small handful of us who sit on this side. We had the Duke of Northumberland, who spoke as if it was a pleasure to us and that we were going out of our way to embark on this tremendous controversy, as if we were diverting our energies from the necessary habitual business we have to administer for the pleasure of promoting revolution at every turn. He told us that our conduct contrasted very badly with that of Mr. Gladstone, who did not put a pistol at the heads of his political opponents. I agree it is always undesirable to do so, but when your opponent tries to take away your property sometimes it is necessary to do so. But the noble Duke seems to have for-
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0479"/>
<col>949</col>
gotten a Bill known as the Army Purchase Abolition Bill which passed the House of Commons and was rejected by your Lordships' House. What did Mr. Gladstone do? He not only produced a pistol but he put a bullet into it and presented it to this House in the shape of a Royal Warrant. Many people passed criticisms upon the procedure, but he carried the principle of his measure and declined to discuss the niceties of whether the procedure was Constitutional or not.</membercontribution></p>

We cannot remain any longer in the atmosphere or the traditions of two generations. The noble Duke said things which reminded me more of the tone of Mr. Disraeli's letters on the Constitution in the thirties than the tone of a controversy
<col>950</col>
to-day. But Mr. Disraeli changed his views very much. He was a man who advanced with his times. In 1836 he would have been very surprised to know that the noble Duke was going to vote for the Reform Bill which was introduced here the other day for the destruction of the hereditary principle.<lb/>
Great changes have taken place, and Conservative statesmen have recognised them as they have come, and the things that the Liberals were denounced for preaching yesterday the Conservatives preach with acclamation to-morrow. I hope that calmer and more temperate judgments may before long be passed on the Party to which I belong than are expressed to-day, and that people will come to see that the surgeons knife was necessary for the restoration to health of the body corporate; and that what has been done is with a view of meeting the necessities of the time; and that we are acting in the only spirit which will preserve the Constitution in order to endeavour to bring it once more into harmony with the conditions under which we live.<lb/>
My Lords, I do not think this is a time when we do well, either of us, to indulge in recriminations. The task before us is too difficult. We trust we have given your Lordships some reasons for asking you to believe that in our efforts to bring about a state of things in which we shall at least be in a position to deal with this matter we have some justification on our side. But, on the other hand, we on our side realise that in the recognition which your Lordships have recently given in this and the previous debate to the proposition that times have moved on and that action is necessary, we have something to be grateful for, and something which has in it the promise of better things in the future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01497"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount to whose speech we have just listened did not trouble himself very much to reply to the grave arguments that have been adduced against this Bill from our side of the House; and least of all did he reply adequately to the very powerful speech of my noble friend Lord Rosebery. The noble Viscount, indeed, took exception to Lord Rosebery's consistency, and quoted at length a considerable number of passages from his speeches. I listened to those quotations
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0480"/>
<col>951</col>
as carefully as I could, and I certainly did not detect in any of them any words which could be legitimately interpreted as expressing the approval of my noble friend for the kind of measure that now lies on the Table of the House. My noble friend, of course, has always been a strong advocate of the reform of this House, but he has never, to the best of my belief, recommended to the country any legislation which would have the effect of placing this House in the position that it will occupy under this Bill. The noble Viscount's speech, like most of those to which we have listened in the defence of the Bill, was an endeavour in the first place to set up a case against your Lordships' House, and, in the next place, to convince us, if possible, that the sentence which His Majesty's Government propose to pass upon us is, after all, a very lenient one, and one of which we have little reason to complain.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, with regard to the indictment of this House on the ground of what I suppose may be described as habitual obstruction, I do not propose to say many words. That part of the case was dealt with admirably by my noble friend Lord Midleton, and I have little to add to what he said. But it was remarkable that when the noble Viscount who moved the Bill the other evening was pursuing that part of the subject he found himself in the first ten minutes of his speech describing to your Lordships the extraordinary results of what he called Mr. Gladstone's fertile period of administration between 1868 and 1874. He gave a catalogue of measures of the greatest importance which had been passed into law despite anything that this House might have desired to do, and before he had spoken for another ten minutes he found himself dwelling on the remarkable achievements of the House of Commons of our own time in the direction of what he called popular feeling and popular improvement. I may be permitted to supplement what the noble Viscount told us of Mr. Gladstone's first Administration by a reference to Mr. Gladstone's second Administration, and the words I shall use are those of no less a person than Mr. Gladstone himself. This is what he had to say in 1884&#x2014;
<quote>"Notwithstanding the action of the House of Lords, we have had for a period of fifty years such legislation as has never been known in the history of this country, I may say of the entire modern world."</quote>
<col>952</col>
If I may say so, that gives the House of Lords something like a clean bill of health up to that period. In 1907 again I find a Liberal Minister saying with pride that in two sessions he and his colleagues had been able to put on the Statute-book no fewer than 125 measures, many of them bearing witness to the dawn of a new democratic era. How could that have been accomplished with an obstructive House of Lords in the background? And, my Lords, quite recently we have passed Bills relating to small holdings, coal mines, old-age pensions, Irish land, housing and town planning, labour exchanges, besides all that legislation of which Lord Carrington never fails to boast whenever he addresses your Lordships' House; and pray let it be remembered that that particular class of legislation dealt with the question of the ownership and occupation of land, which is the very subject on which your Lordships might be not unnaturally expected to hold strong and tenacious views.<lb/>
Is it not, I humbly suggest, rather stretching our language for the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack to tell us, as he did the other evening, that Liberal Governments were unable to get anything done? He drew a picture of Liberal Members of Parliament trudging hopelessly through the Lobbies, and described them as broken-hearted reformers defeated at every point. What a singular thing it is that when these broken-hearted reformers go to the country and address their constituents they are never weary of boasting of the magnificent things they have achieved during the past session. Let me test the matter in this way. Can it be stated that owing to the action of the House of Lords the country has ever been permanently cheated of a really important measure which it deliberately desired to obtain? I believe it is impossible to produce any such case. And when I come to the case which is always produced for our confutation&#x2014;the case, I will not say of the rejection, but of the reservation of the Budget of 1909&#x2014;is it not rather remarkable that the <i>gravamen</i> of the noble and learned Lord's charge is, not that there had been a serious loss of time, because we know the loss of time was comparatively insignificant, and might have been much more insignificant still if His Majesty's Ministers had so desired? Nor did he complain of the loss of money, which, I believe, can be measured, so I am told, at a sum of &#x00A3;8,000. The <i>gravamen</i> of
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0481"/>
<col>953</col>
the charge of the noble and learned Lord was that the result of the action of this House had been to convert the great and overwhelming majority with which the Government expected to do great things into a much smaller majority. The question I would ask the noble and learned Lord is which majority, the greater or the smaller majority, most accurately represented the views of the electors of this country?<lb/>
But we on this side of the House are not here to deny that there are grave questions which require the attention of this House. There have been difficulties and friction. They have been due to two causes&#x2014;the one-sided composition of this House and the unfortunate absence of any machinery for adjusting differences between the two Houses when they arise. Both these difficulties are surely capable of adjustment. We are ready, so far as our opportunities permit us, to deal with both questions. We have taken a very long step in the direction of proposing a reconstituted House, and in the Resolutions of last year we gave the country in outline our ideas of a scheme under which differences between the two Houses might conveniently and reasonably be adjusted. Surely here were promising materials for a settlement, and can there be any reasonable doubt that, if His Majesty's Government were really free to deal with this question on its merits, they would find means of co-operating with us in solving these difficulties, instead of forcing upon a Party which represents something like an equality of the electors of the country a measure such as that which they have proposed?<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord told us that the time has passed for talking of a settlement of this kind, because, he said, of the failure of the Constitutional Conference last year. That failure was to me, personally, a very great disappointment, but I am far from considering it quite so discouraging as some people would have us believe. We sat for five months, and it is self-evident that we should not have sat for five months unless some measure of agreement had been come to on some points at all events. And I would ask, does it follow that because eight Ministers and ex-Ministers, sitting with closed doors, and not entrusted with anything that could be described as plenipotentiary powers, were unable to come to a settlement that there is no room, no materials, for a settle-
<col>954</col>
ment by open discussion and debate between the two Parties in the full light of political day?<lb/>
When the Conference broke down you proclaimed war on the following morning&#x2014;literally, I think, on the following morning. We chose what seems to me the better part in endeavouring to find a way for peace, and may I not ask whether that memorable speech delivered by the most rev. Primate the other evening does not point to the conclusion that with good will on both sides of the House peace on reasonable terms should not be impossible. But I fear we are to conclude from the language of noble Lords opposite that, in spite of all that has happened, in spite of the measure of unrevealed agreement which resulted from the Conference, in spite of the overtures made from this side of the House, you are determined to crush us with the same sledge-hammer which you were brandishing before the Conference had sat, before the Resolutions of 1910, and before this House had read a second time the Bill for the reconstitution of the House of Lords.<lb/>
I have described the Bill as a sledgehammer, and I am inclined to think that the epithet is not undeserved. We have had with reference to this Bill a series of what I would describe as anodyne speeches. We have had one from the noble Viscount who has just addressed the House, and we had another very remarkable one from a noble friend of mine who sits behind me, Lord Montagu. The burden of those speeches is to tell us that, after all, this Bill will not leave us in such a very bad position. I must say that none of those speeches give me the slightest comfort. Moreover, we can, in my opinion, make no greater mistake than to indulge deliberately in what I can only call a policy of make-believe with regard to this point. The noble Viscount told us that the Bill still left us powers which were important and substantial. I believe they are neither important nor substantial.<lb/>
Let me for a very few moments explain what I mean by reference to the clauses of the Bill. I take the first clause. The noble Viscount who introduced the Bill in the whole course of his speech never referred to the first clause at all. He did not say a single word in support of it, and the other noble Viscount who spoke just
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0482"/>
<col>955</col>
now treated the clause as if it were an agreed clause, scarcely worth our discussion. I protest against any assumption of the kind. Under that clause the right of this House to reject Money Bills goes altogether&#x2014;to reject not only Money Bills in the stricter sense of the words, but anything which, under the terms of this Bill, can be described as a Money Bill, which is a very different thing. As to the existence of that right, the legal right, there is no question. It is admitted by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. Only he contended that because that right had not been exercised it had fallen into desuetude, and could not be constitutionally exercised. With great deference I venture to think that it does not by any means follow that because a great Constitutional safeguard of this kind has not been from time to time set in motion, that that safeguard has ceased to exist. No measures are so difficult to justify as measures of precaution, because the more effectual they are the more rarely is it necessary to set them in operation. Although I do not like to Hansardise him, I would remind the House of the memorable statement of the noble Viscount opposite during the debate on the Finance Bill, when he told us that our bare legal right to reject Money Bills had not been denied, and he went on&#x2014;
<quote>"Some, no doubt, would argue that it may be transformed appropriately into a moral duty, and I do not know that I would quarrel with them. I can imagine a state of things&#x2014;I can imagine it with difficulty&#x2014;which would justify such a transformation by reason of the wild-cat proposals of a demented House of Commons."</quote>
Under the new dispensation the legal right and the moral duty disappear altogether, and the country is left to the blind fury of the House of Commons, or it may be of a Minister who finds himself in a tight place and is obliged to make drastic proposals in order to placate his followers.<lb/>
Not only does the right of rejection disappear under this Bill, but even our opportunities for profitable discussion and suggestion in regard to matters of finance disappear almost to the vanishing point, and that, I think, is the answer to what was said just now by the noble Viscount in reference to my noble friend Lord Cromer's speech. I agree with the noble Earl on the Cross Benches that in these days of&#x2014;shall I say?&#x2014;reckless finance, it is of the utmost importance that this
<col>956</col>
House should have full opportunities of discussing the financial proposals of the Government of the day, and when we consider that this House contains men like the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, Lord St. Aldwyn, Lord Milner, and the heads of the great banking and commercial houses who sometimes take part in our discussions, would it not be a national misfortune if we were not given the fullest opportunities of criticising and examining even Bills which are Money Bills pure and simple and no more. As I read the Bill our opportunities henceforth will be limited to a perfunctory discussion during the last months of the session, at a moment when this House is notoriously overwhelmed with business and when it would be quite impossible for us adequately to put before the other House of Parliament and before the country our views even on the gravest financial issues.<lb/>
And I attach great importance to the right of the House of Lords, I will not say to insist upon Amendments to financial Bills, but to suggest Amendments. We have had a good many controversies in this House in the past as to this right of amendment, and very hard measure has not infrequently been dealt out to us. The House of Lords has not always been in the wrong in these controversies. I should like very much to give the House a rather remarkable illustration which I gather from the Bill on the Table. When we have at various times suggested alterations in Bills dealing, not with money raised by taxation, but with money raised out of the rates, we have been on several occasions pulled up by the House of Commons and told that our Amendments constituted a breach of the privilege of that House. But what do I find in this Bill? When the question came up for discussion in the House of Commons the Government were obliged to admit that this plea that we should be precluded from discussing Bills dealing with the rates was not tenable, and accordingly in subsection (2) of the first clause it is provided that Bills dealing with money to be raised by local authorities for local purposes are not to be regarded as Money Bills within the meaning of the clause. There we have a complete vindication of the contention of the House of Lords in the past as to the kind of point we had a right to discuss.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0483"/>
<col>957</col>
But when we come to Bills dealing with the money of the taxpayers we find that the clause is drawn in such a way that the net is spread not only too widely, but even more widely than Ministers themselves apparently desired. The Prime Minister announced the other day that the Government had no desire to enlarge the bounds within which, he said, Constitutional practice and usage had established the authority of the House of Commons in matters of finance. He said that was their "governing principle," and then he went on to give examples of Bills the substantial governing purpose of which was not finance, but "some larger or social policy, though for the purpose of carrying out such a policy they incidentally contained financial provisions," and finally he said that the definition of Money Bills was&#x2014;
<quote>"most careful to exclude, first, the possibility of including in this clause a Bill, financial in form or title, of which the object of its other provisions was the real and governing purpose; and secondly, to exclude the annexation or tacking on to a financial Bill of extraneous provisions intended to be applied for political or social purposes."</quote>
That is all very good. It is an admirable description of what the object of the clause ought to be. It is intended, according to the Prime Minister, to guard against "tacking" in the more technical sense&#x2014;that is, the addition of ulterior political purposes to a financial Bill&#x2014;and it also covers the case of what we sometimes refer to as moral "tacking"&#x2014;that is where the. Bill is a financial Bill but where objects not financial but covering, to use Mr. Asquith's words, "some larger or social policy" are clearly aimed at by the legislation. When we get into Committee I think we shall be able to show that the clause, so far from carrying out the intention of the Prime Minister, really does sweep within the net not only Money Bills in the strict sense of the word, but a whole host of other legislation under the guise of Money Bills. The noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War, when discussing the Veto Resolutions some time ago, used a very admirable phrase when he said that there were Bills in which "some big principle altogether over-tops the financial point involved." That is an excellent test by which this clause may be judged. It will, I believe, be found that as it stands it contains a very dangerous encroachment on the privileges of this House. The clause, however, provides not only a very shaky definition of a Money Bill, but also what I must call a very
<col>958</col>
suspect tribunal for deciding whether or not a Bill is a Money Bill. I say that without any disrespect to the present Speaker of the House of Commons or to the distinguished men who have preceded him. But it has been pointed out that the Speaker is an officer of the House of Commons, the vigilant guardian of its rights and privileges, and that as such he does not hold the position of au umpire or arbiter qualified to hold the balance evenly between the interests of the two Houses.<lb/>
Now I pass to the second clause. The first clause, as I have shown, withdraws from this House absolutely a very considerable part of the field of legislation. The matter, therefore, becomes the more serious when we find that in the remainder of the field of legislation we are hopelessly crippled and hobbled by the provisions of Clause 2. The noble Viscount who moved the Bill told us that the clause left us important and substantial powers, and the Secretary of State for War went the length of saying that it made no very great change from what was the present practice as between the two Houses of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01498"><member>VISCOUNR HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: What ought to be the practice between them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01499"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: That is not quite the same thing. We might not entirely agree as to what ought or ought not to be the practice. But what the noble Viscount who leads the House told us was this, and the statement does seem to me, must say, a most extraordinary one. He said that the right of delay given to us under this clause would "no longer rest on the disputed survival of an antiquated right, but would rest on the definite and formal assertion of a modern Statute." I absolutely challenge both limbs of that statement. What does the noble Viscount mean by saying that our right to delay the passage of an ordinary Bill, not a Money Bill, rests on the disputed survival of an antiquated right? I never heard of such a doctrine. If we delay the passage of Bills it is not the assertion of a disputed survival of an antiquated right, it is the exercise of a duty that belongs to us under the Constitution of the country. Then what does the noble Viscount mean by saying that in the future we should be able to rely on the security of a modern Statute? What is that worth? The antidote to the poison of the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0484"/>
<col>959</col>
noble Viscount's statement is to be found, I think, in the almost immediately preceding sentence of his speech. He said:&#x2014;
<quote>"There are those, I may confide to your Lordships, in my own Party, persons who have a good right to an opinion, who regard the powers to be possessed by the House of Lords as formidable, and even, if they are very unwisely used, as menacing to all the things that Liberals at all events care for."</quote>
I rather mistrust this revelation of stable secrets. Menacing&#x0021; Could a menace be less thinly veiled than that contained in this sentence? It is a plain intimation that if this House uses the restricted powers conferred on it under this Bill in a manner which noble Lords opposite may deem to be unwise, these influential people of the Radical Party of whom the noble Viscount speaks will see to it that those powers are still further curtailed. Such is the security of the modern Statute which the noble Viscount holds out to us.<lb/>
Then there is the suggestion that with our two years' delay and the three sessions we really have all the opportunities we can reasonably look for. I remain quite unconverted by those suggestions. If I may follow up Lord Marchamley's simile, I doubt extremely whether the dishes which are likely to be presented to us by His Majesty's Government under the new <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> will be of that light and unsubstantial character which will render them no longer pleasant to the sight or palatable to the taste if they are kept waiting for a few hours. I believe, on the contrary, that the proposals which they are likely to submit will be of a much more solid and indigestible and dangerous character. But how will the thing work? For all we know the two sessions may be bogus sessions. There is not a word in the Bill to ensure that the sessions shall be really substantial sessions of the usual length. What is quite clear is that during the first two years of the Parliament the House of Commons will be able to run riot. From this perfunctory treatment no subject, however important, is to be excepted. In the whole course of the debates in another place no feature was more significant than the refusal of the Prime Minister to vouchsafe exceptional treatment for any single subject, no matter how important or how vitally it might affect the very Constitution of the country. And what an ominous observation that was which he let fall, I think during the course of the debate, that if all Constitutional questions were excepted
<col>960</col>
there would be very little left for the Radical Party to do.<lb/>
Let us look for one moment at this Bill in operation. You will have the two periods&#x2014;the period when the new House of Commons will be in the full plenitude of its power. In that period it will be impervious to argument for this reason, that under your Bill the insertion of Amendments in any measure converts it into a new measure and it will consequently have to be brought up the following year as such, so that it will come to us in the third year instead of the second. That lost year will be in the eyes of His Majesty's Government a precious year; it will be one of the two years of the riotous youth of the Government, and they are not likely to jeopardise it in a hurry, and I say no greater premium could be put upon the obstinacy of a Government in charge of a Bill than this enactment which says that an amended Bill is to be treated as a new Bill. Then, my Lords, the Bill may be carried by a wholly insignificant majority, by a majority which reflects quite inadequately the public opinion of this country, by a majority formed of a coalition of groups, a majority of the kind which Mr. Asquith himself described as "a scratch majority combining under the coercion of Party exigencies" and controlled by that Parliamentary machine the rigour and inelasticity of which the Prime Minister has lamented and of the working of which we have been allowed occasional glimpses by some of the old House of Commons men&#x2014;Lord Marchamley, Lord St. Davids, Lord Courtney of Penwith, and last, but not least, the Secretary of State for War&#x2014;who have addressed us. So much for the first two years. Then we come to the second period&#x2014;a period of lower vitality, when the General Election will be approaching and there is no longer room for the interval of two sessions prescribed by the Bill. It has been suggested by my noble friend Lord Montagu that during that period this House would be able to paralyse the House of Commons. I should like to put it to your Lordships&#x2014;Is it very pleasant to look forward to these alternate periods of violent activity and stagnation? Has it been under such conditions that in the past our legislation has been deliberate and progressive, and because it has been deliberate and progressive, has been durable and respected by the people of this country?<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0485"/>
<col>961</col>
It is not disputed that the first period of exuberant youth will be used by the present House of Commons for the purpose of forcing Home Rule upon the country. We understand that the Government claim to have a mandate to ignore the fact that a Home Rule Bill has been twice deliberately rejected by the people. It has been truly said that Ministers were careful in their addresses to keep Home Rule out of sight, but, assuming that you have some kind of mandate for Home Rule, the question we have to ask is&#x2014;What kind of Home Rule do you consider you have a mandate for? I believe that the ideas of the Government upon the question of Home Rule are about as nebulous as their ideas in regard to House of Lords reform. Are we to have the only Home Rule we know&#x2014;Gladstonian Home Rule, twice rejected by the country? Is it to be Federal Home Rule&#x2014;some vast Imperial scheme? Is it to be what is sometimes called Home Rule all round? Unless I am mistaken, that is the variety which finds favour with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and, I think, the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. I am glad he nods assent to my observation; but if that is to be the kind of Home Rule we are to have&#x2014;Home Rule intended to relieve Parliament of part of the burden of local business which now falls upon it&#x2014;we have a right to say that no scheme of that description has ever been put before the country and that it is impossible to contend that the Government have a mandate for such a scheme. I say nothing of the other questions connected with Home Rule&#x2014;the financial basis, the treatment of Ulster, and what is going to be done with the police and the justiciary. All these things, I know, are treated by Mr. Redmond as mere details, but they are details in which this country takes a good deal of interest and about which they have never been consulted.<lb/>
I may be asked why, holding the views I hold about this Bill, I shall not go into the Lobby against it if the House should divide. My answer is that our action must certainly not be interpreted as any indication that we accept, either permanently or provisionally, the place which it is sought to assign to this House under the Bill. But we admit that after the two last elections you have a right to legislate upon this question, and
<col>962</col>
we believe there is some ground which is common to both sides. We therefore hold it desirable that we should enter upon the Committee stage and discuss the provisions of the Bill in detail, and that we should put upon the Paper such Amendments as the measure may seem in our view to call for. I hope I may be permitted to add an expression of my confidence that those Amendments will be respectfully examined and discussed by noble Lords opposite. We are justified in inferring that this will be so from the distinct intimation of the noble and learned Lord that if Amendments are moved in Committee then will be the time to consider our proposals.<lb/>
Upon one point we shall press for information. We shall endeavour to ascertain from noble Lords opposite the extent to which the arrangements proposed in this Bill are to be regarded as merely provisional. Very little has been said by noble Lords opposite on the subject of the Preamble of the Bill. It bids us look forward to a reconstituted House of Lords with powers which are to be hereafter defined and limited. The noble Viscount told us the other evening that there would be a long road to travel before effect can be given to the intentions expressed in the Preamble. We should like to have some idea of what we are likely to find when we get to the end of it. I hope we may expect to find that the Government have in view a reconstituted Second Chamber with real powers, not powers of obstruction, but powers giving to the two Houses opportunities for consultation and co-operation, opportunities for the nation of securing a breathing space in moments of great tension and of uttering the second thoughts, which sometimes occur, and occur usefully to nations as well as to individuals. Such glimpses as have been allowed us by noble Lords opposite have not, I am afraid, been altogether reassuring. The noble and learned Lord told us that we might look forward to "a new procedure" which would be more "expeditious." But his formula bore a striking resemblance to that used by his colleague, the Home Secretary, who amplified the same idea in words which I will quote to the House. Mr. Churchill expressed himself in favour of less dilatory and more convenient methods, but he went on to explain that by less dilatory methods he meant a less dilatory method of passing Government Bills and by a more convenient method, a method
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0486"/>
<col>963</col>
more convenient to His Majesty's Government. The passage does not strike that note of disinterestedness, of fair play, which the habitual language of His Majesty's Government entitles us to expect at their hands. Meanwhile, while we wait for the new dispensation, we shall suggest that, so long as the Constitution is out of gear, it is necessary in common prudence to devise some safeguards to protect the country against dangerous and ill-considered innovations; safeguards, above all, to protect and to secure our most sacred institutions and the foundations of the government of the United Kingdom against irreparable damage.<lb/>
That is all I have to say this evening, but before I sit down I desire to lay before the House a quotation which has been sent to me by a correspondent, and which is, I think, apposite at this moment. It is taken from a book by Mr. Oman, the distinguished Professor of Modern History at Oxford. The book has for its title, "Seven Roman Statesmen of the later Republic," and the passage occurs in the essay on Tiberius Gracchus&#x2014;
<quote>"No statesman has the right to pull down the Constitution about the ears of the people the moment he finds himself checked in his designs. However bad a Constitution may be, the man who upsets it before he has arranged for anything to put in its place is a criminal and anarchist if he knows what he is doing, and a mischievous madman if he does not."</quote>
Apologising for the severity of the professor's language, I venture to leave the noble Viscount his choice of the horns of the professor's dilemma.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01500"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am too well accustomed to the horns of the historian's dilemma to be at all embarrassed by that of my friend Professor Oman, and I would have read out that passage with a confidence equal to that of the noble Marquess and applied it to the noble Lords who prepared the way for wrecking the Constitution by their vote on the Budget Bill and by the proceedings which they felt bound to follow that vote up by, which amounted to the offence that Professor Oman was condemning.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I had not intended, and I do not intend, to-night to make any lengthy observations, for I consider that
<col>964</col>
my noble friend Lord Haldane sufficiently stated our case, and I do not see that the noble Marquess&#x2014;I say it with all respect&#x2014;has in any way shaken our position. During the last three weeks we shall have had two votes in this House, one upon the Bill moved by the noble Marquess and the other upon the Bill now before your Lordships. There is this very curious feature about both. With regard to the Bill the Second Reading of which was accepted last week without a Division, the vote was preceded by a vast number of speeches directed strongly and vigorously against the Bill which was afterwards to receive unanimous support. Now again to-night the noble Marquess said&#x2014;and it was with pleasure and satisfaction that I listened to the opening sentences of his speech&#x2014;that he did not at all, in spite of the failure of the Conference, despair of a settlement; that, on the contrary, he was not discouraged either by that failure or by anything that had happened since from still hoping for a settlement, and the refusal to vote against the Bill to-night, coupled with that language of the noble Marquess, filled me with an expectation that we should not have emphatic, and may I say laboured, disapproval of the Bill which noble Lords are going to assent to. But if the reasoning taken by the noble Marquess were solid reasoning, if the points taken were good points, I wonder, if I may say it without want of generosity, that they should allow the Second Reading of a Bill open to all those condemnatory criticisms. I rejoice that that operation is to take place, and if the noble Marquess had accompanied his announcement of that intention on the part of himself and his friends by making the best of an unwelcome task, just as those who supported his own Bill last week made the best of an unwelcome task, then I think the noble Marquess would have taken a line more worthy of the occasion and more worthy of those pathetic and conciliatory expressions with which he began his speech.<lb/>
At the end of these two momentous debates and these two momentous Second Readings, I am asked to do&#x2014;what? To defend the Bill? No. I am asked to explain to the House what is the scheme of Home Rule which we are going to adopt under the Bill to the Second Reading of which you are going to assent. Why am I to go all through the anti-Home Rule
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0487"/>
<col>965</col>
story? I do not say that there is no anti-Home Rule story to be told, but why is all that old story to be revived on this occasion? Next year if all goes well there will be plenty of opportunity, and I submit to the House and to the noble Marquess that that subject is thoroughly irrelevant to the Second Reading of a Bill which is an agreed Second Reading. Then there was the old point, which really I should have thought the noble Marquess was wearied of&#x2014;that we have no mandate. The noble Marquess laboured for several minutes what is a mandate and what is not a mandate, and my noble friend Lord Rosebery also said something about a mandate and about my view of a mandate. My own view of a mandate, may I remind the noble Marquess, is the view of the old Whig school, which was that when a Parliament was elected it could do what it liked. The noble Marquess referred to my reference the other day to Mr. Glad-stone's legislative performances between 1868 and 1874. I did not refer to them with a view to disparaging the House of Lords. I did not refer to them as showing that the House of Lords had rejected good Bills; I referred to them as showing, and certainly I was right from the point of view of the old Whigs, that when Parliament contains a majority which supports a Ministry the whole of that operation is to be an independent operation&#x2014;they are to be members of Parliament and not delegates. The noble Marquess has read plenty of writings in works well known to him which express that with much greater force than I can do.<lb/>
It is uninteresting, if he will allow me to say so, to follow the noble Marquess through all his criticisms on the Bill. I think it is true that there is not a single one of those criticisms which has not been thoroughly discussed in this House within the last three weeks. As to Money Bills, I confess I thought the clause dealing with those was by this time agreed. The noble Marquess denies that, but I do not think he quite correctly stated, or understood even, how far the first clause goes. There was added, as the noble Marquess remembers and all who followed the fortunes of the Bill in the House of Commons will remember, that addition to the clause as it originally stood which was supposed to meet and entirely satisfy the objections made by the Party of the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>
<col>966</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01501"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: It was admitted to be an improvement, but I do not think any of my friends in the other place admitted for a moment that it entirely satisfied us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01502"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: At all events it satisfied them as much as any concession His Majesty's Government made. It was studied and considered and taken as a concession that would meet the objections made by Mr. Balfour and others. Then as to the other points the noble Marquess took, I submit that on consideration he will find that they are all difficulties and objections that arise whenever you attempt to change an unwritten into a written Constitution. The minute you begin to write your Constitution you will be confronted with the very points and objections that the noble Marquess produced. That they can all be answered adequately, completely, and summarily I do not pretend for a moment. It is well known that in the American Constitution not all the points to which objection was taken 100 years ago were satisfactorily settled for good and all; and all the difficulties raised by the noble Marquess are difficulties that anybody will find inherent in an attempt to infuse written provisions into an unwritten system depending more upon custom and usage than upon anything in a Statute-book.<lb/>
I am a little dismayed, and I daresay the noble Marquess meant to dismay me, at the promise or threat that he holds out of Amendments. There is no intention on the part of the Government to refuse consideration of Amendments that are consistent with the principle, which would be approved by the Second Reading, but it would not be to the credit of the noble Marquess and his friends to allow the Bill to go through Second Reading with the intention of raising all the difficulties and objections they think vital at a later stage. The noble Marquess will not suspect me of desiring to play the part of moral censor, but I think it would not be entirely to the credit of the leaders of the Opposition if they let this Bill go through the Second Reading with the intention to reproduce at a later stage all the difficulties and objections which they think vital. It would, I think, be very disquieting to the country and not advantageous to them-selves to pursue such a course. But the Government have no power or right to prevent Amendments, but they would be carried, of course, at the risk of dissension with another place. If it is the intention of
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0488"/>
<col>967</col>
noble Lords opposite to persist in bringing forward a cloud of Amendments in the Committee stage of this Bill, such a course will tell against them just as much as voting against the Bill on Second Reading to-night. We are confident that that view must prevail in the minds of noble Lords opposite. I think the country is expecting what we expect&#x2014;that the same spirit and policy and temper, in view of the public and Parliamentary necessities which have induced noble Lords to-night to let this Bill pass the Second Reading, will animate them when they come to the later stages of it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01531">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01532"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill which I now ask your Lordships to read a second time is for the purpose of amending the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act of 1906. It is brought in under its present name because it includes matter which has not been included before and could not properly be included under the older name. The Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act of 1906 was an amendment of the original Act of 1893, and it was the result of an inquiry by a Departmental Committee which sat for some time upon the subject. That Act has, I think, on the whole served a very useful purpose. It has checked, at all events, some of the bad practices which prevailed at that time, and has had the very important effect of making farmers generally more accustomed to the necessity and the real advantage of having their material analysed. But while this Act has been of value, it has not, I think, carried out all we hoped or expected it would do, and it has not been so fully taken advantage of as it ought to have been, partly through defects in the drafting of the Act itself. The result of our five years' experience of the Act shows that there still remain several loopholes for fraud which we hoped had been closed. We find also that it has not checked all of those practices not in themselves fraudulent and yet which are very detrimental to the interests of farmers and which do cause them enormous loss.<lb/>
<col>972</col>
This Bill has been drawn up by the Central Chamber of Agriculture, a body thoroughly representative of agricultural opinion in the country. It has affiliated chambers in every county, and the large majority of them have been pressing us for some time to take action in the matter. The Bill has been before the council now for close upon two years, and has been reported upon by a committee of the council; and in July of last year the final report of that committee was accepted unanimously by the council itself. The Bill is drawn, as we intended it to be drawn, in the interests of the farmers. At the same time it is in no way a declaration of war against the trader, because I certainly acknowledge that as regards the great number of people who trade in the articles to which this Bill applies their method of trading is above suspicion. We expect to get from them fair and honest trading, and with regard to the majority of them we get it. At the same time the Bill is aimed at the suppression of certain practices which must be stopped if agriculturists are to get the full value of what modern science can do for them in connection with these artificial manures and feeding stuffs. It is aimed more particularly at those men who do not carry out their trade in the best possible way, but who put stuff on the market which is frequently, I am afraid, not worth its carriage from the station to the farm, and who advertise with very high-sounding names many articles totally unfitted for the purposes for which they are intended&#x2014;mixtures and compounds which may actually comply with the letter of the Act but offend very greatly indeed against its actual spirit.<lb/>
The provisions of the Bill are very clearly explained in the Memorandum on the front page, which goes very closely into the Amendments and additions which we propose. Some of these Amendments are of a very technical character, and I do not want to trouble your Lordships with them more than I can help, but I shall probably have to say a word or two upon them. In the first place, I should like to speak of the probably more general Amendments. In the first place, under the Act of 1906 the Board of Agriculture has a veto upon all prosecutions. Under the former Act of 1893 individuals, farmers' societies, and others could not institute a prosecution under the Act except with the consent of the Board of Agriculture, but county
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0491"/>
<col>973</col>
councils and borough councils had freedom to take the initiative in the matter. The Act of 1906 did away with that freedom, and at the present moment they cannot institute a prosecution unless they first obtain the consent of the Board of Agriculture. There is a very strong feeling indeed among county councils that that power to prosecute should be restored to them. I believe that almost every county council would agree to that. There are members of the County Councils Association in your Lordships' House who, I hope, will be prepared to speak upon the advantage of this power being given back to them, and I believe it is the perfectly unanimous opinion of the agricultural world generally that the power should be restored. That view is probably largely based upon certain cases where the Board of Agriculture have refused permission to prosecute but where there has been a strong expression of opinion that prosecution ought to be allowed.<lb/>
I do not wish to quote any cases of that kind. The President of the Board has probably been sufficiently worried about them already. But the chief reason I do not quote them is this, that although I believe they would constitute substantial ground for making the request that I am now making, I much prefer to base my argument for the power to prosecute being returned to county councils on the broader ground that those bodies are the right bodies to have full control over the Act. County councils and borough councils have full charge at present of time administration of the Act except in this one particular. They have to bear the whole expenses of administration, and, in the event of a prosecution undertaken by them being unsuccessful, they have to pay the full costs of that prosecution. In addition, the county council is bound to appoint an official agricultural analyst and official sampler. The appointment of those officials has to receive the approval of the Board of Agriculture, and so it may be taken as tolerably certain that the men appointed are good men. Furthermore, many county councils keep up very well-equipped laboratories, and have the whole responsibility for carrying out the measure in the best way they can. They, of course, would never attempt a prosecution except on the advice of their analyst. Their own analyst is a man of responsibility and reputation, and I do not think it is in the
<col>974</col>
least likely that he would ever recommend a prosecution if there was much risk in his own mind of the analysis which he had made being upset or if there was any chance of the prosecution being unsuccessful; and bearing in mind that both the county council and the analyst have a reputation for fairness to keep up, it is exceedingly unlikely that they would consent to frivolous prosecutions being undertaken.<lb/>
I do not know whether the Board of Agriculture desire to keep this power in their own hands. I expect at times they find it a somewhat inconvenient power. For when they feel bound for their own reasons to take a different view from that taken by the county councils and refuse an application to prosecute, they place themselves in antagonism with a very large body of agriculturists. I think county councils are for many reasons in a much better position to judge of the fairness of a prosecution than the Board of Agriculture. It can only be in the interests of the traders that this power should remain with the Board. Although I am very willing that the interests of traders should be safeguarded in every possible way, I think this is an unnecessary safeguard, both for the reasons I have stated and also because under the Act there is a chief official analyst set up by the Board of Agriculture and power is given to the trader or to any one connected with the prosecution to submit a sample of the disputed article to that official analyst; and I think it is quite certain that if he disagrees with the analysis of the analyst to the county council there will be very little chance of a prosecution being undertaken, or if undertaken, of being successful. I hope, my Lords, you will think those are sufficient reasons why you should consider this point.<lb/>
There is one other Amendment of a general character. Formerly no prosecution could be undertaken unless time sample of which the analysis is disputed was taken within ten days of its delivery. We want to extend that ten days to twenty-eight days. I do not think there has been anything in this Act which has militated more against its being taken full advantage of than this ten days' limit. The regulations for sampling are laid down in most concise and clear language. They are complicated, because they are in themselves so stringent. They are in many cases almost too complicated
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0492"/>
<col>975</col>
for the farmers to work, but I am not suggesting that they should be altered. They are laid down purposely stringent for the protection of the trader, but I think it is obvious that sufficient time should be given to the agriculturist to work them out. The limit of ten days is quite insufficient. If a man decides at the moment he orders his goods that he will have them sampled I have no doubt he could do it in ten days, but we do not carry on our trade in that way. We do not carry it on under a constant suspicion that we are being done by these traders, and if we delay for a few days while we are finding out some reason to believe that the manure or feeding stuff is not what it is intended to be, then we are prevented from prosecuting by the operation of this ten days' limit. It very often happens that a farmer who has some doubt of the material which is delivered to him will get a partial analysis taken privately, and it is when his doubt has been confirmed by some other private analyst that he wants to take proceedings against the trader, but the limit of ten days precludes this being done. I believe that twenty-eight days is the least time in which the farmer would be able to do it. I am very anxious that we should have an extension, as I am quite certain that until the period is extended we shall not get the Act taken advantage of in the way it ought to be.<lb/>
There is an important addition to this Bill in this direction, that agricultural seeds are brought within its scope for the first time. Clause 3 gives power to samplers to take samples of seed. Clause 5 gives power to appoint an agricultural seed tester, and Clause 6 deals with the power of the purchaser to send his seed to the agricultural tester to be tested. Seeds have not been dealt with in England since the year 1869, when an Act was passed preventing under a very heavy penalty the killing or dyeing of seeds. An Act was passed to protect the Irish farmer the year before last, and it is on those lines, with one important exception, that we are proposing to deal. I believe it is very important indeed that we should get control over the seeds sown. There is a very much greater knowledge of agricultural seeds now than there used to be. Farmers are beginning to realise the actual place in every mixture of the different varieties, and are beginning to realise, too, the importance of getting exactly the right seed
<col>976</col>
for particular parts of their soil. But in spite of the efforts of a large number of our best seedsmen there is still a great deal of bad seed on the market, seed which comes of a bad stock, seed which has disease in it, seed which is old, and seed which has a great variety of adulterants.<lb/>
Under the Irish Act seeds might be tested for purity and for germination. We translated those words into this Bill as I introduced it into your Lordships' House last year, but the Bill in that shape proceeded no further, and having introduced those words into the Bill we found that it raised a storm of indignation. We were accused of setting up a standard of germination. I do not think the Bill did set up a standard of germination, but, if it did, it was a wrong thing to do in this country. None of us wanted a standard for many reasons. One reason is that germination must vary from year to year and be dependent entirely on the climatic conditions and the time in which the seeds were harvested. But more important still, the germination of foreign seed is almost always higher than English seed. We get many samples of clover grown in France which will germinate regularly at 95 per cent., whilst a good sample of English clover would not germinate at more than 85 per cent., but we get a hardier crop off the English seed than we do off foreign seed.<lb/>
Under Clause 1 and partially under Clauses 2 and 4 an invoice has to be given with every article showing the percentages of the ingredients which the article contains. Under Clause 4 the invoices are taken to be an absolute guarantee of the facts stated. Under the old Act they were taken as a guarantee only within certain limits of error. Those limits were fixed by regulation of the Board of Agriculture, and, generally speaking, the limits were placed at something like one-tenth. It works in this way, that supposing a man sells you a feeding cake guaranteed to contain, say, 9 per cent. of oil and 20 per cent. of albuminoids, he is entitled to supply you with a cake containing a little over 8 per cent. of oil and 18 per cent. of albuminoids. He is protected because the analysis would not deviate more than the limit laid down by the Board of Agriculture. The farmer has to accept the loss of those very valuable units of feeding stuff and has no redress. We say he ought to have redress. He buys
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0493"/>
<col>977</col>
on the units which are guaranteed to him. He knows quite well the market price at the moment of those units, and he pays for the article at that price, and what he pays for he is entitled to have delivered to him. The traders object to this limit being taken away mainly on the ground that they analyse their manures and feeding stuffs in large bulk, and that owing to errors, mistakes in mixing which they cannot always avoid, the actual consignment sent out will differ in some degree from the analysis. We admit that to a certain extent. We know quite well that mixing is not an exact science, and that there may be occasional small errors. Consequently we propose that, while the limits of error shall be done away with in ordinary cases, they shall remain in cases of prosecution. We think it quite fair that a man should not be prosecuted merely because he has made a mistake which he cannot avoid. Therefore when a prosecution is undertaken a man will be able to rely upon the limits of error, but for ordinary cases his civil liability will remain, and he will be bound to supply all he has contracted for or give compensation. Many firms give compensation now. We want under this Bill to make that compensation compulsory.<lb/>
In paragraph (<i>b</i>) of Clause 1 we enlarge the number of constituents which we require to have guaranteed. This is of very considerable importance to us. In more scientific stock-breeding we feed our stock on what is called the albuminoid ratio. For effective and successful stock-breeding that is, I believe, almost necessary; but to do so we must have a statement of the amount of carbohydrates. There is another reason. Formerly certain feeding cakes used to be sent to us practically without any of these carbohydrates. Now a very large amount is added, and I think it is reasonable that we should ask that particulars should be given to us. No doubt the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture will recollect that this matter was brought up and discussed before the Departmental Committee which sat upon this subject five or six years ago, and they decided that while they could not compel manufacturers to give these carbohydrates yet traders should be encouraged to do so. We want in this case to make it necessary that the carbohydrates should be given. In paragraph (<i>c</i>) we provide that, in regard to any article whose value depends entirely or mainly upon the presence of one particular
<col>978</col>
constituent, the invoice shall state what is the percentage of such constituent contained in the article. I had sent me recently from a county analyst the analysis of the last six samples which he had analysed of ground lime. The lime in them varied from 45 per cent. to 92 per cent.&#x2014;an enormous variation. The purchaser of the material was probably told in the analysis that it contained a certain amount of potash, ammonia, or whatever it might be, but he was not told how much lime it contained. But what he wanted to buy was lime. Consequently if the amount of lime could be shown, as it would be under this Bill, it would be a very good guide as to the price the purchaser should pay for it.<lb/>
We see the same constantly in regard to feeding stuffs. I resisted the temptation just now of quoting instances to the President of the Board of Agriculture of cases in which his Board had refused permission to prosecute, and I only quote this now as an illustration. The noble Earl will recollect a certain case of a cattle food compound which was found, on analysis, to contain over 40 per cent. of sawdust. The Board of Agriculture, I think, rather like sawdust as a feeding stuff. At any rate they would not allow us to prosecute. If this clause which I am recommending to your Lordships had been in the former Act the analysis would have shown the purchaser in this case how much sugar was contained amongst that sawdust. All the analysis did show was that there was a certain amount of oil and albuminoids; but the only thing the purchaser wanted to buy was sugar, and we think it is important that the provision in this clause should be adopted. I have felt it necessary to make this somewhat long statement in moving the Second Reading of the Bill in order to show that there is good reason for amending the former Act, and that as far as we are able to do we have attempted to make no more than the necessary amendments. I hope your Lordships will be good enough to give the Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01534"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to say, on behalf of the County Councils Association, that this Bill has been before them and that on the main lines they entirely support it. It is a Bill
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0494"/>
<col>979</col>
full of details, and for that reason it will require careful consideration in Committee. There is one point particularly to which I wish to allude, and that is the necessity of obtaining the consent of the Board of Agriculture to prosecutions. This particular consent of the Board has been found not to meet with entire favour on the part of county councils, and I think the Bill deals with this question very fairly and well. County councils have no objection to the action of the Board of Agriculture in strengthening the hands of county councils and in seeing that the analysts they appoint are efficient and capable of doing their work; but they do think that the restriction regarding prosecutions put upon them by a superior body is one which, to say the least, is misunderstood in the rural districts in this country.<lb/>
Clause 9 brings forward another question which bears on the subject. It gives power to county councils and borough councils to publish the results of the analyses they have made, and this brings up a point which I think is very much needed. Whereas local authorities are restricted in bringing the law to bear upon manufacturers of feeding stuffs and manures, there is no power to control the analyses and the advertisements which are put forward by these traders. I think this is a point of very great importance. There was the case, alluded to by the noble Lord, where the analysis showed the presence of 40 per cent. of sawdust. In that particular case the manufacturer gave the amount of carbohydrates that he said were capable of assimilation. Had he been required to use the words "digestible carbohydrates" there would have been no doubt that his analysis would have been wrong. Very probably the material that was used in this compound was quite capable of being assimilated by the animal eating it, but a great portion of it was of no possible use as a feeding stuff. The manufacturer has this advantage, that he has nobody to say what form his analysis, his description of the stuff, shall take. On the other hand, the county councils and borough councils who are interested in the matter are unable to publish the analyses which they have made and which could be set alongside the advertisements so as to warn the buyer as to the true substance of the material he was buying. I think, therefore, that this clause would be exceptionally useful to county councils.<lb/>
<col>980</col>
Another point which was raised before the Departmental Committee was that the seller of seeds and the manufacturer of food stuffs and manures should be allowed to have the use of the analysis of the county council for the purpose of the sale of his article. It appears to me, if a county council is to have the power of publishing the result of its analysis of the food stuffs, that that should be as useful to the seller of a good article as it is a check upon the man who is selling inferior goods. I see no reason why the good seller should not make use of it. For these reasons I think that the Bill is one which may be of very great use to agriculture, and I hope that the House will consent to its being read a second time, and such faults in regard to detail as there may be in it can be considered in Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01535"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am certain that your Lordships will be disposed to agree that the noble Lord who introduced this Bill has explained this somewhat unintelligible Bill with a great deal of clearness. I was very glad to hear him say that the Bill was in no way a declaration of war against the traders. That, of course, we readily understand. He spoke of the veto of the Board of Agriculture as regards prosecutions, and told us that in his opinion, and in the opinion of the great agricultural corporation that he so worthily represents, county and borough councils are the proper persons to exercise this right independently of the Board of Agriculture, and I must say that he put his case very fairly indeed. I am bound to admit that feeling runs very high the other way, and for the protection of traders&#x2014;and no one wants to interfere with the legitimate protection of traders&#x2014;the opinion is held that there should be some sort of veto on account of the difference of opinion that exists among legal representatives as to whether a prosecution would or would not stand.<lb/>
The noble Lord also spoke of the very technical question of the limits of error, and I hope he will not at this stage wish me to follow him into that. He also mentioned a subject which I hoped, in my heart of hearts, he would have left alone, and that was the well-known case in which a feeding stuff was found to have over 40 per cent. of sawdust, and in connection with which the county council not unnaturally wished to prosecute the trader. I was, however,
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0495"/>
<col>981</col>
able to persuade myself, and what was much more important to persuade noble Lords opposite some years ago, that this sawdust was not sawdust at all, that it had been changed by some chemical process into what I think was called cellulose, and that it was an absorbent of sugar and therefore a very proper food for agriculturists to feed their cattle upon. I shall not again inflict my reasons upon the House, but I hope your Lordships will be satisfied with the undoubted proof that I was able to show that stuff containing 40 per cent. of sawdust may be a very admirable food for cattle.<lb/>
The noble Lord's Bill proposes to amend the Act of 1906, which amended the Act of 1903. That Act put a stop to the mal-practices in trading by which farmers were robbed, and it induced farmers to realise the importance of getting information as to the nature of the fertilisers and feeding stuffs they used, and for this purpose to encourage analysis by competent public analysts; but I do not say in any way that the Act is perfect. Everything, of course, in life can be improved, and if it can be shown that further steps can be taken without injustice and dislocating legitimate trade, the Board which I have the honour to represent will, of course, be only too glad to avail themselves of them. This is a very technical Bill and is bound to be most hotly opposed by traders. I have no opposition on behalf of His Majesty's Government to offer to the Second Reading of this Bill, but I earnestly hope that the noble Lord will consent to its being sent to a Select Committee to have the rough edges rubbed off it. I think if that course were adopted some of the opposition at any rate of the traders would be removed, and the Bill would have a much better chance of passing through Parliament. I therefore hope that the noble Lord will consent to that proposal, which I make, not in any way to stop the passage of his Bill through this House, but only with the wish that our Act may be brought noire into harmony with agricultural interests.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01536"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to speak at any length on this subject, which has been dealt with so fully by experts, but I would express the strong hope that the Minister for Agriculture will not put his foot down in Committee, if this Bill goes to a Select Committee, in resisting the efforts of county councils for the removal of the Board's veto. I must say I thought
<col>982</col>
the noble Earl was the last person I should find championing a veto. I do not think, however well placed the veto may be otherwise, that there is any reason why the great county councils, on whom the responsibility of assisting farmers within their county areas depends, should not have the right of decision in respect of these prosecutions. The analyst is appointed with the consent of the Board of Agriculture; and I maintain that the committees which direct and control agricultural matters in the county councils are just as fitted as the officials of the Board of Agriculture to decide tins-question. Yes, every bit as fitted, and perhaps in their own locality a little more fitted. The noble Earl says legal opinions differ. Of course they differ. The county councils may make mistakes. Let them make mistakes and learn. I have often seen your Lordships entranced by the witching eloquence of the noble Earl the Minister for Agriculture. I had not the good fortune to be present when he persuaded you all that sawdust was the most natural food for cattle. The Board of Agriculture found that out. If it is true, let the county councils find it out for themselves. But I do not think they will take it, not having the opportunity of hearing the noble Earl, on his authority. Therefore, I hope that when the. Bill goes to the Select Committee the Board will not assume a degree of infallibility in respect to this veto. Every one who takes part in county business knows how thoroughly competent are the men who deal with these matters on the county councils, and the less centralisation there is in these things the better.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01537"><member>LORD WENLOCK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend who has just spoken appears to be in some doubt as to the action which will be taken in future by the President of the Board of Agriculture in regard to the provision in this Bill giving back to county and borough councils the power to initiate prosecutions. But from what the noble Earl the Minister for Agriculture said, I understood that he was going to offer no objection to this part of the Bill. [EARL CARRINGTON nodded assent.] I am glad the noble Earl consents. Therefore the fears mentioned by the noble Earl who has just spoken are not likely to be justified. I have had an opportunity in my county of seeing a great many of these questions brought before the various committees, and I can assure the noble Earl that it has been the greatest disappointment to them that
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0496"/>
<col>983</col>
he has refused on several occasions to consent to prosecutions in what they believed to be extremely strong cases against fraudulent traders. The result has been that in many cases the committees who deal with these matters have felt that it is useless sending any more applications to the Board of Agriculture, and therefore a certain number of what we believe to be absolutely fraudulent transactions have taken place and the farmers have suffered. I would press on the noble Earl that his special business is to protect the interests of the farmers and agriculturists. I think the traders are strong enough to look after themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01538"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to thank the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture for the sympathy he has extended to this measure. I am anxious to get the Bill passed, but to do that I must have the assistance of His Majesty's Government. The noble Earl has suggested the reference of the Bill to a Select Committee. I should regret that, because it would mean delay; but if the noble Earl is prepared to set up a Committee with a full reference to it I would not put any objection in the way, because I am willing that the traders' objections should be perfectly fairly considered. We do not want to steal a march upon them. We believe that we have given them every protection in this Bill, and we have not asked for more than the agriculturists of this country are entitled to obtain. As I say, if your Lordships desire that the Bill should go to a Select Committee I would offer no objection.</membercontribution></p>

<title>REMOVAL OF A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01540"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government whether their attention had been called to the removal of Mr. Caldicott from the Commission of the Peace for the City of Worcester, and to call attention to the circumstances attending his removal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01541">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I think it my duty to ask your Lordships to listen for a few minutes to what I am afraid is a very ugly story. I do so with the most profound respect for the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, and underlying a
<col>984</col>
great deal of what I am going to say is a desire to protect him and his successors from a recurrence of the kind of thing which I am going to relate to the House. Mr. Caldicott is a well-known and respected inhabitant of the city of Worcester. He is an old and tried public servant of that city, and has been on the town council for twenty-eight years and a magistrate of the city for nineteen years. At the beginning of this month&#x2014;I think on May 2, as the letter is dated May 1&#x2014;he received this letter from the Lord Chancellor's secretary&#x2014;
<quote>"I am desired by the Lord Chancellor to inform you that his Lordship, acting on the advice of the Advisory Committee recently appointed to deal with the Commission of the Peace for Worcester City in accordance with the recommendation of the Royal Commission on the Selection of Justices, has given directions for the removal of your name from the Commission on the ground of non-attendance."</quote>
We know that from time to time Justices are removed from the Commission of the Peace on the ground of non-attendance. We also know that before this is done it is usual for the gentlemen whom it is proposed to remove to receive some intimation from the Lord Chancellor that their removal is about to be effected. In this case the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, following the usual precedent, caused to be written to Mr. Caldicott a letter advising him of his intention, but owing to some mistake that letter was never sent; it was not put into the post. But that is not the point on which I desire to lay particular stress.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01542">We need not enter at any length into Mr. Caldicott's qualifications as a Justice of the Peace. It is quite true that he has not attended on the Bench very often, but this has been due to other work. I will ask your Lordships to listen to the defence which Mr. Caldicott makes for his non-attendance&#x2014;
<quote>"My excuse for non-attendance is that I have been busily engaged on corporation work pretty well every day of my life &#x2026; I had to neglect something or give up business altogether, and I thought the work I was engaged on was more important in the interests of the city than sitting on the Bench, which was never short of a magistrate during my time, and I have often provided a substitute when impossible to go."</quote>
If non-attendance was the only plea for the removal of Mr. Caldicott, it is quite clear that a great many other gentlemen, including the noble Earl who sits on the Front Government Bench, Lord Beauchamp, ought also to have been removed on the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0497"/>
<col>985</col>
ground of non-attendance. The noble Earl can contradict me if he is in a position to do so, but I am informed that, although he has been a magistrate of the city of Worcester for, I think, fourteen years, he has attended but a very few times, and has not sat on the Bench at all since 1906. I am not finding fault with him on that ground, but if non-attendance is to be the ground for removal then the noble Earl, equally with this unfortunate gentleman, is open to that charge.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01543">Mr. Caldicott is a strong supporter of the Conservative Party, and my deliberate suggestion is, whether or not his removal was of an invidious character, that it at least has in the public eye that appearance to a considerable extent. So much so, that Mr. Caldicott's removal was very strongly resented by his fellow magistrates and by all his fellow-citizens. When they heard that he had been removed from the Bench public opinion would not stand it. Indignation meetings were held, and following upon that, though I do not say as a result, Mr. Caldicott's name was reinstated by the Lord Chancellor. The noble and learned Lord wrote to Mr. Caldicott reinstating him on the Bench, and I should like, with your Lordships' permission, to read the Lord Chancellor's letter, because the sequence of these letters is really important to an examination of the ease. The Lord Chancellor's secretary wrote on May 8&#x2014;
<quote>"I am directed by the Lord Chancellor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 6. His Lordship has looked into the business and thinks there has been a misapprehension. It is a pity that you did not receive the letter which I wrote to you on April 10. &#x2026; At the same time, the Lord Chancellor will replace your name on the roll. No one has ever made any suggestion against you personally, and it was only in the belief that you were unable to attend to Justices' business that your name was removed."</quote>
This letter, which the Lord Chancellor intimated could be made public by Mr. Caldicott, if he so desired, in order to show that no reflection had been intended, is only another instance of the invariable fairness and courtesy always extended by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack to those with whom he comes in contact, though I do not think that in this matter he has received at all times the assistance he might have received from his political friends. The point I put is that if a few days after the removal of this gentleman it was necessary to reinstate him, then his removal
<col>986</col>
cannot have been altogether a just or proper proceeding.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01544">But it is not so touch the fact of Mr. Caldicott's name being removed from the Bench that I desire to call attention to. What I want to direct public attention to is the manner in which his removal was effected. These Advisory Committees for the purpose of advising the Lord Chancellor with regard to the appointment of Justices are, I believe, appointed in the counties on the combined suggestion of himself and the Lord-Lieutenant of the county. I am not aware what the particular machinery is, but what the country wishes to see is that those who are responsible for recommendations of this kind shall not be grouped into bodies which have a distinctly political bias. The Advisory Committee in the city of Worcester is constituted as follows: First there is Lord Beauchamp, whose appointment to the committee it would be an impertinence in me to criticise except to say that he is, and quite rightly from Iris own point of view, the leading Radical in the place and chairman of the Radical Party there. The next name is that of Mr. Fairbairn. His appointment as a member of the Advisory Committee caused very serious thoughts. Mr. Fairbairn was at one time, and I believe is now&#x2014;I stand open to contradiction if I am overstating the case&#x2014;the paid agent of the Radical Party in Worcester, and he was at one time the Radical candidate for the city of Worcester. The third name is that of Mr. Evans, also a leading Radical of the city of Worcester. Then there is the Mayor, who is supposed to have, and I suppose has, officially no politics at all; and then there is a Mr. Allsopp, who was, I believe, at one time a Conservative candidate for Parliament, but who is now looked upon by his friends and acquaintances as something like a Socialist. But it does not matter very much what he is, because he never goes near the Advisory Committee at all. Noble Lords laugh, but this is no laughing matter. What I wish to place before you is that this Committee has a distinct political bias. But that, again, is not really the point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01545">Even if this Committee had been properly consulted with regard to the removal of Mr. Caldicott's name from the Bench, the removal would not have become a matter of notoriety; but I have material at my disposal to prove that two members of the Committee were not consulted at all with
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0498"/>
<col>987</col>
regard to the removal, and this is the <i>crux</i> of the whole matter. Both of these gentlemen say that the first thing they heard of Mr. Caldicott's removal was when they saw the announcement in the public Press. Mr. Evans, one of the members of the Committee to whom I have referred, wrote to Mr. Caldicott on May 4&#x2014;
<quote>"You are under a wrong impression in thinking that I have been in any way a party to the removal of your name from the list of magistrates. I, of course, saw the announcement in the newspapers, but until the receipt of your letter to-day I thought the removal of your name was made at your own request."</quote>
Here is another letter, a most remarkable one, from the Mayor of Worcester, who is a member of the Advisory Committee. He wrote to Mr. Caldicott as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"The first intimation I had that your name had been removed from the Commission of the Peace was the announcement in the public Press. I have only been asked to attend one meeting of the Advisory Committee for this city, and at that meeting no recommendation was made that your name should be removed from the Commission. If such a proposal had been made I should have strenuously opposed it.&#x2014;Yours faithfully, E. THOMAS, Mayor."</quote>
I think I have said enough to show the kind of thing which must have taken place. The impression which must be left on our minds, and on the minds of anybody who has followed the sequence of the story, is that Lord Beauchamp and Mr. Fairbairn were, by the process of elimination, the only two members of the committee who were privy to the recommendation that Mr. Caldicott should be removed from the Bench; and without wishing to overstate the matter&#x2014;because you cannot get rid of the suggestion that a letter was sent by one or other of those gentlemen to the Lord Chancellor advising him to remove Mr. Caldicott's name&#x2014;there must have been a letter from those two members of the Advisory Committee purporting to come from the Advisory Committee as a whole. It may be that I misstate the terms of that letter, but I cannot be very far out because we have the letter of the Lord Chancellor, dated May 1, in which he said that in removing Mr. Caldicott's name he was "acting on the advice of the Advisory Committee." As I ventured to remark just now, this constitutes a very unpleasant episode, and the best way, if the noble Earl opposite desires to clear it up, is for him to produce the letter which was written to the Lord Chancellor purporting to come from the Advisory Committee. I do beg that
<col>988</col>
in the public interest both Houses of Parliament and the public may have an opportunity of seeing this letter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01546">I have ventured to bring this matter forward, my Lords, because there has been a great deal of suspicion, and after what has happened to Mr. Caldicott a great deal of well-grounded suspicion, with regard to the manner in which the Lord Chancellor is being advised as to the creation and removal of magistrates; and I trust that Parliament at no distant date will see fit to go into the whole matter of these Advisory Committees in order that the Lord Chancellor and his successors may have protection in the future from what at least is a very irregular manner of conducting the public services of this country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01547"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have not the smallest complaint to make of the noble Lord for bringing forward this or any other subject relating to the administration of my office. The suggestion is that there has been some political bias, and that an injustice has been perpetrated of which I must be apparently the innocent instrument. The facts are these. The names of two gentlemen were removed from the roll under a misapprehension. One was the gentleman referred to, Mr. Caldicott, and the other was a gentleman who I believe is a Liberal. I think I am right in saying that he is a Liberal. The noble Lord has only referred to the case of the gentleman who happens to be a Conservative. It was a misapprehension which would not have happened but for the miscarriage of a letter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01548"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to interrupt the noble and learned Lord, but my information, which he will have ample opportunity of testing, is that at the same time that Mr. Caldicott was removed three other gentlemen were also removed. One of them is an undischarged bankrupt, one has unfortunately lost his reason, and the third was removed entirely at his own request and on his own initiative.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01549"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: That only shows the delicacy and difficulty of the duty which I have to discharge in regard to putting magistrates on and removing magistrates from the Bench. As I have said, two gentlemen were removed under a
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0499"/>
<col>989</col>
misapprehension, one of whom is a Liberal and the other a Conservative. Both names were restored, and in the case of neither would there have been anything of the kind had it not been for the miscarriage of a letter, a thing that may happen in any department or in any business. The only ground of removal in the case of the two gentlemen I have referred to was the belief that they would not be able in future to discharge the duties of a Justice of the Peace. Immediately I ascertained that a mistake had been made I sent the same day to Worcester for the Commission roll, which was sent to me by return of post, and I instantly reinstated the names of these two gentlemen. I never heard anything about anxiety and unrest in the city of Worcester on the subject at the time. At least I do not think I did. I only learned that a mistake had been made, and it was instantly rectified. I did not know whether Mr. Caldicott was a Conservative or a Liberal, and I did not care. From the beginning to the end no one has ever suggested to me, either by letter or by word of mouth or otherwise, any single word against the character or standing of these two gentlemen, and the only ground considered was that to which I have referred. As soon as I knew what had happened I wrote a letter to the gentleman in question saying that he had been reinstated and that he might use the letter publicly, if he was so pleased, to show that no sort of reflection had been intended. If the noble Lord wishes to convey that members of the committee had done or said anything unfriendly or offensive to this gentleman, I can assure him that there is no foundation for it.<lb/>
With regard to the composition of these committees, I would like to <i>say</i> that I have to appoint, on the recommendaton of the Royal Commission, committees in ninety-eight counties and 227 boroughs. In some counties more than one committee has to be appointed, and in London I expect there will be at least fifteen. I have to get the information from the best sources I can, and I believe the committees are so appointed as to give no partiality to any one person on account of his political opinions. Just consider the delicacy of the work that has to be done when not merely the names of persons who are taken off or put on the roll, but the names of the committees are to be brought forward in Parliament and canvassed. I do not know how it is possible to carry on a business of this kind
<col>990</col>
under a perpetual bombardment of criticism of that kind. In point of fact I believe that on the committees that have been appointed there is practically an equality. I get the best and most suitable men in the particular place. In this case there were three Liberals and two Conservatives. I ascertained that before I appointed them. Probably in the next borough there would be three Conservatives and two Liberals. But this is not a question of voting. Any committee-man who is dissatisfied with what proceeds can come to me, and if anything is wrong I will investigate the matter as I did in this case and set it right. I do not rely upon numerical relations at all, and it is not unfair that there should be three of one side and two of another.<lb/>
As to the removal of names, I am sure the noble Lord has read the Report of the Royal Commission, or he may consult some of the Lords Lieutenant sitting around him and they will tell him that it is most undesirable that the Commission roll should be encumbered by a number of names of men who are absent or quite incapable of discharging the duty, or by gentlemen who regard the office as a decoration instead of as a duty. I will leave any man who knows the subject to judge. I am sorry to say that no one can know this subject so well as I do, unless it be my predecessor, who has to perform the most weary and trying duty in the face of constantly conflicting opinion of supplying the Benches of England, Scotland, and Wales with an adequate number of magistrates. Anybody who knows the difficulties will know that the only method of preventing ultimate corruption is by obtaining efficient local advice which can be given by impartial local committees. I cannot impart to any human being the experience which has led me to that conclusion, but experience led to the same conclusion those who investigated the matter in the Royal Commission, consisting of sixteen men of great experience who were absolutely unanimous on this point.<lb/>
I do not in the least regret that the noble Lord has brought this subject forward, and I thank him for the kindly expressions which he used towards myself. But let me remind him that there are enemies of the system of Advisory Committees&#x2014;I am not speaking of the House of Commons or of Members of Parliament, for I should never think of being guilty of such a discourtesy&#x2014;but all
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0500"/>
<col>991</col>
over the country there are many persons who are anxious to see this system fail, because hitherto the appointment of magistrates in some parts of the country has been treated as a matter of political reward and has been thought to be used by both sides in political life as an instrument and weapon in political controversy. It is that which I have always condemned and sought to avert and always will seek to avert as long as I retain my present position. I ask the noble Lord, who I am sure will sympathise with my view, to consider that the kind of criticism which he has brought forward about an accidental misapprehension relating to a single man is the very sort of weapon which will be made use of outside Parliament by those who are hostile to the reform which has been undertaken in the interests of purity in the administration of justice.<lb/>
If I am alone with a single secretary living in London, with no possible knowledge of the different parts of the country, and if I am deprived of the information and advice, given always in confidence&#x2014;a confidence which I would never betray under any circumstances&#x2014;which I am able to obtain from local committees, what chance have I of preventing the appointment of magistrates from degenerating into a mere question of reward for and incentive to political services? I hope I have answered the observations that were made by the noble Lord, and I trust that he will feel that it is desirable in the public interest that these committees should prosper and should be encouraged. I believe that all dissatisfaction will, in the course of a short time or within two or three years, disappear if only I have access to impartial, fair, honest local opinion, not only from Lords Lieutenant, who have always given me their honest opinion and the best advice in their power, but from those who move about among the people in the neighbourhoods concerned and are able to interpret their feelings and desires.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01550"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise mainly for the purpose of assuring your Lordships that nothing is further from the thoughts of those who sit in this part of the House, and I am sure nothing is further from the thoughts of my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke, than to make any complaint of the conduct of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, either in regard to this particular
<col>992</col>
incident or in regard to the manner in which he has dealt with the whole of this important question of the selection of Justices. That duty is, as he truly said a moment ago, a most delicate and difficult duty, and I am sure that every one of us must feel that in his efforts to discharge that duty dispassionately he deserves the full sympathy of every member of the House. But, my Lords, in this particular case it is evident from what has fallen from the noble and learned Lord that a misapprehension arose, and as soon as that misapprehension was discovered the noble and learned Lord at once corrected it, and, judging from the terms of the letter which was read to the House by my noble friend, corrected it in a very full and handsome manner.<lb/>
But while I say that we have no complaint whatever to make of the noble and learned Lord, I cannot help saying that I think the noble and learned Lord has some complaint to make of the manner in which he has been served in connection with this transaction. It is to be remembered that in the first letter read to the House by my noble friend, the secretary to the Lord Chancellor states distinctly that the removal of Mr. Caldicott from the Bench had been "recommended by the Advisory Committee." We have yet to learn by whom and in what form that recommendation reached the noble and learned Lord. He will, I am sure, not be surprised that we should watch the operation of this new system of Advisory Committees not only with interest but with some slight measure of anxiety. We are all anxious that this experiment should succeed, and we shall none of us spare any pains in order to make it succeed. We recognise that it is desirable that these committees should, so far as may be, be constituted upon the most impartial basis possible. I say so far as may be, because we most of us realise that it is difficult in a case of this kind to balance with mathematical precision the different elements of which an Advisory Committee may be composed. But it does seem to me essential, if the new system is to work that each member of these Advisory Committees should have a full and sufficient opportunity of making his views known either in regard to the appointment of a magistrate or in regard to the removal of a magistrate; and I must say that my noble friend seemed to me to establish clearly that in this particular instance the members of the Advisory Committee did not have the full and
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0501"/>
<col>993</col>
sufficient opportunity to which they were entitled. He quoted to the House the names of several members of the Committee who distinctly state that they took no part whatever in the recommendation with regard to Mr. Caldicott. That really is, to my mind, the only weak point in the case. There was what purported to be a communication from the Advisory Committee to the noble and learned Lord, and we should like very much to know, if we can be told, what form that communication took. When I say this I trust I shall not be understood as suggesting that the procedure of these committees should be of too rigid or formal a character. In my view their proceedings should, on the contrary, be informal, confidential, and as little as possible impeded by anything in the nature of red tape. But I do hold very strongly that the consultation of the Committees should be an effectual consultation, and, as I said a moment ago, there does seem some reason for supposing that in this particular instance the consultation was not of the full and complete character to which members of the Committee, were entitled.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01551"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack will have heard with very much satisfaction the expression of the noble Marquess who has just sat down, that these Advisory Committees should in future meet with success, but I share the fear of the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack that if discussions of this kind become frequent the success of these commitees will be very gravely imperilled. In the first place, let me touch on one of the points raised by the noble Lord&#x2014;the point about the composition of the committee of which I have the honour to be chairman. He told your Lordships, quite correctly, that on that committtee sat the last Radical candidate for the representation of the city of Worcester. He is universally respected, and I think the oldest magistrate representing that interest in politics. On the other side there was the present Mayor, who is a Conservative and always has been a Conservative. Then there is Mr. Percy Allsopp. It is with some difficulty that one speaks of the personalities of people and it is not a pleasant thing to do, but I think your Lordships will agree that the Allsopps are generally members of the Tory Party and I have never had any reason to suppose that this gentleman is
<col>994</col>
any exception. I noticed that on Saturday last his nephew, Lord Hindlip, speaking in Worcester, expressed the opinion that the Liberal Party were pests who ought to be swept altogether from this country. I can quite understand that he would say that of his political opponents, but I cannot imagine that he would say it of so near a relative as his uncle, and I confess I feel convinced that Mr. Percy Allsopp is a member of the Conservative Party.<lb/>
As to the proceedings of the Advisory Committee, here I confess I find myself in a difficulty created by the noble Marquess opposite, who expressed the opinion that the proceedings of the committees should be of a confidential nature. Yet I am asked for an explanation as to the proceedings in this case. Let me suggest to the noble Marquess that it is not easy to combine proceedings of that nature with a full explanation. On the present occasion I am glad that I can, without violating what took place at the meeting of the committee, say sufficient to make the position clear. An Advisory Committee never recommend the removal of a magistrate, and are not asked in any circumstances to do so. What they are asked to do is to inform the Lord Chancellor whether any Justice ought to be requested to resign. The noble and learned Lord has explained the unfortunate mistake that occurred in this case. The letters sent to the two gentlemen in question never reached them, and I think it says something at any rate for the impartiality of the committee that on this occasion they should have treated a Liberal and a Conservative in exactly the same way. The mistake arose, as I have said, through a letter sent to these gentlemen never reaching them, and as soon as the mistake was brought to his notice the noble and learned Lord restored the two names to the Commission roll. That seems to me to have been a very generous and fair step, and one for which the noble and learned Lord deserves every credit. In these circumstances noble Lords opposite will not be surprised if I say that I do not think the question would have been raised if it had not happened that the friend of the noble Lord who introduced it was a member of his own Party.</membercontribution></p>

<col>995</col>
raised this whole question of the appointment of magistrates, that we have not felt very strongly about it. The reason we have not raised it is that we did not think we should be of any assistance to him if we did. For the same reason we have made no comment upon what has been said by certain gentlemen elsewhere, and for the same reason I make no comment to-night. But I am glad of this opportunity of giving an illustration of how utterly different is the working of the system which the noble and learned Lord has inaugurated from what, so far as I can judge from their utterances in other places, certain gentlemen believe it to be. As far as I can understand, they think that the noble and learned Lord, the Lords Lieutenant, and the Advisory Committees are in a conspiracy to put as many Tories on the Bench as possible and to keep off as many Radicals as possible. I happen to be able to give an illustration, of no interest whatever except as an illustration, of how this system is really working. I wrote to my Lord Lieutenant at the end of last year asking him to put my son, who is now a member of the other House of Parliament, on the Commission of the Peace. The Lord Lieutenant replied that the Lord Chancellor had requested him to make no recommendations at all until the Advisory Committee had been appointed and was in working order, and then only to make such recommendations as the Advisory Committee would join with him in presenting to the Lord Chancellor. I need hardly tell your Lordships that I was wholly satisfied with that reply. My son has never yet been appointed. I make no kind of complaint of that, and I leave the matter with the utmost confidence in the hands of my Lord Lieutenant, the Advisory Committee, and the noble and learned Lord.</membercontribution></p>

<title>TRAWLING SECTION OF THE NAVAL RESERVE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01554"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HENEAGE</member> rose to call attention to the new Naval Reserve scheme (Trawling Section), and to ask His Majesty's Government what steps have been taken by the Admiralty to enrol fishermen in the new Naval Reserve at the Humber ports, and whether it is true that their efforts have failed to obtain a sufficient number of men either at Grimsby or Hull.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01555">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I put this Question on the Paper about a fortnight ago in consequence of a reply given
<col>996</col>
by the First Lord of the Admiralty to Lord Charles Beresford in another place which those of us connected with the fishing industry considered rather misleading and somewhat unfair to the fishermen of Grimsby, as it seemed to imply that they were wanting in loyalty and patriotism although it was no fault of their own that they had not come forward to join this new trawling section of the Naval Reserve. Mr. McKenna, in his reply, said that recruiting had only taken place for a short time and that there were other ports than Grimsby at which they could get fishermen. A fortnight has now intervened since I put the Question on the Paper, and in that time I have been sent a good deal of information from various parts of England. I find that in November last a circular which I hold in my hand was issued by the Board of Admiralty, or rather by the Board of Trade on behalf of the Board of Admiralty, containing the conditions of service for those who desired to enrol in the trawling section of the Royal Naval Reserve, and the pay and advantages. I also have here a letter which was issued early in the present year by the Superintendent of the Board of Trade at Grimsby, and which takes the character of what I suppose the Home Secretary would call a little "ginger." He wrote to ask the owners to put pressure on the men to join this Reserve, but, notwithstanding this, up to the beginning of May only eleven men had enrolled at Grimsby and none at Hull or any other of the English ports. I make an exception with regard to Aberdeen, because a good many have joined at Aberdeen, but the circumstances of trawling there are very different from what they are where men go into the North Sea for six weeks at a time. During the last fortnight six trawlers whose crews were to be the men the Admiralty are looking for have been at Grimsby, and during that time they have got some fifteen or sixteen more men and have been able to send two boats, the "Seamew" and the "Sea-flower," to sea, but with regard to the rest they were there without any crews at all up to the end of last week.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01556">I ask, Whose fault is this? I am quite certain, after thirty years' experience of the fishermen of this country, that they are as loyal and patriotic as any other body of men, and that if their services are wanted and the conditions are fair they will come forward and enrol. Therefore I say it is
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0503"/>
<col>997</col>
not the fault of the fishermen. If the Board of Admiralty had, instead of working through a sub-department of the Board of Trade, obtained the assistance of the Sea Fisheries Department and the associations in connection with it, I am quite certain that the whole thing would have gone smoothly and the right men would have been forthcoming. But they did not consult any one connected with the trade. They tried first of all to work it themselves through the Board of Trade and then through the masters. I should like to remind the representative of the Admiralty in this House that the people they call the masters are simply the directors of the various fishery companies at the different ports. At Grimsby there are only two private owners. The whole of the ships belong to companies, and the men who manage them are mere directors and have as little influence over the seamen as the directors of any large industrial company have over the men in their employ. I hope His Majesty's Government will not think that I am trying to run down this scheme. I am as anxious as anybody to help it forward, but I want the Admiralty to get the right men and the best men.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01557">The right men to get are the skippers, who have all the power over the men and to whom they look for advice. Now it is a condition of this scheme that no skipper shall be enrolled who is over thirty-five years of age. All the best skippers, the men who go to the North Sea, to the Faroe Islands, and who went to the White Sea before it was closed, are over thirty-five years of age, and not being able to enrol themselves they discourage the second hands and the men who serve with them from enrolling either. You may say, Why don't the men act as they like? It is a very serious matter for the men to go against their skippers. The boats go out for six weeks at a time to fish, and if men remained at home in order to do eight days' training they would find at the end of the training that their places had been filled up, that they had annoyed their skippers and would not be taken on again by them. The result is you wilt not get the best men unless you first of all enrol the skippers. I am glad to see my noble friend Lord Nunburnholme in his place, because I am sure he will agree with me on this matter and will be able to speak with greater influence with the Government than I can. The Admiralty have twenty-
<col>998</col>
seven men at Grimsby, but they had eleven enrolled before May I. The rest have been enrolled during the last week, but they are the men who were left behind when all the fleets went out to the North Sea, and therefore they are not the best men.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01558">There is another complaint. In the conditions of enrolment for recruits for the trawler section it is laid down by the Admiralty that when called out by Royal Proclamation for service they should not only be liable to serve on trawlers for which they enrolled, but be under obligation to serve also on such service as the Admiralty may direct. That is to say, because a man has patriotically enrolled to serve on board a trawler for the particular service for which he is to be trained, that on being called up by Royal Proclamation he is to be liable to be called upon to serve on a submarine, a torpedo boat, a merchant vessel, or anywhere else. These men say they are quite ready to enrol for the service for which they are asked to serve, but that they are not ready to enrol to be at the disposal of the Admiralty for any service upon which they choose to send them. Then I ant informed that the men of the Naval Reserve, of whom we have some 200 at Grimsby, will not volunteer for the trawler section because, if they do, they will be deprived of their right to a pension. I must say I do not quite understand that, but this information is sent to me as a definite condition which prevents them from joining. So far as I am concerned, my object is to give the Admiralty every assistance I can as one who has been for a long time connected with fishermen. I am certain that they will not get the best men unless they alter the conditions in some respect&#x2014;they may get casuals or unemployed men, but they cannot get the best men. I beg to ask the Question standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01559"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the criticisms which the noble Lord has made are, I think, entirely justifiable, but I would point out that the scheme under consideration only started at the beginning of the year and it is early days to criticise it adversely. It is hard to explain why this scheme has been such a success at Aberdeen, but according to the latest figures we have there already trained 116 men, and we have another forty ready
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0504"/>
<col>999</col>
for training. The noble Lord is perfectly right in what he said as regards Grimsby and the Humber ports. Our scheme there has not been so successful as we desired it to be, and a few days ago we sent to Grimsby Captain Greatrex, who has undertaken the management of this particular scheme. He has sent a report which is before me now on the whole matter. He states that he has consulted with all the interests at Grimsby, and as far as he is able to ascertain they are, with one exception, all in favour of the scheme. He saw the secretaries of several of the skippers' associations, the enginemen's union, the deckhands' and trimmers' union, as well as several owners. The noble Lord seems to think that the great difficulty in getting these men is that we refuse to take skippers of an age about thirty-five. The period of service which we desire these men to serve is twenty years, and the view of the Admiralty was that after the age of fifty-five the services which these trawler skippers would be called upon to do would be of too arduous a nature. They thought that, if the age limit was raised to forty-five, by the time the man finished his service, which would be at the age of sixty-five, he would not be of very much value to the Admiralty. The noble Lord also touched on the question of long cruises. He said that at Grimsby the conditions were somewhat different from those at Aberdeen, and that at Grimsby the trawlers went out for six weeks or over, which is not the case at Aberdeen. I questioned Captain Greatrex on that point, and he tells me that the men who go on voyages of three, four, and six weeks are a very small proportion indeed, and that that fact would hardly affect the success of the scheme in any way. Another criticism raised by my noble friend was as to liability to serve in the Fleet in the case of the Naval Reserve being called up. We are perfectly willing to modify that liability, and we propose to delete the words "on such service as the Admiralty may direct." The paragraph would then read&#x2014;
<quote>"All ranks and ratings will be liable to serve in steam-trawlers when the Naval Reserve are called out by Royal Proclamation."</quote>
That limits trawler skippers and trawler men to serve in trawlers and not in any other ships.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01560"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: Unless they choose to volunteer?</membercontribution></p>
<col>1000</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01561"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: Yes. There are, I think, something like 160 available skippers between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-five at Grimsby. I can assure my noble friend that there is no suggestion of questioning in any way the loyalty of Grimsby. That was the last thing Mr. McKenna wished to convey in the answer he gave in the other House. The Admiralty are very anxious that this scheme should be a success, and are willing in every way to consider the views of persons interested in the trawling industry. At the same time the scheme is so much in its infancy that they are not desirous of changing the age limit at the moment, and I think my noble friend will agree that the scheme should be given a few months longer trial before any definite decision is come to with regard to further modifications in the regulations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01562"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl stated, in his reply, that this scheme only started at the beginning of the year, but I hold in my hand Admiralty regulations regarding skippers, second hands, and enginemen dated October 10, so that the scheme has been for some time in operation, and I am very glad to hear that the Admiralty intend to go on with this scheme and are prepared to make considerable alterations in the regulations. Skippers are entered for a period of five years, and if suitable they may re-engage for another period of five years and so on until they have served for twenty years. This puts the limit of age at fifty-five for men entering at thirty-five. After twenty years' service a skipper is to receive a discharge gratuity of &#x00A3;60. The Admiralty might consider whether a skipper should not be allowed to enter at forty and do fifteen years' service, or at forty-five and do ten years' service, and then be given a proportionate gratuity on attaining the age of fifty-five. Skippers entering at twenty-five might be allowed to make six re-engagements for five years and to serve for thirty years instead of only twenty. Why should not fifty-five years remain the limit of age in all cases? A discharge gratuity of &#x00A3;50 is to be given to all second hands on completion of twenty years' service, but the men who enter at the age of twenty-six and are discharged on attaining the age of forty-five after completing nineteen years service will apparently get nothing at all. Surely the discharge gratuity ought to be made more
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0505"/>
<col>1001</col>
proportionate to the number of years served. The Admiralty, too, might consider whether there should be hard-and-fast regulations for all ports or whether local circumstances should not be taken into consideration and different regulations be issued for different ports; also whether the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve could not assist in the work.<lb/>
It would be a great misfortune if the attempts of the Admiralty to have the mine-sweeping round our coasts in war time carried out by trawlers manned by Reserve fishermen should end in failure. If this work is undertaken by local men it will set free for other service large numbers of seamen who would be more usefully employed on board our seagoing fleets. I may add that I do not think it necessary that the whole of the crews of the trawlers should be fishermen. I believe that the dangers of mine-sweeping in small vessels have been greatly exaggerated, especially when compared with the dangers incurred by large ships. Their midship section is much smaller, and besides at high water they will in many cases be able to go over mines without touching them. The rise and fall of tide during neap tides at the mouth of our harbours on our North Sea coasts is about ten feet, and generally more. Now if a mine is laid with a length of cable which will cause it to float ten feet below the waterline at high water, that mine would be visible at low water, and easily destroyed. At high water any trawler drawing less than ten feet would pass over it in safety, whereas a mine so placed might destroy a Dreadnought drawing thirty-one feet. Spring tides are, of course, higher, and the trawler would get the advantage of them. Then as mine-sweeping is carried out by means of a specially prepared hawser between two vessels, there is always a second vessel ready to pick up the crew of the damaged trawler. In my opinion fishermen would run more risk when going through the unwept entrances of their harbours for the purpose of fishing than in actual mine-sweeping. Besides, if an enemy is raiding the North Sea a good many fishermen will remain unemployed.<lb/>
It appears that both skippers and second hands are afraid of losing their employment if they take intermittent service under the Admiralty. I can easily understand that owners of vessels object to having their crews broken up at intervals for training in
<col>1002</col>
mine-sweeping. But I have a suggestion to make with regard to that. All vessels engaged in trawling must lay up for repairs from time to time. Why should not the Admiralty regulations be so altered as to enable the skipper and the whole of his crew to take up their eight days' or their four days' training simultaneously at the time their vessel is undergoing repair? I think that with a little give and take on the part of the Admiralty and the owners an arrangement satisfactory to both parties might be arrived at. I would suggest that a conference should be arranged between the Admiralty representatives, the owners, and the skippers. I have made these remarks in the hope that the Admiralty will not be discouraged, but that they will continue their efforts to have all mine-sweeping done locally by Reserve men.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01563"><member>LORD NUNBURNHOLME</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would appeal to the Admiralty that they should raise the age in the case of skippers from thirty-five to forty or forty-five, which would enable them to get the best men. I can assure the noble Earl that he is mistaken in saying that the majority of the trawlers at Grimsby and the Humber ports go out only for three weeks. They generally go out for six weeks. The men at the Humber ports go out to Newfoundland and to the northern coast of Africa, and what they do not know about the depth of waters is not worth knowing. Many of the best skippers of these modern trawlers are forty years of age and upwards, and to make the scheme a success I think it would be worth while for the Admiralty to raise the age at any rate to forty. Another complaint is that the men are very badly paid while serving under the Admiralty as compared with what they earn whilst fishing. A good skipper can earn at the rate of &#x00A3;500 a year while fishing, and those are the men who would be most useful to enrol in the new trawling section of the Naval Reserve. Not only should they be given better rates of pay by the Admiralty, but also compensation for accidents whilst serving in the Navy to the same extent as they would be entitled to if serving on their own fishing vessels.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01564"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord will readily understand that I cannot myself give any undertaking that the limit of age will be raised. As at present advised the Board of Admiralty are not
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0506"/>
<col>1003</col>
anxious to change the age limit from thirty-five, but I feel sure that the First Lord of the Admiralty will give careful consideration to the arguments of the noble Lords who speak with such authority in these matters. Lord Nunburnholme expressed the opinion that if the age was raised to forty the Admiralty would tap the best skippers in his district. Well, the question of five years, I should say, is not very material, and although I cannot make any definite promise I am sure my right hon. friend will give the matter his immediate consideration. The noble Lord behind me also raised the question of pay. I am in no way cognisant of what these men earn when they are at their work, but a skipper gets when doing eight days' training &#x00A3;9 and a gratuity, at the satisfactory conclusion of his training, of &#x00A3;3, which makes in all &#x00A3;12 for his eight days' training, and which I think on the whole is quite generous from the Admiralty point of view. The question of gratuities and compensation for accidents has also been touched upon. As far as I understand, in the event of the Naval Reserve being called out these men come under the Navy Warrant and get pensions and gratuities the same as men belonging to the Royal Navy, but while under training I am not quite certain on the matter but I will make inquiries with regard to it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE ADEN HINTERLAND.</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01565"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member> rose to ask the Secretary of State for India whether he could give any information about the railway to be constructed by a French syndicate, from Hodeida to Sana'a, and whether all idea of railway extension in the Aden <i>Hinterland</i> had been abandoned; also whether he could state what progress had been made in the dredging of Aden Harbour.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01566">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I regret that slight indisposition prevents the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, being present this afternoon to answer these Questions. It was his policy when Secretary of State for India which had some bearing on one of the Questions I have put down. Some eight or nine years ago, after the conclusion of certain operations in the Aden <i>Hinterland,</i> the Government had under consideration a project for the construction of a railway from Aden to the high ground in the <i>Hinterland</i> to a place called Dthala. This was under consideration with the object
<col>1004</col>
of helping to pacify and bring into good order the Aden <i>Hinterland,</i> and also as affording a place where a sanatorium could be formed at which the troops in Aden could find refuge from its scorching rocks. But the policy of the noble Viscount was to withdraw altogether from the <i>Hinterland</i> and to have as little interference as possible on our part with anything that went on in that country. Therefore any consideration of a railway lapsed. At the same time the Chief of Lahej had granted one or more concessions for a railway to a company who wished to construct what would have been a portion of the bigger scheme&#x2014;from our Aden frontier at Shaikh Othman to his capital&#x2014;but even this railway was prohibited as coming under the grounds for withdrawal which the noble Viscount considered expedient to adopt. This always seemed rather a selfish policy on our part, that because it did not happen to suit our policy we should prevent one of the Chiefs under our suzerainty opening up his country. But it was obvious that if the railway was not carried on to Aden it would be of no value at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01567">A few days ago I saw in the Press a statement that a railway syndicate was beginning to construct a line from Hodeida to Sana'a, which is 140 miles inland and is the capital of Yemen. If it is the fact that there is now going to be a development of the southern portion of Arabia, I would ask whether it would not be advisable to reconsider the policy which was adopted by the noble Viscount and allow the development of the Aden <i>Hinterland</i> by the great civilising agency of a railway. Probably there is more reason for doing so because of the scheme for deepening and improving the inner and outer harbours of Aden itself. This is with the idea of attracting trade particularly from East Africa, but there has always been a strong desire on the part of the inhabitants of Aden to promote the trade of the place by having better intercourse with the <i>Hinterland.</i> I am well aware that our first consideration is of Aden as a strategical position, and that from time to time the view of the Admiralty has altered as regards its value in this respect. That being so, it was not unnatural if the Government have been reluctant to encourage Aden to become a commercial <i>entrepot</i> and so increase their responsibilities for defence. On the other hand, if in response to local demands an improvement in the port is being carried out it is inconsistent
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0507"/>
<col>1005</col>
and unfair should we disallow what is the counterpart of harbour accommodation&#x2014;namely, the opening up of the country by a railway if there is any private agency anxious to undertake the project, as certainly there was in the past. This is my excuse for asking for information as to what is our position at the present time, and what is the attitude of the Government towards the whole question of the development of the <i>Hinterland</i> and of Aden becoming an important trading centre.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01568"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the absence of my noble friend the Leader of the House I have been asked to reply to the noble Lord's Questions. In regard to the first, the answer is that a concession to survey a projected line from Hodeida to Sana'a was obtained in 1909 by M. David Leon, of Paris, from the Ottoman Minister of Public Works, and the survey was completed in April, 1910, by French and Italian engineers. The scheme included the construction of a harbour at Ras-el-Ketib and a railway line from Ras-el-Ketib <i>via</i> Hodeida to Mefak (186 kilometres) and thence to Sana'a (85 kilometres), a branch to be added proceeding north-west to Amran (57 kilometres from Sana'a). The total cost of the scheme was estimated at &#x00A3;1,772,000. It is understood that the Ottoman Government has decided not to grant a concession to any foreign company for the proposed line for a limited number of years, but M. David Leon's syndicate has taken in hand on behalf of the Ottoman Government the construction of the harbour at Ras-el-Ketib and the section of the railway from that place to Hujjula which it has been decided to construct. The line will run <i>via</i> Hodeida (about 116 kilometres). No decision has yet been taken at Constantinople with regard to the continuation of the line to Sana'a. M. David Leon has also obtained the concession to make a survey of the country between Hodeida and Taiz and between Taiz and Sana'a, with a view to ascertaining the practicability of a line traversing these parts to Sana'a.<lb/>
<col>1006</col>
As to the second Question in regard to railway extension in the Aden <i>Hinterland,</i> it is the settled policy of His Majesty's Government to abstain from any extension of their responsibilities in the Aden <i>Hinterland</i> so long as the <i>status quo</i> is strictly observed by the Turkish Government. Any scheme for railway construction would be narrowly scrutinised by them in the light of this policy. The reply to the third Question is that the dredging of Aden Harbour, which early last year was reported to be nearing completion, has been somewhat prolonged owing to physical obstacles necessitating a modification of the scheme. It may interest the noble Lord to know what those obstacles are. The latest information we have is a report made by the Port Trust to the Bombay Government in 1910, in which they state that difficulties had been experienced in attempting to remove the rock in the valley mouth on the south side of the channel, and that the dredger had broken down. It was therefore decided to abandon dredging in this particular spot, and to widen the other part of the channel. This alteration in the scheme was approved by the port engineer and the Port Trust, and was sanctioned by the Bombay Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01569"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I am much obliged to the noble Earl for his answer. At the same time I would ask His Majesty's Government whether it is right, not that they as a Government should embark in any enterprise, but that they should prohibit private agencies from developing a country for which, after all, we are responsible. It certainly seems to me rather a dog-in-the-manger policy that we should undertake more or less to supervise and see that good order is maintained in a certain area, and at the same time not allow the Chief to contract an obligation with private parties for a project which would have a beneficial effect upon the whole of that country.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ALIENS AND THE MERCANTILE MARINE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01590"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member> rose "to call attention to the case of the steamer 'Coomassie,' which is, or was until quite recently, flying the British flag; to ask whether His Majesty's Government have received any report or reports from their representative at Hamburg relative to the manning of this vessel on leaving there; if so, to ask whether it is true that she left in charge of a master and acting mate, both of whom were uncertificated, of Greek nationality, and ignorant of the English language, four only of the crew being of British nationality; further, whether they have received any reports from their representative at Catania (Sicily) as to the alleged scandalous proceedings which have been going on there on board this vessel; and to move, 'That in the opinion of this House, legislation is urgently demanded which will ensure that ships flying the British flag when leaving ports other than in the United Kingdom shall at least be commanded and officered by men holding British certificates qualifying them to do so.'"</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01591">The noble Lord said: My Lords, on March 27 last I brought the question of uncertificated officers before this House. As I stated then, any merchant ship, no matter how large she may be, provided she is engaged in the coasting trade and not carrying passengers, need not carry a single certificated man on board. And in addition to this, so long as vessels under the British flag are not sailing from ports in the United Kingdom or certain Colonial ports there is nothing which compels them to carry competent and qualified captains and officers. This is really so astonishing that even men well versed in shipping affairs have been known to refuse to believe it. During the course of the last debate on this subject in this House I had the satisfaction of learning that at last the Marine Department of the Board of Trade were beginning to make a move, and had drafted a measure which they considered would cope with the evil to which I have called attention on ninny occasions. Whilst the debate was in progress a point arose as to whether the Board of Trade, as appeared to be their intention, would confine themselves to the coasting trade of the United Kingdom, or, on the other hand, whether the new Bill would also include the case of British
<col>1010</col>
merchant ships outside the three-miles limit of our shores and trading permanently, or at least fox long periods, between ports abroad. My noble friend the Marquess of Salisbury laid particular stress on this point, and I hoped that the noble Lord representing the Board of Trade would have given some assurance of favourable consideration being given to this important aspect of the case. My Lords, I do hope that the Board of Trade will deal with the whole matter in a thorough and effective way. In adopting half measures they will satisfy nobody, and they may rest assured that if the measure which they intend to introduce is not complete they may expect that agitation on this question will still continue.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01592">I will now show your Lordships what glaring and outrageous scandals can prevail under the Red Ensign of this country as the law stands at present. Through the medium of the Imperial Merchant Service Guild I have been supplied with information which undoubtedly is authentic, and as I have given ample notice of this Question, I trust that the Board of Trade have obtained what possible information they could from British representatives abroad, who would be familiar with at least some of the details of the case. According to the written statements of the captain of a large steamer attached to a well-known London fleet of merchant vessels, he reports that the Guild will hardly credit the information which, if he had not both seen and heard first-hand what had transpired, he could not have thought possible. He reached Catania, in Sicily, with his vessel on April 1 last, and shortly afterwards a steamer of some 3,000 tons, flying the British Red Ensign, came into the berth next to him. On her stern he read the vessel's name, which stood as the "Coomassie," of London. Before the day was over it appears that she became a special object of note, owing to the drunkenness and fighting which was going on on board, and Which was accountable the next morning for several of the "Coomassie's" crew being either in prison or in hospital.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01593">Naturally the interest and curiosity of the captain who supplies the information was aroused, and he obtained some particulars himself. He found that the "Coomassie" was loaded with a cargo of coals from Emden for Catania. Four only of the crew were Britishers, and the rest
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0510"/>
<col>1011</col>
were of mixed nationalities. They signed on at Hamburg to serve in the vessel on her voyage to Constantinople. The captain was a Greek without a certificate, the mate another alien holding no British certificate, and neither of them able to speak more than a word or two of English. We are told that it is possible that the "Coomassie" may be trading in the Mediterranean for another twelve months under the British flag, and it is not surprising to hear that the arrangements on board and the lack of discipline, coupled with the disgraceful scenes which had occurred, were the principal topic of conversation amongst the shipping business men (Italians mostly), who were not slow to wax sarcastic over the scandals which are allowed to prevail under what we call our glorious Red Ensign. I would ask whether such a ship under the British flag can be accepted as in a seaworthy condition for the voyage; whether she is not a menace to life and property generally, and whether any insurance company of standing would take such risks if they were aware of them? The captain who reports this matter says that he sailed from Catania only too pleased to be out of sight of such a disgraceful state of affairs.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01594">The Imperial Merchant Service Guild have gone further than this in order to get solid substantiation for such astonishing accounts. They furnished me with copies of letters which have been received from another British shipmaster of long standing who was also at Catania at the time in command of a large merchant ship. He endorses in every way what I have already brought to the notice of your Lordships. This shipmaster actually inspected the articles of the "Coomassie" which had been signed at the British Consulate in Hamburg. He failed to find one person, master, officer or engineer, whose number of certificate had been entered up, with the exception of the first engineer, and on bringing this to the particular notice of the British Vice-Consul at Catania he was informed that no doubt the reason of this was that no one held a certificate. The "Coomassie's" articles, which, as your Lordships know, are really the agreement with the crew, were, it is said, about as interesting a document as was ever sanctioned. With your Lordships' permission I will read the latest letter. It is addressed to the Secretary of the Imperial
<col>1012</col>
Merchant Service Guild, and runs as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"Dear Sir,&#x2014;In reply to your request that I should give you all the particulars that I am familiar with in respect to the ss. 'Coomassie,' I do so with pleasure, and trust that they may be a little aid in stopping a recurrence of such a disgrace. On April 5 whilst in Catania I was able to inspect the articles of agreement of the ss. 'Coomassie' and found the following particulars. The articles were opened at 'British Consulate General' in Hamburg on March 10th, 1911, and the crew signed on for the run to Constantinople, evidently understanding that the vessel was to load at Emden and discharge at an Italian port, on the way to Constantinople. The vessel's registered tonnage was something over 1,000 tons, and the name of the managing owners the Anglo-Ionian Steam Navigation Company, Limited; registered address in London. Evidently no register was produced on opening agreement, as there was endorsed 'Particulars as per last agreement.' This is a hard-and-fast regulation in all British shipping offices. Another peculiarity was that the Consular official had endorsed, in the space allotted for such statements, 'a change of masters.' Why should this be when there is only one master on agreement and he the man who opened the agreement? If his predecessor had opened the agreement and signed it I could understand it, but when the change takes place before the agreement is signed I cannot see what need there is for such endorsement. Can you? In the space allotted for 'Number of certificate if any,' one man only had a number against his name and he was the first engineer. These I think are the chief particulars in respect to the articles of agreement. About the men who signed them, I will endeavour to give you a little information. Master, Greek, spoke very little, if any, English. Mate, cannot be quite sure but feel certain, German. Second Mate, none as he was carried as passenger and did not sign
agreement. Bos'n, Britisher. Sailors, three Britishers; remainder, all
nationalities. First engineer, Greek, spoke very little English. Second
engineer, Greek, no English. Third engineer, none. As I have tabulated the total number of Britishers&#x2014;Bos'n and three sailors&#x2014;it is useless to prolong the agony, except to add that these were out of a total of twenty-five or twenty-six hands all told. My friend Captain Green, having told you of the disorders and disgrace to our flag in Catania, I can only fully endorse all he says. The four Britishers were paid off in Catania, having demanded to be paid off on the grounds 'that they could neither understand nor be understood,' and I presume Italians were shipped in their places, so that when the British (!) ss. 'Coomassie' left Catania I have little hesitation in saying that there was not a Britisher on Board, yet she was under the British Flag, British protection, and, I presume, also British Board of Trade Regulations."</quote>
It is not unnatural that both shipmasters who interested themselves in the case felt acutely the disgrace cast upon the British flag and the most damaging impression it would convey to foreigners.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01595">I do not believe that there is one of your Lordships who would contend that such
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0511"/>
<col>1013</col>
a scandalous state of affairs is not in need of the most urgent attention. In putting my Question I trust that my Motion that such vessels as the "Coomassie" should be brought within the scope of British law relating to efficiency in respect to those who command and officer them need not be pressed, provided we receive assurances that the Government when the Bill is brought forward will be prepared, if it proves necessary, to accept an Amendment, or introduce one themselves, which will prevent such cases as I have now brought to your Lordships' notice from occurring again. We were told on March 27&#x2014;over two months ago&#x2014;that this Bill was drafted. I should like to know why it has not been introduced.</p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01597"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am informed that the steamship "Coomassie" formerly belonged to the Elder Dempster Company, and was sold at the end of March to the Anglo-Ionian Company. The right of this company to own a British vessel is under the consideration of the Board of Customs, and if it is found that the company have no right to fly the British ensign the register will be closed. I am able to inform the noble Lord that the Board of Customs have ordered an inquiry under Section 51 of the Merchant Shipping Act. After the sale of this ship to the company I have referred to, a new master, who was a Greek, was appointed. The only person on the vessel who held a British certificate was the first engineer, and he also was a Greek. We have called for a report from His Majesty's Consul-General, who informs us that all the rest of the crew passed satisfactorily a language test as set forth in the Merchant Shipping Act, but the captain had very little knowledge of English, and according to the Act there was no power to subject him to the language test.<lb/>
It may interest your Lordships to know how the crew of this ship was composed when she left Hamburg. Her crew at that time consisted of two Britons, six Finns,
<col>1014</col>
two Austrians, two Greeks, two Brazilians, one German, one Dane, one Chilian, one native of Fiji, and one native of Aden. The vessel then proceeded to Emden, where two more Britishers were engaged. At Catania seven members of the crew, including the four British subjects, were discharged by mutual consent, and five Greeks were taken in their place. So that, as a matter of fact, when the ship sailed from Catania she had no British subject on board. A report has also been received from the Consul at Catania, who states that the master of the vessel asked him to discharge two Austrians on the ground of misbehaviour and drunkenness. He also informs us that the reports of breaches of discipline to which my noble friend referred were in a great measure exaggerated. That, my Lords, is the whole history of the "Coomassie," and I have no doubt, now that it is in the hands of the Board of Customs, steps will be taken to prevent an occurrence such as the one which my noble friend has brought to our notice recurring.<lb/>
The noble Lord, in the course of his remarks, asked for information as to when the new Merchant Shipping Bill would be brought; in. I have heard from Mr. Buxton this morning. He informs me that it is proposed to introduce the Bill in the House of Commons, and probably it will not reach your Lordships' House until near the end of July. My noble friend Lord Hamilton of Dalzell has already informed the noble Lord of the purport of that Bill. It is to insist that persons engaged in the coasting trade should have certificates the same as is the case with foreign-going and passenger ships in the home trade. The noble Lord opposite also stated that he thought it necessary that British ships trading exclusively abroad should be brought within the scope of the Bill. I do not think I can agree with the noble Lord in that respect, for by so doing we should penalise our trade a great deal abroad. Take, for instance, the case of ships trading in the Red Sea on what is known as the pilgrim traffic. It would be quite impossible to employ purely British certificated officers out there: In the first place, they would be very hard to get; and, in the second place, they would not understand the ways of these people. The only effect of bringing forward legislation such as my noble friend suggests would be to very materially

injure our trade there, and it would mean that we would be cut out by some foreign rival.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ARRANGEMENTS FOR CORONATION DAY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01602"><member>LORD WELBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the First Commissioner of Works whether it would not be a very great convenience to the House if, on the occasion of the Coronation, Peers were admitted to the Abbey by the Chapel of Henry VII, bearing in mind the fact that such an arrangement would not interfere in any way with the Coronation route. I think it is clear that it would be a great convenience to those who wish to go over from this House to the Abbey if they were permitted to make use of that short space of fifty or sixty yards which separates this House from the Chapel of Henry VII. I understand, from papers that have been circulated, that facilities are to be given to Peers leaving the Abbey to come to this House, and facilities are also to be given by which Peers will be able to get to this House by steamer. It seems to me that our convenience might be further considered by our being allowed to come to this House and go from here to the Abbey in the morning. If that were done, it is evident that a certain amount of pressure on the western entrances would be lightened; and as for any interference with the public, you have only to go into New Palace Yard to see that the last scaffold is some fifty or sixty yards to the north of
<col>1016</col>
the Peers' entrance. I put it to your Lordships that the concession for which I ask would be of very great convenience, and if it were given it would lengthen the time during which Peers would have an opportunity of entering the Abbey. To most of us it would be a considerable convenience if the time at which we have to enter the Abbey was extended by an hour or half-an-hour. I hope that in these circumstances the First Commissioner will be able to hold out some hope that the convenience of your Lordships will be consulted in the direction I have indicated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01603"><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member><membercontribution>: Before the noble Earl answers the Question, might I venture to ask another which bears on the same subject? It is whether on the same occasion facilities will be afforded to those of your Lordships who desire to do so to robe within the precincts of the House before the Coronation, in the same manner as is done at the opening of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01604"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The matter referred to in Lord Welby's Question is one which comes entirely within the jurisdiction of the Earl Marshal, and I am informed by him that the arrangements for Peers entering the Abbey have received most careful consideration, and the scheme has been decided upon and drawn up after consultation with the police. The arrangement suggested by my noble friend would not enable Peers to enter the Abbey at a later hour than that which has been fixed, as all the doors of the Abbey will, in accordance with the Order in Council of May 4, be closed at nine a.m. The cards of admission, I am informed, have already been issued, and any change at this stage would inevitably lead to confusion and inconvenience to all concerned. The courtesy of the Earl Marshal and his desire to oblige are so well known that I am quite certain he would have met the wishes of my noble friend had it been possible.<lb/>
As regards the further Question put by Lord Zouche, his suggestion shall receive consideration. I think what he suggests could easily be arranged for those Peers who chose to come to the House of Lords before the ceremony. Perhaps I may remind your Lordships that no one will be allowed to pass the police lines without a ticket after 7.15 a.m. on Coronation Day.
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0513"/>
<col>1017</col>
The doors of the Abbey will be shut at nine o'clock. The first Procession will arrive at 9.30, the second at 10 o'clock, and His Majesty the King is timed to arrive at 10.30. Tickets of admission to the Palace of Westminster enabling the holders to pass on foot until the traffic is closed at 8.30 may be obtained on application at the Lord Great Chamberlain's office, House of Lords. This will be of some convenience to noble Lords, as I am given to understand by the police that no person whatever will be allowed to break into the route at different points after 7.15 a.m. without either a luncheon card for the House of Lords luncheon, or a ticket for a stand, or a card of some sort.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01633">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01634"><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the measure which I have to introduce to your Lordships this afternoon is one which will, I feel sure, commend itself to the House in general; but before stating what are the provisions of the Bill I should like very briefly to outline the steps that have led up to its introduction. Attention was first called to the danger which might be caused to crowds by aeroplanes on the occasion of the. University Boat Race this year, when several aeroplanes manoeuvred over the heads of the crowd in such a way that the spectators could see that dangerous results would follow should an accident occur. Further attention was called to the matter by the flying at Hendon Aerodrome on May 12, when one or two aeronauts performed flights over the heads of the spectators, with great skill, it is true, but
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0515"/>
<col>1021</col>
at the same time in a way which was rather suggestive of danger.<lb/>
Not unnaturally the question then arose as to what would happen if similar flights were performed on the occasion of the Coronation, and probably in consequence of this on May 18 the Royal Aero Club issued a notice warning aviators against performing flights during the Coronation over the route of the Procession, and also stating that any aviator who did so would have his certificate suspended. But, as a matter of fact, previous to this the Chief Commissioner of Police had already represented to the Home Secretary that in his opinion serious danger might arise if such flights were permitted, and he had even suggested that legislation might be introduced with a view to preventing them. The matter was therefore already fully under consideration when on May 21 there occurred that terrible disaster which I am sure must have filled the minds of all the members of your Lordships' House with horror and with feelings of the deepest sympathy for the French people in the loss which they sustained. I allude to the deplorable accident at Issy-les-Moulineaux. The Secretary of State then, though he recognised that the action which had been taken by the Royal Aero Club would in all probability prove effective in so far as the Coronation is concerned, came to the conclusion that in view of the serious danger it was incumbent upon him to apply to Parliament for powers which he could use effectively, not only on the occasion of the Coronation but also on other similar occasions. He therefore gave instructions for the drafting of this Bill, which has already passed the House of Commons.<lb/>
In the original Bill as it was introduced in the House of Commons there was a clause proposing penalties upon any one who navigates an air craft recklessly or negligently or to the danger of the public, this, of course, being based upon Section 1 of the Motor Car Act of 1903. However, very strong representations were made, on behalf of the Royal Aero Club and of the Aerial Defence Committee, to the effect that the clause was very vague and that in their opinion it would tend seriously to impede the progress of the study of aerial navigation. Consequently the Home Secretary decided to omit the clause and to rely wholly upon the powers which now appear
<col>1022</col>
in Clause 1 of the Bill as amended. This clause gives the Secretary of State power from time to time to forbid the navigation of air craft over particular areas where special danger would be deemed to be caused. The penalties, which were originally two years imprisonment and a fine of &#x00A3;500, have been reduced, but they are still severe&#x2014;namely, a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months and a fine of &#x00A3;200. The procedure under the Bill may be summary or on indictment, but it is in either case in the option of the persons prosecuted to claim trial by jury should they so desire, and, further, all convictions, whether the punishment is by fine or by imprisonment, are subject to appeal. These, my Lords, are the provisions of the Bill, and in this form it passed the House of Commons with the assent of the representatives of the Royal Aero Club and the Aerial Defence Committee.<lb/>
At the same time I am authorised to give the strongest possible assurances that His Majesty's Government have not the slightest desire to impede the study and progress of aerial navigation. On the contrary, they are anxious to promote it; but it is really in the interests no less of the aviators themselves than of the general public that some efficient means should be found of preventing the possibility of the occurrence of some grave disaster, which might, and probably would, turn public opinion entirely against aviation and aviators. The suggestion was made that the Bill should be limited in time, but this the Home Secretary felt bound to refuse, and the representatives of aviation whom I have mentioned acquiesced in his decision. At the same time he gave a definite assurance that a fuller and more complete measure dealing with the whole subject of aerial navigation would be introduced and passed as soon as possible. A Bill on the subject is, indeed, actually in draft, and will be brought in as soon as the state of public business permits.<lb/>
The present measure, therefore, is only an interim one, though it is not possible to state now when the more complete Bill can be produced. I hope that the few remarks I have made have been sufficient to show, in the first place, the necessity for the introduction of some measure of this sort, and, secondly, that, the Government are in no way actuated by any hostile
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0516"/>
<col>1023</col>
feelings towards aviation and aviators. I therefore trust your Lordships will see your way to allow the Bill to be passed through all its stages this afternoon, with a view to its being placed on the Statute Book with the least possible delay. I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01728">[The EARL of DONOUGHMORE in the Chair.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01729">Clause 1:</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01730" align="center"><i>Powers of House of Lords as to Money Bills.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01731"><b>1.</b>&#x2014;(1) If a Money Bill, having been passed by the House of Commons, and sent up to the House of Lords at least one month before the end of the session, is not passed by the House of Lords without amendment within one month after it is so sent up to that House, the Bill shall, unless the House of Commons direct to the contrary, be presented to His Majesty and become an Act of Parliament on the Royal Assent being signified, notwithstanding that the House of Lords have not consented to the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01732">(2) A Money Bill means a public Bill which in the opinion of the Speaker of the House of Commons contains only provisions dealing with all or any of the following subjects, namely, the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on the Consolidated Fund, or on money provided by Parliament, or the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of public money; the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment thereof; or subordinate matters incidental to those subjects or any of them. In this subsection the expressions "taxation," "public money," and "loan" respectively do not include any taxation, money, or loan raised by local authorities or bodies for local purposes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01733">(3) There shall be endorsed on every Money Bill when it is sent up to the House of Lords and when it is presented to His Majesty for assent the certificate of the Speaker of the House of Commons signed by hint that it is a Money Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01734"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the three Amendments which stand in my name and the first of which I now move would, if agreed to, make subsection (1) read as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"A Money Bill having been passed by the House of Commons shall, unless the House of Commons direct to the contrary, be presented to His Majesty and become an Act of Parliament on the Royal Assent being signified."</quote>
The object of these Amendments is to make clear what is the avowed intention of this Bill. It is freely urged by members of the Opposition that the whole effect of the Bill will be to reduce your Lordships'
<col>1032</col>
House to the level of a debating society. But whatever difference of opinion there may be as to the effect of Clause 2, there can be none at all as to what would be the effect of Clause 1, for it is framed for the express purpose of preventing your Lordships from amending or rejecting a Money Bill. Any amount of discussion in this House cannot have the effect of inducing or enabling the House of Commons to make any change in a Money Bill which they have sent up to this House, and it seems to me a waste of time that we should debate the matter. If we disapproved of taxation which was proposed and expressed our opinion, we should only provide material for paragraphs in Radical papers winding up with the congratulation that by this Bill our teeth had been drawn, and that, however much we might bark, we were unable to bite.<lb/>
Personally I quite agree with what was said on this subject by Mr. Keir Hardie at Merthyr Tydvil. Speaking of the House of Lords he said&#x2014;
<quote>"They are not to have power to amend a Money Bill, nor to reject it, nor to suspend it. Then why send it to them? Why make two bites at the cherry? Why not say here and now that the House of Commons shall be supreme in finance, and send Finance Bills direct to the Crown without going to the House of Lords at all?"</quote>
It is true that the Prime Minister expressed a different opinion. He said that he thought the country ought not to deprive itself of the advantage of hearing the financial proposals of the Government discussed and reviewed with all the vast resources of dialectical skill which your Lordships possess. But if the Prime Minister is unable to take advantage of the discussions and debates on these matters in your Lordships' House&#x2014;and he certainly will be unable to do so&#x2014;I cannot see how he is to benefit by having heard the view of your Lordships upon the Government's proposals. If this Bill passes and in the future some financial measure is brought forward which your Lordships think will be very injurious to the country as a whole, it is not a feeble whine from an impotent House of Lords which will prevent its passing into law. That can only be done by the action your Lordships may take outside this House. A few more speeches such as that which was made at Manchester by the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, will do more to convince the country than any amount of debate in the House of Lords constituted with the powers which it would
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0521"/>
<col>1033</col>
then enjoy. It seems to me that our position with regard to this is very much that of surgeons who have a patient brought before them and placed in the theatre for the purpose of operation, and who see that it is absolutely necessary that an operation should be performed to restore the patient to health, but who are unable to perform that operation themselves; and not only that, but those who, as the Prime Minister told us, are anxious to have our advice on the subject are themselves unable to perform the operation although they may agree with our diagnosis of the case. I submit that this is an unworthy position for your Lordships' House to occupy. That is why I have placed these three Amendments on the Paper, the first one of which I now beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01735">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>Page 1, line 17, leave out ("If").&#x2014;(<i>Lord Oranmore and Browne.)</i></quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01736"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on the Second Reading of this Bill the noble Marquess opposite asked me whether it was the intention of His Majesty's Government to give a fair hearing to all Amendments that might be moved in this House, and I said, in reply, that nothing was nearer to my heart and to the hearts of my colleagues than that we should pay all attention to Amendments that might be moved and to any arguments that might be brought forward in support of those Amendments. But I am afraid I must make a bad beginning, because the Amendment which the noble Lord has just moved is really, if he will allow me to say so, an Amendment without any substance whatever. It is an Amendment turning upon the dignity of your Lordships' House; and when the noble Lord implies that he is induced to move this Amendment by paragraphs in Radical newspapers and by speeches such as that of the Member for Merthyr Tydvil, I do not think those are points that ought to weigh with your Lordships for a single moment. Nobody is more bound than I am to pay attention to paragraphs in Radical newspapers, but I would not think for a moment, standing where I happen to stand now, of asking your Lordships to take a single step in one direction or another because you were alarmed or perturbed by paragraphs either in Radical or Conservative newspapers. We are here to look at these things from the point of view
<col>1034</col>
of this House. The Amendment of the noble Lord is to the point that the dignity of this House is affronted by the Bill as it stands, and that therefore you had better say, "Do not trouble us with your Money Bills. Take them, and let us be done with it." I do not think that is the right point of view from which to open the discussions we are to-day beginning, and therefore, in spite of my very sincere desire to meet any Amendment and to listen to any arguments from noble Lords opposite, I am afraid we must oppose a negative to the Amendment of the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01737"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the noble Viscount has treated the proposal of my noble friend on the Cross Benches rather hardly. He told him that he regarded his Amendment as one of no substance, and the reason he gave for that statement was that the Amendment was one turning on the dignity of this House. I trust that that is not an indication of the general attitude of the Front Bench opposite towards questions concerning the dignity of this House. I am sure we do not desire to be meticulous on these points or to stand too much on our dignity, but I do trust, on the other hand, that when questions affecting the position of this House and the respect to which it is entitled at the hands of the country are raised, we shall not be told that those are questions of no importance and that they merely concern the dignity of the House of Lords.<lb/>
My noble friend's Amendment is founded upon a feeling on his part that the opportunities for consultation which will be afforded under this clause are so meagre that they are really not worth having at all. I gather that, sooner than have what might appear to be a sham consultation with this House, he would have no consultation at all. The noble Viscount suggests that that might not be the right point of view, but it is a very natural point of view indeed, and it is one which I cannot help thinking will be somewhat widely entertained. But I own that I attach more importance than my noble friend does even to those very meagre opportunities which will be afforded to us under this clause of discussing financial measures in this House. To my mind even slender opportunities are better than no opportunities at all, and I for one would be reluctant to part even with those slender
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0522"/>
<col>1035</col>
opportunities. The discussions which may take place here in regard to Finance Bills may not be without effect upon the public mind. I can almost endeavour to persuade myself that they may sometimes not be without effect upon His Majesty's Ministers. There is an indication in the clause which leads me to hold this opinion rather more strongly. I notice that under the words of the clause a Finance Bill must be passed in this House within a month "unless the House of Commons direct to the contrary." Those words evidently are not put in without some meaning, and I hope I am right in interpreting them as meaning that in special cases the period of one month might be extended&#x2014;in other words, that the period of one month is a minimum and not a maximum. For these reasons I would venture to suggest to my noble friend that we had better leave the Bill as it is on this point. I hope, therefore, he will not press his Amendment to a Division.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01738"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after the appeal that has been made to me by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, I will, with the permission of the Committee, withdraw my Amendment, and not move the other two standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01739">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01740"><member>VISCOUNT GALWAY</member> moved to omit from subsection (2) of the clause the provision under which the Speaker of the House of Commons had to decide whether or not a Bill was a Money Bill, with the object of subsequently moving the insertion of the following new subsection&#x2014;
<quote>(3) The question whether a Bill is a Money Bill within the meaning of this section shall, on a resolution in that behalf being passed by either House of Parliament, be referred forthwith for final decision to the Court of Appeal, and that Court shall, in private deliberation and without submission to it of argument or evidence, determine whether the Bill is a Money Bill within the meaning of this section, and the decision of the Court shall be final and conclusive, and shall be communicated to both Houses of Parliament: Provided that a Judge of that Court who is a member of the House of Lords shall not take part in any proceedings relating to the consideration or decision of any such question.</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01741">The noble Viscount said: I am sure your Lordships will fully understand that in no remarks that I make do I wish to reflect in any way on the Speaker of the House of Commons. The position which the Speaker has gained for himself by his</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01742"><i>The Marquess of Lansdowne</i></p>
<col>1036</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01743">ability and tact is well known, and the last thing I would wish to do would be to see anything placed in this Bill which would militate against his high position. Personally I am rather surprised that the members of the House of Commons should run the risk of the Speaker losing the great position which he new holds, for any measure which he may have to decide upon will no doubt be a measure which will give rise to Party discussion, and whichever way the decision is given one side or the other will be dissatisfied. I may be told that this is a matter for the House of Commons to consider for themselves; but when it is proposed that the Speaker should be the sole arbiter as to whether a Bill comes under the category of a Money Bill or not, it is a matter which concerns this House very seriously. We must remember that the Speaker is the representative of the House of Commons, and that when he attends in this House to receive His Majesty's approbation on his election he claims for the House of Commons, as their representative, all the rights and privileges which the Commons alone enjoy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01744">It is rather stretching the point to say that one who solely represents the House of Commons&#x2014;and we must remember with regard to this that the Speaker is elected to that position by the majority of the House of Commons&#x2014;should be the sole arbiter in this matter. It has been the custom for the Speaker to be re-elected in successive Parliaments, but if the idea is entertained that the Speaker is actuated in any way by partisan motives, however unreasonably that idea may be held, I am afraid we shall not see that continuity in regard to the Speakership which we should like to see. The object of my Amendment is to endeavour to remove the whole question as to what is and what is not a Money Bill absolutely and entirely out of the way of any Party feeling whatever. So anxious am I to do that that in a subsequent Amendment I propose that there shall not be any Party argument or discussion before the tribunal to which the question goes, but that the point should be decided on its abstract merits. I propose that it should go to the Court of Appeal; and as we have begun for the first time to have a written Constitution, it is not unreasonable that we should ask that a written Constitution should be interpreted by
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0523"/>
<col>1037</col>
legal authorities. That is the case in other countries. In America the Supreme Court is called upon to give a decision in such cases, and I cannot see what objection there can be to a written Constitution being interpreted legally by the Court of Appeal. So anxious am I to see that there should be no Party feeling whatever introduced that I have carefully provided that any Judge who should happen to be a member of this House should not sit on that Court of Appeal. That is practically the object of my Amendments. I move the first one now, and in due course I will submit the other.</p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01746"><member>THE LORD CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: There are alternative proposals before your Lordships. The noble Viscount proposes to leave out twelve words, six of which are necessary should the Amendment standing in the name of Lord Cromer be discussed. I think, therefore, that the most convenient course would be that the question put to your Lordships should be that the first six words proposed to be left out by the noble Viscount&#x2014;namely, "which in the opinion of the"&#x2014;should stand part. The other words can follow as a consequential Amendment if that is carried.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01747"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the change in the form of the Amendment proposed by the Lord Chairman is well founded. This Amendment is one of a not very large but very important group of Amendments, and the object of that group is to substitute for the Speaker of the House of Commons or for any other body&#x2014;a Committee of the two Houses, for example&#x2014;a judicial tribunal. The noble Viscount proposes the Court of Appeal. In another place the proposal was made that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council should decide whether the electors at a given moment intended this or that. It is not becoming to read in your Lordships' House long quotations, or, indeed, any quotations, from speeches made even by important men in another place, but if any of your Lordships are captivated by the arguments which the noble Viscount opposite has brought before you, I would refer you to the speech made by
<col>1038</col>
the Leader of the Opposition in another place if you want a complete and emphatic repudiation of all attempts&#x2014;whether the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council or the Court of Appeal is proposed&#x2014;to transfer to a legal tribunal questions which are distinctly and unmistakeably and inevitably Parliamentary questions. We may quarrel as to the exact share the House of Lords should have in discussing a Money Bill, but if anybody wants a complete answer to proposals of this kind he will find it in the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition in the other House, in which he repudiated all ideas and proposals of this kind with great emphasis.<lb/>
It is surely an untenable position that the two Houses, distribute the respective powers of each as you will, should submit their views and convictions as to what is or what is not pure finance to a legal tribunal. A legal tribunal&#x2014;of which I would, like Mr. Balfour, speak with all respect&#x2014;is guided by precedents and very strict construction of terms. That is not the way in which either this House or the other House does its business. It is not the point of view from which either House has been accustomed all these years, I might almost say all these centuries, to regard these distinctions. Consider what would be the effect of transferring to a legal tribunal an issue of this kind&#x2014;whether a given Bill is or is not pure finance. The effect would be to set up precedents. You would have a great body of case law established. We have always been accustomed, and I hope it will continue to be the custom, to look at all these financial proposals from a practical point of view, without reference to a great body of case law, important as that is in dealing with legal business. This is not legal business.<lb/>
I admit that we are embarking to a certain extent upon written elements in our Constitution. I admit that it might seem natural, in an operation of that kind, that there should be a legal tribunal to interpret the writing. Upon that we shall hear more by and by. But whether this business is to be discharged by the Speaker of the House of Commons, as we propose, or by a Joint Committee such as the noble Earl on the Cross Benches (Lord Cromer) proposes&#x2014;however you may settle that, it should be decided upon Parliamentary
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0524"/>
<col>1039</col>
and public considerations and not upon strict legal technicalities. Of course, one could elaborate this to any extent, but I will only refer to the arguments used by the Leader of the Opposition in the other House against a judicial tribunal, and I ask your Lordships not to accept the noble Viscount's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01748"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the speech of the noble Viscount who has just sat down was very determined as regards the transference of this power to a legal tribunal, but he was not equally determined, or he said nothing which justified us in thinking that the Government were prepared, to stand by the letter of the Bill, leaving the matter as at present proposed, in the hands of the Speaker. On this side of the House we hold, perhaps not so strongly as the noble Viscount, the view that it is undesirable to set up a legal tribunal. If you come ultimately, as we are coming, to a written law as regards our Constitution, it seems not improbable that then certain matters will have to be decided by some legal tribunal, but our practice and our traditions are equally divided from that position at present, and I apprehend that, though my noble friend behind me has made a great case for change in the practice proposed in the Bill, there will be no general acceptance by your Lordships of the proposal to make these decisions a judicial question.<lb/>
We have seen in the last few days something of the danger of dragging judicial authorities into anything like the political strife of the day. Unfortunately there have been a number of election petitions, and in some quarters there has not been the same readiness as there has always been in the past to accept the Judges' decisions as absolutely impartial. In reference to one matter&#x2014;it was not a matter of elections, but a matter of politics&#x2014;which had to be decided by law, we have had grave reasons to complain of language used with regard to the Judges from a very high quarter&#x2014;from a quarter which should have been the first to defend them. That is an indication to us that, if men in high positions cannot in a moment of strife refrain from ill-considered and ill-balanced remarks of that kind, there would be considerable danger that when political feeling ran high on a question so vital as that which is<lb/>
<i>Viscount Morley of Blackburn.</i><lb/>
<col>1040</col>
now before us, recourse to the judicial authorities might result in their being dragged into the arena of politics, from which we desire to keep them free.<lb/>
But if we cannot go the whole length with my noble friend who has moved this Amendment, we by no means accept the position of the Government. The Lord Chairman will put the question that these words stand part of the clause. We cannot agree that they should stand part. Like my noble friend behind me, I have had a long experience of Speakers in the House of Commons, and I am not going to do more than follow my noble friend in saying how earnestly I associate myself with him in respect for the present Speaker and for the office which he represents. But do not let us conceal from ourselves that the position of the Speaker has changed very much in recent years. He has become in closer relations to the majority of the House of Commons year by year, and by the action of both Parties in the State, than were the Speakers of the last century. The Speakers of the Tudor period upheld the right of the Sovereign against the House of Commons. They managed the business of Parliament, and they settled in some cases what subjects should be discussed. The Speakers of the present day uphold the rights of the House of Commons against all comers. The Speaker has been again placed in the position of settling the business to be discussed, and also of settling, not the prerogative of the Crown which former Speakers in old days upheld, but the privilege as it is so called, but in reality the prerogative, claimed by the House of Commons.<lb/>
Many of us who have sat in Ministries may be to blame, but I ask your Lordships to consider how great has been the change. When in the eighties the closure was first adopted the Speaker was limited, by the most careful language, to imposing the closure when the evident sense of the House desired that there should be an ending of debate, but he had to take a responsibility for the management of business which he never had before. A few years later closure by compartments was adopted, and in that case it became necessary for the Speaker, at a time when the evident sense of the House could not be shown, to decide that certain portions of a Bill should be debated and dismissed in a certain
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0525"/>
<col>1041</col>
number of hours. But now, by reason of the new fantastic system under which Bills are sent up to this House, the Speaker or the Chairman as the case may be decides, not merely what time shall be given to a measure, but what subjects, in a list containing fifty or 100, should be discussed in relation to it before a Bill leaves the House of Commons. That is the greatest invasion of the rights of Parliament, the greatest invasion of free speech, which has ever been attempted in this country; and it is quite impossible that the Speaker or the Chairman, as the case may be, who has to administer this power should be entirely at one with the minority of the House when he has to impose such regulations and has to settle, without hearing arguments at all, whether eleven Amendments out of twelve should be placed altogether out of court and out of discussion.<lb/>
Remember that from this despotism there is no appeal. Under this clause a Bill so manipulated, so undiscussed, could be sent up to this House, where we could not reject it and could not discuss it. Your Lordships would have no remedy, the people of the country would have no remedy; and I cannot but feel that to ask an official like the Speaker, who is charged already with difficult and onerous duties, to put on the cloak of impartiality between the two Houses and to put aside all that he is bound to consider on behalf of the House to which he is attached&#x2014;to ask him then to decide that your Lordships have no right to touch a certain Bill because it is a Money Bill, and still later in this measure to decide the other intricate questions that may arise, is a burden too great to put upon the shoulders of any man, and one, moreover, that must have the effect of causing people to challenge the impartiality of the Speaker when he has to stand between the two Houses on a purely political subject.<lb/>
Without impeaching the Speaker's impartiality I wish to say this, that no man who has looked into the precedents can deny that the privilege claimed for the House of Commons has grown, is growing, and ought to be diminished. In the last measure on which this question arose both sides of the House concurred. On the Old Age Pensions Bill, when Amendments were sent back broadcast to this House which had been ruled out of order
<col>1042</col>
by the privilege of the House of Commons, the noble Marquess behind me observed&#x2014;
<quote>"Amendments have been rejected, not on their merits; they have been rejected in spite of the fact that their merits are in some cases incontestable, and that they help to carry out the objects of the framers of the Bill. Privilege has never been asserted in so aggressive a form as in connection with this Bill."</quote>
What was the comment of the noble Earl the Secretary of State for India (Lord Crewe), whom we are all so glad to see amongst us again? The noble Earl said&#x2014;and this is very remarkable and most important for the discussion in which we are now engaged&#x2014;
<quote>"The grievance of the noble Marquess is not against us but against the authorities of the House of Commons, who put a certain interpretation upon the question of privilege."</quote>
So that, reading between the lines, we might even infer that had not the question of privilege been raised on some of these Amendments the noble Earl would have been prepared to assist in placing them in the Bill. I am only going to ask your Lordships to consider two of those Amendments in order chat you may see to what a distance and how far apart we have run from the Speaker of the House of Commons in our notion of privileges.<lb/>
I will trouble you with two cases, one to prove that the Speaker himself, although he is called upon so often to assist the majority in carrying a Bill, is not always listened to when he asks the House not to insist on their privilege. On that occasion the Speaker, with regard to one Amendment&#x2014;an Amendment which prevented a man putting a sum of money into a security at very low interest and then saying he came within the purview of the Old Age Pension Act&#x2014;used these words:
<quote>"It would be the doctrine of privilege run mad to insist upon it in regard to this Amendment."</quote>
But the Government, who had it in their power, advised the House to insist upon their privilege, which in itself is an indication that the Speaker is not able always to guide the House to the position which he thinks right as to those very measures in regard to which he will have to act as umpire. I come to the second case, where I venture to think the judgment of the Speaker was a very extreme one. Lord St. Aldwyn had carried an Amendment in your Lordships' House which everyone
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0526"/>
<col>1043</col>
who had that Bill at heart must have regarded as a fair Amendment. It provided that if two persons living together as husband and wife, each of them having &#x00A3;800 in Consols and therefore an income of &#x00A3;20 a year each, claimed an old age pension, in fairness to others their means ought to be calculated actuarially on their life interest in the sum. No one contested the principle of that Amendment, but the Speaker of the House of Commons felt himself bound to rule that it was a breach of the privilege of that House, and that astonishing provision is at present in the Bill.<lb/>
I have chosen those two instances merely to point out that it is impossible to take an official, however high, who is the mouth-piece of one House and make him the arbiter between the two Houses. What we desire to do when we come to discuss the Amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Cromer, is this, to take the Speaker out of the position which he now occupies as counsel for the House of Commons and put him on the Judicial Bench with an adequate surrounding of impartial men whom he may assist to guide to a decision, but who will themselves influence him by their impartiality and their arguments. I am glad that the noble Viscount opposite did not in his speech shut the door to any such proposal. It would indeed be a sorry thing for this great Parliament if between us we could not find a body of impartial men who could decide what the noble Viscount called a purely Parliamentary question, but one which must be decided as a Parliamentary question and not as a Party one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01749"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose to follow the noble Viscount in his anticipation of the discussion which will arise upon the Amendment standing in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Cromer, and I cannot help thinking that the references that he made to the Amendments on the Old Age Pensions Bill which were refused by the House of Commons on the ground of privilege are more germane to the coming discussion than to the present. The Amendment now before the House proposes to forbid the Speaker of the House of Commons from being the judge as to what is and what is not a Money Bill, and to substitute for him some<lb/>
<i>Viscount Midleton</i><lb/>
<col>1044</col>
judicial body&#x2014;the Court of Appeal. It is quite clear that whenever you have a written Constitution, and for broad practical purposes we may say we have not any such thing&#x2014;in the wide sense we have not any such thing now&#x2014;you must have some body to discriminate between the different classes of business and the different duties that arise under the written Constitution. That is essential and elementary. The noble Viscount proposes that it should be a judicial body. Mr. Balfour in the House of Commons protested against Parliament being placed under the domination of any Judges, however eminent, and no one could feel more strongly than I do how inadvisable it is to have a judicial body to decide a question of this kind. It is not a legal question in the sense in which such matters come before Courts of law. It is a question of mixed law and Constitutional custom, usage, and point of view, of which a great number of the most eminent Judges have no experience whatever. They have never been in Parliament, or, if they have, they have not addicted themselves to the particular study of this matter, and I do not think any question of this sort ought to be decided by them.<lb/>
This Amendment as it will be put from the Chair will decide the point whether the Speaker's opinion is to be the dominating opinion or not. On that I wish to say a few words. The noble Viscount said, and I think with truth, that the position of the Speaker of the House of Commons has in some degree become different in regard to his functions from what it was quite a short time ago. When I first entered the House of Commons there was no rule as to closure of any sort, kind, or description. I will not describe to your Lordships the state of suffering in which a good many of us were placed by reason of that circumstance. At the commencement of my life in the House of Commons it was found necessary to introduce something in the nature of the closure. I say these things because the noble Viscount expressly referred to them. That was resisted with the utmost strength of the Conservative Party, and naturally, for it was a great innovation. But gradually it was found by reason of the pressure of business to be indispensable, and from 1881&#x2013;2 down to quite a short time ago successive amendments of procedure in the House of Commons have been made by both Govern
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0527"/>
<col>1045</col>
ments. The noble Viscount will agree that if one Government was to blame the other is equally to blame. I think neither was to blame; and the noble Viscount will also agree that most of these enlargements of the closure were at the necessary instance of the Government of which he was a member. The remedy for that I will not enter upon now. It is to give the House of Commons a little less work to do and a little more time in which to do it.<lb/>
Now see how that bears on the position of the Speaker. He has to decide constantly on the question whether a matter is to be put to an issue at once. A great deal of difficult work has been put upon him. What has been the result? Everybody who knows the House of Commons will admit that it has not cast the smallest shadow of any kind upon the reputation of the Speaker. He would tell you that the exercise of these functions has not in the smallest degree impaired the reputation, character, or standing of the Speaker of the House of Commons for impartiality. How are you to find a better man than the Speaker for the business we have in hand&#x2014;to decide not what is a legal question but what is a Parliamentary question, a question with close affinity to other questions which he has to decide. The view of the Government is that, after all has been considered&#x2014;and you have to consider not only the merit of this proposal that the Speaker should be the arbiter, but the merit or demerit of the alternative proposals&#x2014;the Speaker is the best tribunal. As I read the Bill, if this Amendment is rejected it does not prevent the raising of the question in the Amendment standing in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Cromer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01750"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I take it that it may be for the convenience of the Committee that we should reserve for future discussion the points raised by the Amendment of my noble friend Lord Cromer, and I will therefore say one word, and one word only, in regard to the limited question which I conceive to be now before us&#x2014;that question whether, if we desire that these duties should not be imposed upon the Speaker of the House of Commons, we desire to put in his place a Court of law. Upon that point I am bound to say that I
<col>1046</col>
agree rather with what has just been said by the noble and learned Lord opposite than with what has been said by my noble friend behind me. I think it is desirable that we should avoid placing the control of these matters in the hands of any Court of law. I can well understand that my noble friend should argue that now that we are about to introduce into this country a Constitution which will, in part at all events, be a paper Constitution, we are coming nearer to the time when the introduction of something like a Supreme Court on the American lines might become inevitable, but I do not think we have arrived there yet; and I have it strongly in my mind that the general desire of Parliament is to maintain its independence of Courts of law. Whatever tribunal may be invoked to decide this question&#x2014;I mean the question whether a particular Bill is or is not a Bill of a purely financial character&#x2014;it seems to me clear that the decision will have to be given, not upon strictly technical and legal grounds, but upon what I think the noble and learned Lord described as broad Parliamentary grounds&#x2014;grounds of general convenience and of common sense. The noble and learned Lord referred to an important speech delivered by the Opposition Leader in the House of Commons, in which Mr. Balfour declared himself decidedly opposed to bringing in a Court of law for this purpose. I have no doubt that speech was read by most of your Lordships and has not been without weight. But I think it right to remind the House of another consideration which I think will be regarded as entitled to weight by your Lordships, and that is this, that in the month of November last year your Lordships passed a Resolution under which it was expressly stated that the question of deciding whether a given Bill was a financial measure or not was to be referred to a Joint Committee presided over by the Speaker of the House of Commons. That, I must say, seems to me to tie our hands considerably. But quite apart from that think, upon the merits of the case, that if we are to have a tribunal it is better that it should not be a Court of law, but a tribunal of the kind which by and by my noble friend on the Cross Benches will propose. I fear, therefore, that I cannot support my noble friend behind me, although many of the arguments which he brought forward were of a kind which were certainly entitled to considerable weight.</membercontribution></p>

I propose, therefore, with your Lordships' permission to speak on all three Amendments at the present stage of our proceedings. These Amendments deal with two subjects&#x2014;first, the constitution of the tribunal which is to decide whether a Bill is or is not a Money Bill; secondly, with the functions which are to be exercised by that tribunal. After what fell from the noble Viscount who moved the previous Amendment and from Lord Midleton, I had not proposed to say anything as to the unsuitability of the Speaker to be the sole judge of whether a Bill is or is not a Money Bill; but I rather understood the noble and learned Lord opposite to contend, in his speech just now, that the Speaker was the best judge, and that obliges me to repeat to a certain extent arguments similar to those already used by the two noble Viscounts to whom I have referred.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01755">I wish to speak with the utmost respect, not merely of the personality of the present Speaker, but also of the high and dignified office which he holds. Successive Speakers have established an honourable and well-deserved reputation for impartiality. But, my Lords, what is the precise nature of that reputation, and on what does it rest? I maintain that it is a reputation for dealing impartially with internal questions
<col>1048</col>
which arise in the course of discussions within the House of Commons itself, and that it is based on the acknowledged fact that when a member of that House, to whatever Party he may belong, is chosen to be Speaker, he at once lays aside all spirit of partisanship and deals impartially with the views laid before him from every quarter of the House. But, my Lords, is there anything to show that this strict spirit of impartiality will be preserved when it is no longer a question of dealing with the internal affairs of one House, but with questions relating to the respective functions of the two Houses? I cannot think that there is. The Speaker would really be almost more than human if he were not influenced by the political atmosphere by which he is surrounded, and if he were not unconsciously biassed by a desire to assert the privileges and extend the functions of the House over which he presides. There is an old law maxim, with which the noble and learned Lord opposite must be well acquainted, to the effect that it is the function of good Judges to enlarge the jurisdiction of the Court to which they belong.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01756"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Old and bad.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01757"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: Will not the Speaker be very much tempted to act on the principles of that maxim? Will he not almost certainly be animated to a certain extent by that <i>esprit de corps</i> which runs through the whole of English political and social life, the spirit which makes every one educated, say, at Eton, pass through life singing <i>Floreat Etona,</i> and which makes every officer in the Army or Navy think that his own regiment or his own ship is incomparably the best of regiments and the best of ships? Moreover, my Lords, what guarantee have we that all future Speakers will possess the high qualifications of Speakers of the past and present? Is it quite certain that in course of time the Speaker will not come to occupy in this country the same position as he holds in the United States&#x2014;that is to say, the position of a strong political partisan? It appears to me that we should not lose sight of this danger. I need not dwell any more on this point. I believe that the majority of your Lordships will agree with me in thinking that it is not a fair or reasonable proposal that a high official of one House should be able
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0529"/>
<col>1049</col>
on his own <i>ipse dixit</i> to curtail the legislative functions of the other House.<lb/>
What tribunal, therefore, should be substituted in the place of the Speaker? I will not dwell on the question of establishing a purely judicial tribunal, for that has been already discussed and settled. I will proceed at once to state how, from my point of view, the Joint Committee which I suggest should be composed. I propose that it should be composed&#x2014;exclusive of the Speaker, who will be Chairman and have a casting vote&#x2014;of fourteen members, namely, seven members of your Lordships' House, and seven of the House of Commons; that the individuals should be chosen jointly by the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker of the House of Commons; and that these two high authorities should make their selections in such a manner as they think best adapted to provide an impartial tribunal. In the course of the discussions which have taken place on this subject, both inside and outside Parliament, a great many suggestions have been made as to the proper constitution of this Joint Committee. I admit that the question presents some practical difficulties, but I submit that it is by no means insoluble. It is very easy in ordinary parlance to express what I believe we all want. We want a Committee which will be composed in about equal proportions of supporters and opponents of the Government of the day. It is more difficult to translate this simple idea into language which will be suitable for insertion in an Act of Parliament. What constitutes being a supporter and what being an opponent of the Government of the day? We have long passed the time when political Parties were represented by a solid phalanx of Tories on one side and of Whigs on the other. It is, I think, regrettable, but it is certainly a fact that the whole tendency of the day is towards the formation of groups. A Liberal Government would, I conceive, find it very difficult, amidst the rather confused jumble of Parties which now exists in the House of Commons, to state precisely who were and who were not to be counted as their supporters, and even in this House a difficulty might arise, although probably in a less acute form. A question which naturally comes home with very special force to myself is, How is an occupant of the Cross Benches to be classed? The Roman jurists had an old saying to the effect that
<col>1050</col>
in civil law all definitions were dangerous. I think it applies in the present instance. I propose, therefore, that no attempt shall be made in the Act of Parliament to define the precise qualifications which it will be incumbent on a member of the Joint Committee to possess, but that the choice should be left to the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Lord Chancellor, subject to the general direction that they must use their best endeavours to constitute an impartial tribunal. I think that every one will agree that the Speaker of the House of Commons is the proper person to select the members from that House. The case of your Lordships' House presents somewhat greater difficulties, for the Lord Chancellor does not, politically speaking, occupy a position analogous to that of the Speaker. He is a member of the Cabinet of the day, and therefore necessarily and avowedly a Party man. But, my Lords, when it is remembered that the Lord Chancellor must always be one of the most eminent lawyers of the day, that he must necessarily be accustomed to deal with matters in a judicial spirit, and that further, not only the present occupant of the Woolsack, if he will permit me to say so, but also his predecessors, to whatever Party they may have belonged, have always commanded in a high degree the esteem and confidence of the whole House, I think it may safely be anticipated that no future Lord Chancellor will abuse his powers by attempting to take any Party advantage, and that he will conscientiously carry out what will be the manifest intention of the Act. As regards the actual members of the Committee, the point is not one on which it is possible to entertain any strong opinion, but I may observe that in adopting an uneven number it will be possible to represent in some degree the normal Party preponderance in each House, and thus to a limited extent introduce the principle of proportional representation.<lb/>
I have heard it said outside that it is useless to appoint a Committee of this sort, for that each set of representatives will be certain to vote on strictly Party lines. I am not altogether sure that this will be the case. We may charitably entertain a pious hope that even political partisans will be occasionally open to conviction and will not be altogether deaf to argument. But even supposing this assumption to be correct I should like to point out that the House of Commons will, at all events, have no cause
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0530"/>
<col>1051</col>
to complain, because in these circumstances the decision will virtually rest, as they propose, with the Speaker. There will, however, be this notable difference between the amended procedure and that proposed in the Bill&#x2014;that the Speaker will at all events have had the advantage of hearing the House of Lords case fully and ably put before him, whereas under the Bill as it now stands there is no certain guarantee that the House of Lords point of view will be considered at all. I have now said all I have to say on the subject of the tribunal. I will only add that it is quite possible that in the course of this debate some suggestions, both as regards the members of the Committee and their mode of appointment, may be made which will commend themselves to your Lordships in preference to that which I have embodied in my Amendments. In that case they will, without doubt, be fully considered.<lb/>
I now proceed to deal with the other main object to which my Amendments are directed&#x2014;namely, the functions of the Committee. When I speak of the functions I am perfectly well aware that at a later stage, under the Amendment which will be moved by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, those functions will be extended to other matters than Money Bills. To discuss that now, however, would be entirely outside the scope of the Amendment before the Committee at this moment. I therefore propose to limit my remarks entirely to the functions of the Committee on Money Bills. Any member of your Lordships' House who attempts to deal with this question lies under a certain disadvantage. That disadvantage is that we all of us labour under the suspicion of wishing, not only to reassert all the powers which constitutionally this House has up to the present time possessed in respect to Money Bills, but even to extend those powers. I gather from some remarks made a few days ago by the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War that I am more especially the victim of these suspicions. I hasten to assure the noble Viscount that, so far at all events as I am myself concerned, he may dismiss these suspicions from his mind. Without going into the question of what ought or ought not to be, in theory, the functions of a Second Chamber in respect to financial measures, I take as my point of departure the Resolution of the noble Marquess to which I have already alluded and to which this House<lb/>
<i>The Earl of Cromer.</i><lb/>
<col>1052</col>
has already agreed. It is worded in the following terms&#x2014;
<quote>"The Lords are prepared to forego their Constitutional right to reject or amend Money Bills which are purely financial in character, provided that effectual provision is made against tacking."</quote>
The only practical question to be discussed is, as it appears to me, whether the Bill now under consideration provides any effectual provision against tacking.<lb/>
The intentions of the Government on this subject have been stated over and over again in the most positive terms. The subject is so important that I feel constrained to trouble your Lordships with some quotations from Ministerial utterances. On April 11 the Prime Minister, in dealing with the clause we are now discussing, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The object of the Government on this Definition Clause is two-fold. It is, in the first place, not to enlarge the boundaries within which, as we believe, Constitutional practice and usage has established the authority of the House of Commons in matters of finance. On the other hand, it is to include by a statutory definition everything which is within the boundaries so established by usage. That is our governing principle."</quote>
And again later, on the same day, he said&#x2014;
<quote>"These words are most careful to exclude, first, the possibility of including in this Clause a Bill financial in form or title of which the object of its other provisions was the real and governing purpose; and, secondly, to exclude the annexation or tacking on to a financial Bill of extraneous provisions intended to be applied for political or social purposes."</quote>
Your Lordships will observe that the identical phrase used by the Prime Minister&#x2014;namely, "governing purpose"&#x2014;is introduced into the Amendment standing in my name on the Paper. Mr. Winston Churchill also used very similar language on May 9. The intentions of the Government are therefore quite clear.<lb/>
But, my Lords, in spite of some minor and salutary changes which were made during the passage of the Bill through the House of Commons, can it be seriously contended that the Bill as it now stands gives effect to those intentions? I cannot think that it does. I maintain that this Bill provides no sort of adequate guarantees against tacking. There is practically no limit to the political and social changes which may not be effected by "the imposition, alteration, or regulation of taxation." And, my Lords, it is especially to be observed that the Bill does not in any way authorise the Speaker to include in his
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0531"/>
<col>1053</col>
purview of the situation the political and social changes which any alteration of the fiscal system may make. He has merely to ask himself whether the Bill on the face of it ostensibly deals only with the imposition, alteration, or regulation of a tax, and unless he can answer this question in the negative he will have no option but to sign the certificate including the measure in the category of Money Bills.<lb/>
What guarantee is there that under the Bill as it now stands a 50 per cent. Income Tax will not be imposed, or a tax placed on landed and other property which will virtually deal a death-blow to all property? None whatever. And yet, my Lords, surely measures of this sort, which would involve social and political changes of the highest importance, cannot reasonably be regarded as mere Money Bills. I know I shall be told that we must rely on the commonsense of the people of this country not to sanction monstrous proposals of this sort. I am perfectly aware that in a democratic country we must rely ultimately on the commonsense of the democracy. But, my Lords, I submit that vague generalities of this description, which may equally well be used to justify the most subversive changes in the laws of this country, are not a sufficient answer to my criticism. We have, I think, a full right to claim that there should be a definite statutory provision which will, as far as legislation can prevent it, put a stop to any attempt being made to evade the spirit of the Act of Parliament. We want, at all events, a clear provision that the Speaker and whatever other tribunal may eventually be instituted shall be authorised to consider whether the real and ostensible object of any proposed measure are identical, and whether under cover of a Money Bill political and social changes are not contemplated which would reasonably bring the Bill within the category of general legislation. The object of my Amendment is to bring these considerations, which are at present excluded, specifically within the purview of the authority which has to decide.<lb/>
To sum up, my Lords, in respect to the tribunal I ask the Government to act in the spirit of the declaration made by Lord Crewe in this House, which was to the following effect&#x2014;
<quote>"I may perhaps venture to say that if some other tribunal within Parliament can be found which can be expected to carry out these duties with equal authority and impartiality, this is not a matter we should regard as vital to the Bill."</quote>
<col>1054</col>
Although I do not wish to forestall what the noble Viscount opposite will say on my Amendment, I hope I gathered from his preliminary remarks earlier this evening that he is prepared to give this proposal reasonable consideration. In respect to tacking, I merely ask His Majesty's Government to place on the Statute Book a provision which is in entire conformity with their declared intentions. I maintain that these proposals are reasonable and moderate and although, in common with many of your Lordships, I hold strong opinions as regards the conduct of His Majesty's Government throughout this Constitutional crisis, I have endeavoured to the best of my ability to advocate them in reasonable and moderate language. I would earnestly appeal to noble Lords opposite to meet these suggestions in the spirit in which they are brought forward&#x2014;that is to say, in a spirit of conciliation. Other important issues await discussion, but if this very important question of the treatment of Money Bills could be settled by a reasonable compromise, a considerable step forward would, at all events, have been taken to arrive at that general settlement of the Constitutional question which I believe every sensible man in this country earnestly desires.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01759"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no one could have listened to the speech of the noble Earl who has just addressed the Committee without having a sense of the sincerity of his desire to do what he thought to be best in getting over the difficulties with which we are faced. If I have to criticise his arguments it will be largely upon this ground, that I think his propositions owe their support to arguments of a too abstract kind, and have too little reference to the actual living Constitution which is ours, and to the history and traditions which we are bound to recognise. It is not possible to go back to a state of things where you have a blank sheet of paper on which to write. The noble Viscount opposite referred, by way of illustration, to the change in the position of the Speaker. He contrasted the position of the Speaker as it is now with what it was in the days of the Tudors, when he was the exponent of the wishes of the Sovereign in the House of Commons, and when the form of a Bill used to begin
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0532"/>
<col>1055</col>
with a petition to the Throne. The position of the Speaker as it is now is the result of evolution, and the result of functions of the House of Commons as they have come to be defined with the growth of our unwritten Constitution.<lb/>
The noble Earl said he wished to prevent tacking. I agree that we do not want to enable tacking to take place. We desire to prevent it. But how does the noble Earl propose to prevent it The Joint Committee is to have the power to declare that a Bill comes not under the category of Clause 1, which deals with finance, but of Clause 2, which deals with general legislation. The position of the Speaker under this Bill, and necessarily also the position of the Joint Committee, is a statutory position. There is no appeal against their decision. Something that fell from the noble Viscount made me think that he had it in his mind that the House of Commons could control the Speaker if the Speaker were taken as the judge here. That is not as I read the Bill. If the Amendment were carried, the Joint Committee would have statutory authority also absolutely free from the control of Parliament. Under the noble Earl's Amendment the Joint Committee could declare a Bill which was financial on the face of it, because of what they conceived to be its purpose and its policy, to fall within Clause 2 and therefore to be the subject of consideration under a wholly different procedure. The effect of that would be to give to this House larger powers than this House has claimed to possess for many a long day past. The old Resolutions of 1671 and 1678 are, I believe, Resolutions which your Lordships have in practice at all events accepted. You have given up explicitly the Constitutional right to reject a Money Bill; and even upon the question of amending a Money Bill it is by no means clear that your Lordships put forward your right in an abstract form. But the Amendment of the noble Earl does not confine the situation to the position in which it is at the present day, in which the House of Commons exercises control over the general character of finance, but enables the policy underlying that finance to be taken into account.<lb/>
The noble Earl referred to a speech which I made on the Second Reading of this Bill in criticism of something that fell from himself. I think I was right in that criticism, and I am rather confirmed by<lb/>
<i>Viscount Haldane,</i><lb/>
<col>1056</col>
what he said to-day. He means by tacking something quite different from what we understand by tacking. He means by tacking that a Finance Bill is to be altogether colourless and to have no policy in it. If you applied that definition you would at once give this House control over a number of Bills and over measures of a character as to which control has never been assumed. Take the Appropriation Bill&#x2014;a Bill which your Lordships have never amended or rejected. What is the Appropriation Bill but a Bill embodying in many cases general policy? It is a Bill which gives effect to the Votes of the House of Commons for Supply for carrying out the policy of the Government of the day. Very often most important questions of general policy come in under that Bill, and the Appropriation Bill would come within the words of the noble Earl's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01760"><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: What I mean by tacking is what the Prime Minister described as the annexation or tacking on to a financial Bill of extraneous provisions intended to be applied for political or social purposes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01761"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I am dealing with the noble Earl's Amendment, and it is an Amendment which carries things very much further than the question of tacking. The second Amendment which the noble Earl has on the Paper provides that if, in the opinion of the Joint Committee, the governing purpose of a Bill or of any portion of a Bill is such as to bring the Bill within the category of general legislation, the Bill is to be subject to the provisions of Clause 2. A Bill introduced by the House of Commons in order to give effect to the financial policy of the Government would become subject to this kind of consideration. The truth is, it is impossible to define in writing what is general policy and what is not. There is hardly a financial Bill which comes from the House of Commons which does not embody general policy. A definition of tacking may be difficult to give, but it is clear that there are things which are undoubtedly in the category of tacking. One gets at these things by illustration. It is impossible to define them. You cannot separate general policy from finance, and there are Finance Bills which do not aim at tacking but which do bring in general policy. That is my first criticism on the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0533"/>
<col>1057</col>
Amendment&#x2014;that it goes further than the situation at the present time, and that it would in effect repeal many of the things in the Resolutions of 1671 and 1678 which now form part of our Constitution, and would diminish the position of the House of Commons. But I cannot separate in my mind the proposal to set up this Joint Committee from other proposals with respect to it not moved by the noble Earl but to be moved by the noble Marquess opposite. I do not propose to discuss them, but I do feel that the introduction of this Joint Committee is the introduction of a principle which is wholly foreign to anything we have yet known. It is a statutory Committee to have enormous powers&#x2014;the power to say that the country has not sufficiently pronounced on a subject, and to refer the matter to a Referendum. That is a proposal of great magnitude. It is not a proposal which can be limited, and it is not limited even under the words of the noble Earl, to tacking.<lb/>
Let me for a moment glance at the other difficulties. I will put out of count those that I have stated, in order to ask your Lordships to come face to face with what would be to my mind the overwhelming difficulties of procedure in the House of Commons if this Amendment were carried. In the passage of a Money Bill through the other House there are Amendments constantly brought up which it becomes the duty of the Speaker as the guardian of the rules of order to rule out, and for the purpose of ruling them out, either as not having originated in the proper form or as not being germane to the character of the Bill, the Speaker has to give rulings from time to time and rapidly. But supposing this proposal were carried he could not give those decisions, and if he could not do that he could not discharge his present functions as Speaker. He could not give a ruling without calling together the Committee, and in that case the condition of business in the House of Commons would become even more congested. What has been the reason for the closure? It has been the want of time in the House of Commons to deal with the increasing mass of business which it has to handle. Until you relieve the House of Commons from that mass of business the duty of the Speaker must be heavy. But how much heavier would it be if business had to be interrupted because
<col>1058</col>
the Speaker could not prejudge questions by giving rulings without calling together the Committee? Therefore if this Amendment were carried, not only would it involve enormous difficulties of the kind I referred to in the earlier portion of my remarks, but it would paralyse the conduct of business in the House of Commons. It is quite true, as the noble Earl said, that our Constitution is one which in theory leaves you defenceless against all sorts of wild people whom the imagination can conjure up getting into power, but I am not sure that there has been any great danger shown of our proceeding in that fashion. Undoubtedly legislation is getting increasingly democratic. That is because the democracy is more and more getting the control of affairs. You cannot stop that by any measure you can introduce. You have to accept it and make the best of the situation as it is. You have to judge the proposal contained in the noble Earl's Amendment not merely as an abstract proposition to be written on a blank sheet of paper, but in the light of the actual situation to-day and the position of Parliament and its responsibility to the country; and if this Amendment were passed in such a form as we have it now, not only would it lead to embarrassment of public business, but it would run counter to the very proposals which seem to me to be the foundation of the Constitution as it is to-day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01762"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am placed in some difficulty, because there are surely two subjects which have become somewhat confused in the course of this discussion. There is the subject which is directly raised by the Amendment of the noble Earl, and which places before the Committee the question whether the tribunal to decide upon Money Bills should or should not be the Speaker of the House of Commons. That, I thought, was the subject directly raised by the Amendment, and the one to which our speeches ought to be directed if they were strictly in order. There is the further question, if the Speaker of the House of Commons is not to be the tribunal, whether there can be suggested from this side of the House or from any quarter a better tribunal, and upon that point the noble Earl on the Cross Benches has submitted to us his ideas. Then there is the further question, what is to be the procedure of the Committee when it sets to work to
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0534"/>
<col>1059</col>
decide whether or not a Bill is a Money Bill. I confess to being in absolute doubt whether I am to discuss all three, or whether the proper procedure would not be to recall the Committee to the direct order of our business and to say a little more than has hitherto been said upon the question of the Speaker. Perhaps your Lordships will permit me, as I feel somewhat strongly on the question of the Speaker, to say a word or two at any rate to start with on that point. I confess I was very much disappointed with the remarks which fell from the noble and learned Earl the Lord Chancellor. I gathered from him what I take to be the intention of His Majesty's Government&#x2014;namely, that they mean to adhere to the position as to the prerogatives and the authority which they are giving to the Speaker of the House of Commons by this Bill. I do not know whether I am justified in drawing that inference from the few sentences of the noble and learned Earl relating to the subject, but unless he contradicts me I must proceed on that hypothesis.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01763"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I said that in our view it was the best proposal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01764"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: In the first place that is a great disappointment to us, because it throws absolutely to the winds the hopes that were undoubtedly aroused in our bosoms by the passage in the speech of the noble Earl the Secretary of State for India which was quoted by Lord Cromer. When the noble Earl, Lord Crewe, told us in a previous debate that, if some other tribunal than the Speaker within Parliament could be found which might be expected to carry out these duties with equal authority and impartiality, that was not a matter which the Government would regard as vital to the Bill, we certainly were encouraged to think that if we were in a position to submit a suggestion for such a tribunal to this House&#x2014;a tribunal to be created within Parliament and a tribunal which I venture to think would carry with it great weight and authority&#x2014;at least it would receive respectful consideration from His Majesty's Government even if it were not adopted by them. And there was another reason that might have led us to hope for some modification on this point. I allude to the debates in the House of Commons. Probably most of us, even if<lb/>
<i>Lord Curzon of Kedleston,</i><lb/>
<col>1060</col>
we did not have the pleasure of attending those debates ourselves, at any rate followed them more or less closely in the newspapers, and I shall be in the recollection of your Lordships when I say that on no part of the Bill was a more destructive and unanswered and unanswerable criticism directed against the proposals of the Government than on that which related to the Speaker of the House of Commons. Yet those arguments appear to be thrown away, for when we come to this House the Lord Chancellor, in a couple of sentences, adheres to the position which has been taken up by His Majesty's Government. He seemed to regard the matter as so much settled that it was hardly worth while for him to give us any arguments in its favour.<lb/>
As we have not been favoured with any arguments in support of the proposal in the Bill, may I be permitted to give one or two arguments against it? I understood the Lord Chancellor to say that it was a most reasonable thing that the Speaker of the House of Commons should be asked to exercise these functions because they were more or less strictly analogous to those which he at present discharges in the House of Commons. Speaking as an old House of Commons man&#x2014;and there are many in this House&#x2014;I say that there is really the widest difference between the two. At the present moment the Speaker of the House of Commons has, roughly speaking, to discharge two sets of duties. In the first place, he is the custodian of the Rules and the order of the House of Commons. As such he does not utter <i>obiter dicta.</i> He is largely guided by the volume of precedents; to that he adds, no doubt, from time to time; but, broadly speaking, those are functions confined entirely to the business and order of the House of Commons. Then he has a second function to perform as the custodian of the privileges of the House of Commons. It is for him to say, when Bills go down from this House or when Amendments are introduced by this House, whether in his judgment those Bills or Amendments violate the privileges of the House of Commons as he conceives them to be. But when he makes that pronouncement it is common knowledge that he commits nobody beyond the House to which his pronouncement is addressed. He is laying down the law for the House of Commons. He is not laying down the law
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0535"/>
<col>1061</col>
for the House of Lords; and has it not happened over and over again within the last fifty years that the version of privilege which has been given by the Speaker in the House of Commons, binding though it may be upon that Chamber, has been repudiated by us&#x2014;that we have expressed our dissent from it? We may not have contested the point, but we at any rate have not accepted it. Also should not this be borne in mind, that there has always hitherto remained in the hands of the House of Lords the power in the last resort, if they disagreed with what happened in the House of Commons, to adhere to their own Amendments and throw out the Bill? That makes the whole difference in the situation.<lb/>
What are you going to do now? You are going to place upon this great official duties no longer confined to the interpretation of the privileges or to the enforcement of order in the House of Commons. You are going to make him decide political issues of the greatest importance. You are going to empower him to say not merely whether a Bill is or is not a Money Bill&#x2014;that might seem to be a question on which he was well qualified to pronounce&#x2014;but also to say whether a Bill, if he pronounces it to be a Money Bill, shall be brought before the House of Lords with no power of amendment whatsoever; or, if he pronounces it not to be a Money Bill, shall go through a course of two years' dispute in the two Houses of Parliament. In other words it is proposed to put it in the hands of the principal officer of the House of Commons to say whether a measure introduced by the Government is to be carried into law in a single session or shall be protracted over two or three years. Those are entirely novel functions, which raise grave issues of politics, and which it will be most undesirable to ask the Speaker to perform. The Speaker surely is not appointed for functions of that description. The Speaker is selected partly because of his high character, partly because of his dignified manners, partly because of his regard for the privileges of the House of Commons, and most of all because he is not a politician or a partisan. I know of no case in modern times in which a strong partisan has been selected for the office of Speaker. Yet in future the Government are going to call on him to discharge these difficult
<col>1062</col>
political duties which must almost inevitably throw him into that category.<lb/>
Much has been said about the great character which has been built up by recent occupants of the Speaker's Chair. No doubt in the last forty or fifty years the authority and prestige of that Chair have increased. There is now sitting in this House the noble Viscount, Lord Peel, whose manner of conducting the business of the House of Commons from the Chair is a memory which all of us who sat under him will for ever cherish. A more dignified or more noble exhibition of dignity and impartiality in the discharge of a Speaker's duties it is impossible for any man to imagine, and that high character has been carried on by his successors. But it does not follow that it will be eternal. In the future one might conceivably have a Speaker suddenly called upon to decide these momentous points in the early days of office before he had years and authority behind him; or there might be a weak Speaker, who bore in mind that Parliament was likely soon to come to an end, and that his own re-election would depend on the votes of those who sat before him. There might even conceivably be a partisan Speaker. Would it not be a danger to hand over to him the great authority contemplated under the Bill? I agree that the impartiality and prestige of the Speaker's Chair are one of the great assets of the nation. Speakers of the House of Commons were once partisan, but they have ceased to be so in this country, while corresponding officers have remained partisan in other countries. I hope nothing will be done to impair the great authority which we have so laboriously and successfully built up.<lb/>
Before I pass on to the question of the Committee, there is one other point I should like to take about the Speaker as Chairman of a Committee. It may be said&#x2014;I am not certain it was not hinted at&#x2014;that if you appoint a Committee and then put your Speaker as Chairman of the Committee, you are practically calling upon him to perform the same or similar duties to those which the Government themselves propose to place upon him. That remark is greeted with applause by the noble Viscount the Leader of the House. Is there really any analogy between the two cases? There is a great difference between calling upon the Speaker alone, in private,
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0536"/>
<col>1063</col>
without any consultation so far as one knows with other authorities, to decide these difficult questions, and providing him with a Committee drawn impartially from the two Houses of Parliament and composed, as I am certain it would be, of the best men in both Houses. I do not believe such a Committee would be animated by partisan feeling. In these questions I think some people are inclined to take too low a view of human nature. I believe if you have a Committee of this description appointed by Statesmen who hold the position of the noble and learned Lord in this House and the Speaker in the House of Commons you will get a body of men animated with the sincerest desire to give their decision impartially and without regard to the interests of the Party to which they belong. And if you did get such a body as that, am I to be told that it is not to the advantage of the Speaker to hear their deliberations before a decision is arrived at? Am I to be told that it would not be a great advantage to them to have the Speaker in the Chair and to listen to his advice? Am I to be told that there is any analogy between the two cases of the Speaker deciding alone and the Speaker assisted by such a tribunal as that proposed by the noble Earl?<lb/>
Then I may pass on&#x2014;and I can only assume I am in order, otherwise the speakers before me were equally out of order&#x2014;to deal with the points that have been made against this Committee. The noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, said that the principle of such a Committee would be wholly new. No doubt the application of the principle is new because the situation is new. You have a Government introducing revolutionary proposals. How can you possibly hope to deal with those proposals or cope with them by ordinary measures? Our plans have to be adjusted to their proposals. If that answer is thought, as it seems to be, quite inadequate, is it not fair to point out that the principle of conference between members of the two Houses of Parliament is one to which noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite have frequently signified their adhesion during the last year or two, and one which figured prominently in the proposals of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman for dealing with the Constitutional situation and was alluded to pointedly and with great approbation by the noble Earl, Lord Crewe, last year? It was contemplated<lb/>
<i>Lord Curzon of Kedleston.</i><lb/>
<col>1064</col>
that if there was a disagreement between the two Houses over a Bill it might be settled by a Conference between a small number of members of both Houses. I cannot, therefore, see anything startling in making such a body the arbiter on the question of Money Bills.<lb/>
Then the noble Viscount went on to say that the existence of such a Committee would give great powers to this House. I confess I did not understand that objection. In what way does it add to the powers of this House? As I understand, it is proposed that the composition of the Committee shall be, half and half, from members of the two Houses of Parliament seven of one and the same number of the other, with the Speaker in the chair. In other words, the members of this House would never be in a majority, and in the case of a division between them and the Speaker voting they might be overruled. But it is most unreasonable to suppose that members of the House of Lords will all vote as House of Lords men, and that, on the other hand, House of Commons men will vote as House of Commons men. Surely we may presume to think that they will vote as sensible men and as patriots. I fail to see the situation which the noble Viscount predicates, that the presence on this Committee of a certain number of members from this House would add to the power or authority of this House. I may, of course, have quite failed to understand his argument, and it may, perhaps, be put before us later on; but I am unable to see that the members of the Committee belonging to this House will give any more to this House of Parliament than the corresponding members of the Committee from the House of Commons will give to the other House of Parliament.<lb/>
In the course of his remarks upon that point the noble Viscount made one admission for which I think we ought to be grateful. He said that there is hardly a Finance Bill which comes up to this House that does not involve some question of general policy. My Lords, that is the whole of our contention. It is because finance is so inextricably interwoven with these other questions that we want some impartial tribunal to decide this matter in the first place, and are not willing to leave it to the arbitrament of a single man. Then there was one small point made by the noble Viscount which again I did not quite understand. He seemed to
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0537"/>
<col>1065</col>
contemplate that the existence of this Committee would paralyse the conduct of business in the House of Commons, that there would constantly be occasions arising in which the Speaker would, so to speak, have to leave the Chair and run away to a room in the background, collect his Committee together, and find out what they thought. Surely we do not contemplate anything so absurd as that. I understand the noble Earl proposes that this Committee should be set up at the beginning of the session and that it should deal at a preliminary stage with the Bills that it is contemplated by the Government to introduce.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01772"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I assume that the Speaker will discharge on those occasions exactly the same functions as he performs at the present moment. I do not conceive that those are the cases which the Committee will be called upon to assist him in deciding. It is rather difficult to carry on this discussion across the Table, and I have no doubt other speakers, and the noble Earl himself, will be prepared to elaborate it later on. Starting with the question of the Speaker, I hope I have not unduly deviated into the other branches of the discussion which were taken up by noble Lords opposite. All I will say, in conclusion, is that we shall have opportunities of discussing this Committee later on when the larger and wider functions proposed to be attached to it will come under consideration. But do let this House pause before it accepts the advice of His Majesty's Government and decides to impose upon the Speaker of the House of Commons functions foreign to his office, functions entirely different from those which he has hitherto been called upon to discharge, and functions which must, if thrust upon him, bring his office into disrepute and impair the great position which a series of renowned Speakers have built up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01773"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I need not say that I entirely subscribe to the noble Lord's panegyric to a great Speaker under whom both he and I had the honour of serving, and I entirely agree with what he has said as to the character of past Speakers and the character which we may expect future Speakers to maintain. We are asked what attitude we really take with regard to the advantage of the Speaker of the House of Commons being the deciding authority upon the point whether a Bill is or is not a Money Bill. If noble Lords opposite can persuade us that there is any better plan of erecting a deciding authority I can promise that we will listen to it. But this at all events is certain, that nothing will induce the Government to assent to this Joint Committee. And why? Lord Cromer very naturally said that his proposal affects not only Clause 1 but Clause 2, and is deeply

involved also with the Amendment which stands on the Paper in the name of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition. On that we shall have a great deal to say, and so will noble Lords in every part of the House, when we come to it, because I think we apprehend that if that Amendment in its present form is maintained anything like a possible agreement between us on these Benches and noble Lords opposite vanishes.<lb/>
As to the Committee proposed by my noble friend, does the House realise how that Committee would be composed? It is to be composed of seven members of this House, seven members of the House of Commons, and the Speaker, who is only to have a casting vote. They are to be men chosen by the Lord Chancellor and by the Speaker&#x2014;men of impartial mind. Whether those are the exact words or not, we know what is meant. That sounds very easy, and I cordially agree with the noble Lord in thinking that we do habitually assume that the character of noble Lords here and of members of the House of Commons is lower than it really is, and that they will abandon themselves to purely Party or even factious purposes with a culpable facility and readiness. But, nevertheless, when you get a large body of fifteen gentlemen I do not believe it is possible, taking a high view of the character of public men in both Houses, to divest such a body entirely of Party considerations. Supposing my noble and learned friend in this House were to choose seven noble Lords to decide upon an issue of this kind&#x2014;to decide whether a Bill is or is not a purely financial Bill, or whether it does not involve all kinds of social and ulterior considerations&#x2014;I do not believe, speaking candidly, that we should assume it was quite easy for my noble and learned friend to be certain that he would find seven men who would, when it came to a critical point&#x2014;say the Budget&#x2014;divest themselves entirely of Party considerations. He might, of course, look to the Cross Benches, but I am not at all sure that he would find such men even in that latitude. Now look at the House of Commons. Men are sent there as politicians. They are not sent there to meditate upon human affairs at large; they are sent there as Party men, and what is commonly meant by this choice of men of broad minds and flexible convictions, and so forth, is that you will have the seven men chosen from the House of Commons either cranks or Party nobodies. I submit that it would be<lb/>
<i>Viscount Morley of Blackburn.</i><lb/>
<col>1068</col>
exceedingly difficult to constitute a fair and impartial tribunal in the nature of a Joint Committee with the object of deciding political questions, because the effect of that decision is a political and Party effect.<lb/>
Some language used by the noble Lord opposite just now, and by a noble Lord previously, implies that this Joint Committee is simply to advise the Speaker, who would advise the House of Commons. It is not merely that. The Joint Committee is to decide and to impose upon both Houses its own view of the question submitted to it. That is a very serious thing. You want something much more than fourteen meditative minds, and you certainly will not get fourteen meditative minds. You will get fourteen upright men, straight men, and careful men, but they will be essentially politicians. What are they to do? What is the real object of the Joint Committee. To construe the definition of a Money Bill given in the first clause of the Bill under discussion. It is no good talking in this high vein about impartial men. In one sense it would be wise to have a Court of law as the tribunal. But you do not want men to construe this defining clause from the technical and strict view of a Court of law; you want men well acquainted with Parliamentary practice and usage, men of Parliamentary habits of mind. I can imagine there being added&#x2014;I hope the Committee will not think that I am for a moment recommending it&#x2014;one or two men of special and almost technical acquaintance with the practice and custom in respect of Money Bills. That might or might not be an advantage. I myself do not believe that the Speaker would have any more important decisions to make than he has to make at present. The noble Lord obviously foresaw one of the answers that would be made to his argument. He said how unfair and disadvantageous it was to throw on the Speaker alone this invidious duty which the Bill proposes that he should discharge. I submit that it would be far more invidious for him to go against the seven men whom he had himself put on the Joint Committee&#x2014;at all events, it would be just as invidious for him to go against the views and wishes of those seven men as under the provisions of the Bill&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01774"><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: Why are we to assume that the seven men will be all united? It is exactly that against which I protest. Why are we to assume

<col>1069</col>
that the seven men of the House of Commons will be united and that the seven men of the House of Lords will be united?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01775"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I am rather astonished that the noble Lord puts that point. He knows very well, with his immense experience of the House of Commons and his considerable experience of this House, that supposing a Chancellor of the Exchequer brings in a Budget which is palatable to his own Party it is probable that out of the seven men of the House of Commons four or five of them will represent the Government view. You could not get seven whose minds were entirely empty, and they would not be worth very much if you could. The probability, almost the certainty, is that five of the seven from the House of Commons would go one way, and you are putting the Speaker in a tremendously invidious position if you tell him to overrule those men. Surely we have had in the last few months in this House evidence enough that men go with their Party, and of course these fourteen men, or most of them at all events, would go with their Party, and I for one should respect them the more for it. Now there is one remarkable feature in my noble friend's proposal. This Joint Committee is to be set to work either at the request of a Minister of the Crown or by a Resolution of either House of Parliament. I think I am right in that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01776"><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: Quite right.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01777"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I cannot for the life of me make out why on earth a Minister of the Crown should request the Joint Committee to set to work to find out whether his Bill is or is not in order. I cannot understand it. The Minister has his majority in the House of Commons, or else he would not be a Minister. He brings in his Bill, and he is supported by that majority or else he would have to give up his office. What is the sense, then, of allowing him to move the Joint Committee? Perhaps my noble friend will explain that, but it puzzles me enormously. It leads me to suspect that my noble friend&#x2014;and I say so, as he knows, with profound respect&#x2014;has not quite thought out all that his proposals involve, or else he would not have put in a proviso of that kind.<lb/>
Do remember&#x2014;and it is almost the only other observation with which I will trouble
<col>1070</col>
the Committee&#x2014;that Clause 1 is a clause which does nothing but put into legal form, according to the best judgment and knowledge that we have been able to procure, what has been the custom and practice of an indefinitely long number of years. We do not want a Joint Committee to determine matters of that kind. The Speaker decides now questions more important than can arise upon the construction of the definition of a Money Bill, and on that ground, at this stage at all events, we must adhere to the placing of this authority in the hands of the Speaker, who by his office, his history, and his experience is better acquainted with what the custom and practice has been than this Joint Committee, as to which I am afraid. I shall have to say a great deal more before we get to the end of the Bill. In the meantime we cannot accept the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01778"><member>EARL FORTESCUE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the argument of the noble Viscount who has last spoken amounts practically to this, that the Speaker of the House of Commons is the only person who can be trusted to deal impartially with questions that may arise as to whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not. Very likely the present Speaker of the House of Commons or any of his predecessors would have been more capable of dealing with such questions than any possible tribunal that could be imagined, but, if we may judge at all by what has happened elsewhere, the giving to a Speaker of great political powers has a remarkable effect upon his position and upon the attitude he assumes. I have been looking at what has happened in America, according to Mr. James Bryce in his well-known book on "The American Commonwealth." He says there that the Speaker of the House of Representatives in his title and attributes is taken from the English original, but the character of the office has greatly altered from that of the original. He has immense political power. It is not necessary for me to amplify what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, as to the great political power which would be given to the Speaker by the proposals of the Bill we are discussing. It would lie with him to decide whether any Bill was to be debated and decided on exclusively by the House of Commons, or whether it was to be subject to prolonged discussion in this House and outside. Mr. Bryce, in a very few words, draws a striking contrast between the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The note of the Speaker
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0540"/>
<col>1071</col>
of the House of Commons, Mr. Bryce further pointed out, is impartiality; custom as strong as law forbids him to render help to his own side even by private advice; it makes little difference to any English Party whether the occupant of the Chair comes from their own side or not. But of the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States Mr. Bryce says that he may, and does, advise the leaders of his Party privately; that he is expected to serve his Party in all possible directions; that a "certain measure" of fairness to his opponents is required of him, and that he must not palpably exercise the rules of the House to their disadvantage though he may decide all doubtful points against them. That official, as regards his title and attributes, and, I believe, his original functions, was modelled, we are told, on the English original. The change I have mentioned has been brought about by giving him immense political power, and I do not think anybody can argue that the Bill we are discussing does not give immense political power to the Speaker of the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01779"><member>LORD MARCHAMLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I only desire to say one word on one particular point. I cannot help thinking that the Amendment proposed by the noble Earl is a step in the wrong direction, and a very dangerous step. The danger will, I think, be apparent when it comes to the constitution of the so-called Joint Committee. The Bill proposes that in all cases the decision as to whether a Bill is or is not a Money Bill should be in the hands of the Speaker&#x2014;that he should be the sole arbiter. I have the greatest possible respect for the judgment and the impartiality of the Speaker, a respect which has been shared by every speaker throughout this debate. I do not think it is in any way his wish, nor is it to his advantage&#x2014;and I have had some experience in these matters&#x2014;to aggravate or increase difficulties between the House of Lords and the House of Commons. It is rather his business, if possible, to smooth difficulties away. Such matters are questions of the most anxious consideration and deliberation by the Speaker. It is not as if he acted, as some suggest, if I may so describe it, "off his own bat." He refers to precedents, consults with his Clerk, and with his legal advisers in the House of Commons, and he never comes to a decision without the matter having first been well thought out. Some noble Lords seem to regard the<lb/>
<i>Earl Fortescue.</i><lb/>
<col>1072</col>
Speaker as a hot-headed youth who rushes in and gives ill-considered decisions. Nothing of the sort. He desires to be absolutely impartial and to act in a strictly fair and unbiassed way.<lb/>
What is the alternative proposed by the noble Earl&#x2014;an alternative which I may say deals not with the question of Money Bills alone; it is one that is going to be developed, if we may judge by the Amendments on the Paper in the name of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition. The noble Earl proposes a Joint Committee which is bound, in my judgment, to be a political Committee and to assume the political aspect of the Government of the day. The noble Lord says that surely it ought not to be impossible to get seven impartial men in the House of Commons and the same number in the House of Lords. The noble Lord has greater faith in human nature than I have. He thinks that everything is for the best; that all men are good and true, and honest, unbiassed, and impartial, and that they will do their duty. The noble Lord has been in India lately and it may be so there, but it is not so in the House of Commons. Just see how this Joint Committee is going to be selected. There is to be a delegation of seven Members from the House of Commons chosen by the Speaker or by the Whips. All these Committees are bound to be chosen and selected in proportion to the representation of the Parties in the House of Commons. Whether they are selected by the Whips or by the Speaker they are bound to give a majority to the Government of the day, and I suppose the representation would probably be: the Government four; the Opposition, two; and the Irish, one. Then we come to the seven noble Lords appointed by the Lord Chancellor in this House. Consider the invidious and painful task you are putting upon the Lord Chancellor. It is one that he cannot carry out to the satisfaction of both sides of the House. Supposing the Lord Chancellor says, "I recognise there is bound to be a majority in the House of Commons delegation of one in favour of the Government, and I will neutralise that by appointing four of the Opposition and three of the Government." How could he either neutralise that or accord to the Opposition the majority vote in that Committee? He could not do so. Unlike the Speaker in the House of Commons he
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0541"/>
<col>1073</col>
is a politician and a Party man, and he would be bound to consider the complexion of that Committee. He could not appoint a delegation from this House that would give the control of that Joint Committee to members of the Opposition. He would neutralise all the desires of his own Party if he did. I am certain that the Lord Chancellor would do his duty, but at any rate he would be in a dangerous and invidious position and one which no Lord Chancellor would desire to be in.<lb/>
To sum up, you have at the present time in the Speaker an arbiter with whom every noble Lord who has spoken to-night has expressed himself satisfied. It has not been even hinted that the Speaker would not act fairly in these matters. Instead of him you are proposing to set up what is bound to be a political Committee&#x2014;the Whips would endeavour to make it a political Committee. It will not only be Money Bills that will be referred to it, for, if you read one of the Amendments in the name of the noble Marquess, a vast variety of topics, embracing almost every subject that comes before the House of Commons, will have to be so submitted. The suggestion of the noble Earl is, in my opinion, a mistake. I feel sure that if noble Lords carry the Amendment they will do wrong, and will make this Committee a battle-ground for politicians in the future. It would, I think, be better to leave the decision in the hands of the Speaker of the House of Commons, as the Bill proposes.</membercontribution></p>

To-night the noble Lord who has just spoken, and spoken with the authority of a late Chief Whip, tells us that there are not to be found in the House of Commons seven impartial men. He made some other remarks about this House, though his acquaintance with this House is not so great as his acquaintance with the House of Commons. But I was very much surprised when the noble Viscount who leads the House said very much the same thing. He said that House of Commons men are Party men, and are sent there for that purpose, with the exception of a few cranks. He further asked, How could the Speaker vote against his seven men?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01782"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount asks, How can the Speaker incur this invidious task of voting against his seven men? The Speaker, being an upright man, will vote against those seven men if they are wrong just as readily as he will vote against the other seven. Then we were told that we interfered with the Speaker in his present duties. The noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, said that. How do we interfere with the Speaker in his present; duties? So far as the House of Commons is concerned, I presume the Speaker will continue to act in that House as he does now. He has at the present time questions of order and so on to settle. Why is he not to continue to decide those questions just as he does now?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01783"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: He has to rule on Amendments arising on these very points, and thereby would prejudice his judgment as statutory head of the Joint Committee.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01785"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: His pre-judgment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01786"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The Bill is not before the Joint Committee at that time. That is exactly what the noble Viscount forgets. The Bill will come before the Committee at a later stage, and if the Speaker has formed his judgment I presume that he will vote according to the way in which he has formed his judgment. I know a little more of this House than I do of the other, but if you cannot find seven independent men in the House of Commons I am quite convinced the Lord Chancellor will have no difficulty whatever is finding seven impartial men in this House. Anyone who has any knowledge of this House knows perfectly well that when men are picked out in this House, whether it be as Chairmen or in any other capacity, and are told that they have to put aside their personal predilections
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0542"/>
<col>1075</col>
and give a judicial opinion&#x2014;anyone who has any knowledge of this House knows that there are a great many men here, and I believe on both sides, who are quite able to perform that duty.<lb/>
I cannot see how the Speaker' position will be prejudiced in any way. You say you are only giving to him duties which he discharges at the present time. Is the Speaker at the present time called upon to decide questions of tacking? The questions which he will be called upon to decide are new questions to him altogether. Hitherto the Speaker has been occupied with questions relating to the House of Commons only, and now you are going to put him upon the entirely new duty of deciding questions which concern the relations of the two Houses. I know if I were Speaker I should be most grateful to have the assistance and advice of, and to take counsel with, fourteen men chosen from the two Houses. Remember you are not proposing to give the Speaker any advice to assist him. He will be called upon, as has been already stated, to decide without any outside assistance and according to his own unaided judgment. I cannot conceive that the Speaker, possessing a vote and at the head of fourteen men, seven of whom were chosen from his own House, would not then find himself in a much more easy position and one in which he would be much more able to perform his duty than if he were called upon to decide this question alone and in private.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01787"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think everyone must see the extraordinary difficulties we get into&#x2014;I say this with great respect&#x2014;the moment we begin to depart from the integrity of the Constitution. Noble Lords opposite need not think that, having said that, I am going to support their proposal, because in my opinion their proposal is a great deal worse than the proposal which is put forward from the Cross Benches. I shall reserve the remarks I have to make with regard to this Joint Committee till a later stage, because I learn from the Amendments on the Paper that it is proposed that this Committee shall not only apply itself to finance&#x2014;and I can conceive a Constitutional body which might be able to adjudicate on what was finance and what was not finance being set up with a certain amount of advantage&#x2014;but to the consideration of a variety of other matters, and that almost<lb/>
<i>The Earl of Camperdown.</i><lb/>
<col>1076</col>
any Bill which comes to your Lordships' House will have first of all to run the gauntlet of this Committee.<lb/>
It is very refreshing to notice that during the whole of this debate, with the exception of Lord Marchamley, not a single Peer on the Back Benches opposite has got up to defend this proposal on the part of their own leaders that the Speaker of the House of Commons should be placed in this exceedingly invidious position. We must have listened with delight to the erudition which Lord Fortescue brought to bear on this extremely important subject, from which it appears that the Speaker in another Assembly has become in effect, as the Speaker is bound to become here if the Government's proposal is persisted in, the dominant wire-puller of the Party in power. We have a Speaker now in whom we all have the most profound confidence. That is a line that the adherents of this proposal always take when they are defending it, but it must be repeated for the thousandth time that the present occupant of the Chair is not always going to occupy it, and a Speaker can conceivably be found who will meet the demands of those who put him there. Another thing to be considered is that by the proposal to pay members of the House of Commons you will be introducing a type of politician who will be much more prone to make bargains with officials and to create Speakers of the kind wanted. The proposal to pay members will bring into our public life a type of politician who will be less scrupulous than the friends of Lord Marchamley whom he described just now, I have no doubt in perfectly suitable terms.<lb/>
Some noble Lord suggested that it was unfair to assume that you could not find seven impartial men in the House of Commons. Whoever made that remark said, I believe, nothing more than was absolutely true, because all the best men in both Houses of Parliament&#x2014;with every apology to noble Lords who sit on the Cross Benches&#x2014;are those who take an active part in Party politics in this country; and whatever may be said with regard to the House of Lords, there is no doubt whatever that, in the condition things have got into now, there is no political hope whatever for anybody in the House of Commons unless he is a very pronounced Party politician. I should not at all mind seeing finance Bills of the character of the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0543"/>
<col>1077</col>
Chancellor of the Exchequer's referred to seven gentlemen who hold views such as Mr. Harold Cox does. I believe we should be perfectly safe in his hands. Mr. Harold Cox spoke against the Budget of 1909 every time he had an opportunity of saying anything in the House of Commons, but I also notice that he went into the Lobby with the Government, so far as I could follow his movements, as often as he possibly could. But on account of the non-Party character of Mr. Harold Cox's career there is no place for him in public life at the present day, and there is no morn in the House of Commons under our Party system for anybody who is not a rabid Party politician.<lb/>
My Lords, I am going to support this proposal for a Joint Committee to adjudicate upon the question whether a Bill is a finance Bill or whether it is not, but I give no pledge now as to whether I am going to support it as applied to other Bills. I for my part am not much in love with the idea that what used to be the functions and privileges of this House should be usurped&#x2014;I do not mean it in an offensive sense&#x2014;or handed over to some other body constituted in any way whatever. Human nature is, after all, human nature, and I am afraid that sometimes I am rather inclined to take a higher view of human nature when it agrees with what I wish it to agree with than when it does not. It is quite easy to conceive in future a Committee which might possibly, when you have a complaisant Speaker and a Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords also a partisan&#x2014;I do not mean the present Lord Chancellor, but some successor&#x2014;consist all of Conservatives, or all of Liberals. I have risen for the purpose of entering a protest against this proposal to place the Speaker in a position which he ought never to be placed in, and never will be placed in if we can possibly help it. I shall support the alternative proposal, although I do so with a certain amount of misgiving, and I must not be taken as supporting the proposal of this Committee as applied to subjects other than finance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01788"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the few remarks I ask leave to address to your Lordships on this question I will confine entirely to the operation of the Amendment before the House in relation to the first clause. I think a good deal may be said as to the distinction between the action of the proposed Committee in reference to finance Bills and in reference to
<col>1078</col>
general legislation. I do not wish at all to prejudge what may be considered proper in respect to general legislation, but in respect to pure questions of finance I must confess, having considered this question as dispassionately as possible, I have arrived at the conclusion that the proposal of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches is totally inadmissible. I say this confessing great regret that it should be necessary to bring in the Speaker in the way proposed in the present Bill, and admitting also most fully that the argument founded upon the past reputation of Speakers is not completely convincing with respect to what may happen in the future. The quotation made by my noble friend opposite from the book of Mr. Bryce does show that Speakers can deteriorate, and although I hope that the character of the Speaker here will not deteriorate and may be strong enough, and I think will be strong enough, to withstand all the temptations involved in the present proposal, we cannot rule the point out, and if there was an alternative which could be admitted I, for one, would be quite ready to consider it and almost eager to embrace it.<lb/>
Consider the proposition in the Bill as it stands. It is nothing more or less than what we have understood to be the operation of our Constitution in past years&#x2014;at least up to two years ago. It is with reference to Money Bills and Money Bills alone that I am now speaking. A Money Bill we all held could not be amended, and most of us held that it could not be rejected by this House, and the question whether it was a Money Bill or not ultimately depended upon the opinion expressed to the House of Commons by Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker's opinion on that subject in reference to the Old Age Pensions Bill ruled the matter so that no Amendments inserted by your Lordships were considered; and, with regard to another question of recent occurrence, the decision of the Speaker was practically final and unquestioned that a Bill was a Money Bill and could not be amended by this House. Now if, under the guise of a Money Bill, a system of tacking had been adopted in the past, what would have been the procedure This House might have proceeded to take out the tacking clause. The Bill would then have gone back to the House of Commons, and it would have rested with the Speaker to decide whether or not that interference was an interference with the privilege of the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0544"/>
<col>1079</col>
House of Commons. The Speaker himself has been the authority up to the present upon the question of whether a Money Bill is purely a Money Bill or not, and the clause in the Bill now before us leaves that matter entirely as its stands. The vital alteration is this, that the Speaker might have decided what he liked, but your Lordships had definitely the power of rejecting the Bill in the end, and you might have done that if you had liked in respect to the Old Age Pensions Bill, but you did not. In future, if this Bill becomes law, you will have no such power, and the Speaker's decision will be final. It is that which makes the matter very grave, and it has been brought upon us unfortunately by what happened two years ago. It is necessary to decide this matter now. The country will not stand the interference which your Lordships have exercised in the past. You all recognise that.<lb/>
Now what is the alternative? It is to set up a Joint Committee of fourteen, presided over by the Speaker. A good deal of language has been used as to the selection of those fourteen which does not appear to me to be in agreement with the terms of the proposal in question, Over and over again your Lordships have spoken of seven Peers being selected by the Lord Chancellor and seven Commoners being selected by the Speaker of the House of Commons. That is not the language of the proposal as it stands. The language as it stands is that the fourteen are to be selected jointly by the Speaker and the Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor will have a say theoretically as to the members of the House of Commons to be chosen, and the Speaker will have a say theoretically as to the members of the House of Lords to be chosen. Surely that is a matter that will have to be corrected before it can go any further. Then supposing the Lord Chancellor has agreed upon a certain number but not agreed as to the remainder. What is to happen? The noble Earl on the Cross Bench does not tell you. You have this Committee of fourteen to decide, under the presidency of the Speaker, as to whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not. There is this novelty, which was pointed out by my noble friend the Leader of the House, in the proposal before us, that this Committee is of superior authority to both Houses of Parliament. This Committee is to govern us. That is one of the novelties of the situation. This unprecedented Committee is to be brought into<lb/>
<i>Lord Curzon of Penwith.</i><lb/>
<col>1080</col>
operation and its conclusions are to govern us altogether. Another point which I may refer to, in passing, is with regard to the position of the Lord Chancellor in having to exercise a function of this kind. Hitherto the Lord Chancellor has exercised a most noble influence in this House, but he has not in any sense had the functions of a Speaker here, and this proposal gives him new powers and new authorities totally foreign to those hitherto vested in him. You now propose to set up this Committee of fourteen, with the Speaker as the Chairman, to decide a question whether a Money Bill is a Money Bill or not, not knowing how your Committee is to be appointed, not having settled it clearly in your own mind, not knowing what the influence of the Speaker will be, and exposing the Speaker to the embarrassment pointed out by Lord Haldane, that having already taken action in respect to the Bill in the House of Commons in his individual capacity there, he will have to consider it again in reference to the Bill as it comes up here.<lb/>
There is another point as to which singular divergence has been displayed. When is this Bill to be submitted to the Joint Committee? Lord Curzon spoke of the Committee being appointed at the commencement of a session, and said that when a Bill is introduced into the House of Commons it was to be submitted to this Committee. On the other hand Lord Camperdown, who always speaks after close attention to all the details of the case, spoke of it as being submitted to the Committee at the stage of its being brought up here. I should suppose that that would be the proper stage at which it should be submitted to the Committee, because then, and then only, could the final question arise as to what the possible action of this House might be. But looking at the matter on both sides, and sincerely desirous, if possible, of getting the Speaker out of this trap, and conscious that the introduction of this novel power may possibly have a deteriorating influence on the character of Speakers in future, I confess I fall back reluctantly to the conclusion that the scheme of the Bill is the only scheme possible with respect to Money Bills, and that the proposal of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches&#x2014;I say it with all respect&#x2014;is totally inadmissible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01789"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was rather glad when I heard my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke say
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0545"/>
<col>1081</col>
a few minutes ago that though he intended to support this Amendment he did not regard the vote he was about to give as in any way prejudicing Ids decision in regard to an Amendment standing in my name. In two of the speeches delivered from the Bench opposite reference was made to that Amendment, and I think I may say that a certain amount of prejudice was brought against the Amendment of my noble friend on the ground that the Committee which he contemplates would, under my Amendment, have other and more extensive duties imposed upon it. This Amendment has, however, nothing to do with my Amendment. We are at this moment voting on the Amendment of my noble friend, Lord Cromer. We on this Bench shall certainly support it, for we attach the greatest importance to it. It seems to us to be one of the most vital Amendments to this Bill. The question of the tribunal which is to decide whether a Bill is or is not to be withdrawn from the cognisance of this House is most import ant. The definition of a Money Bill, I do not care whether you take the definition contained in the Bill as it now stands or any other definition which may be suggested, must necessarily be to a certain extent vague and undefined, and everything to my mind depends on the weight and authority and confidence to be reposed in the tribunal by which that definition will be interpreted.<lb/>
The Amendment raises two questions. Are you to have for your tribunal the Speaker without any aid or assistance whatever? If you are not to have the Speaker unassisted, what tribunal are you going to adopt in his place? Let me say frankly that I should have been very glad indeed if His Majesty's Government had seen their way to keep the Speaker out of this clause altogether. I am not going to travel over the ground covered by my noble friends, but I think they must have satisfied the House that whatever respect we may have for the present Speaker, or for his illustrious predecessors, however deeply we may be convinced that they have been successful in maintaining an attitude of impartiality between the two Parties in the House of Commons, no Speaker of the House of Commons can really be wholly impartial as between the two Houses of Parliament. The business of the Speaker is to claim for his own House everything which he thinks the practice of Parliament permits him
<col>1082</col>
to claim, and it is undoubtedly the case that in recent years that claim has been pressed with much greater insistence and pertinacity than in former times. In our view it is unfair to the Speaker himself and unfair to both Houses of Parliament to impose this new burden on that high official.<lb/>
When we remember that under this Bill the Speaker is to have this new duty imposed upon him, and that he is to discharge it without assistance, the case from our point of view becomes very much worse. So far as the House of Commons is concerned the Speaker is in close and constant touch with it, familiar with the currents of thought that prevail within it, and familiar with every item of business that comes before it. What opportunity has the Speaker of making himself aware of the feelings of this House? He has none whatever, he is completely cut off from us, and therefore in our view it is absolutely necessary that he should be assisted by persons competent to assist him. The suggestion that that assistance should be given by an impartially constituted Joint Committee seems to us to meet the necessities of the case better than any other suggestion that has yet been made. What more reasonable can be suggested? We understood the noble Viscount to express a kind of general readiness to consider whether some other tribunal might not be discovered, but the noble Viscount went on to say that our proposal was one which nothing on earth would induce His Majesty's Government to accept.<lb/>
If you are to exclude a Committee, what else is there to fall back upon? I venture to attach great importance to this Committee; and for this reason. It seems to me that the Committee would establish, what is very much wanted, a bond of more intimate contact than anything we have got at present between the two Houses of Parliament. To my mind the greater part of our inter-House troubles arises from the fact that we have no such point of contact. Some of us have had experience of those hurried conferences which take place in the last days of the session in regard to contested measures, and know how unsatisfactory those conferences are. We want something better than that. Our troubles have arisen because the two Houses in the past have been too much in the habit of holding one another at arm's length. The noble Viscount told us that the proposal
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0546"/>
<col>1083</col>
of a Joint Committee was one wholly foreign to our Constitution, or words to that effect. My noble friend Lord Curzon pointed out that in principle there was a certain amount of similarity between this proposal and the proposal of conferences between the two Houses which formed a conspicuous part of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's proposals. Another proposal is that there should be Joint Sittings of the two Houses. The Joint Committee now proposed is conceived in the same spirit. I believe that by setting up some machinery of this kind we should add a most valuable element to our Constitutional system. As to the constitution of the Committee, the number of members and mode of selection, I understood my noble friend to say that his mind was open as to these details. I can quite conceive that someone may be able to invent a better mode of composing the Committee, or a number which would work better between the two Houses; but what we care about is the principle of the thing. Amend the proposal if you can, but we desire that something in the shape of this Committee should be added to the machinery of this Bill. I must say that I have not been in the least intimidated by the gloomy prognostications we have heard from noble Lords opposite as to the hopeless difficulty which would be encountered in forming a body of fourteen honest men drawn from the two Houses. As usual on these occasions we had an illuminating speech from the noble Lord on the Back Bench, once Chief Whip of the House of Commons, who not for the first time has thrown light upon the manner in which business is transacted in the Whip's room elsewhere. But, my Lords, although we must accept the noble Lord as a high authority upon House of Commons matters, I venture to express my confident hope that when he knows us a little better he will be of opinion that we could provide seven members of a Committee of this kind, chosen impartially, and so chosen that every one of them would be able to contribute usefully to the deliberations of such a Committee as this. My Lords, I have said all that I desire to say at this time of the evening. I presume we shall now proceed to a Division, and I for one shall very gladly give my vote to the proposal of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01790"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before your<lb/>
<i>The Marquess of Lansdowne.</i><lb/>
<col>1084</col>
Lordships go to a Division, I desire to say a few words, and they shall be very few. I confess to considerable disappointment at the result of to-night's discussion, first because of the hope which I had understood the noble Viscount to hold out to us of not merely a friendly hearing, but of what he described, I think, as a full discussion of the Amendments that were proposed. With an honest desire to agree if I possibly could with the noble Viscount's case and with the Bill as it stands, I have, literally, heard no arguments, I was going to say worthy of the name&#x2014;I do not mean it disrespectfully&#x2014;but worthy in point of adequacy, brought forward in answer to the objections to the sole arbitrament of the Speaker in this matter. I held myself perfectly open to conviction on that very difficult question, but I have had no opportunity of being convinced, because the arguments have been very far short of dealing adequately with what is obviously a most grave and serious question.<lb/>
In the next place I am deeply disappointed to hear the opinion that is held, not in one part of the House only but in many, as to the difficulty of finding men who for this purpose would be impartial in dealing with such a matter. Surely, my Lords, there is a good deal of something more than misunderstanding as to the use of the word "impartial" in this particular matter. What is it that these men who are here suggested have to decide? It is not primarily a Party question at all. It is this&#x2014;"Is there, or is there not, within the four corners of this document something that covers such and such a branch of legislation." I entirely decline to believe that there would be any difficulty in either House of Parliament in finding men able to state that, which is not primarily a Party question at all. I should be sorry to believe that it is impossible to find in either House seven men who would be perfectly able to decide such a question. Then the noble Viscount Lord Morley said that the men selected would vote for their Party, and that he would respect them the more for doing so. I am totally at a loss to know what voting for the Party means when the question is a question whether there is or is not within the four corners of a Bill something which is not a money question; and how I should respect a man more because he voted with his Party on such a subject I fail to understand.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0547"/>
<col>1085</col>
While I am perfectly ready to be convinced by argument that the sole authority of the Speaker is the best arbitrament, I feel at present that we really have had no substantial argument to prove that to be right. The very name of that great officer means, if I understand it rightly, that he is the spokesman and the representative of the House of Commons, and if indirectly rather than directly a Party question between the two Houses must necessarily be raised, it seems to me that the Speaker, the definition of whose duties in the little Dodd which lies on the Table and which I have consulted is, in the forefront, to uphold the privileges of the House of Commons, is the last man almost upon whom to lay the sole arbitrament of a matter of this kind. Lord Courtney, who speaks with impartiality on these questions, expressed his desire to "get the Speaker out of this trap," and that is the kind of position I find myself in in regard to this particular proposal.<lb/>
As at present enlightened, I am not greatly enamoured of the proposed Committee in all its plans and in all that lies ahead of it, and I am glad to think, if I understand the rules aright, that our first Division to-night will be on the question that the words proposed to be left out stand part. The words proposed to be left out are "the Speaker," and I am prepared to vote for leaving out those words although I confess to feeling very much less secure about putting in the words which are proposed in their place. That is a position with which one cannot rest satisfied very long, and I think there ought to be, and I hope there will be, alternative proposals before us for alleviating the gravity of the situation if the matter is left to the Speaker alone. I did feel a little hope when I heard Lord Morley say that "at the present stage" this proposal must be opposed. That led me to hope that there might be a readiness on the part of His Majesty's Government to consider other suggestions if they were made. But at present what I am personally conscious of is a lack of the constructive argument for what <i>prima facie</i> seems a strange proposal&#x2014;that the man who is Speaker of one House of Parliament should be the arbiter when questions arise between the two Houses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01791"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the most rev. Primate's view at present, apparently, is that he is not satisfied that the Speaker should discharge a duty which
<col>1086</col>
somebody must discharge, and he does not know who else ought to do it. He is asking us for a suggestion. Our suggestion is that the Speaker, if I may put it so, is the least bad instrument for an absolutely necessary work. What we are at the present moment discussing is whether the authority is to be the Speaker or a Joint Committee. Let me, very shortly, put the reasoning in favour of the Speaker. The Speaker is impartial. He is really the man who has decided hitherto, and his decision has been accepted by both Houses in the past.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01792"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble and learned Lord's pardon. It was repudiated by a definite Resolution two years ago.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01793"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: The year 1909 was not a very happy year to begin with. It seems to me all our trouble has arisen from this, that this House being above all the House which ought to be bound by custom, usage, and tradition, and not by the strict letter of the law, forgot that usages and customs, like houses, are supported by leaning one upon the other. The situation has been created. I say the Speaker is the person who has hitherto been in the habit of giving undisputed decisions on this subject. He has also this advantage, that he is in the House of Commons when a Money Bill or what is said to be a Money Bill is introduced. It conies up and he is present, and in the Report stage certainly he watches it and decides then, if necessary, and warns the House of Commons. He says "This will not be merely a Money Bill."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01794"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: He does not warn them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01795"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: He can do so if he likes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01796"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Can the noble and learned Lord quote one single instance of his having done so?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01797"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I am pointing out what he may be able to do under this proposal. I am not talking of the law as it is. I am referring to what may happen if this clause is inserted. I say the proper person&#x2014;and I appeal to House of Commons men&#x2014;in the House of Commons to warn the House by saying "This Amendment is not in order" is the Speaker. Supposing the House of Commons were warned by the Speaker that a particular Amendment would prevent a Bill being a simple Money Bill and would necessitate
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0548"/>
<col>1087</col>
its transference to Section 2, the House of Commons could refuse the Amendment, and see that the measure remained purely a Money Bill. But such a procedure is not possible in the case of a Committee. I thought the noble Earl felt that to be a weak point. The Committee cannot operate until the Bill has been passed through the House of Commons. Whether the Bill is or is not one which the House of Lords is bound to accept depends upon the decision of the Committee, who have no opportunity of warning the House of Commons, and who may take a different view from what the Speaker took when he was in the House, and so disappoint and surprise everybody.<lb/>
Then you have this situation. Suppose it is the Finance Bill of the year, does not that Bill contain a political purpose? My noble friend Lord Haldane said that nearly every Money Bill contained a political purpose, and the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, said the same thing. He said that nearly every Finance Bill contained political principles, and that was the reason he liked this proposal. That is so, and that is what would make nearly every financial Bill that came up amenable to the Committee, and probably, if the noble Earl is right, likely to be treated by the Committee as one to which Clause 1 of this Bill would not apply. In other words, it would dethrone the House of Commons from its hitherto acknowledged supremacy in matters of finance, and instead of things being better for the House of Commons, instead of your Lordships' powers being limited and restricted, as I thought was going to be the result of what took place two years ago with regard to the Budget, this would be an invasion of the privileges and rights of the House of Commons greater than any which has hitherto been proposed and it would really leave this House in respect to Money Bills, if the noble Earl is right, at the mercy of the decision of the Committee. What would be the position of the Government then? The House of Lords might reject the Finance Bill if they thought proper, and place the Government of the country in this position, that either they must dissolve or appeal to a Referendum. This is a proposal for a deciding Committee and not an advising Committee, and it constitutes a greater invasion of the liberties of the House of Commons and of the ancient usages that have been observed with regard to financial Bills than anything that has hitherto been proposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01798"><i>The Lord Chancellor.</i></p>
<col>1088</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01799"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: I will only detain your Lordships for a few minutes. I should first like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Marchamley, on having thrown what is to me a very lurid and perfectly novel light upon the effect produced by long residence in the East. The noble Lord seemed to think that long residence in India and elsewhere in the East inspired people with a high ideal of human nature, and that long acquaintance with the House of Commons inspired them with a totally different feeling. Those remarks convinced me that the noble Lord was more acquainted with the affairs of the House of Commons than with affairs in the East. A good deal has been said with respect to the question of impartiality. I could not quite understand the line adopted by the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, on that subject. He began by saying that he agreed with Lord Curzon as to the possibility of finding impartial men, but he went on to observe that any man would certainly vote according to strict Party principles with the exception of some very unimportant individuals and other persons like myself, whom he designated as "cranks." Impartiality is a relative term. It is quite possible to find men who are Party men but who at the same time are not so deaf to argument as not to be convinced when convincing arguments are brought before them.<lb/>
Lord Morley criticised the proposal for bringing the Committee into operation at the request of the Minister of the Crown, or by Resolution of either House of Parliament. He asked why that should be so, and I think said that I had not fully considered that point. I may tell him that that point was very fully considered and discussed by us. I quite recognise that the Minister of the Crown will not bring the Committee into operation. Why should he do so? But <i>ex hypothesi</i> there is a difference of opinion between the two Houses, and we therefore thought that we had done all that was necessary by allowing either House to move the Resolution. Of course, there are other ways of doing it. One method, which was a good deal discussed, was whether the Committee should not be brought into operation at the request of a certain number&#x2014;say fifty&#x2014;of members of the House of Commons, but on the whole we thought this was the best proposal. I think most noble Lords will agree with me that we have had a most disappointing debate after the promises
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0549"/>
<col>1089</col>
given to us, and after the opening words of the noble Viscount. The noble Viscount invited us to bring forward suggestions, and said that if we could persuade him that our proposals were good ones they would be adopted. But I think the impression left upon our minds is that His Majesty's Government are open neither to conviction nor to persuasion, and I really think it is hardly worth the trouble of bringing forward any other proposals. It seems to me to be a very unfortunate result, but I think</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01808"><member>LORD HARRIS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is with the greatest diffidence that I rise to offer any remarks upon this Amendment, because having had no experience of the House of Commons I have no personal knowledge as to the practice followed by the Speaker in his consideration of what is termed a Money Clause or a Money Bill. But I listened with attention to what was said by Lord Courtney, knowing his great experience of the practices of the other House. There was a sentence in his speech which impressed me very much, and there was one in the speech of the noble Marquess which also attracted my attention. The noble Lord, Lord Courtney, said that the Speaker gave very careful attention to
<col>1092</col>
these questions, and consulted the Clerk to the House of Commons. Well, it seems to me that that is making what is already, from the point of view of some of us, rather objectionable, even more so, because that is merely consulting an official of the House of Commons. On a question of this kind materially affecting the House of Lords the Speaker of the House of Commons apparently consults an official of the other House. The noble Marquess said that one of the gravest objections that we have to the proposal of the Government is that this question is to be referred to the Speaker solely, without any opportunity of advice. It is upon that expression that I venture, with the greatest diffidence, to ask whether a suggestion I have to make, although I have not a resolute opinion on it myself, might not be worthy of some consideration. To put it without further argument, the suggestion is whether the same result would not in the end be secured if the Joint Committee were made an advisory Committee, instead of an executive Committee, by which I mean a Committee with the power of voting. The noble Marquess complained that the Speaker has no opportunity of getting any advice. That objection would be equally well removed by an advisory Committee, a Committee on which some members from the House of Lords would have an opportunity of advising as to the views of this House as to whether a Bill was purely a Money Bill or not.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0551"/>
<col>1093</col>
As regards the Joint Committee proposed by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, are we sure that that is going to be as impartial as he hopes? I confess that my experience of politics leads me to have some doubt on that point, and I cannot help thinking that people who attend closely to political matters do acquire Party bias. It is unavoidable, and there is a possibility&#x2014;perhaps something stronger than that&#x2014;that this Committee may become a purely Party Committee. It has been suggested in various quarters this evening that it is not reasonable to suppose that from both Houses of Parliament there could not be obtained impartial members who would not allow their minds to be biased by Party feelings. That may be so, but it is purely prophetic, and I do not know that my prophecy that it is possible that the Joint Committee may become as influenced by Party feelings as are ordinary politicians is not just as valuable as theirs. Were that the result, you would then arrive at practically what the position is now&#x2014;that is to say, the Speaker, who would have a casting vote, would become the arbiter upon these questions. If that is the result of the Amendment of the noble Earl and the other Amendments dealing with the powers of this Committee, then you obtain a body which argues the question from a Party point of view, and the Speaker eventually decides, not from any Party feeling, but from his own experience of what has been the practice in the past. I am not sure that we should then arrive at a happier state of affairs than we should arrive at if this Committee were made purely an advisory Committee. I only throw this out as a suggestion.<lb/>
It seemed to me that the idea of the Joint Committee was that the members of it should argue these questions before the Speaker, and that the object of giving him a casting vote was that, having heard the arguments on both sides, he should come to his conclusion. That seemed to me to be a reasonable proposal; but this Committee is to have very much larger powers than those merely dealing with decisions upon financial points, and. I certainly cannot pledge myself at this stage in the debate to vote for a Committee which should have powers of decision on subjects other than those of finance. I confine myself purely to the subject of finance, and upon that point I am not
<col>1094</col>
quite satisfied that the object that the noble Earl on the Cross Benches aims at will be secured. I am apprehensive that the Committee may become actuated or influenced by Party feeling, and that the Speaker will then decide, as he does now, from his own experience. If there is a possibility of that being the result, then I venture to ask those who have very much greater experience of these matters than I have, and whose advice I have followed all my political life, whether they are satisfied that this is the best form in which to frame this Committee. The Speaker has now been excluded from the Bill, and the proposal is to insert the words "Joint Committee." I do not know whether this is the right moment, but if my idea is a sound one possibly this would be the occasion to put in some such words as "Advisory Committee."<lb/>
There is one other matter to which I should like to refer. The Lord Chancellor gave us his view of the effect of this proposed Amendment. I imagine that he was assuming the other Amendments that are down on the Paper to be carried and the Joint Committee to be what is aimed at by the whole of those Amendments&#x2014;a very powerful body as far as deciding a number of questions besides finance. I could not help feeling influenced by what the noble and learned Lord said&#x2014;namely, that the setting up of such a Committee would be infringing very seriously upon the privileges of the House of Commons. If that is so, is it a very wise thing for us to press? Looking at it, from a purely Party and a tactical point of view, I am rather doubtful whether if we succeeded in carrying it we should have the sympathy of the country, because clearly we did not have it when we, from the House of Commons point of view, infringed their privileges over the Finance Bill. I venture with the greatest diffidence to offer these observations, having, as I said before, had no experience of the House of Commons or of the practices of the Speaker. Failing the suggestion of some better body, or some other individual, it does seem to me worthy of consideration whether the whole of the proposals concerning the formation of this Committee are not going rather too far in giving it an executive power, and whether practically the same result, and as useful a result, might not be obtained by making this a Committee more of an advisory than of an executive character.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01809"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that a great many noble Lords on this side of the House feel&#x2014;it is one of the great complaints we have against this Bill&#x2014;that the Bill puts the sole power into the hands of one Chamber, that you are creating a system of one-Chamber government. With regard to this particular clause now under discussion, not only does it appear to me that we are creating a system of one-Chamber government, but we are creating a system of one-man government. We are putting enormous powers into the hands of the individual who happens to be Speaker of the House of Commons. Like many others in this House, I sat for a short period in the House of Commons, and there is no one in this House or out of it who feels greater respect than I do for the office of the First Commoner of England, or for the gentleman who now fills that office with so much dignity. But, as has been said over and over again this afternoon, we are not discussing the character, the qualifications, the dignity, or the impartiality of the present Speaker. What we have to consider in this Bill is whether we shall give to any future Speaker these enormous and practically unlimited powers to decide whether a Bill is or is not a Money Bill.<lb/>
It is a truism to say that we are travelling pretty fast at the present day. I trust noble Lords opposite will not think for a moment that I wish to say anything personally offensive, but there is hardly anybody in this House who a few years ago would have expected to hear from a gentleman in such a high position the language used on public platforms by the present Chancellor of the Exchequer. We should have been surprised that any gentleman who filled such a high office should have gloried, as I think he has gloried, in rendering poorer certain classes of the community. We should have been equally surprised to find a gentleman in the position of Home Secretary using the language the present Home Secretary has used, in regard not only to Justices of the Peace, but to Judges of the High Court. And I think I could refer to other cases of gentlemen in high office who nowadays appear to have a very different standard from that which obtained formerly. Therefore what I wish to lead up to is this, that I fear we cannot expect the high standard of the present Speaker of the House of Commons and of his
<col>1096</col>
predecessors for so many generations always to be maintained. The Government ask us to open our mouths and swallow what they are pleased to give us in this respect. Personally I cannot think that it is right that any future Speaker of the House of Commons should be afforded the practically unlimited despotism that would be given by the Bill unless some such Amendment as that suggested by Lord Cromer is carried. The solution suggested by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches may not be the best solution possible, but I think it is at all events a happy solution, and I am prepared to go into the Lobby with the noble Earl.<lb/>
There were two things in the course of the debate this afternoon that may have struck your Lordships as rather curious. From the Front Government Bench we have heard over and over again language protesting against any innovations on our part, or anything that will impair the powers and prerogatives of the Speaker. I hope the Front Government Bench will forgive me for suggesting that among their many admirable qualities a sense of humour is somewhat wanting, because to hear from the Front Government Bench denunciations of us for attempting to do things contrary to tradition in this country, breaking up old traditions, and interfering with the prerogatives of ancient officials like the Speaker of the House of Commons, does appear to me, and, I think, to many of my noble friends on this side of the House, as&#x2014;may I venture to say&#x2014;somewhat ludicrous. And there was another thing that struck me, and, I believe, others who sit on this side of the House. The speech of the noble Lord, Lord Marchamley, indicated such a profound distrust of the character of those with whom he had been associated in the House of Commons that one felt for the moment prouder than ever of belonging to this House. I must ask your Lordships' forgiveness for making these rather desultory observations on the Amendment moved by the noble Earl, but the truth is that if the Amendment of Lord Cromer is carried&#x2014;as I hope it will be&#x2014;I should be debarred from moving the Amendment in my name or saying anything upon it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01810"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope the Government do not propose to allow this debate to finish without giving
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0553"/>
<col>1097</col>
us a little enlightenment as to their views. Your Lordships must have been struck before the adjournment with the fact that in the case of at least three gentlemen, who generally express themselves with such moderation, those three gentlemen made up by the extremity of their language for the absence of argument. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, told us that nothing would induce him to accept this Amendment, but he hardly tendered a single argument for its rejection. The noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor, said that it&#x2014;
<quote>"dethroned the House of Commons from its hitherto undoubted supremacy in finance."</quote>
How can that be said? This tribunal would decide, not on the ordinary Amendments which come before the House of Commons, but on the question whether a measure is in its governing principle a financial measure. How can this be dethroning the House of Commons from its hitherto undoubted supremacy in the matter of finance?<lb/>
But the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War excelled his colleagues. First of all he said there was hardly a Finance Bill which did not involve general policy. Of course there is not, but the noble Viscount who is a lawyer knows that that proves nothing as to the governing principle of a Bill. Every measure must involve general policy; but the only question the Committee would have to decide is whether the governing principle of a Bill, if it is one of general policy, ought to be passed over our heads as a matter of finance. Again, the noble Viscount conjured up, as a sort of bogey, the assembling of this Committee, I think he said, on every afternoon. I assume that perhaps once every session, and probably not once in most sessions, this Committee would be called together. To say, because there is a difficulty in the matter of forming a tribunal which now and again may discuss these subjects, that therefore we must fall back upon an obviously prejudiced tribunal such as the Speaker of one Assembly to decide matters between the two Assemblies is really a distortion of language. I use the word "prejudiced" because the Speaker is the Speaker of the House of Commons, and it is no use endowing him with all the merits in the world, and especially those of impartiality between the two
<col>1098</col>
Houses when he is retained by his office to protect the privileges of one House. The Government find difficulty in seeing how to produce seven impartial men, and because they cannot see that to their own liking they leave us without any guidance whatever in this critical matter&#x2014;a fact which cannot be passed over without leaving a sense of injustice.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Curzon, pointed out that in the House of Commons the Prime Minister had said, obviously feeling that the tribunal was not satisfactory, that if some other tribunal could be suggested he would be glad to consider it. I think we have a right to some help from the Government at this moment. My noble friend Lord Harris suggested that the members of the Committee might be advisory and not executive. Though personally I do not see much outlet in that direction, at the same time I think it is a proposal which should receive some reply from the Government. If the Speaker is left the sole arbiter he can go to the House of Commons and say, "This Bill, in my opinion, is a Money Bill, and the House of Lords cannot touch it." That is a position which no Government could defend. The arguing of the matter before him would be something, but our view is that he ought to sit as one of a body, if he sits at all. It has been suggested by more than one noble Lord that it would be well if the Speaker of the House of Commons, for his own sake, were not dragged into such discussions. I believe myself, for the future of the Speakership, that that would be the most satisfactory solution of the difficulty. I do not think anything shows more than does the Amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Cromer, our extreme desire to meet the views of the House of Commons and to avoid that which the Lord Chancellor, in what I submit was exaggerated language, described as dethroning the House of Commons from its hitherto undoubted supremacy in finance. Nothing can prove more our desire in that direction than that we have proposed to give the Speaker the chairmanship of this important Committee.<lb/>
I sat in the House of Commons as long as did the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane. I venture to say that every member of the House of Lords who has sat there&#x2014;and there are many behind me&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0554"/>
<col>1099</col>
knows that the vision which the noble Viscount conjured up and which is, no doubt, to play a great part in the arguments used, that you would have this Committee constantly interfering with the Speaker, is nothing but an exaggerated picture of what would occur. I cannot imagine that on any ordinary measure the Committee could do that. In all ordinary matters the Speaker will give his decision. It may be that after a Bill has passed through Committee the Speaker might choose to assemble this Committee and submit to them the question whether or not a Bill as it stands would be regarded strictly as a Money Bill. I submit that this is a practical and reasonable proposal, and it is one to which we attach great importance. It may be possible to change this Committee, or to find something which would be a better solution of this difficulty than a Committee, which we believe could be framed impartially. But of one thing I am certain. If you leave the Speaker as the sole arbiter, you will leave a sense of injustice and dissatisfaction in, this House. Bismarck said on one occasion&#x2014;
<quote>"Flagrant injustice is not only unlovely, but it is unstatesmanlike in politics as in private life."</quote>
I do hope we shall hear something from the Government before we part front this subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01811"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount who has just sat down reproaches me and my colleagues, in a kindly way, for having used violent language. All I can say is I was not conscious of it, and I certainly did not intend to use violent language. I wished to compress what I had to say into as narrow a space as possible, because the limits of time forbid me from enlarging unduly upon any proposition. If one makes it clear, one can leave it to the judgment of the House. Now we have been prevented front having the Speaker of the House of Commons as the arbitrator or umpire. Every one agrees that there must be some authority to decide. We think there is difficulty at all times in applying arbitral methods to Parliamentary proceedings. We are not blind to the fact that there may be objections to the Speaker as well as to anybody else, but we think there is, for obvious reasons, much less objection to the Speaker than to anybody else.<lb/>
<i>Viscount Midleton.</i><lb/>
<col>1100</col>
Let me criticise what the alternative is, because it is not sufficient for any one to take up the attitude of the most rev. Primate and say that he is going to vote against the Speaker being the person when he is really unable to tell us what the person ought to be. He does not seem to be favourable either to a Committee or to anybody else. There must be somebody. Let us see what can be said about the Joint Committee. Noble Lords opposite speak as though there had not been in the past a practical supremacy&#x2014;an almost uncontrolled and undivided authority in regard to matters of finance in the House of Commons. I am not going to enter upon the history of this subject, which is long and complicated, and which did not, perhaps, receive assent on the part of the House of Lords all through. But practically every one knows that in substance the House of Commons has had control over finance for generations. We have always counted upon that, and every one has counted upon it who has ever sat in the House of Commons. We know also that there was a departure made two years ago&#x2014;a departure which I think was fatal and lamentable, but which has been the basis of the whole of the trouble which has now arisen.<lb/>
Now what does this Bill propose to do? This Bill proposes that in regard to finance the House of Commons should retain its supremacy and its sole authority, but it must be only in regard to finance; and the real question we have to determine is whether it is a useful method that a body should say that a particular Bill that is brought forward is a Bill solely relating to finance. Let us see what the Committee has to determine. Mark, not to advise, as the noble Lord, Lord Harris, suggested in a speech which was well deserving of attention, but to decide. The Amendment says that the House of Lords is to have power in regard to Money Bills exactly the same as it has in regard to any other kind of Bill&#x2014;a Drainage Bill or any other&#x2014;if the governing purpose of the Bill, or any portion of the Bill, is such as to bring the Bill within the category of general legislation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01814"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: Take the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01815"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I am taking the Amendments. The Bill does not contain the Joint. Committee. I think the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, does not quite follow me, and no doubt it is my own fault. The noble Lord discussed very properly the different parts of his Amendments taken together. Let us see what the different parts of this Amendment are. He takes away the power from the Speaker. He bestows it upon a Joint Committee, and what the Joint Committee have to determine surely is material to consider. What is the question that has to be decided by this Committee consisting half of members of the House of Lords and half of members of the House of Commons? Let us suppose that a Bill has passed through the House of Commons and comes up to this House. The Joint Committee can act either on the motion of a Minister, who is certainly not likely to move in the matter, or on the motion of the House of Lords or of the House of Commons. As the Bill has passed the House of Commons, it is not likely that the Motion will be passed there. The result is that the Committee is put in motion upon a Resolution or by the request of the House of Lords, and what it has to inquire into is what is "the governing purpose of the Bill or of any portion of it," and if the Committee comes to the conclusion that it is such as to bring the Bill within the category of general legislation, then away go the whole of the privileges of the House of Commons and the Bill becomes subject to the provisions of Section 2. That is to say, it can be dealt with in the same way as any other Bill, not a Money Bill, that comes before the House of Lords. The result is perfectly obvious. If this Joint Committee should decide that in regard to any portion of the Bill, or the Bill itself, the governing purpose is such as to bring it within the category of general legislation, all the privileges of the House of Commons disappear at once. The result would be very naturally this. Take the graduated Income Tax. It may be that the Committee would say that the governing purpose of the Bill was to tax rich people as against poor, and that it was a political subject.<lb/>
<col>1102</col>
Take the case of Tariff Reform. They might say that the object of that was to find employment It is often said it would have that effect. Take the case of the taxation of the liquor trade. The Committee might say with truth that the object of that, the purpose of part of it, at all events, was to suppress drunkenness. The result is that all these different subjects could not be made the subject of the supremacy of the House of Commons. I have tried to put it as clearly as I can, and without any attempt at speaking violently.<lb/>
The beginning of this trouble has been what the House of Commons has declared to be, and what many of us have declared to be, the invasion of their financial rights and privileges by the House of Lords, and here we have a more acute and exaggerated invasion of the privileges of the House of Commons than would be perpetrated by an occasional or by a very rare interference with a Money Bill such as took place in 1909. And the result, as have pointed out, would be this. Take a Liberal Government which brings in a Bill for the taxation of licences or the liquor trade such as I have already adverted to. The Joint Committee might come to the conclusion, on the invitation of the House of Lords, that the governing purpose of that measure was to suppress this particular form of selling drink in the country and to set up some other form of selling drink. What would be the position of the Government with the Budget of the year containing that clause left at the mercy of the House of Lords? By the decision of the House of Lords this proposition, I have no doubt quite conscientiously, could be thrown out for a period of two years, leaving the Government in exactly the same confusion that they were left in in 1909. They might have the Referendum, it is true, and they might have a Dissolution under the Amendments which are proposed, but I am entitled to show what the difficulties are. The whole subject is surrounded by difficulties of all kinds. We make a simple proposal, and I believe the Speaker will in the end, after all our discussions, really turn out, to the minds of all reasonable people at any rate, to be the best authority to deal with this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01816"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble and learned Lord has addressed himself to an Amendment which has not
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0556"/>
<col>1103</col>
yet been incorporated in the Bill and has practically founded his whole argument against the proposal of the noble Earl, Lord Cromer, on the difficulties of that Amendment. If that Amendment should be pressed, personally I should be very much inclined to join with the noble and learned Lord in pointing out the difficulties that accompany it. But I wish to take the Bill as it stands. I wish to take this first clause as it stands, and to ask whether the Speaker is the proper tribunal to work that part of the Bill. Now the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor, cannot touch any part of this subject without a reference to that King Charles's head&#x2014;the rejection by your Lordships of the Budget of 1909. May I hope that at any rate I shall not be regarded as prejudiced in the observations I am about to address to your Lordships, because I did not agree in that rejection. I can assure the noble and learned Lord that I am as anxious as he can be to maintain the supremacy of the House of Commons in matters of finance. I do not think that the proper way to maintain that supremacy would be to pass the Bill making the Speaker arbitrator between the two Houses. This is not a question of supremacy in finance; it is a question of interpreting what finance is. That is a question between the two Houses of Parliament, and surely it is no more right that the Speaker, the principal officer of one of the Houses, should be made arbitrator between the two Houses in this matter than it would be right in the case of two municipal corporations or two companies to select the auditor of one of those corporations or companies as arbitrator on some point of dispute between the two. That really is the point which has been placed before you in many a speech this afternoon, and it was accepted by your Lordships' vote, not only by a large majority, but, let me point out to noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite, opposed by a very small minority indeed. The figures were 183 to 44, and that is a Division which means a good deal more than a mere Party Division in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I voted cordially with the noble Earl on the Cross Benches in support of the Amendment against the Speaker as the sole tribunal, but I frankly say, speaking for myself alone&#x2014;and I have no right to speak for any one else&#x2014;that I am not quite content with the Joint Committee<lb/>
<i>Viscount St. Aldwyn</i><lb/>
<col>1104</col>
that is proposed as the tribunal in place of the Speaker. To my mind, however much the members of that Committee might desire to be impartial in their decisions, it is impossible that they should not have taken an active part on one side or the other in a matter which might come before them for decision, and I confess I think it would be better if some other and smaller tribunal of a more official kind could be suggested which should deal with the matter. Would it not be possible for the Speaker, the Lord Chancellor, and the two Chairmen of Committees in the two Houses to be associated together, and to select a fifth person who should be a member of the House of Commons and might, for example, be the Chairman of the Committee of Selection of the House of Commons, as the tribunal to decide this question as to what is a pure Finance Bill and what is not? I throw out that suggestion because my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition invited suggestions, and suggestions were also invited from the Front Bench opposite, but I do ask noble Lords opposite, as representing the Government, seriously to consider whether we have not a good case for some change in the tribunal proposed in the Bill. The Government surely wish that there should be a fair arbitration between the two Houses in this matter. It is not a question, as I have said, of the supremacy of the House of Commons in matters of finance; it is a question of interpretation alone. As was well said by Lord Midleton, it is a matter that should be settled by reasonable agreement, and should not be left to a tribunal which will cause dissatisfaction and leave a sense of injustice.</membercontribution></p>

It does not touch those difficulties which arise almost from day to day when you have what he is well acquainted with, an elaborate set of Budget proposals. At what point are you to invoke the decision of this Committee or tribunal, whatever it may be? I think the tribunal he has proposed would be very awkward.

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01819"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: That is quite true, but recollect that by an Amendment lower down on the Paper my noble friend Lord Cromer proposes&#x2014;and I think it would apply to the Committee of the noble Viscount&#x2014;that the decision of the Committee should be invoked only at the request of a Minister of the Crown or on a Resolution of one of the two Houses of Parliament. No one will recognise more thoroughly than the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, that that is an impossible proposal, having regard to the daily course of business in the House of Commons. The Speaker will be put in the same difficulties if he has, as Lord Harris suggests, an advisory Committee. He will have to make up his own mind, and even in my noble friend's proposal he is to have the casting vote. Therefore in spite of all these proposals and suggestions, the responsibility in the long run must ultimately rest with the Speaker.<lb/>
I invited noble Lords opposite to propose something outside of the proposals in the Bill. The difficulty of finding a better tribunal than the one set up in the Bill is shown by the fact that in substitution for it about fifteen different tribunals were suggested in the House of Commons. The first proposal was a Committee consisting of the Speaker, the Chairman of Ways and Means, the Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means, and three Lords Ordinary of Appeal, the Speaker to be chairman and have a casting vote. I wonder whether the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, with his long practical experience of Parliamentary affairs, would think that a good working proposal. Three Lords of Appeal. I rather gather that the House has already ruled out the reference of these issues to a judicial tribunal, or to any members of a judicial tribunal as such. Another proposal was the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, with the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker acting as assessors. I am President of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and therefore I am bound to speak of them with respect, but I cannot imagine a body less fitted to decide a question of this kind. And the idea of putting the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker as assessors to these gentle
<col>1106</col>
men, some of whom are entirely unfamiliar with Parliamentary practice and Parliamentary custom. That was the second proposal. Here was a third&#x2014;the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker. How do you view the proposal that the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker should be the tribunal? That is for your Lordships to consider. And then there is the Court of King's Bench&#x2014;that was moved by rather an important member of the other House. The Lord Chief Justice is there, and nobody will speak of him with more regard and respect than I do. He is arbitrator in some matters of administration, and I wonder if he would like, or whether the House of Commons would like, that he should be arbitrator in this matter instead of the Speaker.<lb/>
Another proposal was that the authority should be the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls. I need not go over again the arguments which were stated with great force by Mr. Balfour in the House of Commons. A further proposal was the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council sitting in private and no Minister of the Crown to be allowed to sit. Would the judgment of such a body as that sitting in private, and no Minister of the Crown allowed to sit, be worth a straw? Another Member moved that they were not to listen to counsel; they were not to listen to any arguments; and their decision was to be beyond question. Will your Lordships support a device of that kind? I think not. Then, a Joint Committee consisting of three members selected from each House of Parliament&#x2014;three members, not seven with the Speaker as chairman. Well, if I were obliged to choose between three and seven, I would without hesitation give my vote for three. If you had six men, and the Speaker would be the seventh&#x2014;I think the Speaker was included&#x2014;it would be less apt to be what in my view a Committee of fourteen would be&#x2014;a political body. Therefore I would go for this, but it is open to a hundred objections. The last with which I will trouble your Lordships is the Appeal Committee consisting of two Lords Ordinary of Appeal, together with a person selected by His Majesty. On whose advice? And a person elected by the House of Commons, and a person elected by the House of Lords. These proposals were not made by irresponsible men, but by men of judgment and men of a certain standing in the House of Commons. You
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0558"/>
<col>1107</col>
have ruled out the Speaker and you have these rambling proposals before you as an alternative. Then there is the proposal of my noble friend, which is not at all rambling, but which, for the reasons already stated, is in my opinion thoroughly contrary to the whole spirit of the proposals before the House and will land you in enormous difficulties. The power of the House of Commons will be lessened. Let us reflect for a minute.

It cannot be denied that this Bill had its immediate origin in what happened in November, 1909, and we have landed ourselves here&#x2014;or you have landed yourselves&#x2014;into admitting that this House is not a Chamber of moral authority. That was implied by the noble Marquess's Bill which was passed without a Division. You admit your moral authority is not what it was two years ago&#x2014;that follows from your assent to that Bill. The object of the Parliament Bill is to vindicate the supremacy of the House of Commons in finance, and noble Lords opposite are now going to entrust the decision of whether a Bill is or is not true finance to a Joint Committee of which half, less the Speaker&#x2014;I admit the exception is worth taking into account&#x2014;are to be chosen out of the House of Lords.

The noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, in an earnest appeal to the Front Bench on this side, devoted most of his remarks to showing why the Speaker of the House of Commons should not be the tribunal. But as the Speaker had already been ruled out by the House his remarks were not very germane to the proposal before us&#x2014;it was a case of slaying the slain. The same remark applies to the speech of the noble Viscount who spoke afterwards. Yet severe censure was offered to the Lord Chancellor because<lb/>

<col>1108</col>
in illustrating the operation of this Amendment he looked at the scope of all the Amendments. I am willing to deal with this Amendment apart from any prospective Amendment, and to consider what would be the effect. After all, the scheme which the noble Viscount has suggested as an alternative would come more properly in a new clause when we see how the Joint Committee is constituted. It might be a Joint Committee of Convocation and the London County Council. We do not know what it is to be "joint" of. Notwithstanding the remarks of Lord St. Aldwyn, who is very anxious to keep strictly to the Amendment before us, we cannot help travelling to the composition of the suggested Committee. I do not know whether the noble Viscount in making his suggestion spoke for noble Lords sitting round him.</membercontribution></p>

The Government will have hard work to persuade its supporters to accept any modification whatever of this Bill, but for the sake of peace, if we can possibly settle this question by anything approaching agreement, even though it may be a reluctant agreement, it would be much better than that the Government with the help of other means that the Constitution puts in their power should ride roughshod over every one who opposes the Bill.<lb/>
I am not going to mention King Charles's head. But after the last two elections no one can doubt the feeling in the country. There has been a deadlock between the two Houses of Parliament, and the electors have affirmed that the House of Commons should be supreme.&#x2014;[Several NOBLE LORDS: No, no.] That is my interpretation. If those noble Lords who say "No" took part in the elections perhaps they will remember what they said, and how they were received. Though it is distasteful to your Lordships, ordinary people, at any rate, will consider the result of those two elections as a declaration by the electors of the country in favour of the House of Commons as against the House of Lords. It is not fair to ask the Government Front Bench to express

<col>1109</col>
an opinion on a hypothetical new organisation to be set up until we have got what we may call a firm offer from the whole of the other side as to what they propose. It would be very foolish for any persons in authority on this side of the House to express a willingness to entertain a proposal until it is put substantially forward by the bulk of the other side. In the meantime, we have been having a very long discussion on a very small point, because, strictly speaking, this point should have been taken as consequential without discussion, because on the Paper the Amendment was that certain words be struck out in order that the words now under discussion might be inserted. I cannot help thinking that we should get something more definite from the majority in this House before we are asked to express our opinion upon it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01825"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire before this part of our discussion closes to protest once more against the assertion which has been so freely made on the other side of the House that this Amendment represents an attempt on the part of the Opposition to dethrone the House of Commons from its supremacy over finance. Nothing is further from our thoughts or intention.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01826"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I only said the effect of it would be that. I would never desire to question a statement of his intention made by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01827"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am quite willing to accept the Lord Chancellor's explanation of his words, but my answer remains the same. I deny altogether that the effect of this Amendment will be to dethrone the House of Commons from its position with regard to finance. It is quite true that by the Resolution of 1910 we recognised the supremacy of the House of Commons over Money Bills of a purely financial character; but it never was our intention when we passed that Resolution to abdicate all authority over the whole of that vast field of legislation which is covered by measures which are partly financial and partly political. It was truly said by a noble Lord opposite that all financial legislation involved a question of policy. That is perfectly true. But what we urge is that the relation of political to financial con
<col>1110</col>
siderations varies infinitely according to the nature of the particular measure. There may be a financial measure with very little political effect in it, or you may have the converse case. What we desire is that there shall be some authority which in all cases of mixed legislation of this kind can rule and decide once and for all whether a Bill belongs to the region of pure finance or whether, to use the words of my noble friend in his Amendment, "the governing purpose" of the measure is not financial but political or social. Those words, as I think my noble friend pointed out, were the words used by the Prime Minister himself, when he was dealing with this Bill. If the noble Viscount the Leader of the House will look at the report of the speech, he will see that the Prime Minister explained that what he desired was that the old practice as between the two Houses of Parliament should be maintained, and he described that practice as being one which, when the governing purpose of any measure was other than of a financial character, placed that measure within the category of those which both Houses of Parliament might discuss. I shall be very glad to give the noble Viscount the reference to Mr. Asquith's speech. But supposing the Committee, or whatever the tribunal is, decides that the Bill is not a purely financial Bill, one would think from the language of noble Lords opposite that it would be taken entirely out of the control of the House of Commons, that that House would have nothing more to say. But the effect of that decision will simply be that the Bill will be dealt with under Clause 2; and under Clause 2, as we all know, this House has an opportunity of discussing the measure during two years, and if at the end of those two years the House of Commons is obdurate, then the House of Commons will prevail. Therefore it is idle to talk as if by taking a Bill out of Clause 1 and putting it into Clause 2 we ousted the House of Commons from all right to interfere.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1111</col>
happen in a case of that kind would be that if there was some particular provision of the Finance Bill which was open to the imputation of being a political provision, that provision might have to be held up for further consideration. With regard to the constitution of the proposed Committee, as I have already ventured to say, we are by no means irrevocably pledged to the composition suggested by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, Lord Cromer. Personally I think it a very fair proposal, but there may be better proposals. My noble friend Lord St. Aldwyn, who always speaks with authority upon such questions as this, has suggested an alternative composition. By all means let us consider it, but I do not gather that it found more favour with noble Lords opposite than did Lord Cromer's proposal. The powers of destructive criticism of the noble Viscount opposite are immense, but he offers us nothing in the nature of helpful suggestion. At any rate, I conceive that if we pass the Amendment of my noble friend it will be open to us further on to consider whether we can improve the composition of that Committee or not. One word more before I sit down. The noble Viscount the Leader of the House suggested that because we had brought forward a Bill for the reconstitution of this House we had therefore, by implication, admitted that there was no moral authority behind our action when we threw out the Budget Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01830"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to interrupt the noble Marquess. The abdication of the moral authority was not in throwing out the Budget but in the introduction and the passing without a Division of the noble Marquess's Bill for reforming this House. My point was, for whatever it was worth, that that was an admission that the House to-day has not got the moral authority that it had two years ago.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01831"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Then the noble Viscount's suggestion is that because we passed a Bill for improving the constitution of this House, therefore this House as we know it to-day is deprived of all moral authority. I must say I think that is not only a very ungenerous but a very unfair argument. Are we to be told, because we have shown our readiness to co-operate with noble Lords opposite in improving the constitution of this House, that therefore we have, pend<lb/>
<i>The Marquess of Lansdowne.</i><lb/>
<col>1112</col>
ing that reconstitution, lost all moral authority? That is a monstrous doctrine. Let us see where it would carry us. Is the noble Viscount quite sure that the House of Commons as we know it to-day is perfectly constituted? I think Lord Morley would probably desire to see a Bill putting an end to plural voting, with the anticipation that the passing of such a measure would materially affect the constitution of the House of Commons. A great many of us think that the manner in which votes are distributed over the constituencies is little short of a scandal. We should therefore all unite in saying that the constitution of the House of Commons might be very much improved. But are we going to suggest that in the meantime, until these blots have been removed, the House of Commons has no moral authority behind it? The proposition seems to me to be an absurd one. I do not know whether your Lordships are ready to go to a Division, but I shall certainly support the Amendment moved by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01832"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose to detain you more than a moment or two before the Division, but I wish to refer to the Bill, because I think we have been getting a little away from the facts with which we have to deal. One always listens to the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition with the deepest respect, because he is a wise and moderate counselor. But if you want to see what the difficulties are, turn to subsection (2) of Clause 1, which contains this definition of a Money Bill&#x2014;
<quote>"A Money Bill means a public Bill which in the opinion of the Speaker of the House of Commons contains only provisions dealing with all or any of the following subjects&#x2014;namely, the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges," and so on.</quote>
If a Bill goes outside that definition it comes under Clause 2. The noble Marquess seemed to think it was a small thing, or only meant a little delay. It may mean the postponing of Bills of the greatest financial moment. Take a Budget Bill. A Budget Bill may desire to provide for an increased Navy, for payment of Members, for the provision of old age pensions. It may be directed to half-a-dozen subjects. There are always governing purposes in all general legislation, which never have been, and I hope never
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0561"/>
<col>1113</col>
will be, excluded from the purview of the House of Commons. Yet when a Bill is declared to be outside the definition in Clause 1 it may be delayed for over two years&#x2014;for three sessions. Is it possible to work even the machinery that Lord St. Aldwyn suggested? When a Money Bill is passing through the House of Commons the Speaker is charged with seeing that it remains in the category of Money Bills, and he has to advise the House from hour to hour as to whether Amendments proposed will carry it outside that category. The Speaker has to see that it remains in the category of Clause 1. That can only be done by one who is free to act from time to time. It has been suggested that the proper time for the Joint Committee to come in is at the conclusion of the Bill; but that may come late, and the calling together of the Committee may come late, and it may result in the delay of a Bill for two years.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01834"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: It may mean a repetition of the financial confusion of which we have had recent experience. There is only one way in which the machinery of Subsection (2) can be arranged, and that is by a single person charged with the responsibility of dealing with these matters and guiding the House of Commons from time to time. Your Committee, whether it be that suggested by Lord Cromer or the better one suggested by Lord St. Aldwyn, is a clumsy and impossible instrument compared to the Speaker, who is on the spot and gives guidance to the House of Commons from time to time as the Bill goes on. It seems to me that we are at this moment on a very relevant consideration of the question whether the working of the financial machinery of the House of Commons is to be made impossible, whether it is to be hampered, or whether you are to adopt what I agree is the lesser of two evils&#x2014;the decision of the Speaker, a decision which is to be a statutory duty and under our proposed amendments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01835"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: I have had some experience of the financial working of the House of Commons, and I demur altogether to what has just been said by the noble Viscount opposite. He said that my Amendment, or the Amendment
<col>1114</col>
which will be moved by Lord Cromer, would make the financial working of the House of Commons impossible. I absolutely deny it. What would happen? During the progress of a Money Bill through the House of Commons the Speaker would guide the House precisely in the way he does now, and when the time arrived for the Third Reading he would take counsel with the Committee as to whether the Bill was anything more than a Money Bill. If the Committee decided that it was something else, it would be perfectly possible for the Bill to be recommitted and the objectionable provisions taken out. The whole thing would be done in a week, and to say that it would make the financial working of the House of Commons impossible is to my mind, and I say it with all respect to the noble Viscount opposite, ridiculous.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01836"><member>LORD ST. DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think there is a single noble Lord on this side of the House who would wish noble Lords opposite to feel that any injustice may arise between the two Houses if this Bill becomes law, or that the tribunal that is going to decide matters of importance is packed against them. But, frankly, I am unable to understand how any suggestions that have been thrown out better the position of noble Lords from what it would be under the Bill as it stands. Let us deal with the remark of the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, who said that if the Bill passed as it stood, they would go away with a sense of flagrant injustice. Were the Speaker of the House of Commons a violent Radical partisan, and to be retained in office because he was a partisan, that might be the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01837">A NOBLE LORD: He may be in the future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01838"><member>LORD ST. DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: The Speaker, as we all know, is a member of the Party of noble Lords opposite, and it is well known, not only to those of us who have sat in the House of Commons but I think to other noble Lords, that the Speaker is always chosen from amongst the most moderate men that can be found in the House. In my years in the House of Commons I sat under two Unionist Speakers and under one Liberal Speaker, and, if my memory serves me right, one of the great
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0562"/>
<col>1115</col>
recommendations of the Liberal Speaker was that he had never made a speech of any kind in the House of Commons before he spoke from the Chair. I was struck by the alternative that was suggested by the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn. He did not like the Speaker as the tribunal, and I understood him to suggest that four people should act, with a fifth chosen by them from outside. And who are the four to be? He suggested the Speaker, the Lord Chancellor, the Chairman of Committees in the House of Commons, and the Chairman of Committees in this House. The noble Viscount was speaking for himself, but I would like to know whether noble Lords opposite consider that a better proposal from their point of view than the proposal of the Government. Two of the four must be partisans. The Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons is not chosen as the Speaker is. He is put in by the Government and is supposed to press on the Government's business. He is impartial, but he is not chosen markedly for impartiality by either side as is the Speaker.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01839"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: He never votes on a Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01840"><member>LORD ST. DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: No, but it is well known what his political opinions are, and he is there to help on the Government work. Then there is the Lord Chancellor for the time being. The Lord Chancellor, as your Lordships will admit is not an impartial person as regards Government business. Those are two out of the four. The third is the Chairman of Committees of the House of Lords, a gentleman who is presumably a supporter of the Party opposite. We have one left&#x2014;the Speaker. At present he is of the Party opposite, but, as the noble Lord just now said, it may very well be that he may later on be a Liberal. Therefore under the proposal put forward by Lord St. Aldwyn you will have the matter settled by four people, two of whom must be Liberals, the third may be a Liberal, and the fourth may conceivably be a Liberal. Is that a fairer proposal than the one put forward by His Majesty's Government? We have had important discussion all the evening, but the Government are unable to support the proposal of the noble Earl. But surely there must be something that noble Lords opposite can suggest on which the two. Parties might get nearer to one another.<lb/>
<i>Lord St. Davids.</i><lb/>
<col>1116</col>
I was struck by a remark of the Leader of the Opposition. The noble Marquess said that some future Bill might be settled by a Speaker of the House of Commons over our heads without our being able to approach him or to put our case before him. May I throw out a suggestion? If that is the feeling, could not noble Lords put forward some Amendment to meet the point. The noble Earl has left the Speaker as chairman of the Joint Committee; in Viscount St. Aldwyn's suggestion the Speaker is left as one of the four&#x2014;everybody proposes to leave the Speaker in in some shape or form. Could not noble Lords opposite propose something of this kind&#x2014;that the Speaker should decide, but only after he is acquainted with the views of this House given to him by a Committee of noble Lords appointed by this House. That would make it impossible, as the noble Marquess said, for the Speaker to give his opinion without the views of this House being properly put forward and represented to That is the suggestion I make, as I think it is a pity, when we all wish to get the best tribunal possible, that noble Lords should be left with a feeling or a sense of injustice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01841"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: I need not detain your Lordships more than a few minutes. I think the outcome of this discussion is this, that whereas we on this side of the House think that the leaving of this important matter to the decision of the Speaker is not only a bad solution but the worst possible solution of this difficulty, noble Lords opposite, although they recognise the objections to the proposal of leaving the whole matter to the Speaker, at the same time, for one reason or another, have not given the least indication that they are ready to accept any other solution. In the course of this debate one or two valuable suggestions have been made. Lord Harris suggested&#x2014;and a noble Lord opposite said something to the same effect&#x2014;that the Committee instead of having executive should have advisory powers. Perhaps it would be more suitable to discuss that later, when we come to deal with another Amendment I have on the Paper. The proposal is not altogether new to me, for I had already thought of it as one probably worthy of consideration. But in order to bring in a proposal of that sort we ought to have some indication as to the view of the Government. Up to

<col>1117</col>
the present we have had nothing from noble Lords opposite but criticism, and barren criticism at that. As regards the constitution of the Committee, let me say that I am not in the smallest degree enthusiastic over my own proposal, but I think that in default of anything better for the moment it holds the field. An admirable suggestion has been made by the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, and possibly something may occur to other noble Lords. What has been the attitude of noble Lords opposite? The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, has given us a list of things which it is impossible to do, but; he has given no indication of the extent to which the Government would be prepared to go in our direction. It may be good Parliamentary tactics, but it is not the way to arrive at a solution. If a serious effort were made, and if their professions that they desire to help to get to a solution of this difficulty are sincere, I cannot help thinking that there is some way out of the difficulty. Meanwhile, in default of any other proposal, I must ask the House to give their opinion on my Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01865">[The EARL of DONOUGHMORE in the Chair.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01866">Consideration of Clause 1 resumed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01867"><member>LORD HYLTON</member> moved an Amendment to insert in subsection (2) words providing that the opinion as to the character of a Bill should be "expressed from the Chair after not less than one clear day's notice and before the Second Reading of the Bill."</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01868">The noble Lord said: My Lords, when I put down this Amendment it was to the Bill as presented to your Lordships, but the Amendment which was moved by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches and carried last night has to some extent altered the circumstances. But I think not altogether, because Lord Cromer's Amendment, after all, provides no machinery for the announcement to the Houses of Parliament or to the country of the fact whether the Joint Committee which your Lordships substituted for the Speaker have declared a Bill to be a Money Bill or an ordinary Bill. There is another consideration that occurs to me; I do not know whether I am strictly in order in speaking to it, but it is this. When the Bill goes back to another place I suppose even the most sanguine of us do not expect that at all events all of our Amendments will be accepted there, and if the words "Joint Committee" are struck out and the Bill returned to us in its original form with the Speaker restored, I think the words that I now propose will be essentially necessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01869">I am entirely in your Lordships' hands as to whether I should proceed with this Amendment now or leave it to Lord Cromer to bring up on Report a clause providing the machinery which at present he has not provided for announcing to the House of Commons whether in the opinion of the Joint Committee the Bill is a Money Bill or an ordinary Bill. But if it is your Lordships' wish that I should proceed I will, in as few words as possible, bring forward the arguments in support of the Amendment. They have been already fully discussed in the House of Commons on two occasions&#x2014;in the Committee stage and on Report&#x2014;when Mr. Balfour and other speakers on the Opposition side of the House strongly urged the necessity of the House of Commons being informed at the earliest possible opportunity whether a Bill
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0566"/>
<col>1123</col>
brought before them was regarded as a Money Bill or an ordinary Bill. Strange to say, not only did members on the Opposition side of the House point out how vital it was to know at the earliest possible moment whether a Bill was a Money Bill or an ordinary Bill, but the Home Secretary, when the Amendment was brought forward, said that&#x2014;
<quote>"Honourable gentlemen opposite have discovered a considerable flaw and oversight in our proposed legislation on this point."</quote>
I think the main argument that was used on behalf of an Amendment such as this was that as we are now proceeding to frame a written Constitution and putting part of it into statutory form, it is very desirable that other parts should not be left in the air. As one member on the opposite side said&#x2014;
<quote>"When you are discussing this matter it is advisable that all cards should be put on the table."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01870">I am not going this afternoon to weary your Lordships by pointing out the extraordinary difference that will take place in the Parliamentary procedure in the two respective cases of a purely Money Bill and an ordinary Bill, because that is patent to every one who has studied this question. But a very important point has been urged. Why, it is asked, should it be announced to the House of Commons as early as the Second Reading whether a Bill is a Money Bill or an ordinary Bill? The reason is this. It is probable that if a Bill is declared to be purely a Money Bill, closure, for instance, would be much less drastically applied to it. Greater opportunities would be allowed by the Chairman to Members speaking on a purely Money Bill, which under the new <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> would become law within a month of its leaving the House of Commons, than in the case of an ordinary Bill, and the responsibilities of the House of Commons in regard to a purely Money Bill would obviously, therefore, be far heavier. I do not know whether any of your Lordships, after what Lord Marchamley said yesterday, will believe that there are any really independent Members left in the House of Commons. I imagine not. But if there are, it is obvious that on a purely Money Bill they would be more disposed to consult the dictates of their consciences when they knew how very shortly the Bill would become law on leaving their House, than in the case of an ordinary Bill, in regard to which we would be permitted to give the country the space of two years in</p>

<col>1124</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01872">which to consider whether such a Bill should become law or not.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01873">I will not quote more than a word or two of what was said in another place on this subject, but there seemed to be a general consensus of opinion that before the Second Reading took place the announcement ought to be made from the Chair. The argument used for that was this, that, as we all know, the Second Reading is the occasion on which the principle of a Bill is decided. Your Lordships will see that in subsection (3) the Government have provided that there shall be endorsed on every Money Bill when it is sent up to the House of Lords a certificate that it is a Money Bill; but in the opinion of many members of our Party it is highly desirable that long before that moment arrives a preliminary announcement should be made&#x2014;I venture to think before the Second Reading&#x2014;that the Bill is a purely Money Bill. I quoted just now what the Home Secretary said regarding this considerable flaw and oversight which he admitted had been detected by members of the Opposition in respect of this matter, and your Lordships will probably think that any Government when they detected a considerable flaw or oversight in a measure of this importance would not only be willing but anxious to correct it at the first opportunity. But such, I regret to say, was not the case, for the Home Secretary later on in the debate said that, after all, this was a matter that concerned the House of Commons alone. That was not the view taken by Mr. Balfour. He at once rejoined that it appeared to concern not only the House of Commons but the House of Lords and the country as well. The only method by which the Home Secretary and the Government suggested that this considerable flaw and oversight might be remedied was by altering the Standing Orders of the House of Commons. I would only repeat what Mr. Balfour said in regard to this matter&#x2014;that where you are making statutory enactments with regard to a written Constitution it is only fair that if some portions of the Constitution are to assume statutory form other portions should do so equally. For the reasons I have endeavoured to state I beg to move the Amendment standing in my name.</p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01875"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Amendment which the noble Lord opposite has moved is one which deals with the future procedure of the House of Commons. His proposition is that from the Chair the Opinion of, as it will be now, the Joint Committee should be declared before the Second Reading of the Bill. It scorns pretty obvious that the character of a Bill is not necessarily stereotyped at that stage. A Bill may be introduced which has not the character of a Money Bill, and it may become a Money Bill by the elimination of provisions of a legislative character in the course of the discussion. It would therefore seem that the convenient course is the course laid down in the Bill, that when the result of the Amendments made and the discussion which had taken place had been ascertained there should be a certificate&#x2014;whether of the Speaker or of a Joint Committee does not matter for this purpose&#x2014;as to the character of the Bill. Not until time Bill has gone through all its stages can that certificate be properly given. To endeavour to stereotype the Bill at an early stage is to do what may prove nugatory if changes are made. Therefore I would suggest to your Lordships that much the most convenient course is to take the scheme of this Bill, which is that the certificate should be given when the Bill has emerged from the last stage of its consideration and before it comes to this House, and not endeavour to have declared beforehand the character of that which may alter in the course of its stages though the House of Commons. It may hereafter prove desirable, for the facilitation of House of Commons procedure, that there should be Standing Orders on the subject, but all that your Lordships' House is concerned with is that you should have a certificate of the proper authority before the Bill comes up here. It seems to me for that reason that the scheme in the Bill is very much more convenient and more adapted to the practice of the House of Commons than the proposal contained in the noble Lord's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01876"><member>LORD AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: I would like to ask my noble friend who has moved this Amendment whether he has considered it from this point of view, that a Bill might be declared to be a Money Bill and then Amendments might be introduced which brought in general legislation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01877"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: I have an Amendment later on the Paper which meets that point.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1126</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01878"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the answer of the noble Viscount opposite is very far from exhausting the facts of the case. This is a point which has to be discussed at one time or another in Committee, and the present appears to me to be the convenient moment for doing so. There is a word which is particularly dear to the Government, and which I think I am entitled now to apply to the construction of their own scheme. You will find over and over again that this scheme is "sloppy" in the extreme, even from the point of view of the Government in carrying out their conception of what the functions of the two Houses ought to be. The noble Viscount says that this Amendment interferes with the procedure of the House of Commons. It does nothing of the kind. The Government themselves have taken the Speaker out of the House of Commons and propose to give him statutory functions altogether independent of his position in the House of Commons&#x2014;statutory functions which enlarge his responsibility. It is enlarged from responsibility to the House of Commons alone to responsibility to the House of Lords also and to the country at large. Therefore in the first place I altogether demur, and I hope we shall hear no more of that argument, that we are not to say anything about the proceedings of the Speaker or his methods of operation because we shall be interfering with the business of the House of Commons.<lb/>
Now let me come to the argument of the noble Viscount opposite. He says, How inconvenient that the Speaker should give a decision at an early stage in the history of a measure when the subsequent proceedings may alter its character. It may become a Money Bill, he says, during the course of proceedings in the House of Commons. I quite admit that. If it does become a Money Bill, the fact that the Speaker had given an opinion on its earlier character would not prevent him giving an opinion on its altered character. But I put the other case to the Committee. Supposing a Bill is meant by the Government to be a financial Bill, but contains provisions which, in the opinion of the Speaker, remove it from that category altogether, and supposing the Speaker, having come to this conclusion, says nothing at all about it. The Bill goes through all its stages in the House of Commons, and at the very end the Speaker says, "Oh, this is not a Money Bill. This is a Bill belonging
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0568"/>
<col>1127</col>
to Clause 2, not to Clause 1, because of such and such provisions." I can conceive the indignation of the Government and the indignation of the House of Commons. They would say, "Why, if you had told us this earlier, we could have changed our scheme; we could have brought in two Bills; we could have taken those parts which are not financial out of the Bill and put them into another Bill"&#x2014;quite obviously a convenient course for a Government to take in such a case. It seems to me that the convenient course would be for the Speaker or the Joint Committee to say, at the earliest possible stage, what the character of a Bill was. If it was said to be a Money Bill everybody would know it was a Money Bill; but if it contained provisions which removed it into the category of general Bills, then those responsible for the Bill would have to decide what action they would take. And if changes took place in the Bill during its passage through the House of Commons, then its altered character could be adjudicated upon by the Speaker or the Joint Committee.<lb/>
I do not think the Government can possibly leave the thing as it is. It will certainly give rise to confusion and to heartburning, and to something even more dangerous than that, for it might give rise to pressure on the Speaker. I put again the case of a Bill that has been passed through the House of Commons on the understanding that it is a Money Bill and then, just as it is going to pass from the House of Commons to this House, the House gets to know that the Speaker is going to pronounce it other than a Money Bill. I think there would be very strong feeling in the House of Commons that the Speaker ought to have taken the House into his confidence earlier, and the whole tendency of this clause as it stands at present in this respect is to make the already arduous and invidious duties of the Speaker more arduous and invidious still.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01879"><member>THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount opposite, in opposing this Amendment, has unconsciously done himself an injustice. He knows as well as I do that a Bill cannot be transformed from other than a Money Bill into a Money Bill without a Resolution of the House of Commons being passed either in Committee of Supply or in Committee of Ways and Means, and that has<lb/>
<i>The Earl of Selborne.</i><lb/>
<col>1128</col>
to be reported to the House. It would be perfectly possible to place the House of Commons in a far simpler position than it would be in under this clause by the acceptance of this Amendment, and none of the difficulties anticipated by the noble Viscount need be considered as any objection whatever to the proposal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01880"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after what has been said on the Amendment by members of the Front Opposition Bench shall certainly press it to a Division.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01881"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say one word upon this Amendment before we leave it. My noble friend has certainly drawn the attention of the Committee to a most important point, and one which will have to be taken into consideration in our treatment of the Bill. I will not go over the ground which has been already gone over by my noble friends on this Bench, but I think they are certainly right in contending that the Bill as it stands fails altogether to lay down, with any approach to distinctness, the procedure which it is intended should be followed with regard to this matter. I find nothing in the Bill to tell us at what stage of the proceedings it is to be intimated that a Bill falls either within or without the class of Money Bills. I find nothing to indicate where and how the Speaker's decision is to be made known, nor anything to show how the Speaker is to be set in motion. All these are points which we must discuss and in regard to which it may be necessary to make Amendments in the Bill. But what I desire to invite the attention of my noble friend to is this. I am afraid that if we carry his Amendment in the shape in which we find it on the Paper the clause will hardly run. We struck out last night, in line 2, the words "Speaker of the House of Commons," and we inserted the words "Joint Committee." Now, if my noble friend's Amendment were inserted in the words which he has moved, the clause would run thus&#2014;

I do not know how the Joint Committee is to express its opinion from the Chair. It may be a comparatively insignificant point, but I think, if I may venture to suggest it, that my noble friend had better raise the question when we come to Lord Cromer's

<quote>(2) A Money Bill means a public Bill which in the opinion of the Speaker of the House of Commons contains only provisions dealing with all or any of the following subjects, namely, the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on the Consolidated Fund, or on money provided by Parliament, or the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of public money; the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment thereof; or subordinate matters incidental to those subjects or any of them. In this subsection the expressions "taxation," "public money," and "loan" respectively do not include any taxation, money, or loan raised by local authorities or bodies for local purposes</quote>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01885">The noble Viscount said: I ask your Lordships to consider my two Amendments in lines 10 and 11 together. The words in the clause have too wide a latitude, and go very much further than is intended. It seems to me that it might be possible, under these words, to bring in a separate measure altogether, and if that were done then might come the question of the interpretation of the word "subordinate," because subordinate might mean a very different thing to different sets of persons. It is rather bold for a layman like myself, in the presence of the heavy legal batteries on the Front Bench opposite, to express an opinion, but I believe it might be possible under this clause as it at present stands to bring in a Bill to alter the whole constitution of the Revenue Board. I am strengthened still more in bringing this Amendment forward because there was a discussion upon it in the House of Commons on May 9, but that discussion was curtailed by the eleven o'clock rule coming into force after the matter had been debated but a short time, and the debate was closured and
<col>1130</col>
there was nothing further heard of it. The object of my Amendment is to put in plainer language what is meant, and if my two Amendments are carried the clause would read&#x2014;
<quote>"and subordinate matters incidental to the provisions of a Money Bill as defined in this subsection."</quote>
I believe those words would carry out the intention&#x2014;namely, that the matter should be incidental to a Money Bill actually before the House and to a matter contained in that Bill. I have every reason to believe that His Majesty's Government have no desire to unduly enlarge Clause 1, but to confine it entirely to finance and to matters contained in a Finance Bill. I therefore hope they will accept my Amendment, which is not an unreasonable one and is designed to secure that anything that is done under Clause 1 strictly concerns a Money Bill and a Money Bill only.</p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01889"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that the point which the noble Viscount has raised deserves very serious attention, if I may say so with all courtesy to him. The noble Viscount's point is that a Bill is not a Money Bill which only contains subordinate matter. It might be found convenient, after you had imposed a tax, to introduce a Bill regulating the manner of the collection of that tax. Suppose, for example, you had proposed a new Income Tax. The question might arise whether or not it was expedient to collect the tax at the source, and that might require a supplementary Bill. Surely no argument brought forward by the noble Viscount affects a case of that kind, and I do not believe that any noble Lord on the Front Bench opposite will get up and maintain that it does. It cannot be denied that it might be expedient to introduce a supplementary Bill of this kind, turning, not upon the principle of the tax, but upon some detail in relation to the principle and to the amount of the tax, which would be undoubtedly subordinate, and I think it would be most undesirable and entirely
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0570"/>
<col>1131</col>
contrary to the whole spirit of the clause if such a Bill were ruled out, as the noble Viscount proposes. I am afraid, therefore, that we cannot accept the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01890"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture to think that my noble friend's Amendment requires rather more attention than the noble Viscount has given to it. The words as they now stand appear to me to be dangerously wide, and to go even beyond the purpose which the noble Viscount evidently has in his mind. Let me endeavour, if I can, to explain how some of us regard these words. This clause enumerates a long and varied list of subjects which are to be deemed to be matters covered by Money Bills. Bills contained in that enumeration, we must remember, are Bills which this House is not allowed, if I may say so, even to look at. Under this clause not only are we to be precluded from touching a Bill comprised in the main enumeration of the clause, but we are to be precluded from touching a Bill which deals with any matters subordinate or incidental, not to one matter or two matters, but to any matter dealt with in the body of the clause. Surely that widens the definition too much. I know that noble Lords opposite attach great importance to the use of the word "only" in this subsection, but although the word "only" narrows the scope of the clause, its scope is tremendously widened by the introduction of the word "incidental" further on. I quite understand that it should be desired that a Money Bill, one of these Bills which we are not allowed to interfere with, should deal with any subjects and matters incidental or ancillary to the particular subject dealt with in the Bill. But the clause goes further. You have a measure dealing, let us say, with a particular subject, but to that Bill may be attached provisions dealing with any one of the other subjects covered by the clause. That seems to me to go altogether too far, and I think it goes considerably beyond the scope of what was suggested a moment ago by the noble Viscount opposite. I would suggest that some such words as those moved by my noble friend should be adopted; but personally I would prefer the words "or matters subordinate to the provisions of such Bill." That would make it clear that the incidental matters were matters incidental to the Bill in question, not matters incidental to any subject which has a<lb/>

As I understand, his view is this, that matters subordinate ought to be matters subordinate to the Bill itself and not to the subjects which are here enumerated. That brings out the criticism of my noble friend the President of the Council. There might be a Bill brought in dealing with one of the enumerated matters and there might then be a slip, for example, and it might appear that a better method of collection would be desirable&#x2014;collection at the source in the case of Income Tax. If that second Bill was introduced in the following year it would be, within the intention of this clause, a subordinate matter incidental to one of the enumerated subjects, but it would not be a matter subordinate to any Bill before Parliament. That shows why we prefer the words as they stand. For my own part, I really do not think that the apprehensions which the noble Marquess and the noble Viscount expressed are likely to be realised in any way.</membercontribution></p>

are going to ignore altogether the appropriateness of this subordinate matter to a measure before Parliament and say it is sufficient if it can be shown to be incidental to another financial matter which passed the previous year or the year before, it really seems to me to open the door so wide as not possibly to be within the intention of the Government.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01896"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: We shall be glad to hear what His Majesty's Government have to say on the form of words now submitted. The particular suggestion of the Income Tax has been effectually demolished by the noble Viscount who sits behind me. Now we are waiting for another illustration from the assembled wisdom which we see opposite. The noble and learned Lord who spoke just now said it might be necessary to produce a Bill dealing with a purely financial matter the year after, and that it might be incidental to it and ought to come within the provisions of the clause. But under the clause it does not follow that there need be any preceding financial Bill. There might have been no preceding Bill at all, but the measure might be held to be subordinate to one of the subjects of a previous Bill if it had been introduced. I am quite sure that the Government have not reflected how far the words in the clause carry them. All that the Government have done as yet is to give us one instance, which does not apply. They have not yet really grappled with the difficulty which we have exposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01897"><member>TILE LORD CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: I would call attention to the change which has been brought about by the words which have just been handed to me. The noble Viscount now desires that the clause should read, "or subordinate matters incidental to the provisions of such Bill." The question before the Committee is whether the words in line 11, "those subjects or any of them," shall stand part of the clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01898"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most anxious to gratify, or even
<col>1134</col>
entertain, the noble Marquess opposite (Lord Salisbury) if I can succeed in doing so, but I desire that there should be no fighting about words. I wanted to show, by the illustration which I gave, that you might require to alter a Money Bill in regard to the machinery in the following year, either in consequence of a slip or some other discovery. My illustration related to Income Tax, which, of course, as the noble Viscount said, is annually voted by the House of Commons, but I do not know that that circumstance in the least degree affected the argument. But let, me give another illustration&#x2014;the Death Duties and aggregation. It might be desirable to make an alteration in the aggregation. The difference between us is this, that the noble Viscount, in his substituted Amendment, proposes that the subordinate matters shall only be included in this clause if they are incidental to a Bill before the House of Commons. I fully recognise the point, and it would prevent us from bringing in any ancillary or secondary measure in the following year with the benefit of this clause. What we want is to be able to deal in any particular year, either with the enumerated subjects themselves, or with something which is merely subordinate to them. Let me look at the words. The words in the clause are "subordinate matters incidental to those subjects or any of them"&#x2014;that is, subordinate matters which are incidental to what the noble Marquess rightly described as a great variety of financial proposals. How can anybody give a better definition than that? Here are any number of subjects, and you want to be able also to deal with that which is subordinate to them. What in human ingenuity can furnish you with any definition? It is impossible to define innumerable contingencies which might occur in regard to so great a variety of subjects. I do not think you would be able to find any better method&#x2014;although you might find other words of an equivalent character&#x2014;than saying that it may be a Money Bill if it deals with subordinate matters incidental to the enumerated subjects. We really are in danger&#x2014;I do not mean that the noble Marquess has brought the danger very close to us&#x2014;but we are always in danger, in dealing with these things, of getting into a fruitless and sterile discussion on words. You must remember that somebody has to decide whether the measure legitimately comes within the definition. That person or committee, whoever is the authority,
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0572"/>

will have to deal with this thing in a sensible and broad way, and I do not think he would be troubled with so many considerations as seem to afflict the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01902">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I explained my views so fully on this subject in dealing with the former Amendment which stood in my name that I have really very little to add this afternoon. But I should like to say that although, owing to the indulgence of the Committee, I was able to give those explanations, I feel that I owe an apology for mixing up two subjects which demand separate treatment&#x2014;the two subjects of the composition of the Joint Committee and its functions. I wish to submit, as regards this particular Amendment, that whether the deciding authority be, as the Government suggests, the Speaker, or whether it be, as your Lordships suggest, a Joint Committee, in fact, whatever may be the tribunal, either these words or some words analogous to them are absolutely necessary. The reason I hold that opinion is that the deciding authority will have his or their powers limited by the strict text of the Bill. I conceive that the deciding authority will in no way be able to go outside that text. According to the strict text of the Bill, the point to decide is whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not. There is nothing whatever in the clause in the way of guidance as to how the question of a Money Bill should be decided or as to the latitude which should be given in deciding the matter. Surely, if the object is to prevent tacking the deciding authority ought to have a certain latitude in going into what the Prime Minister has called the "governing purposes" of a Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01903"><i>The Lord Chancellor.</i></p>
<col>1136</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01904">In the course of the debate yesterday in dealing with the question of tacking, the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War said he imagined that I, and I presume other members of your Lordships' House on this side, meant by tacking something quite different from what His Majesty's Government mean. I think that is extremely probable. In that case I should very much like to know what His Majesty's Government do mean, for although we have had a good deal of discussion on this subject I hope I may say without offence that their ideas on the subject appear to me to be slightly nebulous. We on this side of the House may fairly lay claim to knowing what we mean by tacking. We mean exactly the same thing as the Prime Minister&#x2014;that is to say, the introduction into a financial Bill of extraneous provisions intended to be applied for political or social purposes. Surely the authority which has to decide whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not ought to have some power to deal with this question. I do not know what is the view of the noble Marquess or others behind me, but I fully accept the definition of the Prime Minister, only I wish to observe that there is no such definition in the Bill. And if the Government are really sincere in their desire to stop tacking, why is not some provision to carry out the Prime Minister's avowed intention introduced into the Bill itself? In the absence of any such provision it appears to me that there is no guarantee whatever that extraneous provisions dealing with social and political subjects, which the Prime Minister has himself condemned, may not be introduced into a Money Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01905">The danger is by no means imaginary. I would remind your Lordships that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who occasionally expresses the views of the Government with a frankness that must be almost embarrassing to some of his more reticent colleagues, the other day used language almost tantamount to boasting that the famous Budget of 1909 was really not a Money Bill at all, but something else. He said that the Budget contained&#x2014;
<quote>"a series of proposals which embodied much of the Liberal plan for dealing with social problems which concern statesmen throughout the world."</quote>
I venture to suggest that a Bill which deals with social problems which concern statesmen throughout the world is not a Money Bill strictly speaking, but a Bill which ought to come within the category of general

<col>1137</col>
legislation. Surely in these circumstances the deciding body ought to have some specific authority to go into the question and say whether a Bill is a Money Bill properly so called, or whether it deals with social or political problems and other extraneous matters which the Prime Minister himself wishes to exclude. In the absence of any such provision we shall, whatever may be the Government's declaration, drift into what will really be single-Chamber government pure and simple, because the Government will be able to introduce into a Bill which is avowedly a Money Bill, without any sort of control by a Second Chamber, proposals for dealing with social and political subjects of a far-reaching character. I beg to move.</p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01907"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I again say what was said yesterday, that the Government are at one with those who think that tacking is an improper process with a Money Bill, but whenever one gets away from that statement of principle one finds that the whole controversy turns on what is meant by tacking. The noble Earl has a very different idea of tacking from the Prime Minister whom he quoted. The whole essence of the Prime Minister's definition lies in the word "extraneous." The Prime Minister never suggested that a Money Bill was to be devoid or divested of all social or political policy. It is perfectly obvious that with every Government the Budget of the year must embody some policy, and I trust that before the debate on this matter finishes we shall have the benefit of the advice of the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, who has had very great experience of these matters. I should like to know whether he will tell us that his Budgets were always devoid of policy. I think I remember many of the Budgets of the noble Viscount in which there was policy, and, if I may say so, in which there was not only properly but necessarily policy. The Budget of the day is part of the political programme of the year, and to take out of it purposes which are political and to say that those purposes may not be the governing purposes in the Budget without bringing
<col>1138</col>
it under the definition of extraneous matters is, I venture to suggest, to make the task of the Chancellor of the Exchequer impossible. The noble Earl referred to the Budget of 1909. That was a very controversial subject, and Heaven forbid that I should venture to discuss it before your Lordships; but the noble Earl let the cat out of the bag as to his views by his reference to it. Whether that Budget was right or wrong, the noble Earl takes hold of it as a Budget which is an illustration of a Money Bill with a governing purpose which amounted to tacking. If that was not what he meant I do not know what he meant. He certainly seemed to me to imply that the Budget of 1909 ought to have gone under Clause 2 of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01908"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: It was the Chancellor of the Exchequer's cat, not mine. I should say that there were certainly some provisions in that Budget which came under the head of general legislation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01909"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: There were in the Budget of 1909 many features which belong to general policy. I should say that the governing purpose of that Budget was to embody policy, and the country certainly thought that it was not improper on the part of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to bring forward that Budget with its far-reaching results on social policy. What is meant by "governing purpose"? If it means that the Finance Bill of the year is not to be the instrument for promoting general policy, then I say that the noble Earl's Amendment, which is directed to effecting that purpose, is one of the most hopeless Amendments that could be brought forward. It is against the whole public sense and the time in which we live. If all that the noble Earl means is that extraneous provisions directed to social and political subjects should be excluded, then I agree. The very fact that they are extraneous shows that they are tacking.<lb/>
What was the origin of the protest of your Lordships' House against tacking? You said, accepting the terms of the Resolutions which are the Charter of the House of Commons in these matters, that the financial provisions of the year were for the House of Commons, that the financial provisions might be set up in Bills, but that it was wrong to tack on to those
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0574"/>
<col>1139</col>
financial Bills extraneous matter which was not really of a financial character. Your Lordships never have contended that the financial provision of the year may not be based on policy and may not have policy as its governing purpose. For instance, in the case of licensing there are provisions in the Budget which are undoubtedly connected with policy. It therefore comes to this&#x2014;that to accept this Amendment would be enormously to limit what has been hitherto understood as the power of the House of Commons in regard to financial measures, to put back the hands of the clock, to throw back the history of our Constitution, to revive the controversies of 1860 and the Resolutions which followed on them in the next year, and to make the task of a modern Chancellor of the Exchequer something very different from what we have been accustomed to see.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01910"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, a most alarming idea has entered into my mind after listening to the noble Viscount.

ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount opposite made such a direct appeal to me that, as on this matter my view in not quite in accordance with the view of those among whom I sit, I ask the Committee to pardon me while I make a few observations on the subject. I do think that there ought to<lb/>
<i>Viscount Haldane.</i><lb/>
<col>1140</col>
be something beyond the <i>ipse dixit</i> of the noble Viscount opposite, valuable as that is, to safeguard this House against the abuse of tacking. There is a well-known Resolution under which your Lordships long ago protested against anything "foreign to or different from" a Budget being added to a Budget, and I should have thought it would have been possible in some way to have embodied that protest as an Amendment in this clause. But I confess I do see some very practical objections to the Amendment which has been proposed by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, and I will endeavour to state them to your Lordships.<lb/>
It must be remembered, in the first place, that the tribunal to which will be entrusted the carrying out of this clause will have to interpret it quite irrespective of the merits of the Bill which will come under its purview. It may be a Bill like the Budget of 1909, to which reference has been already made, which contained provisions, which, in the opinion of many, exceeded the proper provisions of a Budget. It may be, on the other hand, much more of an ordinary Budget, such as the Budgets to which the noble Viscount referred and which I had the honour of introducing in the House of Commons, and yet it might come within the purview of the noble Earl's Amendment. Let me take one of my Budgets. In the last year of the South African War I had to find a considerable amount of money by the imposition of new taxes. Among those taxes I imposed the Corn Duty. I imposed it, as I think is pretty obvious now, solely for the purpose of raising revenue, but the Opposition of that day were almost unanimous, in protesting that the tax was not imposed for the purpose of raising revenue, but as a first step in the direction of Protection. Think what would have been said to and felt by the members of the Committee who might have had to decide the "governing purpose" of that Budget. I think those who were opposed to it in political opinion might very possibly have felt strongly that its "governing purpose" was such as to bring it outside the category of Money Bills. Others, like myself, certainly would have held a very different view, and I do not know how the Committee would have decided. The noble Earl is thinking solely in this Amendment of the possibilities of taxation. He is thinking of taxing Bills which
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0575"/>
<col>1141</col>
might contain something beyond mere proposals of taxation, something calculated, according to what has been said, to tax property owners of one kind or another almost out of existence, and to utilise a Budget, not for the ordinary purpose of raising revenue, but for the purpose of revenge or for some equally bad design against, some part of the community.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01915"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount has quite correctly interpreted my intention.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01916"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: But consider a different class of Money Bill&#x2014;a Bill for raising a loan. I have been responsible in my time for not a few Loan Bills&#x2014;Loan Bills for naval works, for military works, for the purchase of the Royal Niger Company's undertaking, and for the making of the Uganda Railway. What was the governing purpose of any one of those Bills? The governing purpose of a Naval Works Bill, for example, was not merely to raise money but to provide docks, harbours, or what not for strengthening our Navy. The governing purpose of a Military Works Bill was not merely to raise money, but to provide barracks and in other ways strengthen the Army. What was the governing purpose of the Bill for the purchase of the Royal Niger Company's undertaking? Why, to prevent international complications in the West of Africa, a matter of very high policy indeed. We had to raise the money for that purpose through a Loan Bill. What was the governing purpose of the Uganda Railway Loan Bill? That was a new departure in high Colonial policy of the greatest importance, and a departure which bids fair to prove the greatest success, perhaps, of almost anything of the kind this country has undertaken. Does the noble Earl on the Cross Benches intend that his provision shall apply to Bills of the kind I have stated, because if he does I do not think it is a justifiable proposition.<lb/>
What has been the history of Bills of that sort? They have always been passed with more or less debate through the House of Commons, and when they have come up to your Lordships' House they have been treated as practically unopposed measures. Sometimes there has been debate and different opinions have been expressed,
<col>1142</col>
but never, so far as I know, has there been an attempt to amend or throw out one Bill of that sort in your Lordships' House. Some may say there is no harm in relegating Bills of this character to the position of ordinary legislation; but why should we interfere with the recognised position of such Bills, on which this House has never, I believe, had a Division, and ask for a power for this House in dealing with these matters which it has never yet exercised and which I do not believe it desires to exercise at all? I should be glad to support a proposal such as I have ventured to hint at for amending this clause so as to prevent tacking, of which I do see some danger, in the ordinary Budget of the year; but I do feel that what I have endeavoured to put before the Committee is so strong an argument against the noble Earl's Amendment that I for one would be quite unable to support it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01917"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel very much in sympathy with what the noble Viscount has just said, and I wish to indicate one or two reasons why this Amendment is not acceptable, and why, nevertheless, there is matter for consideration in connection with the clause at a later stage when we come to Report. It seems to me that the whole confusion in the noble Earl's mind is between motive and effect. We are not concerned with the motives of legislators. The motives of legislators in their financial policy are political and general and not purely financial, and all through all Budgets there is more or less an underlying political motive. The readjustment of taxation is intended not merely to raise taxation, but to shift the burden, as the statesmen of the day may think more equitable, on the shoulders of various classes. The effect of this Amendment would be to put an impossible burden upon the fairness and impartiality of the tribunal you propose to set up. Such a tribunal as the noble Viscount suggested would give a fair decision on the question of fact. But you are now substituting something else for fact and going into the region of opinion. It is obvious that this new tribunal which you are setting up will be thrown on their own predilections and preferences, and the result will be accidental according to the temporary predominance of one Party or another in that Committee, and to suppose that the House of Commons will submit to that is quite absurd.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0576"/>
<col>1143</col>
By this Amendment you are proposing very greatly to alter the balance of the Constitution in a reactionary sense. It is admitted now that the House of Lords cannot amend a Finance Bill. It is admitted in practice that the House of Lords cannot throw out the finance of the year. What did the late Lord Salisbury say when he was dealing with Sir William Harcourt's Death Duties Budget, which created great irritation in this House? Though he disliked it as much as any one and used every argument he could to disparage and throw contempt on the composition of the House of Commons majority, yet, after he had done all that, he advised your Lordships not to meddle with it, because he said&#x2014;
<quote>"If you attack the finance of the year without being able to remove the Government which is responsible, you dislocate and make a deadlock in all government."</quote>
That was the opinion of a statesman, and every one knows that by the theory and practice of the Constitution the legal rights of your Lordships' House in the matter of finance are obsolescent or dead. When the question of Life Peerages was before this House, Lord Derby said he would not look at any precedent older than 1688. I think that in this question new precedents are the best, and certainly in regard to the relations between the Lords and the Commons on the question of finance the precedents of the last 200 years are worth more than any precedents of an earlier period. But you are now proposing to go back far beyond 200 years. I say very strongly that it is a vicious principle to try to go behind the direct operation of a Bill in order to ascertain the motives of its framers; and it is also an objectionable thing to try to set up in the region of motive and intention what I must call a scratch tribunal of no authority which is to override the historic position of the House of Commons.<lb/>
May I now say a word as to this clause, itself, because while I feel that the noble Earl's Amendment is quite intolerable, I think before we have done with this Bill we shall want a little information and elucidation as to what the exact operation of the clause would be if it became law. The noble Marquess opposite said that noble Lords on this side laid great stress on the word "only." I, too, lay great stress on the word "only," but I do not see myself how the whole of this clause might be construed.<lb/>
<i>Lord Sheffield.</i><lb/>
<col>1144</col>
It is vital that the annual finance of the year should be protected from any invasion such as we experienced a couple of years ago. Then, again, the Loan Bills to which the noble Viscount referred are essential to the carrying on of the work of the country. I feel myself, assuming, of course, that this Parliament Bill becomes law, that the powers of this House will be cut down for all purposes, except merely to provisionally arrest the progress of a Bill, which arrest will come to an end if the House of Commons is of the same mind after two or three years. If that absolute blow is to be struck at the permanent power of rejection of this House, it may be well to allow the House a little indulgence and latitude with regard to some measures as to your Lordships' power of immediate criticism. I will take one Act as illustrating my meaning. I think most people will feel that the old age pensions scheme, though based on finance, was a Bill of great legislation not necessary to the annual administration of the country&#x2014;a step of comprehensive social adjustment. We were told that it was not competent for this House to deal with it as it was a Money Bill, and I repeat that I think there ought to be some latitude allowed to your Lordships with regard to such measures, especially as you will have to give way to the permanent opinion of the other House in a couple of years.<lb/>
I say the same with regard to the National Insurance Bill. That will be a mixed Bill, partly resting on rates and partly on taxes. There is a concession to the Second Chamber in this Bill. A question involving the rates, which hitherto has been considered a matter of privilege in the House of Commons, is to be thrown open to your Lordships' House, but I cannot help feeling that it would be reasonable in measures of this sort&#x2014;and I draw a great distinction between measures necessary for carrying on the government of the country and domestic measures which are not urgent for one year, or perhaps for the second year&#x2014;that some indulgence ought to be shown to this House with regard to their power of debating and amending such measures. At present the whole power of the House of Commons to insist upon its control of finance rests upon long admitted privilege which is recognised as a Constitutional fact. But it is also recognised that the House of Commons, when it pleases, may waive
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0577"/>
<col>1145</col>
that privilege, and there have been plenty of cases where the House of Commons has waived its privilege, and there have been cases where it has not only waived its privilege in individual cases but in regard to a whole class of Bills. I do not need to trouble the House with illustrations. But if this Bill passes in its present form the House of Commons will be in a slightly different position. Its rights will no longer rest on privilege which it can waive, but upon Statute which it cannot waive. The moment a thing is in fact held to be a matter of finance&#x2014;it may be some very small matter&#x2014;it will be impossible for the House of Commons to waive its privilege, and although every statesman would wish an opportunity for free discussion in both Houses, such a Bill would come up here and this House would be absolutely muzzled.<lb/>
Take a question which is a general political question of the greatest interest to every one, but which cannot be said to be for the necessary administration of the country&#x2014;I refer to the question of education, which has created such strong interest and raised the passions of all sorts of people in the country. Any Bill dealing with education necessarily must have a great deal of finance in it. All the education Bills have had finance in them. Yet I cannot help thinking that it would be a pity if this House, or whatever House takes its place, was not at liberty to discuss an Education Bill fully and freely, and, if it should not agree with it, to make it stand over for a year or two. There is an immense difference between a House with a suspensory Veto and a House with a power of absolute rejection. I agree it is a very difficult thing to put words into a clause which may not go further than your intention, and which may not shut out things which you do not wish shut out and abstain from letting in things which you wish let in. I believe this clause follows strictly the practice and privileges of the House of Commons, except that it excepts rates, which hitherto have not been excepted. I do not think any one will deny that this is an honest reproduction of the practice of Parliament.<lb/>
But, if you read this clause, you will find that it deals with the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxation. That is clearly finance. Then there is the imposition, for the
<col>1146</col>
payment of debt or other financial purposes, of charges on the Consolidated Fund. I do not quite know how far the words "or other financial purposes" are meant to go. If you take such a Bill as the Voluntary Aid Schools Bill of 1897, that would be considered an appropriation of money to some other financial purposes. In fact, we know that on that occasion the noble and learned Lord the late Lord Chancellor at once cut in, before discussion began in Committee, and warned the House that it was a matter of privilege of the House of Commons which they must not touch, and the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, said on that occasion&#x2014;
<quote>"Is this a precedent? If it is, I greatly fear the day will shortly come when we shall deeply regret it."</quote>
Then again the noble Lord who was formerly Lord Chancellor of Ireland as well as Lord Halsbury, on the occasion of one of those Bills that were always coming up&#x2014;an Irish Land Bill&#x2014;warned the mover of an Amendment that he could not press his Amendment because it was an infringement of the privileges of the House of Commons. I do not quote what I call House of Commons people, but cases where eminent leaders of the Conservative Party have very peremptorily asserted the rights of the House of Commons when they thought it convenient. Therefore we are face to face at present with precedents. I think that both the late Lord Kimberley and the late Lord Spencer were anxious to move Amendments on the Voluntary Schools Aid Bill, and the late Lord Herschell only gave a hesitating assent to Lord Halsbury's ruling on the question of privilege. I speak in no contentious spirit, because I support this Bill thoroughly and am anxious to see it become law substantially in its present form; but I think the Government, if they are sure of accomplishing their main purpose, would not wish to deprive this House of such reasonable opportunities of discussion as under the changed circumstances every one must desire they should possess. Therefore while heartily agreeing with the noble Viscount and strenuously opposing the Amendment of the noble Earl, I hope that what I have thrown out may not be entirely neglected at a later stage of the Bill with reference to matters of general and not financial legislation. I cannot help thinking that measures such as I have indicated&#x2014;the Education Bill and the Old Age Pensions Bill&#x2014;were the sort of Bills

which the Prime Minister had in his mind when he contemplated that there should be free discussion of measures outside the scope of finance and mainly of a general social character.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01918"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is one remarkable point of agreement in the speeches which have been made on this Amendment. We understand that His Majesty's Government and the noble Lord who has just sat down agree with us that your Lordships have a right to discuss any purely political subject and all questions of policy, although it is contended on the other side of the House that finance is to be taken entirely out of our purview for the future. How far does the Bill as it stands give us the control or even the opportunity of proper discussion, of policy as compared with finance? The noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War used rather strong language with regard to the effect of this Amendment. He said it would enormously limit the power hitherto exercised by the House of Commons, that it would put back the hands of the clock. What does that really amount to? As far as I know it only amounts to this, that under the clause there are a certain number of measures, some of which were enumerated by the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, which, being matters of policy and involving finance, could previously have been rejected by this House, and could under the Amendment of Lord Cromer be discussed, amended and rejected by this House. There is nothing else which by the wording we are now discussing is taken from the House of Commons. Let us be quite clear on this point. Whereas the great majority of finance measures are by this Amendment entirely taken out of our hands, there are a certain number of measures, of which the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, gave us a category, which could under this Amendment be amended as well as rejected by this House. Is not that rather a small change on which to found so great a statement as that of the Secretary for War that we are putting back the hands of the clock and seriously limiting the power of the House of Commons?<lb/>
I should like to put the other side of the argument. Of course it may be possible&#x2014;and I will ask the Government a question on that in a moment&#x2014;to find a way by which these measures should stand as they
<lb/>
<i>Lord Sheffield.</i><lb/>
<col>1148</col>
do now, and I contend that they ought to stand as they do now. My noble friend said the Uganda Railway Bill, the Niger Company Bill, the great Bills for military works, were Bills of high policy. So they are, and they ought to be discussed by your Lordships' House. It may be that it is right that we should not be able to vary the charge imposed by the House of Commons, but to say that measures of that description are outside the purview of this House would be enormously to limit the usefulness of this House, and I speak from an experience of the carrying of those very measures, two out of four, which the noble Lord mentioned. The criticism which they received in this House very materially affected the carrying out of those measures, and that criticism would become altogether ineffective if the carrying of these measures in this House were a foregone conclusion. It is quite true, as the noble Viscount said, that no such measure had ever been rejected by this House; but has such a measure ever been rejected by the House of Commons? No. Any measure dealing with such a subject can usually depend on the support of both Houses. But I think it would be unwise if we were entirely to debar this House on matters of high policy from that opportunity of discussion which it has hitherto enjoyed.<lb/>
But is there not a much greater danger under the clause as it stands of tacking? My noble friend Lord Mayo alluded to the possible carrying of a measure effecting Home Rule for Ireland under this clause. We had a reassuring <i>obiter dictum</i> from the Secretary of State for War on that point, but he, unluckily, is not the man who will decide the point. Supposing a measure is brought forward which hands over the power of raising certain taxation to a body in Ireland, will not that be a financial measure? Will the Speaker of the House of Commons tell us that is not a financial measure? Supposing a fund were to be appropriated for certain Irish purposes, will not that be an Appropriation Bill? Unquestionably it will. Is it beyond the ingenuity of a draftsman to give an authority for ladling out those funds which might, even under the words adopted a few moments ago, come under "subordinate matters incidental to the provisions of such Bill"? There is very great danger, I submit, of tacking under the Bill. I do not say that any Government
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0579"/>
<col>1149</col>
would so obviously misinterpret the intentions of Parliament and go so far beyond their own professions as to endeavour to carry Home Rule under this measure, but I submit to your Lordships that there is great danger that they would endeavour to deal with the revenues of the Church in a manner which might be fatal to the Church. Members of this Government have threatened that they would so use their power of taxation as to produce a complete social change in licensing and in the habits of the people by taxing the present licence-holders out of existence. That is one proposal and there are others that occur to us, and I do not think we should pass this clause without some safeguard.<lb/>
I venture to lay down, and I believe I am absolutely within the scope and the four corners of the Amendment in saying so, that there is nothing taken from the House of Commons by this Amendment except in the final words which bring any financial measure which is of general policy within the power of this House to amend as well as to reject. I do not know whether my noble friend would be willing to make a concession on that point. The questions I would ask the Government are, first, Are they willing to allow this House with regard to measures of high policy the same power of rejection which it has had heretofore, although finance is involved; and, secondly, Are they prepared themselves to admit some such words as my noble friend Lord Cromer proposes to prevent tacking in a manner which might seriously affect various institutions in the country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01919"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the speech which your Lordships have just heard will show to the House the very grave realities we have to deal with in this debate. When the noble Earl, Lord Cromer, brought forward his Amendment he treated, quite properly if I may say so, his three Amendments as hanging together as part of a scheme. Your Lordships have already adopted one. When I was criticising the first, I ventured to criticise the group as a consistent whole, which is the only way of effectually debating any Amendments to a Bill. I ventured to point out that, taken together, these Amendments constituted a greater invasion of the rights and privileges of the House of Commons in regard to Money Bills than anything that had hitherto been
<col>1150</col>
proposed. The noble Viscount who has just sat down told us that the power of the House of Commons had increased, was increasing, and ought to be diminished.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01920"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: May I interrupt the noble and learned Lord? I said that the pretensions of the House of Commons as regards privilege had increased, were increasing, and ought to be diminished.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01921"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: It is upon privilege that the financial rights of the House of Commons depend, and that most unfortunate expression of the noble Viscount only reflects the attitude which he and his friends are trying&#x2014;I hope they will not succeed&#x2014;to induce this House to take. I have been warned off the Budget of 1909, and I will not venture to refer to it. But consider the position we are in. I thought we were dealing with a Bill which was the result of a General Election, of an attempt to strengthen the position of the House of Commons both in regard to finance and other matters; but here we are dealing with the proposition that the power of the House of Commons with regard to privilege&#x2014;which is finance&#x2014;has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished.<lb/>
I beg your Lordships to consider the gravity of the situation raised by that attitude. Now let me point to this Amendment for a moment. I will try and show its effect by what is, after all, the simplest method&#x2014;illustration. Let me take the case of a Finance Bill which proposes, among other things, to impose another 3<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> upon spirits. If ever there was a finance provision according to all the interpretation that has ever been put upon Money Bills since Parliament existed, that would be a Money Bill. Surely no one will dispute that. At present no one could say that in clauses of that kind there was anything at all approaching tacking. There has been a complete misconception about tacking. Tacking has been defined by this House itself in the year 1702 or 1703 as something which is "foreign to and different from the matter of such Bill." In the case to which I am referring nobody could suggest that there was tacking. Your Lordships could now by strict law throw out a Finance Bill which contained that provision. You would thereby bring about what the late Lord Salisbury well described
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0580"/>
<col>1151</col>
some years ago; you would produce a deadlock and almost frustrate the existence of the Government. The Government could not go on if that kind of thing were done. It was done once, and I think disastrously. Everyone knows that such a Bill as the Finance Bill has really until eighteen months ago never been thrown out by the House of Lords. Now supposing that this Amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Cromer, were introduced, this could happen in regard to such a Bill. The House of Lords would be entitled by a Resolution to ask the House of Commons to summon the Joint Committee, and then although this was a Money Bill in every sense in which Money Bills have ever been understood in the past, they would ask the Joint Committee whether the governing purpose of the Bill, or at all events of a portion of it, was not such as to bring the Bill within the category of general legislation, and whether it was not desirable to consider whether it was fair to the licensed trade and to consult the licensed trade and the brewers upon it. If the Committee said "Yes," you could throw the Bill out, or you could amend it and deal with it freely in a way which nobody has suggested this House could ever do before.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01922"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: According to the words of the Amendment it would only be "such portion thereof." It would not bring the whole Bill under amendment, only that portion of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01923"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: It would bring the Bill into Clause 2, and the House of Lords could suspend the Bill for two years. I beg your Lordships to read the words before you commit yourselves to a proposal of this kind. That being the case, the test of tacking is altered altogether. The noble Viscount, in a speech which I think has not been answered and which it would be very difficult indeed to answer, said that he had introduced Loan Bills in the House of Commons under the acknowledged and undisputed privilege of the House. They were Money Bills, and nobody has ever sought to suggest in the long and protracted history of this controversy that the House of Lords could treat those as other than Money Bills. The truth of the matter is that the Amendment is not only enlarging the doctrine of tacking, but substituting something entirely different. The doctrine of tacking meant that you must not take advantage of a Money Bill in order to get<lb/>
<i>The Lord Chancellor.</i><lb/>
<col>1152</col>
something which is quite outside it. That is what tacking was. But this proposal is to give the House of Lords jurisdiction over a Money Bill when the matter complained of is perfectly germane and, indeed, necessary to the Bill, if this Committee of fourteen gentlemen with the Speaker at their head say that the governing purpose of the Bill is something which brings it within the category of general legislation. That is what I meant yesterday when I suggested to the noble Earl that there has never been an attempt hitherto to make such an invasion on the rights of the House of Commons. Although I am sure that neither he nor the noble Marquess meant it, that is the effect of the proposal, and it has been so demonstrated by the speech of the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, one of the greatest living authorities upon such a subject. The House of Commons are very sensitive with regard to Money Bills, because they know perfectly well that a great part of the policy of this country is governed by finance. No one knows better than the noble Earl himself that finance is at the root of government. Finance is the privilege of the House of Commons, and because of that the House of Commons is the supreme power in Parliament. When your Lordships lay hands upon what I may call the Ark of the Covenant the House of Commons is sensitive to the last degree.<lb/>
Some of your Lordships may have read the report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons which sat in the year 1860 after the famous dispute about the Paper Duties. That Committee consisted of the most eminent men of the day on both sides of the House of Commons&#x2014;Gladstone, Russell, Palmerston, Disraeli, Bright, and other famous names. They tell the whole history of this subject in a way which is indeed instructive, and they show the sensitiveness&#x2014;almost unparalleled in any other department of the State&#x2014;of the House of Commons with regard to finance. And for this very reason, that finance is the root of policy. There are many Bills which your Lordships may throw out which have nothing to do with money. But when you say that the test should be whether a matter ought to be a matter for general legislation, you really are taking a step of which I think&#x2014;complicated, difficult, and troublesome as this question is&#x2014;your Lordships do not quite realise the extent and depth.
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0581"/>
<col>1153</col>
What does it mean? It means an absolute defiance. I am sure the noble Marquess does not so intend it, but if he will try and look at it from the point of view that I have endeavoured to present&#x2014;and if he thinks I have exaggerated let him recall what Lord St. Aldwyn said&#x2014;he will realise the serious position raised for the House by this group of Amendments, the first of which, unfortunately&#x2014;I hope not irreparably&#x2014;your Lordships have adopted. How after the history of the Parliament Bill a claim of this kind can be advanced. I beg respectfully to say really passes my understanding.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01924"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble and learned Lord who has just addressed us truly said that the matter which we are discussing this evening is one of grave reality. We recognise its grave reality on this side of the House, and in the very few words which I wish to address to your Lordships I desire to make clear what the particular danger is against which we desire that this House should be safeguarded. The Lord Chancellor devoted a considerable part of his observations to an account of tacking as he understood it and as defined by the famous Resolution of the year 1702. As your Lordships are well aware, that kind of tacking occurs when to a financial measure is attached some other matter which is extraneous and foreign to the substance of the measure, and which is obviously grafted on to the financial Bill in order to make it easier for the Government of the day to carry it through Parliament. We fully recognise that that kind of tacking has to be provided against. But in our view that is very far indeed from covering the whole ground. There is another kind of tacking which to our minds is much more insidious and dangerous. It occurs when you are confronted with a Bill which is beyond all dispute a Bill dealing with finance, but of which the ulterior objects and consequences are not by any means of a financial character but of a character which I think the noble and learned Lord described as political. It is against both of those kinds of tacking that we desire to introduce safeguards.<lb/>
I am well aware how difficult it is to find a satisfactory definition of the second kind of tacking to which I have referred, but in our view some definition is certainly needed. We are ready to discuss with an open mind the terms of that definition, but we feel that the danger is a real one and that we
<col>1154</col>
must interpose some safeguards against it. Surely it is the case that there must always be, between the region of pure finance and that which is not pure finance, a kind of indefinite zone&#x2014;a zone, if one may pursue the analogy of a frontier question further, which might be claimed by one neighbour or by another. What His Majesty's Government desire is to say that, although there may be an adjacent region which might fairly and reasonably be claimed either by the one side or by the other, it is the House of Commons and the House of Commons alone which is to decide whom that intermediate zone is to belong to. That, in our view, is not fair play as between the two Houses. We suggest that there should be in this Bill, in the first place, a broad and general indication of the kind of limits which you desire to assign to the region of pure finance; in the next place, we desire to have a tribunal which shall interpret that definition when you have provided us with it. I thought the noble and learned Lord fell into a mistake when he told us that the Committee which we desire to set up would be called upon to say&#x2014;I think the instance he put was the case of a Licensing Bill&#x2014;whether the Licensing Bill was fair to the holders of licensed premises or not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01925"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I did not mean to say that, and I was wrong if I said that. What I meant to say was that the Committee would be called upon to say whether the governing purpose of a Bill was general legislation or not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01926"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord will forgive me, but that is not what he did say. It will not be the duty of the Committee to deal with the question of fairness or unfairness. They will simply have to decide whether a measure does or does not fall within the region of pure finance. My Lords, to us the importance of this matter is immense, because, pray do not let us forget, this Bill completely alters the Constitutional position of your Lordships' House with regard to finance. At this moment we have the legal right, not only of discussing financial Bills, but of rejecting them. I know the noble and learned Lord says that it is unconstitutional for us to reject them, but we have the right; and do not let us forget Mr. Gladstone's famous dictum that the House of Lords might even do well to retain its right even of amending financial
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0582"/>
<col>1155</col>
Bills. I do not press that now, but in the case of one of these mixed Bills which I am endeavouring to describe we have at present undoubtedly the right, not only of discussing the Bill, but of adhering to our objections to it, and, if necessary, rejecting it and bringing about a deadlock. This Bill puts an end to that entirely. It rules us out <i>ab initio</i> from any right to discuss, for more than a few hours, or days at the outside, any Bill covered by the immensely wide definition contained in this first clause, and it substitutes for the elastic procedure to which we are used an absolutely rigid rule stripping us absolutely of all our powers of dealing with this great branch of legislation. Therefore I say the words of this definition are to us of absolutely vital moment.<lb/>
We on this Bench do not desire to insist overmuch upon our words and are ready to consider other words if noble Lords opposite wish to suggest them. But I ask the House to notice this, that Ministers themselves have again and again admitted the necessity of taking some precautions against that second form of tacking which I described to your Lordships a moment ago. An interesting speech was delivered a few minutes ago by the noble Lord, Lord Sheffield. He made it perfectly clear that in his view this Bill went a great deal too far in depriving your Lordships of an opportunity of discussing measures financial in form but more than financial in substance. Great importance was attached, and rightly attached, by the noble and learned Lord to what was said by my noble friend Lord St. Aldwyn. I understand that Lord St. Aldwyn does not like the words proposed by my noble friend on the Cross Benches. I repeat that we are not obstinate as to the selection of the words, and it may be possible that we can discover better words. But I do wish, in justice to my noble friend who moved the Amendment, to say something in defence of the particular formula which he has suggested&#x2014;I mean the formula in which the expression "governing purpose" occurs. The Prime Minister delivered, in the House of Commons on April 11, a remarkable speech dealing with the whole of this question of the necessity of treating matters of finance differently from matters involving ordinary legislation. Throughout that speech the expression "governing purpose" occurs<lb/>
<i>The Marquess of Lansdowne.</i><lb/>
<col>1156</col>
again and again. I see the noble Viscount looking at his <i>Hansard.</i> The page is 258, Volume 24. The Prime Minister cites the Poor Law Bill of 1834, the Education Bills of 1902 and 1906, and he says with regard to those measures&#x2014;
<quote>"The substantial governing purpose [of these Bills] was not financial, but some larger or social policy, though, for the purpose of carrying that policy out, they contained incidentally financial provisions."</quote>
There the expression "governing purpose" is used, it seems to us, most appropriately, and I am not surprised that my noble friend should have annexed it. But I will read another passage lower down in the same speech which I think is even more remarkable. This is what Mr. Asquith said&#x2014;
<quote>"The criterion here is not whether an Amendment made by the House of Lords to a Bill is a technical infringement of the privileges of this House. Amendments of that kind would not fall within our definition. We are dealing here with Bills which are financial Bills, as I have already said, in the strict literal and full sense of that term, and&#x2014;</quote>
I would draw particular attention to this&#x2014;
<quote>"the test whether a Bill is a financial Bill or not is whether that is its main governing purpose."</quote>
There is, therefore, ample authority for the phraseology of my noble friend. What follows is very important. That is the Prime Minister's way of dealing with financial Bills of which the governing purpose might be other than financial. But then he goes on&#x2014;
<quote>"It is intended further by this clause to prevent the House of Commons taking advantage of this procedure for the purpose of what is called tacking or annexing to a Bill which is financial in its character provisions which are extraneous and not incidental to its financial purpose."</quote>
There you have, it seems to me, in the clearest language possible a perfectly explicit description of the two different kinds of tacking which it is necessary to guard against, and if I did not wish to avoid wearying the House with quotations I could quote an expression of the Home Secretary's on the Report stage when he repeated Mr. Asquith's language in equally precise terms. I have said enough, I hope, to show that my noble friend on the Cross Benches is at any rate to be excused if he has taken for the purpose of his Amendment the actual language of the Prime Minister. As I have already said, if it comes to a question of words we are
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0583"/>
<col>1157</col>
ready to discuss the words with noble Lords opposite, but some effective precaution is necessary in order to guard both against tacking in the technical sense of the word and also against the larger and more dangerous tacking which I have endeavoured to describe. Of that we are quite satisfied, and we shall press for the addition of some such words to the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01927"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: I should like, with the permission of your Lordships, to enforce upon the Government the point made by my noble friend behind me, and which apparently they were not going to try and answer. They agree that tacking is a reprehensible practice which should be prevented, but they define tacking only in a sense which excludes what we call "moral tacking." The Lord Chancellor made a very impressive speech, but I wish your Lordships to observe that he very carefully refrained from touching the point of our contention. He took every opportunity of expressing agreement with my noble friend behind me, but he very carefully ignored the criticism of my noble friend in which he said that some change in the words of this clause was necessary. Let us take a concrete case, and ask the Government exactly what they do intend. Suppose in a purely financial Bill there was a provision for taxing every railway dividend in this country at 20<i>s.</i> in the pound. That is a purely financial provision, and the equilibrium of the Budget of the year might depend on this railway taxation. But everybody would know that the real object of the tax was not to raise money but to nationalise the railways. Is that a measure which should be in the power of the House of Commons alone to deal with, and in regard to which the Second Chamber ought to be precluded from having any power of intervention? The same principle might be used to deal with land. It would be very easy to nationalise the land by the simple process of taxation. Is that legitimate and pure finance? Or, again, the Church of England might be practically denuded by means of taxation in a Finance Bill. Would that be pure finance? Do the Government intend that such provisions as those should be within the purview of the House of Commons alone? From what he said just now, I understand Lord Sheffield does not think that those are provisions which should be
<col>1158</col>
taken away from the purview of this House. But the Government have very carefully avoided coming to the point. They have not answered this question. Do they intend that no kind of restraint is to be put on the power of the House of Commons to deal with all the property of this country by means of taxation, and bring about any social or political change by means of taxation alone? If that is not the intention of the Government&#x2014;and I do not think it is, judging from what their spokesmen said in the House of Commons&#x2014;then can they show us that this Bill makes provision against such a thing? But if they do intend it, then surely it is just as well that owners of every kind of property in this country should understand that that is the policy of the Government.<lb/>
When we came forward and offered, so far as we were concerned, to abandon our power of rejection of an ordinary Finance Bill, we did it only because we wished and hoped that a line would be drawn between an ordinary Finance Bill and a Bill bringing about vast political and social revolutions. If the Government tell us that it is impossible to make such a distinction, if they decline to bring forward words to make a distinction between pure finance and these great changes which might be brought about under the guise of finance, then certainly as far as I am concerned I take my stand on the old position, and am not prepared to meet the Government by giving up the power that this House now possesses. I would take my stand on the provisions which the Government themselves introduced into the Constitution of the Transvaal only four years ago&#x2014;provisions by which the Second Chamber, although not allowed to amend, was given power to reject financial proposals. Our offer was made in the <i>bona fide</i> hope that a line could be drawn between these two classes of financial measures, and it is up to the Government either to show us that the dangers I have endeavoured to portray and to which my noble friend has so clearly drawn your Lordships' attention do not really exist, or, if they cannot show that, to help us to bring forward words which will avoid the criticism they have made on the words of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches and which will carry out what they profess to be their intention. Speaking only for myself, I want to make it perfectly plain to the Government that,
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0584"/>
<col>1159</col>
if they cannot do that, I revert to the position we held before these debates began, that no Second Chamber ought to have less powers in matters of finance than those which the present Government gave to the Transvaal four years ago.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01928"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, two speeches which have been delivered within the last hour have been of peculiar interest&#x2014;the speech of the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, and the speech of the noble Earl who has just sat down&#x2014;because in both cases when you follow out what is in the minds of the speakers you find an attempt to set up something very different from the relation between the two Houses of Parliament which exists at the present time in regard to finance.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01930"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl is asking for a definition to be inserted and a clause to be added which, as was shown by Lord St. Aldwyn, would certainly carry control of policy and taxation far further than it exists at the present time. The noble Earl quoted the case of the Transvaal Constitution, but that is a case of a written Constitution where the sovereignty between the two Chambers is adjusted and where there is very little analogy to the case which we have to deal with here. We are now dealing with the position of the House of Commons under an unwritten Constitution&#x2014;a position in which the House of Commons has asserted hitherto, and asserted successfully, its right to control the financial policy of the year. That unbroken right had not been challenged until there came the disastrous year 1909, when this House expressed its opinion upon the question which the noble Earl has put forward. The Government by this Bill have stereotyped what they believe to be the true position, the position as affirmed by the country in the election which followed the 1909 Budget, and in the election which followed that. The position of the Government is that they desire to stereotype the true view, and not the false view, in regard to finance, and they consider that the view which the noble Earl has put forward is a view which has been falsified not only by the judgment of the constituencies but by the practice of your<lb/>

<col>1160</col>
Lordships' House. What the noble Earl really desires is to set up new privileges for the House of Lords which it has not hitherto possessed, and what we desire is to restrict that intention.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01931"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Viscount is referring to myself, I beg to give a most emphatic denial to that statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01932"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: No, I was referring to the noble Earl, Lord Selborne. But I have a word for the noble Earl himself also. His proposal, as Lord St. Aldwyn and other speakers have shown, goes further than any power which this House has hitherto had. His words would give this House power over the general policy embodied in the Budget, and take it away from the House of Commons. Certainly there is now no power in your Lordships' House to amend a Budget Bill. Certainly it is very doubtful whether a Budget Bill will ever again be rejected. We do not know. It may be. I hope not. But the wording which the noble Earl has proposed goes far beyond the position as it has been up to the present time, because in express terms it leaves it to this statutory Joint Committee to, if it pleases, subject the policy of the Budget of the year to the control of this House in a way that that control has never been exercised before. If the governing purpose is, in the view of that Committee, something which goes beyond mere finance, then the Bill is taken away from Clause 1&#x2014;in other words, the Budget of the year is to be treated under this Amendment as it never has been treated hitherto. And notwithstanding the studiously moderate and careful speech of the Leader of the Opposition, who puts his case far more carefully, I could not help noticing even in his case a desire to go beyond the doctrine against tacking as it has obtained up to the present time, and to introduce something&#x2014;he did not tell us how it was to be defined&#x2014;which would interfere with the sovereignty of the House of Commons and destroy the position which that House has hitherto occupied.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Earl, Lord Cromer, who is responsible for this Amendment, has already made that disclaimer on his own behalf, but I should not like the disclaimer to be limited to the Cross Benches. I should like it to be made also on behalf of those who sit on these Benches. Instead of seeking to obtain any greater power than we at present: enjoy, instead of seeking to derogate from the financial supremacy of the House of Commons, we are really only asking the Government to assist us in the solution of a difficulty the full measure of which they have themselves acknowledged. The noble Viscount, I think, used the words "moral tacking," or, at any rate, tacking of the nature which we call moral tacking. He said that was a matter which the Government themselves were anxious to safeguard.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01934"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The words were "the tacking of extraneous matters."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01935"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I do not accept the phrase "extraneous matters," because I think that relates to the first class of tacking to which the noble Viscount alluded. I refer to the second and more dangerous class&#x2014;the class of tacking which was clearly contemplated by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons when he used the phrase "governing purpose."</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01937"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: Yes, he did use the words "extraneous platters," but he clearly distinguished between the two classes. When he used that phrase he was referring to tacking No. 1, and when he used the words "governing purpose" he was referring to tacking No. 2. Will not the Government help us in this matter? The responsibility is theirs. The Bill is theirs. The difficulty is one they have admitted. I do not mind their saying that our draftsmanship on this side of the House is extremely clumsy, but I ask them, will they not come to our help? I make the suggestion in all seriousness. When this matter was discussed in the House of Commons, not precisely on this
<col>1162</col>
Amendment but on an Amendment analogous to it, no one admitted more readily the gravity of the case and the necessity of meeting it than the Prime Minister. My recollection of his speeches is that he said, "This matter ought to be provided against; you have suggested certain words to us; we think your words are bad; we think they go beyond what you yourselves desire to claim; we only adhere to our own words which appear in the Bill because so far nothing better has been produced in their place."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01938"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I do not think that is right.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01939"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I believe I am correct, and I think I could provide the noble and learned Earl with the reference. But I only rose to make a disclaimer, and have not the materials before me at the moment. But, my Lords, has not the substance of all the speeches that we have heard been that there is something against which we all want to provide? The noble Lord, Lord Sheffield, clearly made that admission, and the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn&#x2014;whose criticisms upon this Amendment have received much more attention and applause from the other side than his criticisms of the proposals of His Majesty's Government&#x2014;certainly admitted that something was necessary, but said he did not quite like the present form of words. It seems that we are really in a position in which the agreement between the two sides of the House is rather greater than the difference; and if at the present moment words cannot be suggested which will satisfy my noble friend Lord St. Aldwyn and those who agree with him, may we not hope that at a later stage of the Bill such words may be found? And may we not ask noble Lords opposite to exert their inventive ability in assisting us to find those words? If His Majesty's Government are themselves willing to help us I am sure there is no one on this side of the House who would not be extremely grateful to them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01940"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the most remarkable feature in this debate has been that, although my Amendment has met with a good deal of criticism from the other side, not a single noble Lord opposite has stood up to defend the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0586"/>
<col>1163</col>
proposals of the Government. After all, that is the main thing. It appears to me that noble Lords opposite are putting upon us a duty and responsibility which they have no right to put upon us. They bring forward a Bill which even their own supporters admit is open to very great objections. It is for them to find a way out of the difficulty, and not for us. I dare say the Amendment is open to considerable objection. I was very much struck by what the noble Viscount (Lord St. Aldwyn), who speaks with so much authority on financial matters, said. I wish, however, to repeat the denial I gave when the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War was speaking, that certainly it was not in the least the intention of this Amendment to extend the powers of the House of Lords in any degree. I said most plainly yesterday that I accepted entirely as my point of departure the Resolution which was moved by the noble Marquess last November. I have not got it here to</membercontribution></p>

The noble Lord said: As regards this Amendment I hardly know whether I
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0588"/>
<col>1167</col>
shall get much support on this side of the House for it, because it owes its inception, not to my drafting, but to that of His Majesty's Government. At all events, whatever view His Majesty's Ministers may take of this Amendment, they will not be able to find fault with the drafting of it, because it is a provision that appeared in the original draft of the Bill. I suppose there is no doubt that when the Bill was first brought in by His Majesty's Government they recognised that it would be only fair, in view of the enormous additional privileges that would be conferred on the House of Commons exclusively with regard to Money Bills under the new <i>r&#x00E9;gime,</i> that a subsection should be added to the clause in the terms that appear on the Paper in my name&#x2014;namely, that no Amendment should be allowed to a Money Bill which, in the opinion of the Speaker of the House of Commons, was such as to prevent the Bill retaining the character of a Money Bill. But when these words came under discussion in the House of Commons, His Majesty's Government announced their intention of withdrawing the subsection altogether. The only reason that was given to the House of Commons for this course was that in the opinion of His Majesty's Ministers it would be more convenient that the matter should be left to be dealt with either by Standing Order or by the Speaker when he thought fit.<lb/>
I do not know whether any of your Lordships have taken the trouble to read the debates in the House of Commons on this measure, but they are very instructive, I venture to think, for several reasons. One reason is that nearly every argument addressed to the Government for Amendments from the Opposition side of the House was treated with a scant measure of consideration. The answers that were given as a rule, on this point especially, were divided into one or two classes. One answer given by His Majesty's Government was that it was a matter entirely for the consideration of the House of Commons, and that Standing Orders would effectively deal with any difficulty that would arise, or if anybody felt any doubt on the subject they might apply to the Speaker. When a question was put as to how and when the Speaker was to give his opinion on these matters, the answer was given on one occasion, "The Speaker can choose his own time." The Attorney-General stated that an expression of opinion could<lb/>
<i>Lord Hylton.</i><lb/>
<col>1168</col>
be obtained from the Speaker in an informal way, and when invited to describe to the House how an opinion could be thus obtained he replied that he supposed by Members asking Questions on the subject. A member of the Government also said that it was a pity to put the matter into any statutory form, because the Speaker might very well have one opinion at one time and another opinion at another stage. In general the answers that were given by His Majesty's Government in this matter may be practically summed up in the three words, "Wait and see."<lb/>
I think your Lordships will consider, as I ventured to point out when I moved the previous Amendment on which this hangs, that it is very undesirable if you are going to have a written Constitution that part of it only should be expressed in statutory terms, and that the remainder should be left in this very loose and unsatisfactory condition. It is for these reasons that I beg to move, after subsection (3), the insertion of the new subsection standing in, my name. After what the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition said with regard to the first Amendment I moved this afternoon, and in view of the Amendment by the noble Earl, Lord Cromer, substituting the words "Joint Committee" for "the Speaker," it will be within the recollection of your Lordships that I did not press my first Amendment to a Division, in order that I might have the opportunity of altering the form of words so as to make it more consonant with the Amendment of the noble Earl. I propose to do the same with this Amendment, not putting your Lordships to the trouble of a Division upon it; but at the same time I would respectfully ask His Majesty's Ministers whether they do not think that as to this Amendment, originally drafted by themselves and inserted in their Bill when it was introduced into the House of Commons, we ought to receive some advice on the subject now.</membercontribution></p>

consequential to the Amendment originally moved by the noble Lord&#x2014;the Amendment, namely, which was discussed at the beginning of to-day's proceedings, and under which there was to be an expression of opinion from the Chair before the Second Reading of the Bill and a notice. That having been provided for, it became important&#x2014;one can follow the importance easily&#x2014;to put in some such subsection as the noble Lord now proposes preventing any change being made in the character of a Bill. But the noble Lord did not persist in his first Amendment, I think in response to an appeal from the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, and the result is that the Amendment he has now moved assumes a different character. It becomes a pure matter of the procedure of the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01955"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I will state the difficulty. This subsection was brought up and scrutinised in debate in the House of Commons. Both sides agreed that it was an unfortunate subsection, and it was withdrawn because it was found that it would very much fetter the freedom of action, not only of the Speaker, but of the Chairman of Committees in dealing with Amendments. They would have been bound to scrutinised in each case to see whether the Amendment was legally in order, and it was pointed out that it was quite impossible to justify dealing upon a
<col>1170</col>
statutory basis with what was proper to be regulated by the Standing Orders of the House of Commons. That was the view taken by the Home Secretary who moved the omission of the subsection. Mr. Bonar Law entirely concurred, so that both sides of the House were agreed. I therefore trust that the noble Lord will not press the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01956">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01957"><member>THE LORD CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: The question is that Clause 1, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01958"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before this Clause is passed I hope your Lordships will allow ate to say a few words by way of respectful protest against it. Before we began this discussion I was alarmed at the clause, and now I am much more alarmed at what the Government have had to say about it. Although we have been attempting to define what is a Money Bill the real question now is what is not a Money Bill. Almost any question in the world might be brought under the definition of a Money Bill. In saying that we view this clause with apprehension, I am not speaking in any Party sense, nor in the interests, or merely as wishing to maintain the dignity, of this House, but in the interests of the nation itself. There is scarcely any country under single-Chamber government which is prudently or economically governed, or whose finances are in a satisfactory condition. In absolute or semi-absolute Governments the Monarchs feel a sort of personal interest. In our case, however, the proposal is most dangerous. We are not only to be reduced to single-Chamber rule, but to that of a Chamber under closure. Under this clause any loan, however large can be guaranteed, however unwise such a course may be, and the House of Commons can be prevented from even having any discussion on the subject. Our Second Chamber will have less power over finance than, I believe, any other in the world. Unfortunately our national credit is gradually sinking, and if we should require to borrow we shall do so under very unfavourable circumstances. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has alleged, in reply to Sir F. Banbury, the member for the City, that Consols fell under the late Government in a time of war that was, however, inevitable, but with the return of peace we might reasonably have

<col>1171</col>
hoped that they would have risen. For the further fall which has since taken place during peace the financial policy of the Government must bear the responsibility. I cannot believe that the provisions of this clause can be permanent and only hope that it may be reversed before much more injury has been inflicted on the credit of the country. In making this respectful protest I believe I am expressing the opinion of the overwhelming majority of those who are responsible: for the commerce and manufactures of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01959"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened to every word of the debate on this first clause, but I did not think it right to take part in the discussion. But the present position raises a Constitutional point to which I should like, if I may, to call the attention of the noble Viscount and my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor. I was very much struck by the great moderation of some of the speeches made from the Government Bench last night, notably the speech of my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor, which seemed to me to be couched in language which was an example to us all. It seems, however, to me to be a little overlooked that prior to this Bill this House had certain rights. I agree that there was a discussion about it, and I am going to follow the example of my noble and learned friend in not going back into the history of what were the rights of the House of Lords. But it cannot be denied that if this clause&#x2014;Clause 1&#x2014;stands when this Bill is passed those rights are taken away and the House of Lords will not have the right either of amending or rejecting a Finance Bill. It will pass without the control of the House of Lords. Nobody will deny, therefore, that this Bill constitutionally puts an end to the discussion that previously existed, and does establish a paper Constitution with regard to what are to be the rights of the House of Lords. The Government, quite rightly from that point of view&#x2014;I can assure noble Lords I am not making this speech from a Party point of view at all; nothing of the kind is entering into my mind&#x2014;propose by legislative enactment to prevent the House of Lords having any right to either amend or reject a pure Finance Bill. In those circumstances it does seem to me that the right view is that when such a Bill is introduced it is the duty of those who propose the Bill to deal with admitted difficulties and<lb/>
<i>Lord Avebury.</i><lb/>
<col>1172</col>
admitted doubts that arise out of the proposal.<lb/>
The question is not whether the Speaker or a Joint Committee is the better authority for deciding what is a Finance Bill. The question is one of defining the means by which it should be decided what is a Finance Bill. The debate to-night has shown that His Majesty's Government in the House of Commons and speakers for His Majesty's Government in your Lordships' House have admitted the existence of this difficulty of defining a Finance Bill and properly safeguarding the rights of your Lordships' House in the case of Bills that are not purely Finance Bills. I respectfully submit that in those circumstances there is a moral obligation upon the promoters of the Bill to deal with such a matter. It does not touch, as I said, the question of who is to decide it; it is a question of what is to be submitted to the tribunal that has to decide. If I may be allowed to say so, I quite share the criticisms which have been addressed to the Amendment of Lord Cromer; but it seems to me that as a principle the matter is one which the Government might fairly take into consideration, seeing that the Prime Minister and noble Lords on the other side of this House have admitted that it is a difficult matter to say what is a Finance Bill and what is not. If the principle of Lord Cromer's Amendment touches the difficulty which is admitted to exist I think a serious duty is thrown upon His Majesty's Government to see that the matter is properly dealt with. Supposing the Government had denied that there was any difficulty in saying what is a Finance Bill, supposing they had said that they considered that the words of Clause 1 were quite sufficient to cover the question, the case would have been different and there would be no obligation upon them; but that is not their position. It seems to me that when a Government are destroying the powers of this House&#x2014;and rightly from their point of view&#x2014;either to amend or reject a Finance Bill, there is some obligation upon them to indicate a proper course by which the question of what is a Finance Bill can be decided. I assure your Lordships that I have not risen to make these observations in the least from the point of view of creating difficulties, but I submit that His Majesty's Government will not be justified, after the speeches we heard from the Lord Chancellor, the

Secretary of State for War, and Viscount Morley last night, in saying, "We leave it entirely to you." This House is entitled, it seems to me, where a paper Constitution is being made, to ask the Government to deal constitutionally with the difficulties which exist.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01960"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I need hardly say that I have listened with the greatest respect to the temperate appeal made by my noble and learned friend. Let us see how the thing stands. In former times, indeed up to the epoch which is not to be mentioned, the relations between the two Houses on the subject of finance depended upon usage and custom. It may be variously interpreted in some particulars, but it was settled by custom, usage, and convention which admitted of a considerable degree of adaptability and elasticity. Of the interpreter in law I say nothing, but in fact the practical interpreter was the Speaker of the House of Commons. That was a sort of code of unwritten law, a sort of common law of Parliament, which was capable of being adjusted and adapted to each particular case as it arose. The consequence was that when you wanted to know what was a Money Bill and what was not you had in the Speaker, interpreting the traditions of the House of Commons and having regard to the difficulties constantly arising, some one who told you what was right, and it was accepted practically by the House and by everybody else. That is all gone, never mind why, and it has become impossible for the future. That is the theory upon which the Bill rests, and if you accept this Clause at all it must be surely upon the terms that the old unwritten law, infinitely better than any written law if only it was worked according to custom and usage, must go. It is very sad, and I am very sorry for it, but it must go.<lb/>
It now becomes necessary, as my noble and learned friend truly says, to find some new method of discriminating. You must have somebody to decide, and you must have some rule if you can get one. As to the person to decide, we have already had an unfortunate encounter with noble Lords on the other side of the House in which we have been defeated; but as to the rule by which he is to decide, how are you to put down in writing the difference between a Money Bill and a Bill which is not a Money Bill? My noble and learned friend says, with perfect truth, that the Government in
<col>1174</col>
proposing a Bill changing the Constitution are bound to do their best to make clear what they mean. We have tried in this Bill to make it as clear as it can be made. You may not agree with us. The noble Earl has proposed an alternative and has succeeded for a time in getting it into the Bill. He is not himself, as he has told us, completely satisfied. It is no fault of his. Has anybody a suggestion to make for making it clearer and defining it? Our duty is to do our best to make the Bill good, as we have done, but we declare we cannot do better and that it is impossible to get a definition. Is it, therefore, reasonable to reproach us for not doing what we are unable to do?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01961"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: I had no intention of reproaching anybody.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01962"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Quite so; but we have been reproached by other noble Lords, who have accused us of evading the question. We have tried, and I ask&#x2014;Can you do better? Hitherto nobody has succeeded in finding a satisfactory definition. There is none whatever on the Paper. Is it not for the reason that you cannot attain to generalisations which are accurate on a subject of this kind? You have to say what is the difference between a Money Bill and a Bill which is not a Money Bill, and you cannot get nearer to it than by trying to preserve as much as you can the old traditions by which, in a rough way, it was settled, and by leaving the old interpreter of those traditions to come to the best conclusion he can. I have said this in answer to the noble and learned Lord, but I know the House has determined otherwise and has put in its own definition&#x2014;a definition, not of the class of Bill but of the governing purpose which is at the bottom of the Bill, which I am afraid will not do.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01963"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this subject is so important that I hope I shall be pardoned if I refer to one point with regard to which we on this side of the House do not desire to be left under the imputation thrown upon us in the course of this discussion. In the past, if the Speaker gave a decision with which your Lordships did not agree, we had it in our power to reject the Bill. But that remedy is to be taken away. The noble and learned Lord forgets the remarks of his colleagues in the House of Commons advocating the extension
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0592"/>
<col>1175</col>
of the power of the House of Commons in the matter of Money Bills. I think we have reason to complain of the attitude of the Government on both the main Amendments put into the Bill. The noble Viscount who leads the House said that he would never accept the Joint Committee proposed by Lord Cromer. The noble Lord who followed him spoke in a reasonable spirit and showed an open mind as to the substitution of some tribunal for the Speaker. The noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War followed again with remarks which led back to the Speaker as if that were the only tribunal. We could not fail to see that there is, if not a difference of opinion, at least a very strong feeling of uneasiness, on that Bench as to the reply to that Amendment, and I venture to say the same with regard to the Amendment which has been so admirably dealt with by the Lord Chief Justice. You have made the difficulty by insisting upon a written law. You have forced upon us the definition in terms as to what should fall under this clause. The Prime Minister admitted, in the amplest and most generous manner, the necessity of having some governing principle. We have put down the best words we could, and what assistance have we had from the other side of the House? We have had criticisms but no assistance. I wish to make this point quite clear. If, as is alleged by the Secretary of State for War, the words of Lord Cromer's Amendment do add greatly to the power of this House&#x2014;if it be true that we could in the future amend some Bills which we cannot amend now, then we would gladly accept words limiting our powers to the powers which we now possess. If Clause I leaves the House incomplete it is not due to any want of effort on our part, but to the lack of assistance from that channel which of all others ought to have been the chief conduit pipe.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Earl said: My Lords, I hope that the Amendment standing in my name will be accepted by His Majesty's Government, and I venture to think that if they consider the underlying principle proposed they will see that the Amendment takes away none of the privileges which are sought by this Bill for the House of Commons. The Amendment I consider to be a reasonable one. In fact, I go further and say that I think that when this Bill was
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0593"/>
<col>1177</col>
framed the purpose now sought to be secured was omitted from the provisions of this clause more by the accident of drafting than by the intention of His Majesty's Government. The purpose of my Amendment is to exclude entirely from the operation of this clause Bills introduced into the House of Commons by private Members.<lb/>
Under this clause any Bill might be introduced into the House of Commons by a private Member and passed by a series of accidents by combined groups giving a total majority in the House of Commons, and your Lordships' House, or any other Second Chamber which may exist in its place, would be unable to deal with a matter which had probably never been explained in the country or even fully debated in the House of Commons. In putting forward this proposal I think that some weight must be given to the consideration that private Bills do not receive in the House of Commons or in the country the attention given to Bills promoted by a Minister of the Crown. For instance, there are many private Members' Bills which your Lordships hear about because you are on the spot, and with which those who take a particular interest in the matter are conversant, but by far the greater proportion of those who have votes in this country and very many of those who take an ordinary interest in the debates in Parliament know nothing of the principles contained in private Members' Bills which from time to time are brought up.<lb/>
I know perfectly well what will be said in opposition to this Amendment. It will be said that private Members' Bills are subject to the very closest criticism in the House of Commons or in your Lordships' House, that they have to go to Committees and through various stages which prevent the possibility of a hurried passage through Parliament. But I do not think any question of precedents, either in this or the other House, can in these days be followed as to what may happen in the future. Another argument in favour of this Amendment is that in the course of the debate last evening I noticed in the speeches of some noble Lords opposite a want of confidence in the ordinary Members of the House of Commons, and there seemed to be some doubt whether it would be possible to find even seven true and just men who would be able to give an impartial decision on any matter referred to them.<lb/>
<col>1178</col>
Under this clause as it is at present, there might be introduced into the House of Commons Bills of a mischievous and dangerous character, the purport of which might not be fully understood. We know that these Bills generally take the form of private trading, and I can imagine the case of a Bill dealing with municipal questions having for its object a further advance in municipal trading. That Bill, by some arrangement between the various groups which compose the majority in that House&#x2014;I am not referring to the present House of Commons, but any House of Commons in the future&#x2014;might easily pass through the various stages. As I say, I feel sure that it must have been entirely foreign to the intention of the Government and not germane to the provisions of this Bill that a measure proposed and introduced by private Members should have the advantages of the provisions in the Bill now before this House. Private Members' Bills are not discussed in the country; the electors know nothing about them. Some of the most pernicious measures are those which have become law without having been adequately explained either in the country or in the House of Commons.<lb/>
I will give another instance of what might happen. You might have a Bill introduced by a private Member into the House of Commons. That Bill might be discussed&#x2014;I will even go so far as to admit that it might be fully discussed on Second Reading&#x2014;it might be passed through all its stages, and then it might be taken up and adopted by some member of the Government on the Front Bench, and in the second and third sessions provided for in this clause that Bill might be fathered by some Minister of the Crown and ultimately become law. Is it a reasonable state of things that any Bill which is not introduced by a Minister of the Crown, which has not been fully explained to the country, should come under the advantages which this clause confers on Bills brought in by the Government?<lb/>
Then there is a further point. Bills introduced into the House of Commons under this clause by private Members would not have even that shadowy and somewhat indefinite authority commonly known as the mandate. I am not going into hostile criticism or discussion on any of the measures of the Government, but I say this generally, that a Bill of the most
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0594"/>
<col>1179</col>
iniquitous character which had not been even hinted at in the political programmes might become law under the operation of this Act. I have in mind a Bill which was introduced into the House of Commons by a private Member, and which was subsequently taken up by a Minister of the Crown and is now the law of the country. The private Member who introduced that Bill disappeared from the House of Commons for a short while. He is again a Member, but he was not a Member at the time the Bill was passed. But his Bill was taken up by a Minister of the Crown and is now a part of the law of the country&#x2014;it is known as the Agricultural Holdings Act. Bills are generally founded upon policies or Resolutions, and I confess that I do not see why any Bills which are neither founded on the policies of a Party nor on the Resolutions of a Government in office should receive those advantages which the provisions in this clause would give. After the explanations I have offered I think your Lordships will see that there is a very strong argument in favour of the acceptance of my Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01977"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Before the dinner adjournment we passed the first clause of the Bill. It was disputed that that could be called in any sense an agreed clause. We now approach Clause 2, which I am afraid can in no sense be called an agreed clause. The contention of the noble Earl who has just moved this Amendment is that there is no reason why a private Member's Bill which has been passed three times should not be exempt from Clause 2. The noble Earl referred to the position of the private Member. If I am rightly informed, the noble Earl has not himself sat in the House of Commons. I was there for twenty-five years. For, I think, eighteen of those years I was a private Member, and therefore I am not in the least likely to take an unfavourable view of the virtues and statesmanlike capacities of the private Member. But I do not think that the noble Earl has looked at the practical aspect of his own Amendment. There is really no reason for it. It is not to be supposed that a private Member's Bill which had merit and quality in it would not attract the attention of<lb/>
<i>The Earl of Malmesbury.</i><lb/>
<col>1180</col>
the Government. If a private Member could get in his Bill what I would call momentum and volume enough to get it passed three times in three successive sessions, it would be a kind of Bill which I am pretty confident a Minister of the Crown would be sure to take up. And it is rather hard that a Minister of the Crown should be precluded from taking up such a Bill because it had been introduced in the first place by a private Member. I really think there is no kind of reason or justification for this Amendment from a practical point of view. It might be convenient for the Government to take up in a second or third session a Bill that had been brought in by a private Member. That, I think, is a decisive answer which ought to weigh with your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01978"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Lord Malmesbury prefaced his remarks by saving that he thought this was a reasonable Amendment. I think it is more than that. It is absolutely necessary in the interests of the ratepayers of this country. The noble Viscount the Leader of the House, if I may say so respectfully, misses the point of the noble Earl's argument in saying that a Bill of a private Member which had sufficient volume in it to attract the attention of the Government would undoubtedly be taken up by the Government. That is not the point. The point is whether such a Bill would receive an adequate amount of discussion in the House of Commons to attract the attention of the outside public. A Bill introduced by a private Member does not receive that amount of discussion. It goes to the Standing Committee, and there is no doubt that practically no discussion at all takes place in Committee of the Whole House. Under this Bill there would be no reason why a Bill introduced by a private Member and taken up by the Government should receive any discussion in the House of Commons, or why it should have been even mentioned to the electors of the country. That is the point which my noble friend Lord Malmesbury wanted to make. The Government, as the noble Viscount opposite has just said, would take up the Bill, as they did in the case of the Land Tenure Bill which was referred to by the noble Earl, or, to cite another instance, I might mention the Town Tenants Bill of 1906. They would take up the Bill, and they could pass it into law under the despotic powers
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0595"/>
<col>1181</col>
which they are attempting to take to themselves without any discussion in the House of Commons. It might be a pet project of perhaps only a few members of the House of Commons, and they would have neither the authority nor the opportunity of placing it before any large section of the electorate.<lb/>
But the point I really want to make is in regard to the ratepayers of this country. As your Lordships are aware, a Bill which throws extra taxation on the Imperial taxpayer can only be introduced into the House of Commons by a responsible Minister. There are certain safeguards as regards the Imperial taxpayer, but they do not extend to the ratepayers. The pocket of the ratepayer can be picked by anybody. It is open to any private Member to introduce a Bill the result of which would be to throw a very heavy burden on the ratepayers. It is neither reasonable nor just that such a Bill should be passed without even receiving that very small amount of discussion which, under the present Government, is accorded to a Government Bill; and I sincerely trust that His Majesty's Government will receive this Amendment in a more reasonable spirit than they have displayed to other Amendments emanating from this side of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01979"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: There seems to be a flaw in the argument of the noble Viscount who leads the House. The only reason given by the noble Viscount against this Amendment was that it would be hard that a Minister of the Crown should not be able to take up a private Member's Bill if the Government thought it desirable to do so. But I do not think that is the effect of this Amendment. I cannot see that a Minister of the Crown would be prevented from taking up such a Bill in the succeeding session. Surely it is part of the immemorial custom of Parliament that if a Bill is not passed at the end of one session it is dead, and has to be brought to life again in a succeeding session. Therefore supposing a Bill is introduced by a private Member and the Government thought it well to adopt that Bill, if it was not passed in the first session they could take it up in the succeeding sessions without let or hindrance. I have answered the only reason which the noble Viscount has given against this Amendment, and I think we may fairly ask that some more
<col>1182</col>
important objection should be put forward if we are to desist from pressing it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01980"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I do not think the noble Lord who has just spoken has put an accurate interpretation upon the effect of the Amendment. If the Amendment were inserted in the Bill the clause would read&#x2014;
<quote>"If any Public Bill, introduced by a Minister of the Crown and not being a Money Bill, is passed by the House of Commons in three successive sessions," etc.</quote>
I do not think that this Amendment would have, as a matter of fact, any considerable, or indeed any appreciable, operation, because the likelihood of a private Member bringing forward a Bill and succeeding in passing it through the House of Commons in three successive sessions would be a very rare occurrence. This Amendment would establish a difference between the position of the private Member on the one hand and the position of a Minister of the Crown on the other. I was in the House of Commons a long time, and I was only in office for a year and a-half out of the twenty-six years, and my sympathies are therefore very strong on behalf of the private Member. I do not think you ought to put upon him any further disabilities than he is subjected to at the present time. It would be rather invidious to put statutory disabilities upon the private Member, and give statutory preference in favour of a Minister. I do not think it is really worth while inserting an Amendment with the object of effecting a purpose of that kind, which would be resented and would have very small operation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01981"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: I quite agree with the noble and learned Lord that the class of case referred to is a limited one. I do not think that the Bill would be largely improved if this Amendment were carried, but I would suggest to the noble and learned Lord that there is a real argument in favour of my noble friend's Amendment. I would suggest that noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite before coming to the House should read more carefully the speeches of the Prime Minister. I have several of the Prime Minister's speeches very clearly in my mind. I remember one in which he was arguing against the possibility of the House of Commons abusing the power which would be entrusted to it if this Bill became
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0596"/>
<col>1183</col>
law. The Prime Minister, as I understand, based his whole argument for the powers to be given to the House of Commons on the fact that the House would come fresh from the electorate with a mandate which it would not abuse. All the measures which would pass through the House of Commons three times in two years would, he said, be measures for which a mandate had been delivered to the House by the electors. Now, the mandate theory is not consistent with the liberty of the private Member to pass his Bill through the House of Commons in three years. Though I admit that the class of Bills referred to is not large, yet I think my noble friend is amply justified in moving his Amendment, because as the clause stands the effect would be that the Government would have the opportunity&#x2014;on rare occasions, I admit, but still on occasions&#x2014;for an enlargement of the doctrine as laid down by the Prime Minister himself. Personally I should not advise my noble friend to press the Amendment to a Division against the opinion of the Government, but I think he has done real service in drawing attention to the fact that under the clause as it stands a Bill which had never been mentioned in a single address to the electors and for which there was no kind of mandate could be adopted by the Government and carried into law.</membercontribution></p>

Speaking as a private member of this House I have, of course, every sympathy with private members of the House of Commons, but the difference between a Bill introduced by a Minister of the Crown and a private Member's Bill is this that the former is supposed to have been explained at the polls whilst the latter may never have been heard of before.</membercontribution></p>

The Amendment would have the effect of keeping out any amending Bill to lessen the suspensors period of two years. I am one of those who believe, if this period of two years delay is really a genuine piece of policy and is put forward in good faith by His Majesty's Government, that in many instances such delay may be of inestimable advantage, and may turn out for the future good government and peaceful welfare of the country. If, on the other hand, this period of delay is merely a piece of window dressing in order to secure the votes of a certain number of timid Radicals and is on the very first breath of opposition to be swept away, then I say that it is perfectly impossible for anybody to show that the Bill is anything other than an attempt to set up single-Chamber government in this country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01987">The Prime Minister has spoken very strongly on this subject. On the First Reading of the Bill in the House of Commons he said that he saw dangers in the provisions of this Bill unless safeguards were inserted, and he added&#x2014;
<quote>"Any House might outstay its mandate and pass imperfect measures. These are dangers to guard against, and we have guarded against them."</quote>
The safeguard against a Government passing bad and imperfect measures and outstaying its mandate is this two years' delay on ordinary Bills and quinquennial Parliaments. I hold that if these safeguards are not properly maintained we shall certainly live in the course of a very few years under single-Chamber government. We have advanced very far towards a written Constitution by Clause 1. The Government appear to have written a Constitution as regards Money Bills, and it seems to me that unless we have some pledge from the great Liberal Party that they intend to stand by the period of two years' delay, this Bill will be fraught with the gravest dangers. Some people think that this delay is not of very great importance, but, having taken a small part
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0597"/>
<col>1185</col>
in recent elections, I am certain that there are a large number of moderate men in the country holding Radical and Liberal principles who would be sorry to see the government of the country in the hands of a Single Chamber, subject to logrolling and to the exercise of the old familiar phrase, "You scratch my back and I will scratch yours," which unfortunately takes place among different groups in another place.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01988">A large number of moderate minded men who voted Liberal at the last two elections were under the firm belief that the Government would hold to this period of two years' delay and see that it was not altered. I have quoted the Prime Minister to show that he himself acknowledges that unless safeguards are put into the Bill you might have hasty and bad legislation. I will come nearer home. I will quote the noble and learned Viscount the Secretary of State for War. Addressing Liberal enthusiasts at the Eighty Club, last year I think&#x2014;I hope I am not misinterpreting him&#x2014;he declared himself in favour of an elected Second Chamber, but he added&#x2014;
<quote>"I myself am for a Second Chamber. I believe in a Second Chamber to be a drag on Conservative just us on Liberal legislation."</quote>
The noble Viscount is a whole-hogger. He requires a Second Chamber which is to be a real Second Chamber, which will delay ill-considered and hasty legislation and give the House of Commons and the people time to consider a measure. Therefore I sincerely hope that he will support this Amendment. The noble Viscount does not approve of the present composition of your Lordships House. It is clear from the speech I have quoted that he would like to see an elected Second Chamber, but the Preamble of this Bill&#x2014;the promise of a reformed House of Lords or an elected Second Chamber&#x2014;appears to be a very long way off indeed so long as the present Government remain in office.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01989">I believe&#x2014;and I think the feeling is shared by a large number of people&#x2014;that on the very first occasion when your Lordships' House attempts to stand in the way of the House of Commons there will instantly be a demand, among the advanced section of the Government's supporters there, to sweep away the little bit of flimsy power which this Chamber will possess. I do not profess to have the experience or knowledge of Parliamentary customs
<col>1186</col>
which noble Lords sitting on the Government Bench possess, but I do not see that it would involve any very great difficulty on the part of the Government of the day to alter the period of two years into one. In the course of perhaps one week such a Bill could be passed through the House of Commons at the beginning of a Parliament, and, although your Lordships might throw it out, in the space of two years that Bill would become law, and then for the remaining three years the Government of the day would have an absolutely free hand, and as far as your Lordships are concerned you might just as well join the Upper Tooting Debating Society as come down here and speak in this House. This two years' delay is the one power of stopping and delaying legislation which is to be left to this House. On the declaration of His Majesty's Ministers themselves it is a power which certainly is a safeguard against ill-considered and hasty legislation, and it is one which the Government ought to embody in a permanent form so that it cannot be swept away.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01990">Under the present rules of procedure in the House of Commons we are certain, unless there is a Second Chamber which has some constitutional power of imposing this delay, to have imperfect legislation which will bring very great evils in its train. Owing to the severe way in which closure by compartments is used in the House of Commons the Government of the day need never give any heed to a minority, no matter how strong it may be. They may divide night after night 300 on one side, and 290 on the other. That minority may represent the majority of the electors, yet the Cabinet of the day is all-powerful. They could force a Bill through, and without this two years' delay we would certainly have legislation which would be bitterly regretted. One of the great arguments used by Liberal speakers in debating this Bill throughout the country was that we are a peaceful and law-abiding people. That, I believe, is chiefly owing to the form of Government and the Constitution under which we live. But if any great question exciting political feeling in the country arises and pressure is put on the Government to abolish the two years delay, this country might not then be able to live under the present peaceful and orderly system. It might lead to revolution and trouble in this land. Recognising that the principles which we&#x2014;the Opposition&#x2014;put
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0598"/>
<col>1187</col>
before the constituencies at the last election have not found favour in the country&#x2014;I am perfectly willing to admit that we were beaten and to take the defeat&#x2014;I ask the Government to put the policy which they laid before the country at the last election into an Act of Parliament that shall be permanent and not capable of being altered by the first breath of popular opinion running the other way. There is, to my mind, absolutely no difficulty in making this two years' suspensory period permanent. I beg to move the Amendment standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01991">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>Page 2, line 19, leave out ("other than a Money Bill") and insert ("not being either a Money Bill or a Bill extending or modifying the provisions of this Act").&#x2014;<i>(The Earl of Ancaster.)</i></quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01992"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I am sure we have all listened to the speech of the noble Earl with the interest which the frank and strong utterance of a convinced opponent of the Bill commands. This is a very important Amendment. It is the first of a large category of Amendments which deal with exemptions. It is not in itself inconsistent with the proposal of the Government in the Bill if the Parliament Bill is regarded as a compact between the two Houses. From that point of view the noble Earl is no doubt justified in asking your Lordships to insert an Amendment which would make this a stable and lasting instrument of Government. That I do not for a moment deny. Whether that is or is not the right point of view as to its being a compact between the two Houses is a question which would need very much more elaboration than we need give to it under the present Amendment. Having made that admission to the noble Earl and recognising to the full the candour and sincerity of all that he has said since we embarked upon this controversy&#x2014;and never was he more candid or sincere than he has been to-night&#x2014;yet I will say at once that I see enormous difficulty in the way of accepting the Amendment. The difficulty is that it is a very one-sided Amendment. When the Party of noble Lords opposite come into power they can vary this compact without any delay or difficulty. With an adequate and sufficient majority in the other House&#x2014;on the assumption that this House, however modified later, represents Conservative prepossessions&#x2014;you may bring in a proposal altering this great instrument as<lb/>
<i>The Earl of Ancaster.</i><lb/>
<col>1188</col>
much as you please. Instead of saying a Bill should pass after being sent up three sessions in two years, you could make it five sessions and four years. You may alter the instrument to any extent; you could even repeal the whole of it. And those wildcat persons whom the noble Earl apprehended would begin operations might bring in an amending Bill to the effect that "three sessions and two years" should be altered to "two sessions and one year." But that Bill could not be forced through this House. [A noble LORD: Why not?] That Bill could not be forced through if the noble Earl's Amendment were accepted.<lb/>
Let me point to another thing. When the time comes for considering the reconstitution of your Lordships' House, it might be that some points would arise in which the terms of the Parliament Act might be touched, and it would be very inexpedient if the Government in the other House were unable to deal as fully and freely as they might wish with a measure for altering the constitution of this House because of some particular detail which it might be thought necessary to modify in the Parliament Bill. My noble friend Lord Avebury, in his Amendment which will come on shortly, would preclude from the operation of the second clause of this Bill any proposal affecting the duration of Parliament. The principle is the same as that of the noble Earl. When the time comes for my noble friend to move his Amendment we shall object to it on the ground which applies equally to the one now before us&#x2014;namely, that it is inexpedient and against the principle and policy of the Government to enlarge the chapter of exemptions. If you persist in that, if you go far in that course, we believe you will render nugatory the whole purpose of the Bill, which your Lordships by assenting to the Second Reading without a Division have more or less accepted. That is the issue which will be much more conveniently and largely raised in connection with the noble Marquess's Amendment which will come on shortly. The noble Marquess has introduced a series of exemptions of the utmost magnitude and moment. The general principle of the exemptions we can consider in relation to those Amendments; but this particular Amendment, though not absolutely inconsistent with the proposals of the Bill or even with the policy embodied or represented, is one to which&#x2014;

<p id="S5LV0008P0-01993"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount the Leader of the House has described the Amendment of my noble friend Lord Ancaster as not inconsistent with the Bill or the spirit of the Bill, but it has met with the fate which has attended previous Amendments. Personally I dislike this Bill as much as anybody, and I cannot help saying that if it becomes law it will inevitably be followed before long by something even more obnoxious, more especially after what was said by representatives of the Government with regard to the Amendment moved a short time ago by my noble friend Lord Malmesbury. I have risen for the purpose of making a suggestion, or rather to address this inquiry to a responsible member of the Government. If a Bill still further limiting the powers of this House is introduced, will they give any sort of undertaking that a Bill of that kind will not be allowed to pass before a General Election has taken place? There is an Amendment further down on the Paper in the name of Lord Willoughby de Broke which covers this point to a certain extent. I really have not the least idea what the opinions of noble Lords may be on the subject, but, speaking for myself, I cannot help feeling that some assurance of this nature would mitigate to a considerable extent the obnoxious character of this Bill. If the inquiry which I have addressed to the Government could be answered in a favourable sense, it would go some way towards removing the alarm with which we view the present measure, and although we cannot in any sense of the word regard it as acceptable, this assurance would at all events modify my opposition to a certain extent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01994"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount opposite rather forgot the fact that it is not majorities in this House, but, if this Bill is passed, it is majorities in another place that will be able to alter this Bill, to modify or further reduce the powers of your Lordships' House. If this Bill is passed this session, let me put this question to the noble Viscount, Lord Morley. Will he give a pledge that during the present Parliament, at least, no measure will be proposed further reducing the powers of your Lordships' House? I do not think we have fully realised the effect of this Bill if passed.
<col>1190</col>
It is quite true that it curtails very considerably the powers of this House, but at the same time we retain considerable powers of criticism and obstruction. In former times there has been a system or custom regarding these matters which an unwritten Constitution has necessitated between the two Houses, but after this Bill is passed I do not think there can be any reasonable complaint if your Lordships use the powers left to you to the fullest extent. There may therefore be a great deal more criticism and opposition during those two years' delay than previously. That will create&#x2014;it must treate&#x2014;considerable irritation on the part of what we may call the impatient members of the House of Commons, and I am certain that when your Lordships attempt to exercise to any extent those limited powers, an outcry will be raised for a further reduction of your Lordships' powers. It must be remembered that these two years for criticism are considered by many of our opponents as two years for obstruction. In the meantime we shall be entirely under the dictation of the Government, and the only way in which we can influence the Government, and in which we can justify our position in the country, is by claiming an appeal to the people. In the circumstances, whether you choose to call this a compact or not&#x2014;it is not a compact&#x2014;I hope in the interests of justice that this Bill will not be used to further reduce the already crippled powers of this House. The Amendment of the noble Earl is extremely reasonable, and unless a more satisfactory reply is forthcoming from His Majesty's Government I hope it will be pressed to a Division.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01995"><member>THE EARL OF ANCASTER</member><membercontribution>: I think it will save time if I say at once that I do not intend to press this Amendment to a Division. Whenever we have said that the Government wished to set up single-Chamber government in this country it has been alleged that we were not telling the truth. But the action of the Government and the admission of the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, have shown that it is possible for a Bill to be brought in reducing the two years' delay to one, and the period of three sessions to two, so that what we said at the last election about single-Chamber government is perfectly true. I ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1191</col>
Amendment I desire to say one word on the subject, which is one of great importance. The House will, in the first place, not have failed to note that His Majesty' Government have declined to give even the very moderate assurance asked for by the noble Lords who spoke from the Back Benches just now. One noble Lord asked for some kind of assurance that no alteration would be made in this part of the Bill until after a General Election had been held&#x2014;I mean, no alteration in the clause which we are now discussing. And the noble Earl, Lord Portsmouth, asked for a somewhat similar assurance that there should be no further reduction of the very modest powers which this Bill leaves to the House of Lords. That challenge made by my noble friends behind me has received no response whatever, and I hope that some words at any rate may be vouchsafed from the Front Bench opposite upon it. The noble Viscount the Leader of the House suggested, only to dismiss the idea, that this Bill might conceivably form the subject of what I think he called a compact between the two Houses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01997"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I beg pardon. Let me be correct on that. I said that from the point of view that this Bill was a compact between the two Houses, the Amendment proposed by the noble Earl would be intelligible and defensible. I did not, however, say that that was my point of view.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01998"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Exactly; but the noble Viscount threw out the idea that there might be some people who would be disposed to regard this Bill as the subject of a compact between the two Houses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-01999"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: As being a compact.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02000"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: As being a compact. The noble Viscount can put it in his own language. I venture to say that there is no one on this side of the House into whose head it has entered that there should be a compact between the two Houses upon anything like the lines of this measure. That a measure so grossly unfair between the two Houses of Parliament should be regarded as what the noble Viscount described as a "stable and lasting instrument of government" seems to me absolutely inconceivable. We regard<lb/>
<i>The Marquess of Lansdowne.</i><lb/>
<col>1192</col>
it as anything but a measure affording the materials for a lasting and stable settlement between the two Parties. We regard this Bill, and we shall so regard it throughout these discussions, as a Bill of temporary application only&#x2014;a Bill intended to bridge over a transitional state of things which must perforce exist during the interval between the passing of this measure, if it becomes law, and the time when His Majesty's Government carry out their pledge to give the country a reconstituted Second Chamber. Is it unreasonable of the noble Earl who moved this Amendment, or any one else, to ask that during that period of transition some subjects should be excluded from the drastic operation of this clause? My noble friend who moved this Amendment has selected one subject, and I think there is a great deal to be said for his suggestion that that subject should be specially dealt with. It is intolerable that during that period of transition, which, according to the views of noble Lords opposite, must be a not very prolonged one, the terms of this clause should be revised in such a way as to deprive the House of Lords even of those opportunities of discussion which are left to it under the Bill. But I am glad to think that my noble friend will not carry his Amendment to a Division, and for this reason. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, pointed out that this question of exemptions&#x2014;to my mind much the most serious question which we have to discuss&#x2014;will be dealt with under an Amendment which I shall move further on in the Bill. That being so, I rather deprecate dealing with it in a piecemeal fashion, and I much prefer to reserve what I have to say on the question of exemptions until we come to the Amendment which stands in my name. Meanwhile I am bound to say that I think the proposal of the noble Earl, Lord Ancaster, is one of substance, and that the speech which he made is eminently deserving of the attention of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02001"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: Before the House permits the noble Earl to withdraw his Amendment, I would like to draw attention to what seems to me, although I may be wrong, a most important admission on the part of the noble Viscount, Lord Morley. He said that this Amendment would be unfair, because while the Radical Party would not be able to alter the Parliament Bill if they so desired, "you," he said, meaning the Unionist Party, "when you
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0601"/>
<col>1193</col>
come into power will be able to alter or repeal it." That means that the noble Viscount contemplates that when the Unionist Party returns to power it will still have an overwhelming majority in this House. In other words, it means that he does not contemplate any reform of the constitution of this House. If that is so, what becomes of the Preamble of the Bill and the pledges of the Government embodied in that Preamble? It seems to me he has admitted in effect that the Government have no intention whatever of carrying out the pledge contained in the Preamble.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02002"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: I made just now what I think was an extremely moderate, if not servile, appeal to the Government opposite. I think I am entitled to an answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02003"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: May I for a moment endorse the most reasonable request of my two noble friends? The Amendment has been withdrawn, or at any rate the noble Earl who moved it has said that he proposes to ask leave to withdraw it, and therefore I will not discuss it. But my noble friend having made his speech, two noble Lords lose on this side of the House&#x2014;Lord Newton and Lord Portsmouth&#x2014;and addressed to His Majesty's Government a question most moderate and most reasonable in itself, and surely they are entitled to a reply. This Amendment is not to be pressed, and therefore we are left in complete doubt as to what are the intentions of the Government in the period of interregnum if the Bill is passed. It is pointed out that there exists a body of opinion in the House of Commons already dissatisfied with the proposals in this Bill; that if that be their attitude, it is likely to be aggravated by what may conceivably be the attitude of this House under the powers given to it. It is pointed out by the noble Earl, Lord Portsmouth, that this House is given powers of delay, which, if used in the spirit in which I am bound to say they are likely to be used, probably provoked by the manner in which we are being treated by the House of Commons, may lead to demands for increasing the stringency of this measure. Is it not reasonable, therefore, for us to ask what are the views and the attitude of the Government in this matter?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02004"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: What is the question?</membercontribution></p>
<col>1194</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02005"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: The I question put by my two noble friends was this: Will the Government give an engagement that during the period of this Parliament no proposals will be introduced by them, or be supported by them, to strengthen the provisions of the Bill we are now discussing in this particular? Surely that is a reasonable question. As I understand, His Majesty's Government claim a mandate for the present Bill. Over and over again the Prime Minister and his colleagues in the House of Commons have argued that this Bill has been before the constituencies and that everything in it has been ratified by popular assent. If there is anything in the argument, clearly the country has assented to the provisions of this Bill only as it stands. But if that be so there can be no mandate for any stiffening of this Bill in this respect. On their own showing, therefore, noble Lords opposite ought to be willing to give us the assurance for which we ask. I therefore respectfully repeat the question put by my two noble friends&#x2014;Will the members of His Majesty's Government give us an assurance that during the duration of the present Parliament they will not themselves introduce or give support to any measure introduced in the House of Commons to strengthen the provisions of the present Bill in these particulars?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02006"><member>LORD ST. DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: I do not think Lord Curzon has quite correctly repeated the question put by Lord Newton. What Lord Newton asked was, Would the Government pledge themselves, if they brought in legislation to further modify the powers of this House, not to pass it into law until there had been a General Election and the opinion of the country had been obtained upon it? The question of Lord Newton had reference not merely to what the Government would do in this Parliament; he asked whether they would give a pledge to take the opinion of the country upon any legislation which they introduced. That might, under certain circumstances, be a very fair appeal. But things of that sort ought to be mutual, and if we are asked that sort of question I think we are entitled to ask noble Lords opposite to pledge themselves, if they come back to power, not to bring in any measure to repeal the Parliament Bill without first having taken the opinion of the country.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0008P0-02007"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend who has just sat down has put a question which I think is not otherwise than very pertinent; but I do not rise to discuss the counter-pledge which he asked for, but to reply to the question which has been addressed from more than one quarter by noble Lords opposite. I think that question is founded upon a misapprehension of the attitude of the Government. This Bill has been brought in after much consideration. It stereotypes and puts into legal form what we conceive to be the proper Constitutional arrangements between the two Houses of Parliament. We may be right or wrong in that, but it is our view. This is not a Bill in regard to which we are likely to embark on any campaign to alter. It has been brought in deliberately, and in the belief that it will prove a remedy for the state of things with which we have to deal. But while it is one thing to say that, it is quite another thing to give a pledge. We must be perfectly free, just as noble Lords opposite remain perfectly free. I can do no more than define, as I have endeavoured to do, what our attitude towards this question is, and the course which, as at present advised, will be the course which we shall pursue. What noble Lords opposite might do to alter the state of things and create a new situation I cannot say, and I do not anticipate anything of the sort as likely to happen. I do not contemplate it, nor can I give any pledge on the part of the Government to hamper our action under any new circumstances which might arise.<lb/>
There is a further difficulty about giving pledges of any sort or kind. Pledges are extremely apt to be misunderstood. This set of rules is intended to apply to this House and to the House of Commons as they are to-day. The Preamble of this Bill has been the subject of an undertaking by the Prime Minister, which is that in the course of this Parliament he proposes to deal with the question of the reconstitution of the Second Chamber. It is obvious that if that happens, questions of great delicacy may arise. It is possible that other measures may be substituted for the measures of to-day. That may be greater or less. This is not the time to enter upon a discussion of them; but the mere fact that that pledge has been given is to my mind a cogent reason for the Government not embarrassing themselves by giving pledges in the abstract which
<col>1196</col>
would certainly be used against them on other occasions hereafter. For these reasons it is impossible to give any such undertaking as has been asked for.<lb/>
But I wish again to say that I do not share the gloomy apprehensions of noble Lords opposite. I do not know of any Party in the House of Commons&#x2014;at any rate, any Party worth talking of in these debates&#x2014;or elsewhere than in the imagination of the noble Earl, which desires to tear up and alter this Constitution. Somebody may have said something about it which I have not had the good fortune either to read or to hear; but I decline to contemplate it as a serious contingency. As to the general question, the noble Viscount Lord Morley, has very clearly expressed the reasons why we are glad that the Amendment is not to be pressed. It is not desirable to try to lay down exceptions to a broad principle. We think that the procedure which this Bill embodies represents in the main what is the true relation between the two Houses of Parliament. It is the general principle, and it is not desirable, therefore, to try and make exceptions to it which would only lead to a breach through which a good deal might flow. The noble Earl, Lord Ancaster, put his case in a most reasonable and sensible fashion, and I hope this debate has brought out enough to dispel from the minds of noble Lords opposite any illusion which there may be that we contemplate anything wild or revolutionary in the way of changes in the machinery of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02008"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount was asked to give an assurance on behalf of the Government, and in reply he said that they did not propose to embark upon any such revolutionary course as had been suggested. That was not the question which was put to him. The question was, Would the Government undertake not to embark on the revolutionary course suggested.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02009"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I refused the undertaking.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02010"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount refused the undertaking. Therefore that means that there is no assurance that the Government will not embark on any course more revolutionary than is proposed. The noble Viscount said he was not aware of any Party in the
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0603"/>
<col>1197</col>
other House worthy of the name who contemplated any steps more revolutionary than those now proposed. I am afraid the noble Viscount does not read the papers very much. He says that he does not propose to embark on any wild revolutionary course, but he also told us that he would not give any undertaking that he would not embark on such a course. I have heard of people who have said, with regard to a particular proposal, that they would like to see the man who would make them toe the line, but I have seen these very same men toeing the line within a week or less after they had said that. That is why we have no confidence in noble Lords opposite, and particularly in those who call themselves the most moderate men. I do not know how they agree when they are in the Cabinet or elsewhere, but all we know about them is that when they vote they vote for the most revolutionary proposals that are made. When the noble Viscount says he declines to give us any undertaking, we know what it means. It means, as I have said, that the House can have no assurance whatsoever that whatever revolutionary proposal may be made the noble Viscount may not be found supporting it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02011"><member>LORD SOUTHWARK</member><membercontribution>: I desire to say, as an old member of the House of Commons, that when the noble Lord opposite asks His Majesty's Government to undertake not to embark on a certain course, it will depend upon the action of this House with regard to measures that come from the House of Commons. If Amendments are made by your Lordships in a spirit of commonsense and fairness, instead of taking the title of a Bill and turning the contents of that Bill upside down; if you will give the House of Commons the benefit of the great ability which members of this House possess from all points of view&#x2014;then I believe such Amendments would be most cordially received and considered by the House of Commons. I hope there will be no necessity for the Government to embark on any such course as has been suggested. After this Bill has passed, the House of Lords will be expected to treat measures from the House of Commons in a different spirit from that in which they treated such measures during the long period I was in the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02012"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I think the last speaker, as the candid friend of the
<col>1198</col>
Government, has practically told us the position in which we are to be placed under the Bill. Our powers are to be curtailed, but if we exercise those limited powers in any independent spirit at all they are to be further curtailed. That is what it really conies to, and that is why we are to have no undertaking. I would call attention to what fell from the noble and learned Viscount, Lord Haldane. If I heard him correctly, he referred to a pledge on the part of the Prime Minister that during the course of this Parliament he would deal with the whole Constitutional question. [VISCOUNT HALDANE nodded assent.] Then is it not eminently reasonable that we should know that in passing this measure the Government at least will not reduce still further, during this temporary period, the powers of the House of Lords? I am sorry that the noble Earl has withdrawn his Amendment. I do not understand his reason for doing so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02013"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have learned a great deal to-night. Up to now, when we have made statements of a certain kind as to the effect of this Bill, they have been invariably denied in general terms on the other side of this House and in the country, as I can vouch from personal experience. I have frequently been very courteously but firmly contradicted by Liberals, who have denied that the effect of this Bill would be what I have said. What have we learned to-night? I hope the country will mark and note this. We have learned that the effect of Clause 1 as drafted is that the whole of the property of any class in this country is at the mercy of a temporary majority in the House of Commons, however small, to do with as it likes in one single session. And as regards the effect of Clause 2, we have had it now admitted by the Front Bench opposite that a majority in the House of Commons, not in the course of one session, but in the course of two years, can abolish the House of Lords altogether.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1199</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02016">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I bring forward my Amendment in that spirit of commonsense and fairness which Lord Southwark has just invited us to show in our proposals. I have no expectation whatever that noble Lords opposite will accept this Amendment, but I do most earnestly beg their attention to it, because we do want an unclosured discussion as to what is the view of His Majesty's Government with regard to what ought to be the powers of a temporary majority in the House of Commons to alter the franchise. Although I bring forward this Amendment, I must not be understood to make myself responsible for the theory that if certain things are exempted&#x2014;redistribution of seats, the franchise, or Home Rule for Ireland, or what you will&#x2014;I shall then be satisfied with the Bill. As Lord Selborne pointed out in his instructive speech, if you begin to reduce the matter to writing, if you put into a category the kind of Bills that the house of Lords may or may not deal with or which are meet or not meet to be referred to the people, you are met with two difficulties, and it seems to me that the united wisdom of both Front Benches has not been able to exceed the united wisdom of our ancestors in these respects. First of all you have to get a body of some kind&#x2014;either the Speaker, or some body, it does not matter for the purpose of my argument&#x2014;that shall say whether particular Bills belong to a particular category, and then having done that you have to find, what we have been trying to discover this afternoon but not with very great success, a set of rules which may guide that body in its deliberations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02017">My desire in bringing forward this Amendment is to focus public attention on the kind of thing that might and probably will happen if noble Lords opposite and their friends get their own way with regard to dealing with the constituencies. I propose, in Clause 2, after the word "Bill" in line 19, to insert the words, "or a Bill which affects the qualification for the exercise of the Parliamentary franchise or the distribution of Parliamentary seats." As the clause stands, if the House of Commons chose to bring forward and carry a measure in three successive sessions they could alter the whole of the constituencies in Great Britain and Ireland; and the general argument against handing over this power</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02018"><i>Lord Willoughby de Broke.</i></p>
<col>1200</col>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02019">to a Single Chamber will at once be obvious. The House of Commons would be able to give the suffrage to any new class of electors they thought proper. They might give adult suffrage; or they might give women the vote&#x2014;a proposal which I dare say some of us would not regard as being fraught with very great danger. They might also, entirely on their own responsibility, deal with the whole question of the redistribution of seats without the people most concerned&#x2014;the electors&#x2014;having a say in the matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02020">We do not speak without precedent as to the powers with which a Parliament untramelled by any Second Chamber has sought in the past to invest itself. There is the instance of the Long Parliament. I speak about the Long Parliament with profound reservation in the presence of the noble Viscount, Lord Morley. During the last few days I have taken the opportunity of taking down "The Life of Cromwell" from the shelves of my small library, and I must say I was disappointed&#x2014;I say this with great respect&#x2014;with the somewhat perfunctory way in which the proceedings of the Long Parliament were dealt with as compared with the excessive interest in the way Cromwell found it necessary to deal with the people in Ireland and Scotland. But there are other authorities with regard to the proceedings of the Long Parliament. The noble Viscount will remember that the Long Parliament established itself in 1649 by in that year abolishing the House of Lords and, on the next day, abolishing the Monarchy. It is legitimate to quote an authority who said&#x2014;
<quote>"There are some reasons for believing that it was intended that this system of recruiting was to be applied to each successive Parliament so that there would never be a General Election again."</quote>
I have no doubt that that is a consummation, which every Party in the State would view with a great deal of satisfaction supposing they happened to be the Party in power at the time. But we well recollect what was the end of that. Cromwell himself had to call in the soldiers and order the Mace to be removed, and the Long Parliament was brought to an end.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02021">If the people of this country are seriously going to be asked to endow a temporary majority in the House of Commons with unlimited powers over the constituencies, you are opening the door to an orgie of gerrymandering of which it is impossible
<image src="S5LV0008P0I0605"/>
<col>1201</col>
to see the finish. I know that the answer will be that no honest, moderate, unoffending Radical Government would dream of such a thing, but I say at once that I have no confidence in noble Lords opposite and their friends in regard to this or any other matter; nor am I at all sure that I should have confidence in my own side. For it is a temptation to the Party in power for the time being, who will naturally consider that their omnipotence is the primary essential for the welfare of the British Empire. It should not be in the power of any Party to make themselves omnipotent or to continue their existence when it is beyond the power of a Second Chamber to step in and say that this law or that law, that this redistribution scheme or that, should not be passed without an appeal to the people.</p>
<p id="S5LV0008P0-02022">We will now come to the year 1884, when the last attempt was made to alter the franchise and redistribute the constituencies. The Conservative Party of the day, under Lord Salisbury and Sir Stafford Northcote, had a considerable hand in that, and on a certain day in December of that year this appeared in the <i>Daily News</i>&#x2014;
<quote>"The Franchise Bill is law and the Re-distribution Bill is as good as law, and this measure is as much a measure of Lord Salisbury and Sir Stafford Northcote as it is of the Radical Party."</quote>
Therefore we have precedent for not embarking on a great Liberal change, such as we know is contemplated by noble Lords opposite and their friends, without its being capable of being fully threshed out, not only in the House of Commons but in the country. But we have something which is more conclusive than that. We have the remarkable professions of the Prime Minister himself. This is rather striking. Mr. Asquith, in the House of Commons on April 10, when talking about this everlasting thing, the "will of the people"&#x2014;though I am never quite sure what is meant by that expression&#x2014;said:
<quote>"I quite agree and acknowledge &#x2026; that there are conceivable and, indeed, actual cases in which the position of the House of Commons does not necessarily and perhaps does not even presumptively express that opinion. You may have a case, a conceivable case, of what is called a scratch majority combined together under the coercion of Party exigencies for particular and transient purposes."</quote>
That is exactly the kind of majority to which we are asked to hand over such a matter as the constituencies of this country
<col>1202</col>
&#x2014;an action in regard to which I shall not in any way make myself responsible. I bring forward this Amendment in order that the people of the country may have an opportunity of hearing the opinion of noble Lords opposite on this matter&#x2014;whether they really think that the power ought to be placed in the hands of a temporary and transient majority in the House of Commons to deal with the constituencies as they will, to effect a redistribution of seats, to take away the vote from one class whom they think may be hostile to them, and generally to gerrymander the constituencies in whatever way they may think convenient to themselves.</p>

The Amendment is open to all the objections that we have to the exemptions on the Paper, and it is certainly open to the objection that you are showing that you do not think the House of Commons should be trusted with measures affecting most intimately its own powers and resources. The noble Lord said he had a small library, and I do not think&#x2014;and this without affectation and modesty&#x2014;that it is altogether well selected. And I am still less certain that from the few volumes that the noble Lord says he possesses he has taken out all the passages that he could find when he honoured two by quoting them&#x2014;he has
