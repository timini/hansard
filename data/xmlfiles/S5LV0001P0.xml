<p>MEM.&#x2014;<i>According to the Usage of Parliament, when the House appoints a Select Committee, the Lords appointed to serve upon it are named in the Order of their Rank, beginning with the Highest; and so, when the House sends a Committee to a Conference with the Commons, the Lord highest in Rank is called, first, and the rest go forth in like Order: Hut when the Whole House is called over for any Purpose within the House, or for the Purpose of proceeding forth to Westminster Hall, or upon any public Solemnity, the Call begins invariably with the Junior Baron.</i>

<title>[OFFICIAL REPORT.]</title>
<section>
<title>THE KING'S SPEECH.</title>
<p>THE KING, being seated on the Throne, and the Commons being at the Bar with their SPEAKER, His Majesty was pleased to make a most gracious Speech to both Houses of Parliament, and then retired.</p>
<p>His Majesty's Speech was as follows:&#x2014;</p>
<p>"My Lords, and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>"I was much impressed and gratified by the warmth of the public reception given to the Queen and Myself during Our recent visit to the German Emperor and Empress at Berlin by all classes of the community. It afforded Us great pleasure to meet Their Majesties again, and I feel confident that the expression of cordial welcome which there greeted Us will tend to strengthen those amicable feelings between the two countries which are essential to their mutual welfare and to the maintenance of peace.</p>
<p>"My relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly.</p>
<col>2</col>
<p>"Satisfactory progress has been made in the negotiation of outstanding questions with the United States of America. A Treaty to regulate the use of the waterways adjacent to the international boundary between Canada and the United States has been arranged. The question being one of special Canadian interest, the advice of the Dominion Government was sought and followed throughout.</p>
<p>"My Ambassador at Washington has also negotiated, with the co-operation of the Canadian and Newfoundland Ministers of Justice, an Agreement for the reference to arbitration of the North American Fisheries question. I trust that the Agreement will be the means of effecting a final and friendly settlement of matters which have been long under discussion between this country and the United States.</p>
<p>"Arbitration Agreements concluded by my Government with those of France, Italy, and Spain, which were on the point of expiring, have been renewed for a further term of five years, and it is proposed to treat similar instruments in the same manner.</p>
<p>"The situation in Persia continues to cause anxiety. My Government have no desire to depart from the principle of non intervention in the internal affairs of that
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0026"/>
<col>3</col>
country. At the same time, they are of opinion that the state of affairs in Persia imperatively demands the introduction of representative institutions in a practical form in order to assure the realisation of indispensible economic, financial, and administrative reforms, and to pacify the country. As the present troubles endanger numerous commercial and economic interests which Great Britain and Russia have in Persia, the two Governments are exchanging views on the subject.</p>
<p>"I am happy to think that there is now an improved prospect of a solution of the difficulties which have arisen in the Balkans. It is my earnest hope that a settlement may be arrived at which will be satisfactory to all the States whose interests are concerned.</p>
<p>"The news of the disastrous earthquake which occurred recently in Sicily and Calabria called forth the deepest feelings of compassion for the afflicted population. Assistance was rendered by the officers and men of my Fleet, and the naval and military stores in the Mediterranean were utilised for the relief of the sufferers. I am glad that my people have shown their sympathy with the friendly nation of Italy in this terrible calamity.</p>
<p>"An International Conference, which is now sitting in London, will, I trust, soon reach an agreement on certain questions of maritime law. The conclusions arrived at will be laid before you, that there may be due opportunity of considering them when your assent is asked to such legislation as may be necessary to enable my Government to ratify the International Prize Court Convention.</p>
<p>"The reception of the measures designed by my Government for improving Indian administration has given me deep satisfaction. A Bill will at once be laid before you, dealing with matters in which your sanction is required; and it is my strong desire that the steps to be taken for giving effect to the policy announced in my Message of last November to the Princes and people of India may impartially protect the interests and advance the welfare of all races, classes, and communities in my Indian dominions.</p>
<p>"The work accomplished by the Convention for closer Union, which concluded its sittings at Cape Town in the present
<col>4</col>
month, in framing the plan of a South African Constitution for submission to the constituent Colonies marks the achievement of the first stage in the consolidation of that important part of my Empire.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen of the House of Commons.</p>
<p>"Estimates for the expenditure of the year will in due course be laid before you.</p>
<p>"Owing to various causes, including the new provision which was made last year for old age, and an increase which has become necessary in the cost of my Navy, the expenditure of the year will be considerably in excess of that of the past twelve months. In these circumstances, the provision necessary for the services of the State in the ensuing year will require very serious consideration, and, in consequence, less time than usual will, I fear, be available for the consideration of other legislative measures.</p>
<p>"My Lords, and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>"The Bills dealing with Irish Land, and Housing and Town Planning, to the discussion of which time and labour were given in your last Session, will be re-introduced.</p>
<p>"A Bill will be laid before you for the Disestablishment and Disendowment of the Church in Wales.</p>
<p>"I have now received the Report of the Commission, which I appointed more than three years ago, to inquire into the working of the Poor Law, and into the provision for meeting distress arising from want of employment. The recommendations of the Commission are engaging the careful attention of my Government.</p>
<p>A measure will be proposed for the better organisation of the labour market through a system of co-ordinated labour exchanges, with which other schemes for dealing with unemployment may subsequently be associated.</p>
<p>"A Bill will be introduced for the constitution of Trade Boards in certain branches of industry in which the evils known as 'sweating' prevail.</p>
<p>"A measure will be laid before you to alter the law affecting Parliamentary Elections and Registration in London.</p>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0027"/>
<col>5</col>
<p>"In connection with the financial arrangements of the year, proposals will be brought forward for amending the Old Age Pensions Act in certain particulars where, in practice, inequalities of treatment have been found to arise.</p>
<p>"A Bill prohibiting the landing and selling in the United Kingdom of fish caught in prohibited areas of the sea adjoining Scotland will also be introduced.</p>
<p>"Bills will be presented to amend the law in regard to inebriates, to the supply of milk, and to the hours of work in shops.</p>
<p>"Your labours upon these and all other matters I humbly commend to the blessing of Almighty God."</p>
<p>Several Lords&#x2014;Took the Oath.</p>
<p>Sholto Douglas Campbell-Douglas, Lord Blythswood, having succeeded to that title on the death of his brother Archibald Campbell Campbell, Lord Blythswood, by virtue of a special remainder contained in a Patent bearing date the twenty-fourth day of August, in the fifty-sixth year of the reign of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria&#x2014;Was (in the usual manner) introduced.</p>
<p>The Right Honourable Sir John Gorell Barnes, Knight, late President of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice, having been created Baron Gorell of Brampton, in the county of Derby&#x2014;Was (in the usual manner) introduced.</p>

<title>ADDRESS IN REPLY TO HIS MAJESTY'S MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH.</title>
<p><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, in rising to move that an humble Address be presented to His Majesty thanking him for his gracious Speech from the Throne, I know that members of this House, when addressing your Lordships for the first time, have rarely omitted to ask, and have never failed to receive, the indulgence of the House; and I trust that I may experience the same kindly consideration on this occasion. Last year His Majesty alluded in his gracious Speech to the great and universal pleasure which was caused throughout this country by the visit of His Imperial Majesty the German Emperor and his Imperial Consort to our shores. This year His Majesty, in his gracious Speech, makes reference to his own and Queen Alexandra's recent visit to Berlin; and it must have been a matter of much gratification to every individual throughout the British Empire to hear how enthusiastically our gracious Sovereign and his Consort were received by the great German people. This spontaneous display of goodwill and kindliness should dispel some of the evil forebodings of a certain section in both countries, and will, we trust, be the foundation of a lasting friendship which will become more cemented as time goes on.<lb/>
My Lords, I turn to the reference in His Majesty's Speech to foreign affairs. As your Lordships are aware, Turkey has resolved itself into a constitutional Power, and I am sure your Lordships will rejoice that such a radical and beneficent change has been accomplished in such an orderly and peaceful manner. Unfortunately, a
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0028"/>
<col>7</col>
crisis has been brought up in the course of the last day or so, and the first Ministry has been compelled to resign. We can only trust that nothing will arise to disturb the tranquillity and order which have hitherto signalised the Turkish people in their attempts to remodel their government on the best and wisest lines. Perhaps we ourselves may not be a little flattered that one of our ablest and best Naval officers has been selected to reorganise the Turkish navy and bring it up to modern requirements.<lb/>
But although the actual revolution in the form of government has up to now been accomplished with comparatively little friction, there are incidents which are giving great anxiety. Bulgaria, as your Lordships are aware, has declared herself a separate State, independent of the suzerainty of Turkey, and the Ottoman Government will only agree to recognise such independence on condition that an indemnity is paid as compensation for the loss of the railway which runs from Turkey proper through Eastern Roumelia to Bulgaria. His Majesty's Government are working in co-operation with the Government of Russia, and we trust that the negotiations will turn out satisfactorily and that the Government of Bulgaria will be persuaded to acquiesce in the demand of Turkey. There still remains to be dealt with a contentious spot on the North-west frontier of Turkey, and it would appear that a peaceful and satisfactory solution can only be found through the goodwill and forbearance of the Austrian Government. A war would practically mean suicide for Servia, and, possibly, Montenegro; and we can only trust that wiser and saner counsels will overcome the hasty and ill-advised counsels of those who are trying to involve Servia in a war with her mighty neighbour.<lb/>
It is not only in Eastern Europe that events are engrossing the attention and anxiety of our Government. In Persia, unlike in Turkey, the desire of the people for constitutional government has not been realised, and the Government of the Shah appear powerless to cope with the disturbances which are to be heard of everywhere throughout that country. Fighting is no new thing in Persia, and it has unfortunately been going on for some time along the Western frontier. As your Lordships are probably aware, the frontier
<col>8</col>
between Asia Minor and Persia has never been really demarcated, and the result has been that the will Kurdish tribes who inhabit that region have been raiding to their hearts' content and causing endless ill-feeling between Turkey and Persia. His Majesty's Government are fully aware of the gravity of the situation, and they trust that, with the co-operation of Russia, they may be able to arrive at a solution of the difficulty, and that law and order may be restored. At the same time it must be impressed upon those concerned that such a state of things as exists at present cannot be allowed to continue.<lb/>
I pass now, my Lords, from the engrossing topic of foreign affairs to a subject which, as His Majesty says in his gracious Speech, has called forth the heartfelt sympathy of the whole world. I allude to the terrible disaster that has overtaken Italy in the earthquake in Sicily and Calabria. We in England have in many ways given practical evidence of our sympathy with the Italian people in their distress. Our men-of-war were despatched posthaste to the stricken districts, and all that could be done was done by supplying the sufferers with stores and medical assistance; and it is universally known that our sailors, not only of the Navy but also of the merchant service, rendered invaluable assistance, often at extreme peril to their lives.<lb/>
His Majesty's Government are heartily to be congratulated on the satisfactory conclusions of two important negotiations with the United Si ates. An Agreement has been signed for the reference to arbitration at the Hague of the North American fisheries question, which has long been a source of grievance and annoyance, not only to our own subjects, but to those of the United States. It has, indeed, formed ground for dispute since 1818, when the present <i>regime</i> was laid down by Treaty. That Treaty has been interpreted in many and different ways, and on several occasions fishery questions have created positions of great difficulty between His Majesty's Government and the United States. It is to be hoped that the Agreement will secure ratification, and that the decision of the Hague Tribunal on this matter&#x2014;perhaps the most important that has been referred to that Tribunal&#x2014;will remove for ever a source of possible difficulties between His Majesty's Government
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0029"/>
<col>9</col>
and the Government of the United States on this subject.<lb/>
The second important negotiation has to do with the Treaty for the regulation of the boundary waters to ensure for ever the preservation of the beauty of the Niagara Falls, which is seriously threatened on the United States side of the river by the erection of powerful plant under grants of authority from the State of New York, and, on the Canadian side, by licences granted by the Dominion of Canada and the Province of Ontario. This negotiation will, it is to be hoped, also provide satisfactory means of settlement of the innumerable questions which arise out of the diversion and pollution of the waters which form the boundary between His Majesty's Dominions in North America and the United States. It is a matter of satisfaction that His Majesty's Government have acted with the advice and consent of the Newfoundland Government with reference to fisheries question, and of the Canadian Government with regard to the boundary waters question; and I hope I shall not be considered presumptuous when I say that no one deserves greater credit for the carrying through of these negotiations than Mr. Bryce, our Ambassador at Washington.<lb/>
An important step has been taken towards the unification of South Africa. Delegates from Natal, the Cape, the Orange River Colony, and the Transvaal met together in the autumn at Durban, and later at Capetown, and, after exhaustive discussion, agreed upon terms of union. These have been published in the form of a draft Bill, which will be considered later by the Colonial Legislatures. The draft Bill published as the result of the Convention provides, first, for the union of the Colonies, not simply for joining them in a loose federation. Secondly, it provides for the taking over by the Union Government of the debts and liabilities of the Colonies, and the Colonial Governments will become provinces of the Union. Thirdly, the Government will consist of a Governor-General, a Senate, in which some members will be nominated for their special knowledge of native affairs, and an Assembly in which the existing Colonies will be represented in certain proportions. Fourthly, the existing franchises in the various colonies, including the native vote at the Cape, are to be left untouched;
<col>10</col>
nor is the native vote to be altered except by a Bill passed with a two-thirds majority by both Houses sitting together. Fifthly, there is a provision for redistribution of seats later, according to the white male population, the voting being on the principle of proportional representation, with a single transferable vote. Sixthly, the various Colonial Courts will disappear and be merged into a Supreme Court of South Africa. Seventhly, both English and Dutch will be the official languages of the Union. Eighthly, there is a provision for the admission later of other territories. And, finally, special provision is made that if and when native protectorates enter the Union, the natives shall keep their land and the sale of liquor shall be prohibited. I think there will be a universal hope that the labours of this Convention may be successful, and that the integral portions of South Africa may be welded and strengthened, not merely for their own good, but for the general wellbeing of the British Empire.<lb/>
I turn now to that portion of His Majesty's Speech which deals with India. We all have been and are watching the outcome of events in India. As your Lordships are aware, there was and is much to give anxiety; and the Secretary of State and the Viceroy, backed by the great Princes of India, are to be congratulated on the manner in which these difficulties are being faced. A Bill for extending the representative element on the Legislative Councils is ready for the consideration of Parliament, and is to be immediately laid before your Lordships' House. There is a general hope that these changes, together with firmness and tact in executive action, will abate latent discontent, and open a future of peaceful order and progress.<lb/>
One last point before I sit down. His Majesty's gracious Speech touched on the question of finance. There is, unfortunately, little doubt that the Estimates of 1909&#x2013;10 will show a deficit. That deficit will be caused, first, by the increased expenditure contemplated on the Navy&#x2014;for His Majesty's Government intend to uphold the undoubted supremacy of the Navy as laid down in the Prime Minister's speech of November 9 last&#x2014;and, secondly, by the increased expenditure which will be required for old age pensions, both being, in the opinion of His Majesty's Government, not only necessary but vitally
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0030"/>
<col>11</col>
essential to the interests of the country. I conclude by thanking noble Lords on both sides of the House for the patience and consideration extended to me. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>*LORD REMPHILL</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have the honour to second the Address, and I would ask for that indulgence which is invariably given to those who rise to address this House for the first time. I think your Lordships will agree that the foreign and colonial policy of His Majesty's Government has been most successful. But what has crowned their efforts is the great success of their Majesties' visit to Berlin, which has given a great impetus to the friendship between the English nation and the German people. The magnificent demonstration, both official and popular, on their Majesties' departure from the German capital testifies to the happy effects of the visit, and will do more than anything else to cement the friendship between the people of the two countries.<lb/>
There is one measure referred to in His Majesty's gracious Speech which I am sure will be accorded a favourable reception at the bands of all sections in your Lordships' House. I allude to the proposal of the Government to deal with the question of the better housing of the working classes. In London alone 250,000 people are one-room dwellers, and what is true of London is true of other great cities. The need for better housing is illustrated in certain towns by a heavy death rate, excessive infant mortality, and prevalence of tuberculosis. In addition, squalid conditions of living are great incentives to drunkenness. A Bill is also to be laid before Parliament for the disestablishment of the Church in Wales. As an Irish Protestant, I can say that the disestablishment of the Church in Ireland has been attended with the most satisfactory results. The Irish Bishops, elected without any interference from the State, are distinguished for their great learning, and for the able way in which they administer the diocesan business. The same may be said of the clergy, who are elected by their congregations; they are most efficient, and their monetary affairs are highly satisfactory.<lb/>
The Report on Poor Law Reform will shortly be laid on the Table of your Lordships' House. Last year a sum of &#x00A3;80,000,000 was spent in the United King-
<col>12</col>
dom in providing maintenance, medical treatment, and education for the poorer classes ; but the overlapping of administration and the duplication of services by all sorts of local governing bodies caused a large portion of this immense sum to be wasted. Thousands of men are wasting away in the workhouses, and tens of thousands of working men rise up in the morning not knowing where to get work to provide food for their children and themselves. A measure is to be proposed for the better organisation of the labour market through a system of co-ordinated labour exchanges, and by the constitution of trade boards. Labour exchanges, in some form or other, are indispensable for the abolition of casual labour. It is not possible for each employer to employ only irregular men. It is possible for all to agree to take their irregular men from a common centre. The business of the central board will then be so to distribute work as to give each man a regular flow of work under several employers and not under one.<lb/>
The proposed London Electoral Bill will make London one Parliamentary borough instead of twenty-eight boroughs, as at present. One hundred and sixty thousand voters are disfranchised in London owing to the anomaly of not being able to enjoy the right of successive occupation, which is enjoyed in Manchester, Birmingham, and the other great cities throughout the United Kingdom. A Bill is to be introduced to prevent the landing and sale in the United Kingdom of fish caught by foreign trawlers in prohibited areas of the sea adjoining Scotland. There is also a reference in His Majesty's Speech to the Irish Land Bill, which will be a message of hope to the expectant hearts of the Irish people. His Majesty is keenly interested in the welfare of his Irish subjects&#x2014;a fact which has caused him to be most popular in Ireland, and which the Irish people recognise by according him a most enthusiastic welcome when he visits Ireland. It is regrettable that, at a moment when this important Bill is being introduced, certain politicians and newspapers should paint Ireland in lurid colours, and describe it as being in a state of great disorder and unrest.<lb/>
In truth, my Lords, lawlessness in Ireland is grossly exaggerated. In twenty-four counties out of the thirty-two there is no agrarian crime, and the official returns
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0031"/>
<col>13</col>
for last year show a marked decrease in agrarian crime as compared with the previous year. The only remedy for this unrest, which is confined to seven or eight counties in the West of Ireland, is to plant the tenants on the land. There has been great and regrettable delay in carrying out the provisions of the Land Purchase Act, owing not to the fault of the Irish Land Commission, but to the fact that the staff of inspectors and examiners is wholly inadequate to deal with the &#x00A3;56,000,000 worth of agreements lodged in the office of the Irish Land Commission. This delay is most injurious, both to the landlord and to the tenant. They tenant has to pay interest at the rate of from 3&#x00BD; to 4 per cent. instead of paying 3&#x00BC; per cent., the amount of the purchase annuity; and the landlord has to pay all charges on the land and lose a considerable portion of his income by the mere fact of having agreed to sell. Your Lordships have on many occasions shown sympathy with the demands of the working-classes in England, notably by passing the Trades Disputes Bill, the Miners (Eight Hours) Bill, and the Old Age Pensions Bill; and the Irish people may justly hope for the same treatment, whereby you will establish tranquillity in Ireland and give greater security to the British Empire.<lb/>
Moved, "That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty in reply to the gracious Speech from the Throne."&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Liverpool.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>*THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, it is the customary privilege of the person who speaks first in these debates from this side of the House to offer his congratulations to the noble Lords who move and second the Address. I trust that the noble Lords who have done so to-day will accept the congratulations that I offer them. I am bound to say that, having now listened to a very great number of speeches delivered in similar circumstances, I am impressed by the fact that the noble movers and seconders, as years go by, seem to stand less and less in need of that indulgence which, with becoming modesty, they always claim at your Lordships' hands. I trust, nevertheless, that they will take in good part our acknowledgment of the ability with which they perform their task.<lb/>
Both noble Lords very properly dwelt upon that paragraph of the gracious Speech
<col>14</col>
in which His Majesty expresses his gratification at the manner in which he was received by the Sovereign of Germany and by the people of all classes in the city of Berlin. I do not think it is too much to say that there is probably no recent event which has been received with a greater measure of sympathy by the people of this country, or one which they have noted with greater pleasure. We may, I think, say without fear of contradiction that His Majesty's visit was eminently opportune in point of time, and was conspicuously successful, and there is every reason to hope that it may have far-reaching results of the most beneficial character. The visit was one of a long series of such visits, and I do not think we can find words too strong to express our admiration at the indefatigable energy which His Majesty exhibits in undertaking these extremely useful tasks. Each of these visits&#x2014;and they have been numerous&#x2014;has, I believe, either strengthened existing friendships or cemented new ones. In this case we have two Royal families closely connected by ties of blood; two great peoples closely connected by ties of common origin and by common characteristics. No two nations could more properly advance side by side in the van of human progress. We may therefore, I think, rejoice that the two Sovereigns should at this particular moment have emphasised a friendship which ought never to be interrupted, and which, as His Majesty truly observes, makes for the peace of the whole civilised world.<lb/>
That paragraph seems to form a very appropriate preface to the short sentence which follows, in which His Majesty intimates that his relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly. I rejoice that in that part of the Speech which follows the first place should be given to our relations with the United States of America. That is the Power of all others from whom it would be intolerable to think that the non-removal of causes of friction might have the effect of dividing or estranging us. Nor, again, is there any Power with whom we would more gladly co-operate in showing to other countries that is should never be beyond the power of two great nations to find an amicable means of removing sources of international difficulty. I note with particular satisfaction the announcement that in regard at any rate to one of the two questions specially referred to, His Majesty's Government have been
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0032"/>
<col>15</col>
able to carry the Dominion Government with them. We know how keenly the Colonial Governments feel in regard to these questions; we also know&#x2014;I am afraid we must admit it&#x2014;that with the best intentions in the world we have not always been successful in carrying them along with us on questions of this kind, and therefore it is to my mind most satisfactory that in the case of the Waterways question, and I hope we may say the same in regard to the Fisheries question, we have the goodwill and concurrence of the two Colonial Governments concerned.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, there follows a rather remarkable paragraph with regard to the state of affairs in Persia. I entirely agree with His Majesty's Government in holding that our policy in that country should be as far as possible one of non-intervention so far as internal affairs are concerned. But owing to the geographical position of Persia, and owing also to the amount of British commercial enterprise which has found its way into that country, we cannot afford to be indifferent to what passes within it, and, therefore, it is extremely important to us that Persia should be decently governed, and that the state of anarchy and disorder which has prevailed there so long should come to an end. But I observe that in the view of His Majesty's Government that admirable result can only be arrived at by the introduction of "representative institutions in a practical form." I do not know exactly what that somewhat enigmatical expression is intended to point at. I do not know what is meant by "representative institutions in a practical form." It occurs to me that the draftsman of the sentence may have had some experience of representative institutions which have not assumed an entirely practical form. Be that as it may, I do ask His Majesty's Government to remember that representative institutions as we understand them are not a panacea for all the troubles of Eastern communities. We have been putting, in many parts of the world, a great deal of very old wine into very new bottles, and the experiment is a dangerous one. I note with pleasure that in regard to these questions His Majesty's Government are in diplomatic communication with the Government of Russia; it is of great importance, to my mind, that the two Governments should work together in that part and as far as possible in other parts of the world.
<col>16</col>
We note with satisfaction that His Majesty is able to announce that the prospect in the Balkans has improved. I believe it has improved; at the same time we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that very grave cause for anxiety still exists. We can, however, console ourselves by comparing the situation as we know it to-day with the situation as it appeared to us at that moment when, to the consternation and bewilderment of many of the Governments concerned, it was announced to us that Austria had decided to annex the two provinces and that Bulgaria intended to shake herself free of Turkish supremacy. Those events moved this country very deeply. We had always opposed to the best of our power any violent disturbance of the <i>status quo</i> in South-Eastern Europe. Again, we had always been the Power above all others which had insisted most upon the sanctity of international obligations. In the third place, we have never ceased to maintain a very friendly feeling for the people of Turkey, and we rejoiced to see a prospect of better government for them. Therefore, my Lords, it was with the greatest alarm and regret that we became aware of a state of things which threatened a conflagration in South-Eastern Europe, which gave a great shock to all those who desired to uphold the sanctity of international agreements, and which was likely to retard for an indefinite time the development of better institutions in Turkey. If these difficulties have, as I believe they have, been to some extent surmounted, I think we may say that it is due to the moderation and good sense of the Powers which are most concerned.<lb/>
One cannot read the news that comes to us from different parts of the world without feeling that there is really a kind of spirit of reasonableness abroad amongst the Powers, and that they are all anxious to maintain the peace and to compose international difficulties so far as that can be done. I think, in fairness to His Majesty's Government, we may say that, so far as they have contributed to the creation of an international atmosphere which has facilitated better understandings of that kind, they deserve all possible credit. I may venture, in illustration of the kind of reasonableness to which I have referred, to point to the recently concluded Agreement between France and Germany with regard to affairs in Morocco, an Agreement upon which we can afford to look with favourable eyes,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0033"/>
<col>17</col>
because it is, so far as we are aware, consonant with the general lines upon which we have always held that the affairs of Morocco ought properly to have been disposed of.<lb/>
I must not forget to say a word as to the feelings of the people of this country in regard to the catastrophe which recently befell the people of Sicily and Calabria. This was a calamity which no human precautions or foresight could have avoided; it was overwhelming in its disastrous results, and the noble Lord was perfectly right when he said that the feeling of the people of this country was one of unmixed compassion for those who lost friends or lives or homes by that disastrous occurrence.<lb/>
Now I pass for a moment to the paragraph which deals with the affairs of India, a paragraph which will probably be scanned as narrowly as any in the Speech. I observe that in the first place it contains no reference to the general state of the country. That was touched upon by the noble Lord who moved, and most of us feel that something should be said on that subject, particularly as a few weeks ago the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India told us that the circumstances were at that moment formidable, obscure and impenetrable. We should rather like to know whether, in his opinion, the situation has undergone any change. One thing we should all be inclined to say&#x2014;that there must be no weakening, no taking away from the hands of those who on the spot are administering the government of India, no taking away of any of those weapons upon which they rely for coping with so dangerous a position. I cannot express too strongly my belief t hat if matters of this kind are to be successfully dealt with there must be prompt and vigorous action. You must trust the men on the spot with the requisite powers and allow them to use those powers whenever they find it necessary. Above all things avoid dilatory proceedings, appeals from one Court of law to another Court of law, appeals from the local Government to the central Government, or from the central Government to the Secretary of State. All these things tend only to shake the authority. of those who are responsible for the maintenance of order. I hope the noble Viscount will tell us, on this or some other occasion, that he has given the Governor-General and Council
<col>18</col>
all the powers for which they have a right to ask, and that he will trust them to use the powers in such manner as may seem to them necessary.<lb/>
We are informed that the Bill dealing with the improvement of Indian administration is very shortly to come before your Lordships. We are always grateful for any business that can be given to us at the commencement of the session. I am not sure that I am particularly grateful to the noble Viscount for the colossal Blue-books with which he provided us for the purpose, as he told us, of augmenting the joys of the Christmas holidays. I had to spend a considerable part of my holidays in travelling from place to place, and all I can tell him is that after a very short experience of the rules laid down by the railway companies as to extra luggage, it became impossible for me to carry about the enormous amount of pabulum with which the noble Viscount thoughtfully provided us. I have a more serious grievance&#x2014;that these books do not contain any of those aids in the way of indices, summaries, or tables of contents to which we are accustomed in well-compiled Blue-books. It is a perfect maze, in which one loses oneself very easily, and the books contain a great deal of matter which really need not have been there at all. What I conceive we want to know is the opinions of local governments and the opinion formed on those opinions by the Government of India; and finally, the judgment of the noble Viscount himself.<lb/>
We have had another contribution to the literature on the subject, and a very important one, in the reply of the noble Viscount to the Mahomedan deputation which lately waited upon him. I note with great satisfaction one very important point, that the noble Viscount has not yet said his last word, and is prepared to consider the very strong objections raised on behalf of the Moslem population of India. But I naturally desire to reserve what I have to say on this subject until the Bill comes before your Lordships' House. I think we are all agreed that some such steps as the noble Viscount proposes are desirable; the difference between us, if there is a difference, is really one of pace, and that we can discuss at a future time. I will just add that I do not think anything has more reassured those who view these proposals, as many do, with a certain amount of uneasiness than the noble Viscount's frank statement in
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0034"/>
<col>19</col>
this House that nothing is further from his intention than to introduce in India anything that can be described as corresponding with Parliamentary institutions as we know them here.<lb/>
One word more in regard to India. The paragraph is carefully drawn, and in it we are informed that the Bill will deal with matters for which an Act of Parliament will be required. Now, we know that for some of the proposals, in the view of the noble Viscount, the sanction of Parliament is not required, and in those the appointment of an Indian Member to the Viceroy's Council was included. What I wish to say on that subject to-night is whether that matter is or is not dealt with in the Bill, I think it is due to your Lordships that we should have an opportunity of discussing it. To me it appears a matter of very great importance. I feel this the more because the Blue-books, bulky as they are, throw really no light on the subject, and it is to me a somewhat curious fact that the correspondence between the Secretary of State and the Governor-General in Council really contains only one very brief paragraph dealing with the Executive Councils. Lord Minto's Government mentioned, in a tentative tone, that experience which will hereafter be gained of the operation of the proposed measures dealing with the Legislative Councils will show whether it will be desirable or not to strengthen the existing Executive Councils or create new Executive Councils in certain parts of India. The actual words were, I think, that it would be premature even to discuss these questions until after experience had been gained of the other measures. But we know that the noble Viscount has decided to proceed at once, without waiting for further experience, with the changes in the Executive Councils, and the natural inference is that there must have been at some time some kind of discussion, some kind of correspondence between the Government of India and Whitehall. I do not want two more colossal Blue-books, but I think there should be a continuation of the story to tell us how this most important step came to be taken.<lb/>
I can assure the noble Viscount that I make this criticism in no hostile spirit; my one anxiety is that nothing should be done to impair the efficiency of the Viceroy's Council. That is the object and end of my criticism, and I feel a certain amount of
<col>20</col>
anxiety lest the efficiency of the Viceroy's Council should be impaired by giving him one member, not appointed necessarily because he is the best man for the post, but because he happens to be qualified for the post and also to be an Indian. It is because I have that feeling that I do look with a certain; mount of suspicion upon this part of the noble Viscount's scheme. The noble Viscount will remember that his language was rather uncompromising; he said if a vacancy arises&#x2014;and we know that a vacancy is about to arise&#x2014;he will feel it his duty to appoint an Indian. Well, these words have been taken as meaning that, whatever other competitors are in the field, an Indian will be preferred because he is an Indian. Now I conceive that this will not be the removal of a disqualification, but the imposition of a new disqualification upon the other competitors.<lb/>
I turn now to that part of the Speech which has reference to the South African Colonies, and which is extremely interesting to most of us. South Africa is a land connected in our minds with many painful memories and many bitter controversies, and, if out of these troubles there should emerge a new order of things at once benefiting the Colonies concerned and adding to the renown of the British Empire, we shall all warmly welcome it. The first stage has been arrived at, and if the other stages are successfully accomplished, I think we shall all feel that a great debt of gratitude will be due not only to those who, like my noble friend Lord Milner, and still more our colleague Lord Selborne, have been prominent in bringing about a condition of affairs rendering these things possible, but also to those colonial statesmen who, without distinction of race, have been working together for this purpose.<lb/>
I come now to what appears to me a somewhat remarkable omission from the gracious Speech. One, if not both, of the noble Lords who spoke just now said something as to the condition of Ireland. The noble Lord who seconded, I think, told us that there was a great deal of exaggeration in what was currently said with regard to the condition of Ireland. I must express my surprise that the Speech contains no reference to the condition of Ireland. I shall avoid, I hope, the language of exaggeration, but I do
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0035"/>
<col>21</col>
venture to say that in a considerable part of Ireland the state of the country is scandalous and deplorable, and that the result of events which have taken place in that part of Ireland has been to create a general feeling of insecurity in the rest of the country and to render infinitely more difficult than it was a few months ago the solution of the Irish agrarian problem. I understand that my noble friend behind me is likely to draw attention to this matter to-morrow, and I will not anticipate what he has to say; but I do assert that under the present administration Ireland has made a rake's progress infinitely more rapid than any which that country has achieved since we have had anything to do with it.<lb/>
It is an overwhelming indictment. We know, to begin with, that we hold your receipt when you took office for an Ireland which the then Chief Secretary described as more peaceful than it had been since the time of Strongbow. Can you say that of the present condition of Ireland? What about the outrages of which we now constantly read, in which firearms are employed? In 1906 there were virtually no such outrages. In 1908 there were 121. I recall a speech delivered last year by the noble Earl who will follow me in which he made very light of the firearms question. I think he said that people could always get firearms if they wanted to commit a murder, or something of that kind. But does the noble Earl know that there is now a roaring trade in firearms in almost every village in some parts of Ireland, with the result that the persons who take part in these cattle-drives are found with firearms in their pockets and use them, as we know, upon occasion? I mentioned the word "cattle-drives." Cattle-driving was unknown until the present Chief Secretary took over the government of Ireland. Has the noble Earl not heard that in the last two years there have been over 1,000 cattle-drives in Ireland&#x2014;1,050, to give the exact figure? Has the noble Earl not heard, as we are beginning to hear now, of the mutilation of cattle accompanied by that ferocity which in the days of the Land League was too commonly exhibited? Finally, has he not heard of the murder in broad daylight of a w retched constable in the discharge of his duty&#x2014;a murder which apparently was regarded with enthusiastic approbation by the people of the neighbourhood? Are these things in-
<col>22</col>
ventions of ours, or are they, as we believe them to be, solid facts?<lb/>
Bad and alarming as are these isolated incidents, worse still to my mind is the complete supremacy, the complete reign of terror, which has been established by these combinations in some Irish districts. I am told that no child is too young, no woman too weak or too unprotected, no poor person too humble or too helpless to escape the tyranny of these organised bands. All these things shock us, and what shocks us even more is the impunity with which these things are done. I said just now there were 1,050 cattle drives within the past two years. I am told that there have been only 162 cases in which proceedings of any kind have been taken.<lb/>
What is your mode of dealing with these people, when you catch them? You shut them up. You bind them over to keep the peace. I am told that in these circumstances they are treated as untried prisoners. Their friends have access to them. They are fed upon the fat of the land. They have such a glorious time as they never had before in their lives, and they know that, when the time comes for dividing the ranches, it is the people who have undergone this treatment&#x2014;I will not call it punishment&#x2014;who will be marked out for special recognition and reward. I would like to ask, why is it that the misguided women who occasionally make themselves extremely objectionable outside Ministerial residences, when they go to prison, are obliged to spend twenty-three hours out of twenty-four in the solitary confinement of a cell, and that these people who go about the country driving cattle, with arms in their pockets, are treated with this conspicuous indulgence? It is the old story. It is because His Majesty's Government have made up their mind that they are going to rely upon the ordinary law. We know why that is. The truth was blurted out in this House by a subordinate member of the Government last year, who told us that His Majesty's Government refused to avail themselves of the Crimes Act, because the people of Ireland had been led to believe by the utterances of leading members of the Liberal party that they would receive more sympathetic treatment. That really is the sole reason why, having ready to your hands a weapon which from experience you know would be sufficient to deal with these evils,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0036"/>
<col>23</col>
you leave that weapon in your pocket without having recourse to it.<lb/>
I ask, now much longer is this to go on? The noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India has left his place. I was going to suggest that His Majesty's Government might lay to heart some words which he used not very long ago with regard to another part of the British dominions. This is what Lord Morley said&#x2014;
<quote>"Somehow or other we have got to maintain order. Disorder, whatever your policy may be, must be put down, and that with a firm hand. The maintenance of order is the foundation of anything like future progress."</quote><lb/>
Why is that sound doctrine for external application only? Why is there to be a firm hand in one part of the King's dominions, and why are you prepared to use the kid glove on an irresolute, vacillating hand in another? I would rather leave unsaid what most people are saying with regard to the heads and hands by which the Administration of Ireland is at present guided.<lb/>
The next paragraph in the gracious Speech deals with the question of finance, and, although it is short, we can read a great deal between the lines of it. I do not think it needs an expert in finance to discover that we have a waning revenue, that we have vast new commitments, and that we have improvidently dispensed with sources of revenue which would have stood us in very good stead at the present time. I should like to know whether, if the taxation on sugar, tea, and coal had not been got rid of, anybody in his senses would propose to get rid of it now. We know that the Navy will make large calls upon our resources. It is nevertheless satisfactory to remember that the present Prime Minister has in the most emphatic manner undertaken that our naval supremacy shall remain unquestionable, and that we are to have the two-Power standard maintained in this sense&#x2014;that we are to be given a superiority of 10 per cent, over the combined forces in capital ships of any other two Powers. The country has taken note of that pledge, and I feel no doubt that it will be observed in the spirit as well as to the letter.<lb/>
There is another liability to which reference is made&#x2014;I mean the new liability on account of old-age pensions. I think
<col>24</col>
it is pretty notorious that you have considerably outrun the constable in that direction. The noble Earl will remember that, when the Old-Age Pensions Bill was before this House, many Members called attention to tile inequalities which it contained and to the dangerous loopholes which were left for fraud upon the taxpayers of this country. I venture to think that our warnings have been entirely justified. Some of us even went the length of suggesting amendments, but they were brushed on one side, and you invoked the privilege of the House of Commons. What do we find now? You are obliged to bring in a Bill yourselves to deal with the inequalities of treatment which you have now discovered.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>May I ask the noble Marquess when we invoked the privilege of the House of Commons on that subject?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member>: <membercontribution>My impression is that when we first went into Committee the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack got up and warned us collectively that we had better leave these matters alone, because they were questions of privilege. I remember particularly one Amendment moved by my noble friend, Lord Salisbury, which clearly dealt with a very bad blot in the Bill, and was also ruled out on that ground in common with all the rest. If the noble Earl will refer to <i>Hansard,</i> he will find that my statement is amply justified.<lb/>
With regard to the particular question of exclusion on account of pauperism, I see that the Chancellor of the Exchequer the other day announced to a deputation that, if the local authorities would only find the money&#x2014;a little matter of &#x00A3;3,000,000 or &#x00A3;4,000,000&#x2014;he would be glad to see that "cruel" anomaly removed. Your chickens have come home to roost.<lb/>
There is another little matter connected with old-age pensions. Some of my noble friends from Ireland will have some very interesting information to supply on that subject. I am told, by people who know what they are talking about, that, whereas your estimate of the cost of old-age pensions in Ireland was three-quarters of a million, the actual cost will be over two millions.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0037"/>
<col>25</col>
In Ireland the taxpayers are being plundered right and left, and if the noble Earl will institute an inquiry he will get some very curious revelations. In reference to the financial situation, I will only say now that I do not believe any Chancellor of the Exchequer has ever in a time of profound peace found himself confronted with such a situation as now confronts Mr. Lloyd-George. Let me add that this House contains a number of Members whose right to speak with authority upon questions of finance stands as high as that of any other public man, in or out of the House of Lords, and therefore noble Lords opposite must not be surprised if, even although this question mainly concerns the House of Commons, the House of Lords also takes some interest in it.<lb/>
With regard to the measures promised in the Speech, I notice there are one or two important omissions from the list. There is no suggestion of any legislation dealing with your Lordships' House. That is reserved for the public platform. We do not complain of that, but we do observe that, while on the platform friends of noble Lords opposite are extremely eloquent on this subject, as a Government noble Lords opposite are extremely cautious how they translate these vapourings into anything like substantial proposals. Meanwhile, we note with pleasure that the stream of recruits provided by the Government to this House still flows steadily. May we be allowed to offer a welcome to one of the latest of these recruits&#x2014;the Scottish Secretary, who took his seat this evening? I have noticed ingenious attempts to explain why the noble Lord obtained his promotion at this particular juncture, but I have no hesitation in offering a theory of my own, I am convinced that His Majesty's Government had come to the conclusion that the time had arrived when my noble friends Lord Balfour of Burleigh, Lord Camperdown, and other noble Lords who interest themselves with so much ability in Scottish affairs, were entitled to have opposed to them a foeman worthy of their steel. And so little do I disapprove of the Government's action that I would venture to suggest to them that they should carry it a little further. If they promote the Scottish Secretary, why not the Irish Secretary? If the Irish Secretary were to be allowed to sit side by side with the Scottish Secretary, I feel sure that my noble friends from Ireland would give him
<col>26</col>
a reception the warmth of which would leave nothing to be desired.<lb/>
The other omission from the Speech is the abandonment of all attempt to deal with the question of education. That seems to me a striking justification of your Lordships' action in not accepting without demur the somewhat crude and hasty legislative proposals which were put before us in 1906. Since then you have had two years in which to deal with this question. You have had the experience of one Bill brought in in 1907; in 1908 there was the Bill of the right rev. Prelate the Bishop of St. Asaph, then the penal Bill of Mr. McKenna, and then, in the autumn session of last year, the olive-branch Bill of Mr. Runciman. These latter have not reached this House, and therefore it cannot be said that the House of Lords stands in the way. Even with your great and docile majority in the other House, you have not been able to frame a measure which you can confidently recommend to the public and to Parliament as a thoroughly just and equitable solution of the question. As we are not to have any legislation, I do trust that the Government will not attempt to do by executive action what they do not dare to do and cannot do by legislative means. Some of your Lordships may have noticed the extraordinary case mentioned in the papers by my noble friend Lord Cawdor in connection with the Swansea school. There was a dispute between the managers of a non-provided school and the local education authority. The matter was referred by the Board of Education to a very distinguished lawyer, who held an inquiry as provided by the Act, and that distinguished lawyer found on all points in favour of the managers of the school and against the local educational authority. The Board of Education apparently tore up his report, reversed his decision, and ruled against the managers of the school and in favour of the local authority; and to give completeness to the story I observe that that distinguished lawyer has within the last few days been promoted to a place in the High Court.<lb/>
Of the measures mentioned I will not say much. We are promised another Irish Land Bill, and the noble Lord who seconded the Address appears to think that a Bill on the lines of the Bill of last year is likely to be received with acclamation by all concerned. I am afraid he is too san-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0038"/>
<col>27</col>
guine. We are always ready to co-operate with His Majesty's Government in putting the financial basis of land purchase in Ireland on a better footing. We are also prepared to join in doing what we can to improve the condition of the congested districts of that country. But I would entreat His Majesty's Government to apply three <i>criteria</i> to any measure they intend to press forward. Let them ask themselves:&#x2014;Will it really promote purchase, or will it not ; will it really relieve the wants of the congested districts, or will it not; will it increase or will it diminish the feeling of insecurity in Ireland? I regret to say that if the Bill at all resembles the Bill introduced last autumn it fails when judged by each of these <i>criteria.</i> In the opinion of those most competent to judge, it is likely to arrest the progress of purchase. It is a Bill which will do very little for congested districts because you have set up side by side with your congested districts policy the policy of distributing land amongst what are called the landless men in other parts of Ireland. Finally, it is a Bill which will perpetuate that tribunal upon whose haphazard methods various Committees and Royal Commissions have so strongly animadverted, and you are going to trust that body with new powers which it will be obliged to exercise in a manner that will destroy the last vestige of the security, not only of the landlord who still owns a few acres of land in Ireland, but even of those tenants who have purchased their farms under encouragement from His Majesty's Government and who at any rate might have supposed that they at least had found a haven of security in which they were not likely to be harshly disturbed.<lb/>
Then I notice that there is to be a Bill for the disestablishment and disendowment of the Church in Wales. Am I wrong in thinking that a Royal Commission, presided over by a learned Judge, is still sitting and inquiring into this matter? If not, why is it thought desirable to bring in a Bill without waiting for the report of that Commission? In the case of the Poor Law, the Government have shown a wiser discretion. They are going to give themselves time to study that Report, and if it is true that the Report contains nearly 700 pages and the evidence extends to 12,000 pages, they are wise in not being in too great a hurry to legislate upon it.
<col>28</col>
The other Bills seem to be not of first-rate importance, but some of them deal with subjects which we all think should be dealt with. To sum up what I have to say with regard to the Speech, it contains undoubtedly several passages on which we can all dwell with pleasure, but it contains others which leave us anxious and dissatisfied, and it presents omissions which require further explanation. With regard to the legislative proposals which we are told we may expect, we shall await them with interest; and I can assure the noble Earl, speaking for those who sit behind me, that if those measures are conceived in a spirit of equity and moderation, it will be most agreeable to us so far as our opportunities permit, to co-operate with His Majesty's Government in supporting their passage through Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>*THE EARL OF CREWE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, it gives me pleasure, first of all, to congratulate my noble friends the mover and seconder of the Address on the manner in which they have discharged their task. The mover of the Address bears a famous Parliamentary name and succeeded a valued colleague of our own, and the seconder is the son of a very familiar figure in the House of recent years. But if we have our gains we also have our losses. In the short interval since we last met this House has lost one of its most brilliant members, Lord Robertson. His darts were often very sharp but they were never envenomed; and those of us who from time to time became their target enjoyed the skill of the marksman as much as any one else. It will be a long time before Lord Robertson's contributions to our debates are forgotten by those who were privileged to hear them.<lb/>
The Speech opens with an allusion to the visit of their Majesties to Berlin, and I am able to speak from personal observation of the extreme cordiality which was there exhibited from the highest to the humblest without distinction of class or profession. I desire to join in the tribute which the noble Marquess paid as to the manner in which His Majesty has always shown himself willing, at the expense of any personal trouble, to carry out this important part of the Sovereign's duties. Of course, such visits as this cannot do everything. They cannot of themselves settle vexed international questions. They cannot of themselves even dissolve deep-seated international animosities. But in such a case
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0039"/>
<col>29</col>
as that of ourselves and Germany, when there are really no important questions at issue between the two countries, and when there is no conceivable reason whatever for anything like international animosity, a visit of this sort can be productive of nothing but the greatest good. It necessarily improves the whole atmosphere between the two countries; and, so far as I can speak from personal knowledge of the communications that passed in Berlin, I can say that the desire winch His Majesty's Government evinced&#x2014;a desire, I believe, that is shared by the whole of this country&#x2014;is also shared by those who guide the destinies of the great German Empire; and that desire, I conceive to be, that, without in any way compromising the alliances or understandings to which each country is respectively committed, the two nations should be able to maintain a thoroughly friendly attitude with regard to each other, and to take every opportunity for harmonious co-operation, not merely for the purpose of maintaining the peace of the world, but also of advancing the many interests of both countries which do not in any way clash or interfere with each other.<lb/>
The King's Speech refers to the earthquake at Messina. Such great natural cataclysms remind us, more than anything else, of the littleness of human affairs. But it is a very distinct satisfaction to us that we were able to do something through our Navy and merchant service towards the alleviation of the terrible trouble which fell upon a friendly nation.<lb/>
As regards the state of affairs in South-Eastern Europe, the mover of the Address alluded to the recent change of government in Turkey. We are not in full possession of the circumstances which led to that change of government; but even if we were it would not, I think, be our province to comment upon it. So far as the internal affairs of Turkey are concerned, our one wish is that Turkey should go on being strengthened by a policy of reform on a basis of liberty and equality. Therefore, whatever Government may be in power in Turkey, so long as it carries out this policy, it will be benevolently regarded by ourselves. But as regards the conduct of the foreign affairs of Turkey I should be sorry not to pay a tribute to the statesman who has just resigned office. Through a time of very great difficulty he had shown remark-
<col>30</col>
able qualities in conducting negotiations with other countries, and we sincerely hope that the new Government will carry out his policy, for this reason, that that policy seems to be on the very point of securing a settlement between Turkey on the one side and both Bulgaria and Austria on the other side. It is a thoroughly satisfactory feature of the situation that so far as the principal proposals of both Bulgaria and Austria are concerned they have been accepted by Turkey, and I sincerely hope that this may lead to an amicable solution. It is impossible to look with quite the same satisfaction upon the position as regards Servia. But we must hope for the best. There are also difficulties which cannot be blinked both in relation to Montenegro and Crete. I can assure noble Lords opposite that the policy of the Foreign Office will be directed towards arriving at a peaceful settlement of all the difficulties in South-Eastern Europe.<lb/>
The question of Persia is distinctly less satisfactory. The noble Marquess asked for the meaning of the phrase in the gracious Speech&#x2014;
<quote>"The state of affairs in Persia imperatively demands the introduction of representative institutions in a practical form."</quote><lb/>
That means that if representative institutions are granted by the Shah they should be genuinely representative institutions. We agree that representative institutions in Persia, or anywhere else, are not an absolute panacea for all the evils of that country; but the fact remains that they are demanded in Persia and have been promised by the ruler of that country; and all we say is that we cannot feel ourselves in a position to support the Shah, either by means of a loan or in any other way, so long as he persists in his present policy. It is perfectly true that we are exceedingly desirous to avoid intervention in Persia, but it is not always as easy as might be supposed to avoid intervention in the affairs of other countries. A state of general disorder becomes sometimes so great a public menace and constitutes so serious an interference with trade, that anything short of absolute intervention is a matter of extreme difficulty. That applies particularly to the case of Russia because, as noble Lords know, Russian interests are distinctly affected in the, north of Persia, which has for some time been the most disturbed district of any. The Russian Government take the same
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0040"/>
<col>31</col>
view of the whole matter that we do, and we are in friendly communication with them on the whole subject on the lines indicated in the gracious Speech.<lb/>
I was very glad to hear what fell from the noble Marquess opposite with regard to the subjects concerning Canada and Newfoundland mentioned in the Speech&#x2014;the Waterways Treaty and the fisheries arbitration. I do not wish to say very much of the Waterways Treaty, because it is at this moment before the American Senate, and, as the noble Marquess very well knows, that body is in the habit of discussing pretty freely international treaties which come before it. The subject is one of first importance and of very great difficulty. There are complicated questions of the level to which waterways and lakes may be reduced and of the abstraction of water for power, and I should like to bear testimony to the skill and patience shown not only by Mr. Bryce, though I desire that he should have his full share of it, but also by Mr. Root, and certainly not less by the Canadian Ministers engaged all through the discussions. With regard to the fisheries arbitration, these questions are almost, I suppose, the most repulsive with which public men can be confronted. Everybody has shied away, if I may use the expression, from the fisheries question of Newfoundland for a great many years past. Here, again, I should like to pay a tribute to the desire for accommodation shown both by the Colony and the United States, and I sincerely hope that if these matters come, as I trust they may, before The Hague Tribunal, this exceedingly tiresome question may be finally got out of the way.<lb/>
Then I pass to Africa, and there again I am in full accord with what has fallen from the noble Marquess. It is, as the Speech says, the first step towards the consummation of the union of a large part of the great continent of Africa. So far as I am able to judge from what has passed during the discussions, the qualities of statesmanship shown by the South African politicians of all the colonies and of every race have been of the most remarkable character. When one comes to think of the recent history of South Africa it does seem to be almost a magical thing that it should have been possible for these public men to meet and ,discuss and decide upon questions which
<col>32</col>
go deepest to the life of the nation, and with scarcely varying harmony and steadfast determination to arrive at a solution to get over or round their difficulties in a way which cannot be too highly praised. Beyond those qualities of intellect we can prize even more highly the thoroughly human feeling that has been shown both in dealing with racial and with native questions, especially those relating to the great Protectorates under our administration. I hope that it will be found that the good-will which South African statesmen have shown may tend towards the settlement of those very difficult problems caused by the presence within the union, and in districts that may become part of the union, of those vast native populations&#x2014;problems for which I ask your Lordships to remember there is no precedent whatever in any kind of union attempted in any other part of the world. In saying that I should also like to endorse fully the tribute that the noble Marquess paid to Lord Selborne. Lord Selborne has throughout shown the valuable combination of robust common sense and vivid sympathy, which have enabled him to be of very real service to South African statesmen in setting before them certain aspects of the problems with which they had to deal.<lb/>
I now come to that part of the Speech which deals with domestic affairs. The noble Marquess complained that no direct mention is made in the gracious Speech of the condition of things in Ireland. My Lords, our reference to the condition of Ireland, from our point of view, consists in the announcement of our intention to bring in an Irish Land Bill, because the state of Ireland, unsatisfactory as it may be in some parts, though greatly exaggerated by many people for party purposes, does, in our opinion, depend exclusively and entirely on the state of things with which our Land Bill is designed to deal. The noble Marquess brought an indictment against us. He said we found a peaceful Ireland; and what is the state of Ireland now? Now, my Lords, it seems to me that that involves a fallacy of which it is not very difficult to dispose. It is perfectly true that Ireland was in a peaceful condition when we went there. But you can always make Ireland peaceful for a time by bribing it, and the last and greatest of all these bribes was the Irish Land Bill of 1903, which was at the time captivating the imagination of the Irish people. There-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0041"/>
<col>33</col>
fore, to draw a comparison between then and now seems to me as unreal as to draw a comparison between the state of Ireland to-day and what it was when the noble Marquess opposite was there in 1887. It was then infinitely worse than it is now, though I quite admit that it does not follow from that that the noble Marquess necessarily governed Ireland worse than we do. It is really, I submit, fatuous to say that because there is more crime Ireland is worse governed, and because there is less crime it is better governed. To put that statement <i>simpliciter</i> leaves out all the circumstances of the case.<lb/>
What are the circumstances of the case with regard to some counties in Ireland? That state of things directly, in my judgment, arises out of your Irish Land Act. It is the unfortunate fruit of that otherwise noble tree. If you establish a peasant proprietary it may be a wise or foolish thing to do, but if you tell by your legislation every Irish peasant that the object at which he ought to aim is to become a peasant proprietor you excite a new form of that land hunger which has always existed in Ireland. That is exactly what has happened. You cannot do what you did in 1903 without causing comparisons to be drawn between the peasant proprietors with their small holdings and the great unoccupied tracts of grass-land. It may be economically best for Ireland that you should have a graduated system of hill farms, and land for half fattening, and land for finishing; but these considerations do not appeal to people who see these large tracts of empty land, and now we see, what we did not foresee at the time, this land hunger for the grass-land as the direct outcome of what you did in 1903. The noble Marquess referred to 1,000 cattle-drives. I believe that the number of what may be called cattle-drives in the strict sense is very much smaller than is represented, though I have not the figures before me now; but they can and will be produced.<lb/>
Then we come back to the old point of difference between the two sides, as to the administration of the Crimes Act. It is assumed to-night, as it has been so frequently assumed before, that you have nothing to do but depend on one section of the Crimes Act of 1887 and peace will reign in the country. The very reason we do not apply the Crimes Act is that we believe
<col>34</col>
it is a rotten weapon. As regards intimidation, I have always held the view that well-organised intimidation cannot be checked by law. I know no method of checking it by the application of the most drastic coercion. That may be an unhappy admission for a Government to make, but it was made by Lord Salisbury, and I believe that what I say will be confirmed by everyone who has had to do with the Government at Dublin Castle.<lb/>
The subject of town-planning is one in which I have always taken a great personal interest. In driving the other day through the wide suburbs of Berlin it was impossible not to feel how much more thought and sense and method have been brought to the development of the outskirts of that great capital than have ever been applied to the outskirts of any great town in this country. I sincerely hope we may be able by the Town Planning Bill to do something to avoid the haphazard methods which have been hitherto in vogue. I do not attempt to enter on the question of the, Poor Law. We hope the legislation which we propose to introduce for the establishment of labour exchanges, which I was not surprised to find is a matter put in the forefront by those who sat on the Royal Commission, may be of some real service. One great evil is not only unemployment, but under employment, and if anything can be done by organisation to improve the lot of those workers, I feel that a good deal will be gained. On the question of Welsh Disestablishment, I understand the Report of the Commission is practically completed or will be at a very early date. The noble Marquess rather suggested that the measure should not be introduced until the Report has been seen.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member>: <membercontribution>I rather suggested that the policy of the Government should not be decided until the Report has been received.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member>: <membercontribution>As far as the policy of the Government is concerned we have no reason to suppose that the great national demand to which we endeavoured to give effect on a former occasion has been in any way modified, and we shall be surprised if the Report goes to show that it has. I only touch the question of India very briefly, because my noble friend will bring in his Bill in a very short time, and we shall then be able to discuss the question
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0042"/>
<col>35</col>
as a whole. I have my noble friend's authority for saying that he is anxious that all matters relating to India should be fully threshed out in this House, and even although the question of the appointment of a native on the Viceroy's Council, being an executive act, does not arise on the Bill, it will be a comparatively slight breach of order to discuss a topic so kindred to the whole subject on the Second Reading.<lb/>
The noble Marquess twitted us with not bringing in a Bill again on this occasion on the vexed subject of education. I am afraid the forces of bigotry, not confined to one school of thought, have been too much for us. I deeply lament it should be so. It seems to me a profound misfortune that after enlisting the very generous co-operation of the most reverend Primate, and after devoting, as my right hon. friend the President of the Board of Education has done, weeks and months to the discussion of the subject, we are not much nearer each other than when this Parliament first met. I regard that as something like a national disgrace, and I lament as much as the noble Marquess did, though in a somewhat different spirit, the omission of this measure from the gracious Speech.<lb/>
I have no doubt that when our financial proposals come before this House they will be very fully discussed, as indeed a considerable number of your Lordships are well qualified to discuss them. It is perfectly true that the task of my right hon. friend is by no means a simple one. He has to meet these great commitments with a revenue which cannot be described as anything but unsatisfactory, though I should hope there is some indication of improvement before very long. The noble Marquess alluded to the Navy and said something about its requisite strength. I do not remember the precise words of the noble Marquess, but I wish to guard myself by saying that the words which we adopt in that connection are the words as used by the Prime Minister. It is true we have to find a vast sum for old-age pensions. It was fully admitted last year that there would be a certain degree of risk of pensions being claimed by those who were not entitled to receive them, and if noble Lords can produce proofs of cases of that kind they will be interesting, and I hope they may lead to the establishment of measures for reducing that risk. In this connection I may point out that there is another side to the large
<col>36</col>
Irish claim. I think It shows that the proportion of very old people in the country is lamentably great, due, of course, to the fact that such a large proportion of the younger population leave the country year by year. If a miscalculation has been made it is due to the fact that those responsible have taken the English <i>ratio</i> of population and have forgotten that in Ireland the <i>ratio</i> is a different one from what it is in the other divisions of the United Kingdom. I think I have nothing more to add on that subject.<lb/>
The noble Marquess has given a kind welcome to my noble friend the Secretary for Scotland and a kindly invitation to the Chief Secretary for Ireland, if His Majesty should be pleased to raise him to the peerage by the advice of my right hon. friend. I think the Chief Secretary for Ireland, in whichever House he may sit, will feel it is something like a choice between frying-pan and fire&#x2014;which position my right hon. friend might consider your Lordship's House I really cannot say without asking him. In speaking of my noble friend the Secretary for Scotland, the noble Marquess said that various noble Lords well acquainted with the affairs of Scotland, would now find "a foeman worthy of their steel," but really I cannot allow the Lord Chancellor, who, after all, has been in charge of our attempted Scottish legislation in this House, I cannot allow him to rest under the imputation of not being worthy of anybody's steel, although I frankly admit, of course, as regards the representation of the office, it is of great advantage to have my noble friend here instead of a noble friend of mine who has always conducted Scottish business efficiently but who naturally is not conversant with official details as is my noble friend the Secretary for Scotland. Having endeavoured to deal with the points raised I think I need now say no more.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to ask the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India a Question of which I have given him private notice. I noticed a few days ago a statement, apparently on authority, that it was proposed to abolish the Military Supply Member of the Viceroy's Council and the Department over which he presides.

<title>THE KING'S SPEECH&#x2014;ADJOURNED DEBATE.</title>
<p>Order of the Day read for resuming the adjourned Debate on the Motion for an humble Address.</p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, your Lordships may perhaps remember that on three occasions within the last two years I have felt it my duty to call attention to the serious condition of things in some parts of Ireland. When first I addressed the House on the subject the lawlessness was confined to certain parts in the extreme West of Ireland, and though it might then have been considered a cloud no bigger than a man's hand, I warned the Government, of the danger of disregarding the disorder. My gloomy prognostications have, unhappily, been fulfilled, and at the present moment there is a lawless state of affairs extending over twenty-two counties. I, therefore, need offer no apology for taking this opportunity to draw attention for a fourth time to this serious state of affairs.<lb/>
My noble friend the Leader of the Opposition referred to the subject yesterday with his characteristic moderation of language. My noble friend spoke of the condition of certain parts of Ireland as
<col>38</col>
"scandalous and deplorable," and when one who is remarkable for the moderation of his language uses such terms others may be justified in using stronger language. I regret to find it my duty to criticise the speech of the noble Lord who yesterday discharged the difficult duty of seconding the Motion for the Address, but I cannot allow to pass unchallenged the noble Lord's statement that in twenty-four counties out of the thirty-two there was no agrarian crime and very little ordinary crime, and that the returns for last year showed a decrease of agrarian crime as compared with the previous year. I am afraid the noble Lord, in his desire to support His Majesty's Government, spoke upon imperfect information, for certainly it is a statement that cannot be reconciled with the answer on the subject given in November by the Chief Secretary for Ireland. Replying to Mr. Lonsdale on November 3, Mr. Birrell stated that outside the eight counties which had been declared by proclamation to be in a state of disturbance, cattle-drives had taken place within the previous eighteen months in fourteen counties. I assert that in some parts of Ireland there exists a state of affairs that is discreditable to civilised government, and outrages are perpetrated such as the English people scarcely realise.<lb/>
Members of His Majesty's Government will not admit that the attempt to govern Ireland by what they call the ordinary law has failed. I ask them, Will they then allow the present state of lawlessness to continue? The reply of the noble Earl the Leader of the House to my noble friend Lord Lansdowne was most unsatisfactory, and certainly I cannot admit that the peaceful state of Ireland when the late Government went out of office was due to the Land Purchase Act as a species of bribery. If the peaceful condition of Ireland is to be bought at the hands of the law-breakers by bribery, surely the Bill of Mr. Birrell ought to make Ireland the most peaceful country in the world. The Act of 1903 had only one failure&#x2014;it was too successful. It was taken up to a far greater extent than even the most sanguine members of the Government anticipated, and the failure was due to the fact that, in the interests of the taxpayers of England, the Chancellor of the Exchequer limited the amount to be given. Far from being an act of bribery, Mr. Wyndham's Act was a most statesmanlike
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0044"/>
<col>39</col>
measure, and if further facilities were given in regard to money and office arrangements I believe the agrarian troubles in Ireland would cease. I maintain that the present condition of affairs is entirely due to the neglect of His Majesty's Government to take steps for the repression of disorder.<lb/>
The Government are fully aware of this deplorable condition of affairs. Speaking in the House of Commons yesterday the Prime Minister said&#x2014;
<quote>"I am not going to palliate or to minimise the deplorable condition of things which exist in some parts of Ireland. I and my colleagues should be false to our duty and to the real opinion which prevailed if Me did anything of the kind. We agree that things are going on in some parts of Ireland which are condemnable and reprehensible, which ought to be put down."</quote>
Those were the words of the Prime Minister. Then, I ask, what steps are being taken to give effect to these words? There is no form of agrarian crime which has not increased in Ireland since the advent to power of His Majesty's present Government. Cattle-driving was unknown before. Not only has this new crime arisen, but other crimes have increased. In November, 1905, when the late Government went out of office, there were 162 cases of boycotting; on November 30, 1908, there were 840. In January, 1906, there were 208 persons under police protection; on November 19, 1908, there were 351. In 1905 there were no cattle-drives at all; there were 635 in eleven months of 1908. In 1905 there were 270 cases of agrarian outrage; in eleven months of 1908 there were 537. In 1905 there were eleven persons fired at; in eleven months of 1908 there were forty. In 1905 there were eighteen cases of firing into dwellings; in eleven months of 1908 there were eighty-one.<lb/>
Cattle-driving, in spite of what has been said, has increased, and that increase is due to the fact that the law-breakers believe they have the sympathy of His Majesty's Government in their illegal action. They were told by Mr. T. W. Russell that cattle-driving is a comparatively harmless amusement, and the noble Earl the Leader of your Lordships' House has spoken of it as a species of practical joke.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>What I said was that at first cattle-driving had
<col>40</col>
been taken up in somewhat of a jocular spirit, but it had assumed a very much more serious form.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY </member>: <membercontribution>Cattle-driving has; since considerably increased, not only in the number of cases, but also in the system. Before, cattle were merely driven off, receiving but little injury. Now, cattle are maimed, injured, and blinded. There was a case the other day in which the head of a bullock was cut off and placed on a spike in the hedge. I do not call that a harmless amusement or a joke. By not having nipped this in the bud the present serious state of affairs has arisen. When I raised this question in your Lordships' House in October last Lord Crewe said that it was not possible to establish any connection between the dropping of the Arms Act and the firing outrages which had taken place, and that when that Act was in full force there were many more and much worse firing outrages than now. Will the noble Earl repeat that statement now, after the figures I have quoted? He will find that since 1882, the year in which the Arms Act was introduced into Ireland, there has never been so many shooting outrages as since the Act was dropped.<lb/>
I read in the <i>Irish Catholic,</i> of November 7, an organ not unsympathetic to Nationalist ideas, these strong words on this subject:&#x2014;
<quote>"We emphatically say that it was nothing short of a piece of astounding folly to repeal the Peace Preservation Act without at least enacting some such legislation as that which in England, and elsewhere, regulates the sale of firearms. For months past arms have been pouring into our provincial districts, and in far too many cases into the possession of persons who were quite sufficiently dangerous to the public peace and safety without them. The policy or legislation which rendered possible the creation of such a situation as this is simply immoral."</quote>
These various classes of crime have culminated in the brutal murder of the unfortunate policeman Goldrick, and the whole country is demoralised. Let me briefly recount the history of the murder of that unfortunate man. A widow of the name of Ryan took a farm and paid what is called her footing in the shape of a sum of money down to the United Irish League, in the hope of enjoying the benefit of that farm. Within a short time, however, she was boycotted, and on one occasion shot at. In order to preserve her
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0045"/>
<col>41</col>
property she had to repair a wall, and engaged two workmen for this purpose. The lives of these men were in such danger while working for her that the protection of Constable Goldrick was provided; but while they were working one night they were shot at, and the courageous policeman at once started in pursuit of the assailants. But when he got into the hedge, he was shot dead. That murder is the culmination of your allowing crimes of this class to increase.<lb/>
Let me refer for a moment to an incident the other day in the metropolis. A policeman was shot dead by two miscreants. What happened? Every one joined in the hue and cry, and pursued the murderers. But did any one run to capture the murderers of Constable Goldrick? Then, again, at the funeral of the Tottenham policeman crowds assembled, and every honour was done to the memory of the late constable. At the funeral of Goldrick only a few constables and the relatives were present, and a black flag was hoisted to warn people not to attend. The whole of the country is demoralised under the Birrell <i>regime,</i> or what we are told is the governing of Ireland according to Irish ideas. What are His Majesty's Government going to do to cope with this appalling state of things?<lb/>
I should like to ask the noble Lord who is to reply for the Irish Office whether the Government are satisfied with their present system of trying law-breakers by juries. At the Winter Assizes of 1907 and at the Summer Assizes of 1908 complete failure characterised trial by jury: and the cases brought before juries at the Winter Assizes of 1908 represented but a small proportion of the crimes perpetrated. In Clare, for example, from which only three cases were sent, no fewer than 123 serious cases were reported by the police since the previous Assizes. In Sligo the number reported was twenty-nine; yet but one solitary case was brought to trial. At the Connaught Assizes, held in Limerick, the jurors, judiciously selected by the Crown, brought in verdicts in fourteen cases out of twenty-two, involving forty persons out of sixty-two tried. I maintain that there has been a complete failure of the system of trial by jury.<lb/>
In the South-west of Ireland it is said that there are large numbers of outrages, cruelties, and boycottings that are never
<col>42</col>
reported to the police, for the simple reason that the victims live in terror and are afraid of the consequences to themselves if they do report them. The Government, by persisting in their present idea of administration, are inflicting heavy pecuniary damage upon certain districts in Ireland. In many places heavy charges are imposed by the importation into those districts of extra police. In the county of Galway the charge for one year's extra police alone amounted to &#x00A3;8,000. In Roscommon, for the half-year ended September 30, there has been demanded &#x00A3;1,100 for the conveyance of prisoners and &#x00A3;1,808 for extra police. If the Government would only take the proper steps to put the law in force they could save all that extra cost. How can the Government expect districts to prosper when they by their obstinacy and refusal to put the law in motion burden them with heavy charges for the conveyance of prisoners and the cost of extra police?<lb/>
When Mr. Birrell was asked in the House of Commons last autumn if he would put in force the powers which the law gave him, what did he do? He banged on the box in front of him, and said "I won't." That was, I maintain, a direct intimation to every law-breaker in Ireland that he might do what he liked. Speaking in Belfast on November 22, 1907, Mr. Birrell said&#x2014;
<quote>"I say the Government has its duty to perform, and if it should be that this Government of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and myself here in Ireland found it impossible to maintain law and order in Ireland&#x2014; if we found crime and murder and outrage increasing on every side&#x2014;it would be our duty to go to Parliament, or to summon Parliament if it were not sitting, to tell it the facts of the case, to prove those facts in the face of the Irish people, and to obtain from Parliament, if it would give it to us, the extra powers sought. That state of things has not arisen yet, and please God it never may."</quote>
Will Mr. Birrell repeat that statement? When cattle-driving, intimidation, boycotting, cattle-maiming, shooting into houses and murder are going on in Ireland, it is a very serious thing for the responsible Minister when asked to put the law in motion to say "I won't." I heard yesterday, with something like amazement, the words of the noble Earl the Leader of the House when referring to this question. The noble Earl stated that&#x2014;
<quote>"To draw a comparison between then [the year 1905] and now seems to me as unreal as to draw a comparison between the state of Ireland to-day and
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0046"/>
<col>43</col>
what it was when the noble Marquess (Lord Londonderry) was there in 1887. It was then infinitely worse than it is now, though I quite admit that it does not follow from that that the noble Marquess necessarily governed Ireland worse than we do."</quote><lb/>
The noble Earl gave the whole case away. He acknowledged that in 1887 the condition of Ireland was infinitely worse than it is now. What did we then do? We passed an Act of Parliament and administered that Act, coping with most subtle cases of boycotting and intimidation; and at the close of Lord Salisbury's Government there was not a single boycotted person in Ireland. Therefore, if things are infinitely better now the noble Earl has a much easier task than we had if he would only put into use the weapon he has at hand.<lb/>
The English are a very critical people. They never hesitate to say what they think of the Government of other countries in which cruelties and outrages take place. What must other countries think of British rule in Ireland? I say that the things now going on in that country are a disgrace to our civilisation. What does the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India think of his colleague's work in Ireland? Speaking at Arbroath on October 21, 1907, on Indian lawlessness, Lord Morley said&#x2014;
<quote>"We have, somehow or other, wisely or unwisely, by a right policy or erroneous policy, got to maintain order. Disorder, whatever your ultimate policy may be&#x2014;at any rate, violent disorder&#x2014;must be put down, and that with a firm band. The maintenance of order is the foundation of anything like future progress. You would not have me see men try to set the prairie on fire without arresting the hand. You would not blame me when I see men smoking their pipes, political pipes or ordinary pipes, near powder magazines&#x2014;you would not blame me, you would not call me an arch-coercionist if I said, 'Away with the men and away with the powder.'"</quote><lb/>
And last year, in the House of Lords, in defending his policy, Lord Morley said&#x2014;
<quote>"You must protect the lives of your officers. You must protect peaceful and harmless people from the bloodstained havoc of anarchist conspiracy."</quote><lb/>
The noble Viscount himself has been twice Chief Secretary for Ireland. How does he reconcile his statements with what is now being done by Mr. Birrell in Ireland? The people of England have by the light hearted words of the Chief Secretary been blinded to the state of affairs in Ireland,
<col>44</col>
but when they throw off their apathy and call upon the Government to give an account of their stewardship, they will say to them, paraphrasing the well-known words of one of England's heroes who had been betrayed by the members of the Radical Government in 1880, "On you is the indelible disgrace of having betrayed and deserted the honest, law-abiding, and peaceful people of Ireland, and of handing them over to the tender mercies of methods of barbarism and the horrible cruelties of the United Irish League." And, in the interests of those unfortunate people, whose lives are nothing but a hell upon earth, I pray that that day may not be long postponed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF ZETLAND </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, having been officially connected with Ireland I may be pardoned if I intervene for a few moments in this debate. I think my noble friend Lord Londonderry, in the course of a very elaborate and able speech, thoroughly laid bare the malpractices which are prevalent in Ireland at this moment, and also laid bare the maladministration of the law in that country. From information which has reached me from noble friends in Ireland who are able to speak with practical knowledge on the matter, I think I may say that if Rip Van Winkle were to wake up from a dream,not of twenty years, but of three years, he would be very astonished if he endeavoured to draw a comparison between the state of things which existed in Ireland three years ago and the state of things which prevails there now.<lb/>
I confess that I share with my noble friend in front of me astonishment at what fell from the noble Earl opposite with regard to Irish affairs yesterday. If I am not mistaken, the noble Earl the Leader of the House stated, in effect, that the newspaper reports regarding outrage and crime in Ireland were greatly exaggerated for political purposes. Having heard the speech of my noble friend Lord Londonderry, and judging from information which has reached me from friends in Ireland whose lot it is to live in that country, and whose fate it is to suffer, I think it would be quite impossible to exaggerate the state of things in some parts of Ireland at the present moment. It is scarcely necessary for me to endeavour to explain what boy totting is. I am sure noble Lords from Ireland will agree with me that no more cruel invention has ever emanated from the brain of man for the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0047"/>
<col>45</col>
purpose of rendering the lives of men and women miserable and intolerable. Ireland is an agricultural country; the people in a great part of it are dependent upon agriculture for their livelihood, and nothing could cause more trouble or more loss or wound more severely those interested in agriculture than this newly-invented crime of cattle-driving.<lb/>
I often ask myself how is Ireland now being governed. I confess that I have frequently read the speeches of the Chief Secretary in the hope of gaining some useful knowledge and information with regard to the methods employed by His Majesty's Ministers for the government of the country. But the right hon. gentleman appears to me to dilate, with very great power and eloquence, on every political subject under the sun except those topics which are connected with the office over which he presides I notice that the Prime Minister stated in the House of Commons yesterday that very often these cattle-drives were the work of one or two persons. I think all of us who are interested in agriculture must know that one man and a couple of dogs can inflict very serious injury on a valuable herd of cattle. I have no doubt that cattle-driving is an exhilarating pastime for those who take part in it with so much impunity.<lb/>
Who are these people? At whose instigation do they take part in cattle-driving? Unless I am very much mistaken in my opinion of the Irish people, this crime is not the result of any ebullition of feeling on the part of the rural population in Ireland. It emanates from a treasonable conspiracy with which His Majesty's Government are either unable or unwilling to cope &#x2014;a treasonable conspiracy set in motion for the special purpose of intimidating or coercing unfortunate individuals not in a position to defend themselves but who venture to differ politically from certain parties in Ireland at this moment. I cannot help thinking that this Irish question may have a more far-reaching effect than many people imagine. News travels very quickly over the surface of the globe. We have heard of unrest in India; we have heard of difficulties in other parts of the world; and I should like to ask His Majesty's Government whether it has not occurred to them that news of this lamentable weakness displayed in the government of Ireland may travel far and
<col>46</col>
have a bad effect on that portion of the population in India not renowned for loyalty to this country.<lb/>
Lamentable as is the present condition of Ireland, I derive one solitary scrap of consolation from the present state of affairs. I venture to think that the failure of His Majesty's Government to manage the affairs of the Sister Isle and their failure to put down crime and maintain order has driven an additional nail into the coffin of Home Rule. I say this because I feel confident that when the people of Great Britain come to thoroughly understand the distressing state of affairs existing in Ireland under a Liberal Government, and draw a comparison between the state of things now and what would inevitably exist if the loyal population in Ireland were handed over to the tender mercies of the Nationalists, they will never agree to a measure of Home Rule. I hope we shall have an answer from some member of His Majesty's Government as to what steps they contemplate taking for the future government of the country in order to promote peace, contentment and prosperity.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD DENMAN</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the sweeping indictment of the policy of His Majesty's Government which has been made by two former Lords-Lieutenant of Ireland demands a reply from these Benches. For my part I regret that this duty cannot be undertaken by someone who has first-hand experience of Irish affairs. I have no such experience, and I trust that at all events my noble friends behind me will make some allowance for that fact if I fail to state the case for the Government with the force and completeness which it merits.<lb/>
First of all, I am tempted to repeat the observation which I have made in former debates of this kind, that these debates serve no very useful purpose either in this country or in Ireland. In that remark I had the support on a former occasion of such a competent authority as the noble Earl, Lord Dunraven, but I was met by the retort that it was certainly to the interest of His. Majesty's Government to evade discussion on this question. I should like to repeat that we do deprecate exaggeration, but, at the same time, it is not to our interest to evade discussion. We do court full and searching inquiry into the administration and government of Ireland, and if it should
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0048"/>
<col>47</col>
happen that these debates have the effect of informing the public of this country of the difficulties of the problems with which the Government of Ireland have to deal, we, at all events, shall make no complaint of that fact. I am obliged, in replying to the speeches which have just been made, to remind your Lordships &#x2014;it may be, after all, something in the nature of a platitude&#x2014;that it is impossible to judge Ireland by ordinary standards. The only standard of comparison which obtains with regard to Irish affairs is what has actually taken place in Ireland itself. Boycotting and intimidation are nothing new in Ireland; they have been going on for years, in spite of coercion. At present we are experiencing one of those recurring periods of disorder with which anyone who knows anything of Irish politics is tolerably familiar, though I do not admit for a moment that the state of affairs which exists at present, bad though it is, is anything like as bad as certain periods within the recollection of many of your Lordships and to which I shall presently allude.<lb/>
Roughly speaking, two-thirds of Ireland are at present peaceable; the remaining third is in a disturbed condition. Of that remaining part, two counties&#x2014;the counties of Clare and Galway&#x2014;are in a worse state than the other parts. The noble Earl the Leader of the House pointed out last night, in his answer to the criticisms of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, the cause of some, at all events, of our present troubles; and, for my part, I regret that so few noble Lords thought fit to remain behind to listen to the answers which he gave, because there are two sides to this question however imperfectly I myself may be able to present our case. The noble Earl the Leader of the House referred to the fact that the Land Act itself is largely responsible for our troubles at the present time. It is obvious that it is so, because it increased what is known as land hunger in the West, and raised up hopes of peasant proprietorship which, with regard to the West of Ireland, at any rate, have been in the main doomed to disappointment.<lb/>
I have said that I will compare the state of Ireland to-day with the condition of affairs in past years when Ireland was admittedly in a very bad condition. There are, in comparatively recent years three such periods. In the years 1880, 1881, and 1886 the Government of the day were
<col>48</col>
obliged, on three separate occasions, to come to Parliament for special legislation to suppress disorders in Ireland. Exclusive of threatening letters, in the year 1880 there were 1,250 cases of agrarian offences; in 1881, there were 2,248; in 1886, when I think the noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, was connected with the government of Ireland, there were 632; and to-day there are 343. I admit that these figures are quite serious enough, but I also contend that they do not disclose such a bad state of affairs, or anything like such a bad state of affairs, as obtained in 1886, and that they do not warrant our coming to Parliament to obtain special legislation to deal with the matter or warrant us in the application of the Crimes Act.<lb/>
I will now quote a few figures to show what steps have actually been taken to cope with the disorder in the disturbed districts. In 1908 the number of persons arrested and brought before the resident magistrate in agrarian cases has been 1,210; the number discharged has been sixty-eight, the number ordered to find bail 1,114, and the number sent to prison in default 139, while the number of extra police sent to the disturbed areas and chargeable on the local rates has been 839. In view of these figures, I think it is idle to contend that no steps have been taken by the Government to cope with the disorder.<lb/>
Then I turn to the question of cattle-driving. I will admit at once that the figures in respect of cattle-drives in the past year are very bad. I see that 680 cattle-drives were reported in the year 1908, but the Inspector-General reports that out of these cases under 100 were the work of organised crowds or of anything like organised crowds. Therefore under the Crimes Act, as noble Lords from Ireland are aware, you could only have prosecuted for unlawful assembly in something under 100 cases. In the remaining 580 cases you would have had to act in just the same manner as we have acted, even though the Crimes Act had been in force. That is a point which I think is frequently overlooked. The noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, has given some figures with regard to the Assizes. I have here some of the figures of the trials which took place for agrarian offences at this Winter Assizes. Out of the twelve cases for trial, convictions were obtained in seven; the jury disagreed in three cases, and there was an acquittal in one case. Out of ninety-three persons committed for trial
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0049"/>
<col>49</col>
forty-nine were convicted, twenty-six were acquitted, in thirteen the jury disagreed, and in one case the prisoner was discharged by order of the Judge. I do not think those are very unsatisfactory figures, after all, and you cannot say, after considering them, that the law is not being enforced in Ireland.<lb/>
Now I come to another matter with which the noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, dealt&#x2014;the dastardly outrage known as the Craughwell murder. That was, of course, a horrible occurrence, and I quite agree with every word which the noble Marquess uttered regarding it; but I think the noble Marquess was scarcely fair in taking this one occurrence and saying it was the culmination of a long series of crime in different parts of Ireland. I do not think that was quite a fair way in which to put it, and I am saved from any further trouble, I think, in arguing that point by quoting what was said by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition last night. The noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, himself alluded to the Craughwell murder as an "isolated incident." Surely that is a fairer way in which to describe it. It is an isolated incident, and it is no more fair to take it as typical of the state of Ireland than to take the Tottenham murder, in which a London police constable was killed, as evidence of lawlessness in England.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY </member>: <membercontribution>In this Craughwell case there was boycotting in the first instance, protection for the people in the second, and the murder of this policeman in the third. Therefore I say it culminated in this murder.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD DENMAN</member>: <membercontribution>I would like to ask the noble Marquess how it is possible for him, or anyone else, to say that the Craughwell murder was the result of the non-renewal of the Arms Act. I challenge any noble Lord opposite to say that that was the case. If men are really determined to commit crime no number of Arms Acts would prevent them getting weapons. The noble Marquess said, at the close of his speech, that the English people were a critical race. If I may say so with all due respect, I think that Irishmen, more especially, perhaps, those from the north of Ireland, are a hypercritical race, because one of the things which the noble Marquess found special fault with was the remark of the Chief Secretary in another place when
<col>50</col>
he was asked to apply the Crimes Act and replied "I wont." Surely those two words are innocent enough. He merely put, rather more bluntly than is usual in this House, what we have said all along, that we do not intend to apply the Crimes Act at the present time. Surely it is an exaggeration to say that lawlessness and disorder in Ireland have resulted from the use of the words "I wont" by the Chief Secretary in the other House.<lb/>
We have heard a great deal about boycotting and intimidation, and there may possibly be individual cases quoted later on in the debate&#x2014;I do not know if it will be so&#x2014;to show how bad this boycotting is. For example, there is the case of Mr. Clarke, about which a good deal has been heard in this country. I will admit at once that there is no justification or shadow of an excuse for the boycotting agitation which has been raised by some of his neighbours against Mr. Clarke. The Irish Government have done everything in their power to maintain the law, to punish the offenders, and to afford Mr. Clarke the fullest measure of protection and support. They have spared no expense in doing so, and I believe I am right in saying that Mr. Clarke has expressed himself as certainly not dissatisfied with the measures of police protection which have been afforded him, though naturally he complains, as anyone else would complain, of the boycotting to which he has been subjected. I have full details of the case, but I will not weary your Lordships with them at present.<lb/>
With regard to boycotting, I re-echo what was said by the noble Marquess, Lord Zetland, as to its being a most cruel and detestable form of crime. What renders it worse is that it is frequently accompanied by that other serious evil, intimidation. Intimidation is a crime which it is extremely difficult to detect. When it can be detected the persons guilty are at once brought to justice, but it is difficult to detect; and, judging by the light of past history, to say that you can stamp out boycotting and intimidation by coercion is to my mind on the face of it absurd. Another point dealt with last night by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition was that of old-age pensions in Ireland. It is certainly true that a considerably larger number of people in Ireland have acquired old-age pensions than the Treasury was led to expect. I may add
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0050"/>
<col>51</col>
that, after all, the Irish Office, which comes in for so much calumny at present, had very little to do with that. That is a Treasury matter, and one for which the Treasury is mainly responsible. There has been, I understand, great pressure of work in Ireland, and the first issue of old-age pensions has been complicated by the fact that there was no registration of births in Ireland prior to the year 1865. Therefore it is extremely difficult to tell exactly the age of old people, and naturally these persons do not err on the wrong side when they make a claim for a pension. The census returns have been used, but I am informed that they are inaccurate and that it is impossible to accept them as a true criterion in the matter.<lb/>
I pass from that to a more important issue&#x2014; the question of congestion, which was alluded to last night by the noble Marquess opposite. I repeat that the Land Act of 1903, in which the noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, claims that there was only one flaw, is responsible for much of our trouble at the present time. It has increased land hunger, it has tended to raise the price of land all over Ireland, and the Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commissioners have consequently been unable to acquire enough untenanted land in the West. People living on poor holdings of mountain land, on bog, or on the western seaboard, where they can only eke out the barest existence, have seen or have heard of land changing hands on a large scale in other parts of Ireland. There is the well-known case, for instance, of the Duke of Leinster's estate, where a purchase price of some three-quarters of a million was paid to a wealthy landlord, and where he received a bonus of &#x00A3;80,000 straight away for that transaction. They have heard of the operation of the Land Act, which has been to a very large degree the transference of land from well-to-do landlords to well-to-do tenants; but meantime&#x2014;and it is now nearly six years since the Land Act was passed&#x2014;one of the objects of that Act, namely, the relief of congestion, remains practically unfulfilled. Is it to be wondered at that the people in those districts are bitterly discontented? Why, my Lords, the wonder would be if that were not the case.<lb/>
It is now, I think, scarcely disputed that the problem of congestion is one that demands immediate solution. We are accused&#x2014;and I think the noble Marquess
<col>52</col>
said something of the kind himself in the course of his speech&#x2014;we are accused of giving in to agitation by the introduction of our Land Bill; and in proof of this preposterous accusation is quoted the statement of agitators who have preached cattle-driving in Ireland that the production of the Land Bill is in itself giving in to their demands. naturally agitators in Ireland, as, I presume, in every other part of the world, have to boast of what they have done and what they will do. It is part of their stock-in-trade. But I believe that in no arena outside Irish politics would such a charge he seriously made for a moment. For it is unthinkable that the policy of His Majesty's Government should be dictated by a few twopenny-halfpenny agitators in some remote corner of the West of Ireland. The truth of the matter is that a Commission was appointed, under the chairmanship of Lord Dudley, to enquire into this question of congestion so far back as the year 1906, when, as the noble Marquess has reminded us to-night, cattle-driving was unheard of. The Report of that Commission was anxiously awaited. Practically immediately on its production legislation was introduced based mainly on the Report of that Commission, which, as no doubt many of your Lordships are aware, deals with the breaking up of the grass-lands in Ireland.<lb/>
We are told that the grazing industry is bound up with the welfare of Ireland today. There are two opinions even on that point. At all events, it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the grazing industry depends on the maintenance of the prohibition in respect of the importation of Canadian cattle into this country. This Government does not intend at the present time to remove that prohibition, and, so far as I am aware, there is no likelihood of their doing so. But it is possible to imagine contingencies under which that prohibition might be removed. I will take, for instance, a possible, not, I think, a very probable, contingency of a Tariff Reform Government being in power in this country. And when I say a Tariff Reform Government I mean a Government composed of men whose purity of belief and spotlessness of character on the question of tariff reform has never been doubted &#x2014;men who, to use a familiar phrase, are whole-hoggers of a very pronounced complexion; or, if I may be even more concise, a Government with Mr. Austen Chamber-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0051"/>
<col>53</col>
lain as Prime Minister, and some strong Tariff Reformer&#x2014;I will take, for example, the noble Viscount, Lord Ridley&#x2014;as Leader of your Lordships' House. I will take it that that Government might be engaged in negotiations or in bargaining of some kind with Canada as to the removal of this prohibition on Canadian cattle; and this is not entirely out of the question, because when Sir Wilfrid Laurier was over here at the Colonial Conference he said speaking of what he called the embargo on Canadian cattle&#x2014;
<quote>"We think it a great injustice to us and one of which we have serious reason to complain, and in order to maintain the good relations now happily welded between the British Empire and Canada, I bring this matter to the serious attention of His Majesty's Government. It is a thing which ought not to be allowed. It is a slander upon our good name."</quote><lb/>
I do not wish to imply for a moment that such a Government as I have imagined would not take a broad and statesmanlike view of this question. I am quite sure they would. But they might have pressure brought on one side by Canada, and on the other by that mysterious body of men known at the Confederates. who are apparently hiding their importance, or, perhaps, I should say insignificance, behind the cloak of anonimity in order to dictate the policy which the party opposite should pursue&#x2014;they might have pressure brought upon them which it might be impossible to resist. Then do noble Lords from Ireland think that they would allow a question such as the prosperity of the cattle trade in Ireland to interfere with the goal to which they have so longed aimed? The point I wish to make is this, that the cattle trade in Ireland, after all, does not rest upon a secure basis. I do not wish to imply that on that account the industry should be interfered with in any way, if it can possibly be avoided. Opinions differ, as anyone who has studied the Report of the Dudley Commission is aware, regarding the effect on the cattle industry of reducing the size of the large grazing farms; but I think it is quite certain that it would be better to run the risk of some interference with the cattle trade in Ireland&#x2014; although I do not believe that the changes in the grazing system which are contemplated by His Majesty's Government will have that effect&#x2014;if by so doing you can solve the pressing problem of congestion in the West.<lb/>
There were one or two statements made last night by the noble Marquess, Lord
<col>54</col>
Lansdowne, to which I should like briefly to allude. I confess that to my mind the noble Marquess is a more formidable antagonist in his suaver mood than when he is delivering those blows which he knows so well how to strike. It is when he assumes an air of sweet reasonableness that he is especially to be feared, and there was one remark he made last night which filled my mind with very grave misgivings. He said he would assist the Government in any well-considered measure for the relief of congestion in Ireland. I hope he will not think me ungrateful if I say that we on this side of the House have had some experience&#x2014;rather grim experience&#x2014;of exactly what his assistance means. He and his friends assisted us&#x2014;I presume assisted is the word&#x2014;in regard to the Education Bill of 1906; they assisted us on the Evicted Tenants Act of 1907; and they have assisted us on many other measures that have come before your Lordships' House, during the last three years. I confess that when I enter into debates of this kind I have a very wholesome dread of the blows which, as I have said, the noble Marquess. knows so well how to deliver&#x2014;but Heaven protect me from his assistance. Of course, I may be wrong in this case. I may be doing the noble Marquess an injustice, but I would like to ask&#x2014; and possibly some noble Lord on the Front Opposition Bench will take notice of this question&#x2014;what advice, what tangible offer of assistance towards a solution of the problem of congestion any noble Lord opposite would like to give? I hope the noble Earl, Lord Donoughmore, will condescend to deal with that point presently.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE </member>: <membercontribution>Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD DENMAN</member>: <membercontribution>So far as I know, the only advice we have received is this. It is dinned into our ears that whatever happens we must carry on the Land Purchase Act of 1903; that is to say, we must carry on the transference of land from well-to-do-landlords to well-to-do tenants. But no, solution that I know of has been offered for the present congestion, and I maintain there can be no solution of it without breaking up the grass lands. After all, these holdings in the West of Ireland must be improved in order to be made economic. That, I think, is granted on all hands; and in order to increase the size of these holdings you must take untenanted land.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0052"/>
<col>55</col>
The untenanted land is grazing land. Therefore, to solve the problem of congestion in any degree it is absolutely necessary to break up these large grazing farms. I ask the noble Earl for his opinion on the solution of this problem as to how these grazing farms can be broken up and acquired by the State at a price which the State can afford to pay. There is only one other observation of the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, to which I wish to allude. The noble Marquess said that persons who were committed to prison in default were sent there as first-class misdemeanants.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>. <membercontribution>I said they were treated as untried prisoners.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD DENMAN</member>: <membercontribution>Yes, but that they were sent there as first-class misdemeanants.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>I forget my exact words, but I did not say they were sent as first-class misdemeanants. I said I believed their friends had access to them and that they had a very good time while under detention&#x2014;a much better time, probably, than they had in their homes.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD DENMAN</member>: <membercontribution>I accept the correction. I have never been in Galway myself, and have never had the opportunity of spending a night, much less five or six weeks, in Galway Gaol, and I do not suppose the noble Marquess has either. I wish to avoid all suspicion of exaggerated language in connection with these matters, and, therefore, I will only say that I am given to understand, on good authority, that the amenities of Galway Gaol compare unfavourably either with the Ritz or the Carlton.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member>: <membercontribution>I would point out that not one of these people would have gone to Galway Gaol if he had given surety.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD DENMAN:</member> <membercontribution>I have only one remark to offer in conclusion. It appears to be part of the policy of the Opposition at the present time to single out the Chief Secretary rather conspicuously for attack. I would like to remind the House that the Chief Secretary's colleagues are equally responsible, with himself, for the administration of Ireland, and they have no desire whatever to shirk that responsibility. In
<col>56</col>
regard to other questions in other parts of the world, you yourselves have borne tribute to the skill and courage with which the Government have dealt with problems almost as difficult as the problems which confront us in Ireland. But everything in connection with Ireland seems to be distorted and made a subject for party attack and exaggeration, and the chief reason, so far as I understand, is that we have refused to apply the Crimes Act. I might quote, in support of the Government's refusal to resort to this particular measure, authorities like Lord Dudley and my noble friend Lord MacDonnell. It is conceivable that a state of things might arise which would oblige the Government either to apply the Crimes Act, however much they might dislike it, or come to Parliament to obtain powers for a more stringent repressive measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY </member>: <membercontribution>What extra powers do you want?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD DENMAN</member>: <membercontribution>It is open to doubt whether the Crimes Act would be equal to dealing with certain contingencies that might arise in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY </member>: <membercontribution>What contingencies?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD DENMAN</member>: <membercontribution>It is possible that such a state of things might arise, although I do not think there is any likelihood of it. But I hope I have said enough to show that for the present the position is not sufficiently bad to warrant His Majesty's Government in putting the Crimes Act into force.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the noble Lord has applied himself in the speech he has just delivered to diverting attention from the topics which were clearly and fully brought before the notice of the House by my noble friend the noble Marquess. The noble Marquess unfolded his view, giving a clear, broad picture and presenting a clear issue&#x2014;whether Ireland was at present being governed at all, and whether disorder was being adequately dealt with. The noble Lord, Lord Denman, understated the agrarian statistics of last year by over 200. The number of cases for the eleven months of last year was 537. The noble Lord gave the figure as only just over 300.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0053"/>
<col>57</col>
<p><member>LORD DENMAN</member>: <membercontribution>I think the noble and learned Lord is including cases of threatening letters, which, for the purpose of comparison with the previous year, I excluded.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member>: <membercontribution>I took the figures from the Prime Minister's statement in the House of Commons. But I do not intend to involve myself in these small points. My noble friend the noble Marquess supported his statement by statistics and details, but the noble Lord has mainly passed by his charges, and has gone off into speculations as to the effect of a Tariff Reform Government, inviting us to give opinions on the importation of Canadian cattle, the application of the Old Age Pensions Act, and the congestion problem. Upon the last I will only say that the Bill on the subject which we are promised will be keenly and searchingly discussed. I am not going to be led into all the topics that have been raised. I come back to the topic introduced by my noble friend the noble Marquess.<lb/>
Last year my noble friend rightly felt it his duty to call attention to the state of Ireland; it was bad then, but it is much worse now. I do not intend to go through all the details as to how many counties are involved and the state of crime in them, but the number is a great deal too high for the credit of this country. Neither am I going to discuss the details. It is quite enough to refer to the murder of Constable Goldrick. I did not gather that the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition referred last night to that murder as an isolated incident. It is an incident which speaks trumpet-tongued of the possibilities of the lawlessness now permitted in Ireland. I do not, of course, suggest that the mere repeal of the Arms Act enabled that murder to be committed, but it is one of the circumstances to be taken into account when you come to measure the increased facilities that there are for crime. The Arms Act was in force when the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India was Chief Secretary for Ireland, and it never crossed his mind to take that useful measure off the Statute Book.<lb/>
The incident of the murder of Constable Goldrick is one that calls for the gravest and most earnest attention of the Government. This state of things is not confined to Connaught. Tipperary, an immense county with large, populous, and thriving
<col>58</col>
towns, is involved. Take the case of Mr. Clarke. That case must also be taken as symptomatic of the state of affairs which has been, I will not say tolerated, but allowed to grow up unchecked by His Majesty's Government. Mr. Clarke is a gentleman whose father and grandfather lived on the property. They have never been absentees. The present Mr. Clarke spent at least &#x00A3;1,000 a year in wages, and employed a number of men who were entirely dependent upon him for their living. He sold his property to his tenants, only retaining his demesne and residence; and because he fell under the denunciation of the United Irish League he is at the present minute boycotted by every shopkeeper in the large town of Thurles, his neighbouring town, and is compelled to get from Dublin the provisions necessary to feed himself, his family, and his workpeople. That is going on now in the great county of Tipperary under the present Government, and we are asked to forget these incidents by reference to old age pensions and the possible introduction of Canadian cattle. A County Court Judge who knows Meath and West Meath well says that the law prevailing there in many districts is the triumphant and coercive jurisdiction of the League. Those are the points to which you must apply yourselves. Those are the matters the existence of which is a disgrace to this country.<lb/>
Have any of your Lordships tried to realise what boycotting means? The life of the boycotted man is made a hell upon earth; he is cut off from all connection or intercourse with his neighbours, and is denied even the means of getting food. It is a disgrace and a scandal that these things should be going on within a few hours of London and the central Government. Is it not appalling that there are at present 840 people in Ireland who are boycotted? Are we not entitled to ask what is being done to remedy this state of affairs? The noble Earl the Leader of the House stated last night that the real explanation of the whole trouble was the Act of 1903. The Act of 1903 was not a coercion Act. It was passed by agreement between landlord and tenant; it was founded upon the voluntary principle and was regarded as a great message of peace. No tenant was forced to buy; no landlord was forced to sell. The Act has worked well. The point is that it has worked rather too fast for the amount of money
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0054"/>

available. What the noble Earl meant in attributing the present state of affairs to that Act passes my comprehension.<lb/>
The noble Earl called the Act a bribe. He said you could always keep Ireland quiet with a bribe. That was not the kind of language used by Mr. Gladstone, who never forgot to speak as a Statesman. Mr. Gladstone would say&#x2014;"Let us not be weary of well doing. Let us take care that our measure is founded upon justice&#x2014;justice to all." Would he have listened to the suggestion that Ireland could be let alone in the present state of affairs without consideration of what was just to all? Many will remember the great speeches which Mr. Gladstone made, showing that when the necessity arose for applying exceptional measures to Ireland he would not shrink from his duty. One also recalls the powerful, fearless speeches of Mr. Trevelyan when he was Chief Secretary, and of the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, declaring that, whether it was popular or unpopular, law and order should be maintained. Those are circumstances which may well be borne in mind when one considers the application of the Crimes Act. The noble Earl the Leader of the House used last night a curious expression for him. He declared that the Crimes Act was "rotten." There is one clause in the Act, enabling two resident magistrates to deal with cases of riot and unlawful assembly, which, if put into operation by the Government, would have stopped cattle-driving in a month. There are provisions in that Act for putting down intimidation and boycotting, and it cannot be said that an Act which has been found adequate to put down the crimes at which it was levelled during eighteen years is incapable of being effectually used.<lb/>
It is said that the ordinary law has been used. I am speaking in the presence of those who know what that euphuistic phrase means. It very often means nothing. It has not even the utility of being full of sound and fury. It frightens nobody. Whatever the Irish are, they are people of acute intelligence. They know that the ordinary law pivots on juries, and they know that under the ordinary law you cannot get what you are able to secure under the Crimes Act, both in regard to venues and special juries. They know you cannot use the force required in order to secure the maintenance of law and order.
<col>60</col>
Boycotting, intimidation, and terrorism are difficult things to get at, but surely it is worth while making some effort to cope with them. The Government complain that people will not come forward to give evidence. Naturally, they will not get people to imperil their lives by coming forward to give evidence when they know that that evidence is not to be used in a really honest effort to get a conviction.<lb/>
The worst sign of all that I see in Ireland at the present moment&#x2014;and I speak with some knowledge of the country&#x2014;is that the contempt for the law and government in Ireland is increasing in force. People have ceased to believe that there is any nerve or any real intention in the Government to put down crime. And once that belief exists, it is very hard indeed to get the law respected. The noble Earl the Leader of the House said that a good Government might have many crimes committed in its time and a worse Government might have fewer crimes committed. I am not going to be entrapped into this kind of excursion. Nor will I follow what was said by the noble Lord who has just spoken regarding congestion. We will deal with that when it comes before us. But Lord Denman mentioned that there had been convictions at the Winter Assizes under the ordinary law. Certainly, because there had been a change of venue and because the Attorney-General on that occasion used the power of challenge in order to ensure an independent and impartial jury.<lb/>
What is the present position of things regarding the question of arms? I do not know what the Government propose to do about that. It was always possible, of course, to get arms in Ireland, but the appalling facility with which arms can be obtained at the present time&#x2014;they can be procured by small weekly payments&#x2014;renders the commission of crimes very easy, and throughout Ireland there is spreading a feeling of profound insecurity. There is a powerful party in power, and it should be powerful enough to know how and when to be strong. What is the good of a great majority, what is the good of having in the Cabinet many very able and gifted men if the state of things described by my noble friend Lord Londonderry is allowed to exist unchecked? I am satisfied that very few men in the Cabinet can like the present condition of Ireland. I am sure the Chief Secretary himself does not like it. Then
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0055"/>
<col>61</col>
why does not Mr. Birrell take some vigorous, manly, efficient measures to cope with it? What is the good of his taking up a lofty attitude and saying "I wont " if he does not know the meaning of his words? What is the meaning of "I wont"? Does he mean&#x2014;I wont take the steps needed to stop the murder of a constable; I wont take the steps necessary to prevent the boycotting of Mr. Clarke at Tipperary, and I wont take the steps necessary to check what the County Court Judge of Meath and West Meath called the triumphant and coercive power of the Land League? If these debates do nothing else they will lead the country to understand that it is very necessary that steps should be taken to ensure that the Chief Secretary should realise, in somewhat of an adequate way, that the need of preserving law and order is the first requirement of civilisation.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE EARL OF MAYO </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, before I say anything with regard to the state of disorder in Ireland, I should like to read to the House a resolution which was unanimously adopted at a great meeting of Irish country gentlemen in Dublin the other day. The resolution runs:&#x2014;
<quote>"That we call upon our fellow-subjects in Great Britain to use their voice and influence to compel the Government to take adequate measures to put an end to the disgraceful intimidation, boycotting, and crime, which a small section of the population has been allowed to create in many parts of Ireland. That we deplore the fact that in these districts, in which order and peace prevailed two or three years ago, law-abiding people cat now no longer enjoy their civil rights or pursue their lawful business because the Government, for mere political reasons, refuse them the protection of the law."</quote><lb/>
The noble Lord who replied on behalf of the Irish Office said that these debates served no useful purpose, either in this country or in Ireland. My retort to that is that the remarks of the noble Lord, especially with regard to cattle driving, do not serve any useful purpose either, but do a great deal of mischief. Lord Denman said that Ireland was experiencing one of those recurring periods of disorder. But is that any reason why adequate measures should not be taken for dealing with the situation?<lb/>
The noble Lord admitted that one-third of the country is in a bad condition. Well, when you have a gangrene in your little finger and you do not take measures to stop it, it spreads throughout the whole body. We know what it is to have these periods of disorder, but in the past
<col>62</col>
measures have been taken to put a stop to it. The present Government, however, will do nothing; although they have the power to put in force the Crimes Act, the Chief Secretary says the Government will do nothing. There can be no question that the policy of the present Government leads to disorder in Ireland. Disciples of that policy go about this country saying that, after all, Ireland is, on the whole, very quiet, and that the state of things is greatly exaggerated by many people for party purposes. Those were the words of the noble Earl the Leader of the House. Was the murder of Constable Goldrick greatly exaggerated? Was the attack on Mr. Clarke's house greatly exaggerated? I admit that boycotting is very difficult to deal with. But what happened at Mr. Clarke's house? I will read his own statement of what occurred:&#x2014;
<quote>"On November 17 eight men were bound over to keep the peace for attempting to intimidate me. On the same evening at half-past five, the Holy-cross Land League Band, followed by a large mob, forced their way through my entrance gate, and seriously injured the policeman who tried to stop them. They then marched along my carriage-drive, passing close in front of my house, went through my yard, round my demesne and returned to the road out of my entrance gate. They threw stones at the house and broke two windows. They kicked at my hall door and threw stones at it. They also smashed a window at my Gate Lodge. The Holycross Chapel bell was rung for hours in order to assemble the crowd and bands. I am boycotted by every shop in Thurles, and have to get all my provisions from Dublin by rail. The two smiths near here have refused to shoe my horses. I am now guarded by seventy police, five of whom sleep in the house, fifty in my farmyard, and the rest in two cottages in my demesne."</quote><lb/>
The noble Lord who replied for the Irish Office said the Government had done everything in their power and had spared no expense to protect Mr. Clarke. Spared no expense, indeed! The expense falls on the county. The Treasury do not pay. It is true that the Royal Irish Constabulary are an Imperial charge, but these extra police are paid for by the ratepayers. Therefore I take very strong exception to that very definite statement by the noble Lord. I will not go into the question of Tariff Reform and the importation of Canadian cattle. That is a little humbug which does not take us in on this side of the House. I cannot help wishing that the noble Lord would go over to the other House and tell the Nationalist leaders that they are only twopenny-halfpenny agitators. I should like to witness the interview between the noble Lord and Ms. John Dillon when the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0056"/>
<col>63</col>
latter was told that he was a twopenny-halfpenny agitator of the West. It would be a delightful situation. Last night the noble Earl the Leader of the House attributed all the trouble to the Wyndham Act of 1903. He said that you can always make Ireland peaceful for a time by bribing it and that the last and greatest of all these bribes was the Irish Land Bill of 1903, which was at the time captivating the imagination of the Irish people. Personally I cannot in the least see how the Act of 1903 can be held responsible for cattle-driving, intimidation and boycotting.<lb/>
At the beginning of his speech the noble Earl the Leader of the House said the condition of Ireland depended exclusively and entirely on the state of things with which the Government's Land Bill was designed to deal. I suppose nobody has read that Land Bill more carefully than I have. What does it do? It offers to pay us in depreciated Stock. That is, after all, the essence of it. The Act of 1903 was a measure under which those who sold their land were paid in gold; and how the noble Earl can say that the state of affairs in Ireland is going to be improved because of Mr. Birrell's Bill, under which landlords are to be paid in Stock, I fail to understand. The serious offence of firing into dwellings has greatly increased. In 1906 there were twelve such cases; in 1907, there were forty-nine; and in 1908 the number went up to 121. As this debate is to be adjourned, I hope that to-morrow someone will answer, on behalf of the Government, the pertinent questions which were put by the noble Marquess who initiated the debate to-day, and which have in no case been replied to. The noble Earl the Leader of the House slid off last night, in his usual courteous manner, and said that all this trouble in Ireland was due to the 1903 Act. And today Lord Denman began talking about Tariff Reform and the importation of Canadian cattle. All this is only shirking the subject. In the meantime people are being intimidated and shot in Ireland, and cattle-driving is proceeding. I contend that cattle-driving could have been easily stopped if some of the ringleaders had been sent to prison. Mr. Ginnell happened to suggest that there should be a cattle-drive on certain land which was under the Court presided over by Mr. Justice Ross. The result was that Mr. Justice Ross declared this action to be contempt of
<col>64</col>
court, and Mr. Ginnell was sent to prison. There was then a great lull in cattle-driving, and there is no question that it could have been put a stop to altogether if vigorous action had been taken by His Majesty's Government. If I were to make a speech in Trafalgar Square urging that it would be a good thing to rob Cocks Biddulf's bank, I should be immediately marched off to Scotland Yard. Yet this kind of thing is allowed to go on in Ireland with impunity, and we are told that it is the result of the policy of the 1903 Act. I do not think that argument bears examination for one moment.<lb/>
If, however, the Government remain supine there are men in Ireland who are determined not to allow this state of things to go on for ever. I have the authority of a noble Lord from Ireland, who took his seat yesterday, to say that he is the chairman of a body of Orangemen who have organised a system of emergency men for the relief of the boycotted in the west of Ireland. These men are being armed, equipped, and fed from Belfast. They are determined not to allow that fair country to be ruined by political exigencies; and perhaps when the Government realise that these emergency-men are maintaining law and order at the point of the revolver they will wake up to the fact that this is a duty which should be discharged by the police. I do not wish it to be supposed that we are in a state of civil war in Ireland, for that is not the case; but crime and outrage are rampant there, and if there is a responsible Government at all, it is their duty to listen to the cry from Ireland of those who are in distress. Let gentlemen who live at ease in this country think of the words of the Litany which they hear every day in church, "From murder and sudden death, good Lord deliver us!" and remember that there are people in Ireland who dwell in danger and can hardly call their souls their own.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I do not think it is Unionists alone who will rejoice that the noble Marquess has raised the subject of the state of Ireland in this debate, for there must be many Nationalists who feel that the state of anarchy which now prevails in Ireland must re-act on the whole body politic, and there are others who, while they have not the courage to resist, secretly writhe under, and long to be delivered from the tyranny of the United Irish League. We have heard the usual excuses from the Govern-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0057"/>
<col>65</col>
ment in the short portion of the speech delivered by the noble Lord who represents the Irish Office which dealt with the subject which is engaging the attention of the House. The only consolation we are offered by His Majesty's Government is a constant reference to the classic story of the curate's egg. The state of parts of the country, we are told, is quite excellent. If I summon a doctor to treat me for lumbago it would be small consolation to me if he were to tell me that both my legs were perfectly sound. But, my Lords, even this simile fails to carry its lesson, for lumbago is, after all, a local ailment, whereas Ireland is suffering from a species of gangrene which is spreading, and which is bound to spread unless drastic measures are taken to stop its progress.<lb/>
Irish Unionists are often taunted that they impute to those of their countrymen who disagree with them a double dose of original sin. This is not a fair accusation, nor is it a true one. We know, perhaps, better than Englishmen, the good qualities of Irishmen, and we also recognise that they have defects. As a people they are able, courteous, and brave, but they have not those gifts of self-reliance and independence of judgment which characterise Scotsmen and Englishmen. They are much influenced by the opinion of their neighbours, and find it easier to allow their actions to be governed by a few excited and fluent demagogues, who, by working on their cupidity persuade, or, if necessary, compel them to carry out the edicts of what it now the real government of the country. There are still parts of the country, as the Government hasten to remind us&#x2014;and I am thankful to say that the county of Mayo where I live is one of them&#x2014;where people have so far resisted the pressure put upon them to join in illegal action which is so prevalent elsewhere; but the knowledge of the supineness of the Government and the pressure of the tyrants of the League make it every day more difficult for them to resist. If noble Lords want an instance of the absence of self-reliance or independence of judgment in the average Irishman, can a better one be found than at the Convention in Dublin last week, when Mr. William O'Brien, who one would think deserved at least a patient hearing in a Nationalist assembly, was howled down because he ventured to put forward a view of the land purchase question which did not recommend itself to the wire-pullers, who care very little
<col>66</col>
about land purchase but a great deal about the continuance of agitation?<lb/>
And, my Lords, if you want a still more striking case it is presented in that of Constable Goldrick, who was cruelly murdered at Craughwell. The noble Marquess who initiated this discussion referred to the almost parallel case in London&#x2014;that of the murder of Constable Tyler at Tottenham&#x2014;and called attention to the scenes which took place at the funeral of that constable. He told your Lordships that the funeral passed along streets lined with thousands of spectators anxious to show their respect for the dead; the shops were shut and the blinds drawn down;everywhere there were signs of mourning. Then, my Lords, think of the funeral of Constable Goldrick, with the black flag hoisted between a skull and cross bones, with boulders placed on the road to upset the hearse, and with not one civilian following the melancholy <i>cort&#x00E9;ge.</i> And yet I am sure there are very few people in or around Craughwell who, if you spoke to them about the crime, would not express regret at the death of the young man and disapprobation of his murder. They have not the courage to do more. But was it want of courage that dictated the attitude of His Majesty's Government with regard to the funeral? Mr. Birrell relies on what he calls the ordinary law to enforce law and order. We see with what result. Constable Goldrick is killed, a martyr to Mr. Birrell's policy. Surely the Department which by its neglect of the warnings of those who know Ireland is responsible for his death might have paid some tribute of regret to his remains.<lb/>
Your Lordships all know what was done officially in London on the occasion of the funeral of Constable Tyler. Let me read one small extract from <i>The Times</i> of January 30&#x2014;
<quote>"The procession itself was one of the most striking which has been witnessed, not merely in Tottenham, but in any part of London, both in regard to its representative character and its proportions. Its composition is sufficiently indicated when it is stated that the State sent its representative in the person of Mr. Herbert Samuel, M.P., Under-Secretary at the Home Office; that the highest police officials in the metropolis were present, and that representatives of the municipal, political, and social life of the district found a place in it. Some idea of its dimensions may be gathered from the statement that at least 2,500 uniformed police officers followed the mourning carriages, that hundreds of others associated with
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0058"/>
<col>67</col>
State and local services joined in this homage to a gallant officer, that its length measured considerably over a mile, and that it occupied twenty-five minutes in passing a given point. &#x2026; It can be most appropriately mentioned here that the bands of the N, A, Y, H, and K Divisions of the Metropolitan Police, and that of the City Police also, formed part of the procession."</quote><lb/>
Now let me read a short extract from the Irish <i> Daily Express</i> of January 25 concerning the funeral of Constable Gold-rick:&#x2014;
<quote>"Some relatives of the deceased constable yesterday afternoon arrived in Craughwell, and the remains were taken in a hearse from the village. Not a single local civilian attended the funeral along with the police, some of whom carried wreaths. Four police cars and the hearse travelling across the country side were a mournful sight. The cottagers even ignored the passing procession; to such length is bitterness of feeling carried."</quote><lb/>
I can conceive the explanation which His Majesty's Government will give as to why a large number of constabulary were not present at the funeral. To such a state has the country been reduced by the misrule of Mr. Birrell that if the police had been withdrawn to pay the last tribute of respect to their comrade more outrages and more murders might probably have taken place. But this does not explain why the band of the Royal Irish Constabulary was not sent, and, above all, it does not explain why there was no representative of the Irish Office present at the funeral.<lb/>
The Chief Secretary told us the other day that he preferred men to cattle. My Lords, was not Constable Goldrick a man, aye, every inch of him? Why could not my noble friend who replies for the Irish Office in this House with that cheery optimism which only his ignorance of the country can explain have attended the funeral? We know perfectly well that he regards the driving of cattle into bog holes as reprehensible in the same sense that we regard a bull fight as reprehensible, which, however, does not prevent the majority of us from attending a bull fight when in Spain. The noble Lord has told us that he feels as acutely as anyone this atrocious murder, and I cannot help thinking that if he had followed that hearse through the wilds of Galway and had marked the condition to which the people have been reduced by the tyranny of the League we should have less of his cheery optimism in future. I do not know whether Mr. Birrell will call me a carrion
<col>68</col>
crow because I denounce the murderers of Constable Goldrick even if they are Irish, and reserve my meed of praise for the dead man, who was not only an Irishman but a hero. I have dwelt at some length on this, for it seems to me to exemplify very clearly the attitude which Mr. Birrell takes up. I do not say that he sympathises with crime, but I think his point of view is distinctly sympathetic to the criminal. He tries in every way to find an excuse for his action, and, on the other hand, does not support those who, through good report and evil report, in spite of unpopularity, in spite of threats, in spite of boycotting, in spite of outrage and fears of murder, try to do their duty and to carry out the law.<lb/>
We hear constantly that the police are getting demoralised and discouraged by the knowledge that they are not supported by the Government and that the Government do not wish active measures to be taken to bring an end to the state of things which now disgraces many parts of Ireland. The Chief Secretary has little or no sympathy with those who try to enforce the law; he is ever inclined to make excuses for those who break it; he claims and exercises dispensing powers, and because he is of opinion that Home Rule should be granted to Ireland he will not take any steps to protect the lives or the properties of His Majesty's loyal subjects in Ireland. It is a commonplace that the first duty of a Government is to enforce law and order; the next duty is to remove grievances, and we find Mr. Birrell preparing to perform this portion of his duty. A little more than five years ago a Bill was passed, with the consent of both great parties in the State, which was to effect a revolution in Ireland, but it was a peaceful revolution, and the only complaint that is made of it is that it has been too successful. It was mentioned at the time that it would take fifteen years to carry it into effect, but so successful has been this Act that, if sufficient money could be forthcoming, effect could be given to it in ten years.<lb/>
But what does Mr. Birrell do? He stops the action of that Act and brings in a new Bill. I should, of course, be out of order if I discussed the provisions of that Bill, but I suppose I may say that it absolutely does away with all the conditions which made the Act of 1903 a success, that it is a highly contentious measure which has no
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0059"/>
<col>69</col>
chance of being passed, as was the existing Act, with the consent of Unionists and Nationalists alike. And in the meantime Mr. Birrell has stopped all purchase from proceeding by reducing the bonus from twelve to three per cent. My Lords, this is what we specially complain of in the Chief Secretary. He claims a dispensing power. He does not seem to think that it is his duty to administer the law as Parliament has enacted it. He claims to sift it and reject such portions as do not agree with his views. Many of Mr. Birrell's <i>obiter dicta</i> are remembered. We do not forget that when he was asked whether he would put the Crimes Act into force he answered "I wont." Perish Ireland rather than Mr. Birrell should not be allowed to have his own way about everything, like a wilful child! He says, in effect, "I think you ought to give the Irish Home Rule, and as you have not done so I wont protect life and property over there. I think landlords should be compelled to sell their lands at any price the purchaser may be willing to give for them, and I wont allow any sales to take place until I have starved them into consent." How long, my Lords, is this to continue? Judging by the very small amount of time which Mr. Birrell spends in Ireland I cannot believe that he would have much objection to transferring his energies to some other Department of the Government where he could indulge his theories with the knowledge that even if unsuccessful they would only ruin a Department and not a country; and every

Irishman would be grateful if then were sent to us a Statesman like the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India, who would administer the law as it exists and not as he would wish it to be.<lb/>

<title>THE KING'S SPEECH.&#x2014;ADJOURNED DEBATE.</title>
<p>Order of the Day read for resuming the adjourned Debate on the Motion for an humble Address.</p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, in continuing this debate upon the subject raised by the noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, I have no desire to enter at any great length into the issue, but only to offer a few observations. I do so for this reason. Hitherto the only noble Lords who have taken part in the debate have been themselves either resident in Ireland or intimate with its circumstances and conditions, who have spoken from the Irish point of view. The noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, in the address which he delivered, dwelt upon the circumstance that he was not sure how far the people of this country realised the truth about the conditions of things in Ireland. Speaking for myself, and I am perfectly certain for a great many others, I can say that there is a growing and widespread indignation among the people of this country at the condition of affairs allowed to continue in Ireland.<lb/>
I fully realise that the people of this country have practically always had the Irish question before them. We have been accustomed to statements and contradictions on both sides of the Irish controversy over a long series of years, and those concerned with Ireland on both sides have thrown a certain amount of poetic glamour over their statements which has sometimes left the ordinary English hearer a little bewildered. But what we observe about the present condition of affairs is, that now the statements made by those who have intimate know-
<col>72</col>
ledge of Ireland are without contradiction. Even His Majesty's Government do not substantially contradict any of the allegations that are made as regards the state of affairs in Ireland. We are confronted, not merely by statements of agitators or by men in the heat of conflict, but by grave and impartial statements by His Majesty's Judges; by the definite statement of the Prime Minister that condemnable actions are taking place in certain parts of Ireland, and by the admission of the noble Lord who has in this debate spoken for the Government, that one-third of Ireland is in a disturbed condition. Therefore, English people will take note that this seriously disturbed state of Ireland is not merely an allegation but a fact, admitted by everybody who has any knowledge of the country.<lb/>
In view of these circumstances, and in view, I might also say, of all the admissions that have been made by the representatives of the Government, His Majesty's Government are perfectly silent with regard to what they propose to do to put an end to an admitted and rapidly growing evil. Instead of being told what His Majesty's Government propose to do, we are told by one representative that they deprecate what they term exaggeration for political purposes. I ask the House to note that if His Majesty's Government admit exaggeration, they have first to admit the fact which is behind the exaggeration. His Majesty's Government, in talking of exaggeration, admit the fact that a grievous case exists which can be exaggerated. But if there has been exaggeration&#x2014;and I am not concerned to say that people who go about in fear of their lives may not possibly at moments have exaggerated the danger to which they are subjected&#x2014;if there has been exaggeration by a few people, it has not been by His Majesty's Judges, or His Majesty's Government would not admit the grievous state of Ireland. Whatever exaggeration there may have been on the part of people possibly in danger of their lives, that exaggeration is a far less serious thing on their part than the extenuation for political purposes of the circumstances which are now taking place in Ireland.<lb/>
There is no mention in His Majesty's gracious Speech of what the Government intend to do. We have no statement from the Prime Minister of what he proposes to do. So far as we have read what
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0061"/>
<col>73</col>
he said, he has only referred to other times when the state of Ireland was more troublesome. He takes consolation in the fact that, though there is evil now, it is not so great as at another period of Irish history&#x2014;a period, the House may note, coinciding with a period of Liberal administration. The state of Ireland twenty-one years ago was remedied by the application of measures that are not now resorted to. The noble Earl the Leader of the House, instead of telling us what the Government propose to do, busied himself with analysing the causes which, in his opinion, led to this state of affairs, and he found them very largely in the Land Act, passed by the last Government. I am not concerned now to dispute how far that measure did, or did not, contribute to the present state of affairs. Whatever may be the causes, an analysis of them does not take you very far towards the remedy. What His Majesty's Government are being asked now is to put an end to the present state of affairs, and not discuss why it has arisen.<lb/>
The noble Lord who spoke yesterday on behalf of the Irish Office, began his speech by expressing regret that he knew nothing about Ireland&#x2014;a regret which I am quite certain the whole House will share. I venture to think, without any personal reflection upon the noble Lord himself, that when questions of this grave importance are at stake, His Majesty's Government might well consider the propriety of having in this House some representative with an intimate and close acquaintance with the affairs of Ireland, who might be supposed to speak with some knowledge of those affairs in this House. The noble Lord's defence is that His Majesty's Government spared no expense in dealing with the present situation, and that there are no fewer than 839 more police. But the whole head and front of the accusation against the Government is that they have brought about a state of affairs which has necessitated this expense and these additional police. We have been given no hint of any measures to be taken to put an end to the present state of affairs. The noble Lord, after devoting a few remarks to what he conceived to be the situation, made an interesting and able speech on a great variety of other topics&#x2014;on old age pensions, congested districts, and other important subjects&#x2014;which, however, have nothing whatever to do with the maintenance of
<col>74</col>
law and order in Ireland; and he concluded his speech by a pleasant hypothesis as to what may happen when a Unionist Government comes into power&#x2014;an event which, I was glad to notice, he seemed to contemplate at no distant future. But what has that pleasant ,speculation got to do with the subject? I do not propose to follow the noble Lord into his speculations. His Government are charged with neglecting the maintenance of law and order in Ireland, and he is pleased to make jokes about a possible future.<lb/>
Whatever may be in the future, I cannot conceive any Unionist Government which would extenuate, for party or other purposes, the state of things existing in Ireland; and under no possible combination of circumstances can I conceive a Unionist Government in alliance, open or covert, with the forces that make for disorder in Ireland. The Unionist Party came together on its present basis in order to maintain the Union in Ireland. It has now cast upon it the greater and larger duty of cementing the Union between England and her self-governing Colonies. It would be an ill beginning for such a programme, an unhappy augury, to assent to any measure which could possibly weaken the Union between England and Ireland. The party which is responsible now for the disorder in our national finances is also responsible for disorder in Ireland, which they have taken no adequate measures to suppress; and there is a strong feeling in this country that the remedy the Government have at hand should be put in force at once.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have on more than one occasion deprecated these discussions in this House, and for two reasons. First of all, I have thought they might do positive harm by acting as a gratuitous advertisement to those persons in Ireland not inaptly described by Lord Denman last night as twopenny-halfpenny agitators. In the second place, I did not see that these discussions were likely to do any good. I have also said that exaggerated statements had been made, and made for party purposes, as to the condition of disorder in Ireland. I can no longer say that a discussion of this kind can do any harm by acting as an advertisement to the village tyrants and the twopenny-halfpenny agitators in Ireland. They have established their tyranny so completely, their rule is
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0062"/>
<col>75</col>
so fixed in the country, that they no longer require any advertisement, and I can no longer raise that plea against full discussion of the state of Ireland in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I have said also that exaggerated statements have been made. I can no longer say that. It is impossible for me to pretend that the facts that were put forward yesterday in this debate contain any element whatever of exaggeration. I feel constrained, therefore, to add my mite to this debate, in the hope, though I fear it may be a vain hope, of impressing upon His Majesty's Government the terrible injury that their policy of inaction is doing to Ireland. I frankly admit it gives me no pleasure to do so. I have been strong in sympathy with the views of His Majesty's Government in other directions with regard to Ireland; I sympathised strongly with their efforts to give Ireland a larger measure of self-government in their Council Bill; but I feel myself bound to endeavour, to the best of my ability, to show His Majesty's Government the terrible consequences which the policy of inaction they pursue will have upon the country which I believe they honestly, though very ignorantly, desire to serve.<lb/>
I hope I shall not be understood as not feeling sufficient sympathy with those who have suffered so terribly in Ireland from boycotting and from other outrages when I say that what I protest mainly against is the strong contempt for the law which has been engendered in Ireland. I do not know whether boycotting should be considered as a more or less jocular thing or not; but, if that is the correct expression that the noble Lord opposite used, I admit that there is some foundation for it. People in Ireland simply laugh at His Majesty's Government, and, although these cattle-drives originated to a very large extent from personal spite and the worse kind of land-grabbing, I am quite sure that in many of them there has been a certain element of spree. They like to see how far they can defy His Majesty's Government. They are like a pack of naughty children, not naughty altogether from vice, but from exuberance of spirits, who want to see how far they can defy the rule of a weak and rather imbecile governess. Of course, I understand and realise thoroughly the difficulty. It is a lamentable fact that in Ireland there is not that
<col>76</col>
universal respect for the law such as exists in England. I have long ago come to the conclusion that that universal respect for the law will never arise in Ireland until it is given much larger powers of self-government than it possesses now, and the people feel the responsibility of supporting an executive and legislation which emanates from centres in Ireland. That I believe to be so, and that opinion is shared by His Majesty's Government. But that does not in any way exonerate His Majesty's Government from the duty of maintaining law and order under the circumstances which now exist.<lb/>
His Majesty's Government are raising great difficulties for themselves. That, however, is their affair. Perhaps it is immaterial to them. But they are raising also great difficulties for their successors. They may not think much of that. But Ireland some day will obtain the self-governing powers which the people of that country desire, and the Government by allowing the law to fall into utter contempt in Ireland, are leaving a legacy of enormous difficulty for those who will have to administer the country in the different circumstances of that time. I remember when my noble friend opposite, Lord MacDonnell, was considering whether he would accept office in 1902. I remember very well the correspondence which took place between him and Mr. George Wyndham. They had a programme for the betterment of Ireland which it is a great pity they had not a fair opportunity of carrying out. What was the first item in the improvements that Sir Antony MacDonnell, as he then was, set out? The first item was the maintenance of law and order. It may be impossible to create in Ireland, as at present circumstanced, affection for the law, but, at any rate, it is in the power of the Government, and ought to be their duty, to see that the law is respected. National character does not change so rapidly, and I think the national character of Ireland was well described some centuries ago by a very eminent man, who, speaking of the Irish people at that time, said:&#x2014;
<quote>"There are no people under the sun that love equal and indifferent justice better than the Irish and will rest better satisfied with the execution thereof, although it be against themselves, so as they may have the protection and benefit of the law."</quote><lb/>
That is true of the Irish people now. Are His Majesty's Government protecting
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0063"/>
<col>77</col>
the people? Are they giving them the benefit of just laws? They are not. They are not defending the people in the enjoyment of their liberties, their property, and their rights.<lb/>
The noble Earl the Leader of the House has added very much to the interest of this debate by evolving a totally new theory, namely, that one ought not to do right lest by any possibility wrong might ensue. He told us that the condition of affairs in Ireland was due to the Land Act of 1903. He said that the state of things in some counties of Ireland directly, in his judgment, arose out of the Irish Land Act, which he described as "the unfortunate fruit of an otherwise noble tree." The noble Earl went on to say:&#x2014;
<quote>"If you establish a peasant proprietary, it may be a wise or foolish thing to do, but if you tell by your legislation every Irish peasant that the object at which he ought to aim is to become a peasant proprietor, you excite a new form of that land hunger which has always existed in Ireland. That is exactly what has happened."</quote><lb/>
The noble Earl spoke of the Act of 1903 as a bribe, and said&#x2014;
<quote>"You can always make Ireland peaceful for a time by bribing it, and the last and greatest of all these bribes was the Irish Land Act of 1903."</quote><lb/>
I do not for a moment suppose that the noble Earl meant to use the expression "bribe " in any offensive way, but it certainly is an offensive expression, and I for one entirely protest against it as applied to Ireland. Of all people, the Irish people are least open to be bribed. I have never heard old age pensions or the Small Holdings Act spoken of as a bribe, though I can conceive it might be argued that old age pensions are distinctly in the nature of a bribe. It is, however, impossible that the Irish Land Act of 1903 can be looked upon in any such light.<lb/>
What was the Act of 1903 aimed at? It was aimed at doing away with a system of dual ownership which all parties agreed ought to be done away with as being absolutely ruinous to Ireland. The Act was founded upon recommendations made by representatives of the tenants and representatives of the landlords. Those recommendations and terms were accepted as fair by the Irish Parliamentary parties, by the National Convention, and by every county council and district council. They were accepted as fair by both the great
<col>78</col>
parties in Parliament and became law with the acclamation of both Houses. It was a great and statesmanlike measure for a definite purpose&#x2014;to do away with a system of land tenure which was ruinous to Ireland, and to substitute a system of peasant proprietorship. It is absolutely impossible to say that a measure of that kind had anything in it whatever of the nature of a bribe. What possible connection can the disorder which now exists in Ireland have with the Act of 1903? It is indirectly connected in this way. The Act of 1903 brought peace to Ireland; wherever that Act has operated largely the people are contented and the district is peaceful, and that is a state of things which does not appeal to the forces of disorder in Ireland, with which, I am sorry to say, His Majesty's Government appear anxious to ally themselves.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Denman, fell into precisely the same error in attributing the unfortunate condition of things in Ireland to the Act of 1903. Of course, he brought in the case of the Leinster Estate and the enormous bonus. I would like to mention why it was that these large estates came into the operation of the Act, because it seemed to me that Lord Denman rather attributed it to some action on the part of Irish landlords or the Unionist party. I remember those circumstances very well, though I daresay, very naturally, many noble Lords in this House have forgotten them. I remember perfectly well that in the Bill of 1903, as introduced, the bonus was to be given in inverse ratio to the value of the estates. That was objected to, and by whom? By the Irish Parliamentary party. Mr. Redmond, speaking for them, strongly protested against it, and said the effect would be to keep large estates out of the market. He urged that public opinion in Ireland was very strongly opposed to that, and, as a result, the Bill was altered and larger advances allowed to be made. Lord Denman accused the Act of 1903 of causing difficulty in dealing with congestion. I do not quite know why the question of congestion was brought in, but as it was introduced I should like to say a word or two upon it.<lb/>
The noble Lord said the effect of the Act of 1903 had been to increase land hunger. He told us that the Estates Commissioners were unable to acquire
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0064"/>
<col>79</col>
untenanted land in the west. He told us that poor people living on small holdings and having heard of land transfer were naturally discontented that congestion was not relieved; and he added that he would risk injury to the cattle trade if he could remove congestion. Finally, he asked how holdings in the west could be enlarged without dividing untenanted land. So far as I am concerned, I quite admit that congestion cannot be relieved without getting possession of untenanted land. But the noble Lord is under a complete delusion in these matters. He may search in vain for any expression on the part of the Estates Commissioners which justifies him in saying that they cannot get untenanted land. He will find that the Estates Commissioners complain that people are too impatient, that they will not give them time; he will find that they complain that they have not sufficient money or staff; but he will not find them complaining that they have not sufficient land offered them.<lb/>
My noble friend is quite mistaken in supposing that there is any agitation among the small proprietors in the west. There is nothing to prevent these small proprietors obtaining the freeholds of their property, except one thing&#x2014;His Majesty's Government will not find the money. If you will allow the Land Purchase Act of 1903 to go on, the peasant proprietors in the west can obtain the fee simple in their farms just the same as the peasant proprietors elsewhere. The agitation is on the part of men who are not tenants, who are not occupiers, men who, not having land, desire to get land&#x2014;pure land-grabbers. They want to get hold of the untenanted land which, as the noble Lord has admitted, is absolutely necessary to relieve congestion; and in doing anything to assist these landless men to get hold of the untenanted land and grass land you are making the relief of congestion impossible. That is one of the principal grounds of objection I have to the legislation which His Majesty's Government introduced last session, and which we are told is to be introduced again. Lord Denman complains that under the Act of 1903 not much has been done for the relief of congestion. I am quite ready to admit it, but the legislation of His Majesty's Government would make it absolutely impossible to do anything at all for the relief of congestion, because the use of untenanted land for this purpose is abso-
<col>80</col>
lutely essential, and every acre of it that the landless men are allowed to take makes it more difficult to do anything really to relieve congestion. As to the great question of breaking up the grass lands I do not propose to say anything. The noble Earl the Leader of the House admitted the other night that he did not know whether breaking up this land would be economically wrong. He thought it might be economically wrong, but at the same time he appears to be quite willing that it should be broken up as a sop to the elements of disorder.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>Not at all. The noble Earl has entirely mistaken the line of my argument. What I said was that out of the Land Act of 1903 had arisen this demand of what he calls the landless men for the grass lands. I expressed no opinion as to the desirability of breaking them up.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN </member>: <membercontribution>The noble Earl distinctly said he was not sure whether it was economically sound to do so. My impression of the general line of his argument was that this disorder, which by some extraordinary means the noble Earl seems to regard as a sort of outcome of the Act of 1903&#x2014;that this disorder was for the breaking up of grass lands, and I understood him to imply that the breaking up of grass lands was not considered undesirable by His Majesty's Government. As a matter of fact, they do connive at it in the legislation which they are bringing forward. That does appear to me to be in the nature of a bribe. You are permitting men to break up grass lands and become possessed of them, although you admit yourselves that allowing them to do so may be economically unsound.<lb/>
I am glad, at any rate, for one thing, that this debate has cleared up a great mystery. The Act of 1903, as everyone knows, has been an enormous success; some &#x00A3;80,000,000 worth of property has been transferred from the owners to the occupiers under it, without, practically speaking, the smallest difficulty or friction. I think I should be safe in saying that in no instance in any other country has so great a revolution been effected with so little difficulty. That beneficent Act is now to be put an end to. Up to the night before last I was puzzled to discover what possible reason His Majesty's Government could have for introducing
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0065"/>
<col>81</col>
legislation which they must know would put a complete stop to the operation of the Act of 1903, and with it land purchase. Now I begin to understand. Their line of reasoning appears to be this. The Act of 1903 has given rise to a description of land hunger and disorder which they are incapable of putting down, or, at any rate, unwilling to put down. As that disorder arises from the Act of 1903, that Act, and with it land purchase, is to be put a stop to. In addition to that, the relief of congestion cannot be gone on with. I only hope that the tenants in Ireland who have not yet bought their holdings but who wish to buy them, and also the unfortunate people in the congested districts in the west, will clearly understand that the reason why congestion is not to be relieved and why land purchase is not to go on is that His Majesty's Government are incapable, or unwilling, to deal with the existing agitation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD </member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in listening yesterday to the speeches from the other side of the House it occurred to me that noble Lords failed to deal with the important case before them with the breadth of treatment which it required, and in listening to the noble Lord who resumed the discussion to-day I was confirmed in that impression, because, confessing that he himself knew nothing about Ireland, he proceeded to give opinions which I venture to say were of a negative quality and added nothing to your Lordships' knowledge of the subject. I fear, my Lords, that if in this state of the discussion you are called upon to come to a decision, the objects which I, speaking as an independent member of this House but with some special knowledge of Ireland, have at heart will seriously suffer. I therefore desire to treat the subject in a wider manner, not to restrict my consideration of it to the events of the last year, but to consider the circumstances and conditions of Ireland from the time that I became myself connected with it.<lb/>
I would ask your Lordships to travel with me in your minds back to the beginning of this century&#x2014;not so many years ago. The late Government assumed office at the end of November, 1900, and Mr. Wyndham took over the duties of Chief Secretary for Ireland. During 1901 he was given that respite which is allowed to Chief Secretaries in order that they may make the usual promises, and in 1902 he was called upon to fulfil some of those
<col>82</col>
promises. In fulfilment of a promise he introduced the Land Purchase Bill, which met with a very unfavourable reception in another place. The Bill was not without its good points&#x2014;everything that Mr. Wyndham produced had its good points&#x2014;and its rejection led to the renewal of disorder in Ireland, and the introduction and enforcement of coercive measures were followed in the usual way by the imprisonment of the representatives of the people. The clouds that darkened the Irish political sky were gathering apace, and all parties in Ireland, frightened at the prospect before them, took counsel together, and the result was the Land Conference. I think a deep debt of gratitude was due and is due by Ireland and by England to the gentlemen who, at the risk of great odium, and taking upon themselves a great responsibility, did come together on that occasion and discuss with each other the means whereby the evils threatening the country might be prevented.<lb/>
The result of the Land Conference, as you know, was the Act of 1903. The effect of that Act in Ireland was magical. A spirit of hope and of mutual trust was produced in the country such as, within the memory of old men then alive, had never been known before. It was an Act which was acceptable to the Irish tenantry. The fact that within the short period of four years more than half the land of Ireland had been sold is the best proof that can be cited of the popularity of the Act amongst the tenantry of Ireland. There were persistent attempts, from the very outset, to interrupt the working of the Act&#x2014;attempts which came, not from the friends of Ireland or of England, but from the enemies of both. Still, the good sense of the country was satisfied that the Act was working well. Statements were made with the object of producing discontent amongst the people, but the answer was given in an increased number of agreements perfected and in the smooth and easy working of the Act so far as the means available permitted that to be secured.<lb/>
The year 1904 passed over in the same way, with hope and growing confidence in all classes of the people. A great deal of that was due to the manner in which Mr. Wyndham worked the Act. I was most intimately associated with him, and I know that all his great abilities were directed towards anticipating any defects
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0066"/>
<col>83</col>
which the working of the Act might produce and towards finding fitting remedies for them. Towards the beginning of 1905 circumstances occurred which severed Mr. Wyndham's connection with Ireland. Those circumstances were injurious to the best interests of Ireland, and they created in the minds of the Irish people the same effect that they created in my mind&#x2014;a feeling of the strongest regret. The result was that the working of the Act in 1905 became less smooth than hitherto. Previously the spirit which actuated the administrators of the Act was one of conciliation wherever difficulties arose between landlord and tenant. That, to my own knowledge, was effective in preventing serious conflicts, not only in the West of Ireland, but in other counties also. In 1905 a different spirit prevailed. The spirit of reconciliation was frowned upon, parties were allowed to remain aloof, and the result was a growing feeling of friction on both sides. This is not the occasion to consider what were the reasons which led to that state of affairs.<lb/>
At the end of 1905 the present Government came into office. In his speech in the debate on the Address the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition said&#x2014;
<quote>"We know, to begin with, that we hold your receipt when you took office for an Ireland which the then Chief Secretary described as more peaceful than it had been since the time of Strongbow."</quote><lb/>
The noble Marquess was misinformed as to the facts. That certificate, or that receipt, was given, not when the Liberal Government took over the charge of Ireland from the Unionist Government, but when the Liberal Government had been some seventeen months administering Ireland. It was a certificate given by Mr. Birrell to Mr. Bryce. If Mr. Bryce had been called upon to give a certificate, the terms of the document would have been of an entirely different kind. Mr. Birrell, speaking on April 26, 1907, said&#x2014;
<quote>"You may take my word for this, that Ireland is at the moment in a more peaceful condition than she has been for the last 600 years; the general condition of Ireland is peaceful, and her people are quite hopeful and expectant."</quote><lb/>
The people of Ireland were hopeful and expectant at the time that certificate was given. I do not think that in the whole history of the connection of Ireland and England a more peaceable year than 1906
<col>84</col>
is to be found. The country was expectant, the administration of the Act was smooth, but it was foreseen that the difficulties connected with congestion would call for very serious treatment, and early in that year Mr. Bryce, then Chief Secretary, appointed the Royal Commission over which Lord Dudley presided. The proceedings of that Commission were unexpectedly prolonged. The hope was entertained that it might be able to report early so that legislation might be undertaken. The inquiries, however, were so intricate that great delay was necessary, and during that time circumstances in the West of Ireland led people to entertain the belief that the relief of congestion was not a serious object with His Majesty's Government. When the Council Bill failed and it was necessary for the political party which encompassed its failure to take "virile steps "in order to bring the Government to what they considered the proper conception of its duty, advantage was taken of the state of the western districts and of the difficulties relating to the grass lands, which was, in fact, the only vulnerable point then open to them with regard to the government of Ireland. That agitation has gone on up to the present time, and it is a question whether the Government are not blameworthy in not having taken steps to put an end to it.<lb/>
The agitation is due, in my opinion, to two causes. It is due, in the first place, to the bulk of the tenants of the congested districts being anxious that the advantages conferred upon other parts of Ireland under the Land Purchase Act should not be kept longer from them; and it is due, secondly, to the agitators playing upon that state of the public mind in the congested districts. I think that, having regard to the feelings of the people, the policy of the Government in treating them with patience and endeavouring to bring them to reason without the enforcement of the Crimes Act was, in the circumstances, the proper and the correct one. But, if I am asked to say what my opinion is in regard to the agitators, I should say that if the same circumstances were to occur again I would give them short shrift. As matters stand now, we are at a critical stage in the agrarian troubles of Ireland. More than half of the land of the country has been sold, although it has not all been paid for. There remains some &#x00A3;70,000,000 to &#x00A3;80,000,000 worth of
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0067"/>
<col>85</col>
land which has yet to be sold. It seems to me&#x2014;and in this I concur with my noble friend Lord Dunraven&#x2014;a great pity that the procedure which has served so well in the past should be seriously or materially altered in regard to the balance of the land to be sold. The only provisions of the Act of 1903 which seem to call for modification are those which throw upon the ratepayers of Ireland the cost of flotation of Stock, and which deal with the provision of money and the relief of congestion. To change the fundamental principles of the Act of 1903, to throw the whole of Ireland, or that part of Ireland which remains unsold, again into the melting-pot seems to be lamentable. The provision of funds for the balance of the money ought not to be beyond the competency of the Treasury, if it is really anxious to bring the Irish difficulty to its conclusion.<lb/>
Speaking as an Imperial Irishman, for that is my political faith, I do not see why the Government should not say that, having put its hand to the plough, it will continue to the end of the furrow. If the Government were to take over the entire responsibility for the payment of the loss on flotation and for the payment of an additional bonus, it would, according to my calculation, cost no more than &#x00A3;500,000 a year for sixty-eight years, and if that conclusion were come to there is very little doubt that at least half of that sum could be saved within the near future by economies in the government of Ireland. Even if the proposals in last year's Bill are pressed, I still look forward, with a little more concession from the Government with regard to the bonus, to the completion of land purchase within ten or fifteen years. That is a great Imperial object to be gained, for, land purchase once finished, the great leverage which disaffection in and out of Ireland now has will have disappeared, and you will be able to count upon a strong body of opinion in Ireland which will be as proud of its connection with the Empire as most of those Irishmen who have taken part in the administration of the Empire truly are.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ATKINSON </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I desired to be an interested listener to this debate, but owing to two statements made by the noble Earl the Leader of the House I think it would not be right of me to withhold
<col>86</col>
from your Lord ships some information which my long official connection with the Government of Ireland has enabled me to obtain and which has a direct bearing on the two propositions laid down by the noble Earl. I had not the good fortune to be present when he made his speech, and I was occupied with other matters so fully that I did not read it until last night. The noble Earl said:&#x2014;
<quote>"The very reason we do not apply the Crimes Act is that we believe it is a rotten weapon. As regards intimidation, I have always held the view that well-organised intimidation cannot be checked by law. I know no method of checking it by the application of the most drastic coercion. That may be an unhappy admission for a Government to make, but I believe that what I say will be confirmed by everyone who has had to do with the Government at Dublin Castle."</quote>
I read that statement with such absolute amazement that I began to think had not correctly comprehended the meaning which the noble Earl desired to convey. If he means that in the case of some deep-rooted cause of discontent which has its origin in the unhappy past of Ireland the Crimes Act, as regards a permanent cure, is a rotten instrument, he is perfectly right. No person ever claimed such a virtue for the Crimes Act. But precisely the same objection might be made to the law against homicide or arson. The law is no remedy for discontent. But if agrarian troubles unhappily lead to crimes of a serious character, are you to say that the criminals who are guilty of them are not to be brought to justice because they have been led to commit the crimes through some deep-seated grievance which has not been redressed? If, on the contrary, the noble Earl meant that the Crimes Act is not an effective instrument in the case of widely-extended agrarian crime in bringing criminals to justice, then I say that, so far as my experience goes, the noble Earl is utterly and absolutely mistaken.<lb/>
What is the history of the Crimes Act? The Crimes Act, from the date of its passing in 1887 until 1905, has never been tried without proving conspicuously effective in checking disorder and in successfully grappling with crime. I make that statement on the authority of those who have been charged with its administration. The noble Lord, Lord Denman, said you could not deal with intimidation under the Crimes Act. The most effective, subtle, and all-pervading and successful form of intimidation
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0068"/>
<col>87</col>
is that of boycotting. Mr. Gladstone, in bringing in the Act of 1882, the seventh section of which is identical with the second section of the Crimes Act of 1887, under which boycotting prosecutions are instituted, said:&#x2014;
<quote>"What is meant by boycotting? In the first place, it is combined intimidation. In the second place, it is combined intimidation used for the purpose of destroying personal liberty and choice by fear of ruin and starvation."</quote>
Has the Crimes Act been a success in dealing with boycotting? When the Act of 1882 was passed the crime was committed at the rate of 404 cases per week. In a few months it had fallen to 201 per week, and in three years it had practically disappeared. On August 31, 1887, there were 4,556 cases of boycotting; in December, only three months afterwards, they had diminished to 2,400; in the following year they numbered 712; and in 1901 they had vanished altogether. Therefore I cannot understand how it can be put forward as an excuse for the inaction of the present Government that they have a rotten instrument to hand which does not enable them to deal with the existing crime. One of the other crimes that remain at present is cattle-driving. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Denman, on having made a discovery in law. He assured your Lordships that unless there was an organised crowd of 100 people they could not be prosecuted under the Crimes Act for unlawful assembly. I believe the noble Lord said he got his information from the Inspector-General, Col. Sir Neville Chamberlain. If so, I should counsel him to change his legal adviser.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD DENMAN </member>: <membercontribution>I do not think the noble and learned Lord has quoted me quite correctly. What I said was that only 100 of the cases of cattle-driving could have been dealt with if the Crimes Act had been in force for unlawful assembly.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ATKINSON </member>: <membercontribution>I completely comprehended what the noble Lord said, and that is what I am endeavouring to show contains not an element of law or sense. Any assembly of three or more persons met together to effect an unlawful purpose is an unlawful assembly, and as the Crimes Act enables the Government to prevent an unlawful assembly, there is not a single
<col>88</col>
cattle-drive from the beginning to the end of the series that could not have been dealt with under the Crimes Act without any proclamation. I speak with authority, because I have directed dozens of those prosecutions myself. I do not mean that repression should be the only remedy. Not at all. That has never been the Unionist policy. The application of the Crimes Act in 1891 under Mr. Balfour's <i>regime</i> and again in 1901 took place while the Land Acts of 1893 and 1903 were in preparation.<lb/>
Another excuse of the Government is that it is very difficult to obtain evidence in Ireland. That is untrue. But there is nothing that increases that difficulty so much as inefficient or cowardly administration of the law. Terror seals the lips of witnesses in Ireland, and confidence in the Government and in the administration of the law is the only thing that will unloose their tongues and enable offenders to be brought to justice. How can there be a difficulty in obtaining evidence when the large majority of cattle-drives have taken place in the day time and in the presence of the police? The noble Earl the Leader of the House said that every one connected with the Government at Dublin Castle had admitted that no matter how drastic the coercion it would not put down intimidation. I traced back in my mind to the year 1887 to try and discover who on earth connected with Dublin Castle could have given the noble Earl such information. The three Viceroys of Ireland on the occasions that the Crimes Act was put in force were the Marquess of Londonderry, the Marquess of Zetland, and Earl Cadogan. Earl Cadogan, I know, shares the view which Lord Londonderry and Lord Zetland have expressed. The three Chief Secretaries admit nothing of the kind, and the two Attorney-Generals are certain to the contrary. Of the two Under-Secretaries I can speak for one; as to the other&#x2014;Sir West Ridgeway&#x2014;that, at all events, was his opinion at one time; but Sir West Ridgeway's convictions have been for the past few years in such a state of flux that I am not sure whether he has changed what was once a staple part of his creed. I go further. I challenge the noble Earl, or any person who sits on the opposite side of the House, to produce one resident magistrate who has been engaged in putting the Crimes Act in force, or one county inspector of police, who will tell you that
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0069"/>
<col>89</col>
the Act is not a most effective remedy for dealing both with intimidation and boycotting of the most effective form. Therefore, judging by what has been done in the past, the Government can have no excuse on the ground of not possessing the means of grappling with crime. They have an effective weapon, but they deliberately refuse to use it, and prefer to do nothing.<lb/>
The breakdown of the ordinary law has been confessed. The Attorney-General for Ireland has said that it is useless to prosecute before juries until you have the jurors in sympathy with the law. And the means of bringing them into sympathy with the law is to let them violate the law with impunity! There cannot be a more humiliating farce than prosecuting a member of a confederacy before twelve members of the same confederacy for doing an act either counselled or applauded by the confederacy as patriotic and a public service. That is what you have in Ireland. No one wishes to dispense with trial by jury where it is effective; but I concur with the Attorney-General for Ireland that it is useless to try by jury until you have the jurors in sympathy with the law. It is frequently said that the disorder is confined to a small part of Ireland, and that the other parts are in a peaceful condition. Why not try cattle-drivers by jurors taken from the good parts of Ireland, and why not try them in those parts that are quiet? However much the Chief Secretary may dislike the Crimes Act, it is his bounden duty to apply it if it is the only means by which law and order can be preserved. It has been truly said that&#x2014;

Though I am greatly interested in the Act of 1903, I do not wish to follow either of the noble Lords into a discussion on that matter.<lb/>
It is a new theory put forward by Lord Denman that the evil of cattle-driving arose from the land hunger of poor holders of small uneconomic farms, a hunger that had been stimulated by the success of the Act of 1903. There are a few facts which it is difficult to reconcile with that. The first is that the cattle-driving has taken place in a great number of places where there is no congestion at all. Next, I think it can be said with confidence that the men who have been arrested and bound
<col>90</col>
over for the offence are landless men who by the neglect to put down violence, have been encouraged to hope that their crimes will be rewarded by the unoccupied lands being divided amongst them. I entirely agree with the noble Earl, Lord Dunraven, and the noble Lord opposite, Lord MacDonnell, that the distribution of untenanted land amongst these landless men makes relief of congestion almost impossible. The reason is that there is not enough land. Every acre you take away to give to landless men makes relief of congestion all the more impossible. The preservation of law and order is the first and paramount duty of Government, and a Minister is not within his right in deliberately refraining from the use of an instrument ready to his hand and allowing crime to go unpunished.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ARRAN </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I had not intended intervening in this debate, as there are so many noble Lords better fitted than myself to call attention to the serious state of affairs now existing in Ireland; but I have been so much struck by the attitude which His Majesty's Government have taken up in defending themselves against the attack made upon them that I shall venture to trouble your Lordships with a few remarks. The Government's attitude in this case reminds me of a complaint once made at a Pall Mall club by a dissatisfied member, who placed the following entry in the complaint book&#x2014;
<quote>"The hot water in the bath room is stone cold; besides there is none."</quote><lb/>
That is the attitude which His Majesty's Government have taken up. They first of all say that the deplorable condition of Ireland is due chiefly to the legislation brought in by the Unionist Government in 1903, and then add that there are no deplorable circumstances at all, or rather that the deplorable circumstances are greatly exaggerated for party purposes. I have had the honour for some years now of supporting His Majesty's Government, and therefore can have no object in exaggerating the present state of affairs for party purposes. Speaking both as a Liberal and as an Irishman resident in the West of Ireland, I say that the condition of the country has been by no means exaggerated, but has been temperately and accurately described in this debate. As to the argument that the present
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0070"/>
<col>91</col>
condition of affairs is due to the policy of the Unionist Government in 1903, I would refer noble Lords to the pages of <i>Hansard</i>, where they will find that the policy of land purchase was enthusiastically and almost unanimously supported by His Majesty's present advisers. Therefore, if there is any responsibility for the present condition of affairs owing to that policy, His Majesty's Government are as responsible for it as the Conservative Government who passed the Act. Lord Denman expressed the opinion that the present state of affairs is chiefly due to the congestion in the West of Ireland. He also went on to say, with an ingenuousness which I cannot but admire, that that congestion could not have been removed by His Majesty's Government because they could not get land at a price which the State could afford to pay. That, it seems to me, foretells the policy which His Majesty's Government are going to pursue for the amelioration of the present state of things. One would gather that they are going to bring in compulsion for the purchase of the grass lands at a price which, as the noble Lord says, the State can afford to pay&#x2014;that is to say, a price which the purchaser is willing to give, and that means a price which is allowed by the United Irish League. if the Loyalists in Ireland have to take the steps adopted in countries where the ordinary laws of civilisation are not in force, then I venture to say the responsibility will rest entirely on His Majesty's Government. The United Irish League realise that they can, with practical impunity, do precisely what they like. There is, however, one consolation. They demonstrate clearly how absolutely incapable Ireland is of self-government. The question has been raised as to whether these debates are of any advantage. For myself, I think they are necessary in order to enable the people of England to thoroughly realise the extent to which anarchy and crime have progressed since His Majesty's Government undertook the administration of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD INCHIQUIN </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have the fortune, good or bad, to live in the county of Clare, and I feel it my duty to inform your Lordships of what is going on in that part of Ireland. I will relate a few incidents that have come to my own knowledge. There is one case of a widowed lady who lives only a few miles from my home.
<col>92</col>
She owned a small property of 350 acres, of which 150 acres are outside the actual demesne. Some two years ago there was an agitation to induce her to sell her outside land to her tenants. This she did, and the land was divided amongst them. That was eighteen months ago, but I may state that it has not been paid for yet. Only the other day another agitation was started to compel her to break up her park, a very picturesque one with many amenities. The local League determined that it should be broken up and divided amongst the landless men. Naturally, this lady objected. The first thing that happened was that the agent of the property was forced, by threats, to resign. A new agent was secured. He is, I might mention, the man who owned the bullock to which the noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, referred yesterday, the head of which was cut off and placed conspicuously in a hedge. A few days afterwards the herd received notice from the League, and refused to work any longer for this lady. A few days subsequent to that, her only remaining labourer departed at the instigation of the League. She was then left with this demesne land on which were thirty or forty cattle, with absolutely no farm hand to feed or look after them in any way. Only two days ago her gardener received notice from the League, and he will have to go. This will leave the lady with only one male servant and one female servant in the house. Being boycotted, she can get no help whatever, except by procuring emergency men from the north of Ireland, but to these men she will have to pay from 18s. to 20s. a week, whereas the ordinary rate is from 9s. to 10s. per week, and will also have to obtain more police protection. Recently her barn, containing 15 tons of hay, was burnt, and in a letter written after this event she says:&#x2014;
<quote>"I hope you can read my writing. My hand has become very shaky since the fire. How little English people know of our sufferings, or, if they do, how little they care if we are shot down. But I will fight for my home with my last breath."</quote>
This lady is nearly eighty years of age, and I call that real pluck. That is merely one case which illustrates what is going on in Ireland. This lady, fortunately, has friends whom she can visit and who can visit her, but in smaller cases the boycott is absolute.<lb/>
Then I come to cattle-driving. There was the case of Mr. Macnamara. These
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0071"/>
<col>93</col>
cattle-drives were the result of League meetings, at almost all of which Members of Parliament were present and advocated cattle-driving. On August 30 there were two or three Members of Parliament at the meeting, and they openly advised cattle-driving. Mr. Macnamara heard of this and warned Mr. Birrell that trouble would occur. Mr. Birrell was away at the time, but his private secretary replied that the facts would be laid before the Chief Secretary on his return. A few days after that the cattle were "turned out to wander." Two days later 160 cattle and a large number of sheep were driven twelve miles&#x2014;and it must be remembered that the Irish mile is considerably longer than the English mile. On December 20 the cattle were driven for the third time from the same land. On this occasion the police were active. They captured one man, and took the names of others. The man who was caught was taken before the magistrate and bound over to keep the peace. Nothing more than that was done, although there had been great cruelty in the driving. The police, in giving evidence, said the crowd discharged shots and knocked down walls and fences. Yet they were only able to capture one man and to take the names of two or three others. The next day those whose names were taken were also called before the resident magistrate and bound over, and at the very moment of this ceremony another drive was taking place. There has been a good deal written in the papers and said at public meetings to the effect that there is no cruelty in cattle-driving. That is quite a mistake. It is true that in these particular drives there was no actual cruelty in the driving. The cattle were driven quietly along the road because there was no opposition. But the moment the police attempted to stop the driving, cruelty took place.<lb/>
I am informed by one of the victims of cattle-driving that he was awakened at eleven-thirty on one night in September by shouts of "For God's sake get up; the boys are coming." His informants had heard this man's name mentioned and had rushed along to warn him. He went in and spoke to his mother, who is nearly ninety years of age, and told her to keep as quiet as she could while he went out to meet the men. When he reached the corner he found twenty or thirty men, with a herd of cattle, shouting and yelling. They said
<col>94</col>
"Will you put your cattle back?" He at first said he would. They then threatened him, and he had to promise that he would not put the cattle back.<lb/>
I know of another case of a man, seventy-nine years of age, who was so feeble that he had had a nurse from Dublin for several weeks in the house. A number of men came down, nearly frightened the life out of the old man, and drove his cattle. This case took place in broad daylight, and only just previously the two Members of Parliament for the county&#x2014;Mr. W. Redmond and Mr. J. Halpin&#x2014;had addressed meetings. Mr. Redmond said:&#x2014;
<quote>"He came there as an enemy of English rule in Ireland, and as a bitter enemy of Irish landlords. As to cattle-driving, he had no word of blame for the men who drove the cattle. As far as he was concerned, he would never blame the young men of Clare for any risk they took in order to secure land that it was intended should be divided amongst them."</quote><lb/>
Mr. Halpin used practically similar words and added:&#x2014;
<quote>"If you take my advice you will not leave a single thing on the land."</quote><lb/>
Subsequently a priest spoke. He said:&#x2014;
<quote>"Last night I had the most pleasant night's sleep I have had for a long time, because I heard there was a cattle-drive in the district. Driving an old bull or a heifer is not a sin."</quote>
That is how cattle-drives have arisen. Why do not the Government go to the fountain-head and attack those men who give advice to the poor, wretched cattle-drivers, who themselves are not so much to blame, because they are promised land for nothing. The point is often overlooked that the owners of the cattle driven are frequently yearly tenants. The result is that they have to pay rent, rates and taxes in respect of land which they are not allowed to use.<lb/>
I think few people in England have the least idea of the terror inspired by the United Irish League, or how its branches are formed. Generally some half-dozen blackguards, who have nothing to lose but everything to gain, decide to start a branch in their district. A meeting is called, members are proposed, and practically everybody in the district is bound to join whether he likes it or not. Then these half-dozen scoundrels call monthly meetings. The ordinary member attends because he is obliged to, otherwise he would be boycotted. He takes no part in the pro-

ceedings, but at the end throws a shilling on the table to pay his dues. One-half of the people who belong to the League hate it body and soul and would give anything to have it suppressed. Why do not the Government suppress this League which is causing all the trouble?<lb/>
Lord Denman said there had been a great deal of exaggeration about crimes and outrages. In the official reports these crimes and outrages are a good deal minimised. Let me give three cases. A man going down a country lane the other day had five revolver shots fired at him. One would expect that to be entered as "Attempted murder." It was returned as "Intimidation." Another man who lives within a mile of my house was sitting by his fireside when he was fired at through the window four times. The first bullet went just over his head, the second shot away part of his cap, and others went near to hitting him. This was reported officially as merely "Firing into a dwelling-house." A case of boycotting, where the victim was unable to get food or anything else within a distance of twenty miles, was officially recorded as "Partial boycott." What is boycotting if this is partial boycotting?<lb/>
I should like to call attention to a statement which the Prime Minister made in the House of Commons on Tuesday in reply to Mr. Balfour. He said:&#x2014;
<quote>"I was struck by one observation of the right hon. Gentleman. He said 'Can you wonder, when you allow this terrible state of things to go on unchecked in Ireland, that no one is found ready to invest in Irish land?' Are they not ready to invest in Irish land? Who are the people who are investing in Irish land? Not British capitalists. British capital is not being exported to Ireland. The people who are tumbling over one another in their eagerness to invest in Irish land are the Irish people themselves. It is just because there is this eagerness to invest in Irish land that we are obliged to come to Parliament and ask for an extension of the facilities which have hitherto existed."</quote>
My impression was that the Irish tenants who wished to buy land were obtaining the money at a very low rate of interest, repayment being extended over a long period of years. A very great percentage is taken off the price of the land before they buy it, and they are given a long period in which to pay back the purchase price at a very low interest. Surely that cannot be called investing in Irish land. I have endeavoured
<col>96</col>
to give your Lordships a number of instances which have come to my knowledge in the county of Clare, and I leave it to you to draw your own conclusions. It is not a pleasure to us to bring these matters to the notice of the House, but it is our only means of drawing attention to the present serious state of affairs.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, we have been reproved for bringing on this debate. We have been told that these debates fulfil no useful purpose. Well, my Lords, these debates, one regrets to say, are now familiar both at the beginning of a session and at the beginning of an autumn session. But I myself have no hesitation in saying that of all the debates of this kind that have occurred since His Majesty's Government came into power this one has served by far the most useful purpose.<lb/>
The debate has clearly established two things. It has exposed, in the first place, the poverty of the case which the Government are trying to defend. Very little answer has been attempted to be given. Since the two leaders spoke on Tuesday there have been twelve speeches; eleven of those speeches have been attacking the Government, and the speech of the noble Lord opposite who represents the Irish Office contained far more about Canadian cattle and Tariff Reform than about the state of Ireland. The second interesting fact established by the debate, as evidenced by the speeches of Lord Mac Donnell and the Earl of Arran, is that even the supporters of His Majesty's Government have no enthusiasm for their Irish policy. Indeed, I am reminded of a speech that was delivered only a few weeks ago in the South East of England by Lord Brassey. My noble friend made a speech covering a great many political topics, in all of which he praised the Government, and the only rift in his golden cloud came when he was constrained to admit that "perhaps there has been partial failure in Ireland." Therefore I think we have made considerable progress. Nobody will deny the position of Lord Brassey in the counsels of the Party opposite. I am glad to see the noble Lord in his place, and can assure him that his speech was read with great gratitude in many parts of Ireland; and I can almost hazard a guess that there are many noble lords who usually sit opposite who would not be disinclined to agree with Lord Brassey.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0073"/>
<col>97</col>
I wish, first, to refer very briefly to one of the few points in the speech of Lord Mac Donnell with which we on this side of the House would disagree. I do not desire to misrepresent the noble Lord, and therefore I am sure he will correct me if I misunderstood him. One of the points that I think he made was that it was quite true that Mr. Birrell gave somebody a clearance certificate, if I may use the phrase, as regards the satisfactory condition of Ireland when he took Office, but that he was referring to Mr. Bryce. I quite agree. Mr. Birrell did give Mr. Bryce such a clearance certificate. But it must not be forgotten that Mr. Bryce gave us such a certificate. The noble Lord shakes his head. I must appeal from the noble Lord to <i>Hansard</i>. In a speech in the House of Commons on February 21, 1906, Mr. Bryce said:&#x2014;
<quote>"This is a moment of tranquility, of peace, and of comparatively well-settled order. Seize that precious opportunity; seize it while you can."</quote><lb/>
Is not that a testimony to the rule of his predecessors, who had gone out of office only three months before?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD </member>: <membercontribution>That three months made all the difference.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE </member>: <membercontribution>Very well. I shall be quite happy to run a byelecton against the noble Lord on that point. I do not think it necessary now to go into the figures that have been produced to prove that disorder exists in Ireland, but perhaps I may be allowed to read a very remarkable telegram that I have just received from my noble friend Lord Farnham, who took his seat here a couple of days ago. My noble friend has returned to Ireland, and is interesting himself very much in a certain organisation that is being formed in the north-east of Ireland with the object of attempting to send down from that part of the country labourers to assist boycotted persons in the less quiet parts of Ireland. This is what he telegraphs&#x2014;
<quote>"The Orange Emergency Committee applied to a leading insurance company under the Workmen's Compensation Act to insure the workmen supplied by them to assist boycotted people throughout Ireland, and their representative has received the following written reply: <i>'Re</i> Accident Insurance of Emergency Men. Referring to your enquiry in this connection, I regret to advise you that, in view of the disturbed condition of the country in which these men would be employed, my directors would prefer not to issue policies on their behalf.'"</quote>
<col>98</col>
What an eloquent comment on the result of three years efforts by Mr. Birrell over a very large part of Ireland!<lb/>
We have been accused of exaggeration. I do not like the <i>tu quoque</i> argument. But I do complain that noble Lords opposite who represent the Government have here in the House of Lords minimised the true state of affairs. I do not think we have been treated quite fairly in the matter. The noble Lord who spoke last night for the Government told us that two-thirds of Ireland are peaceable; and in the debate last October he used a phrase which I think he probably intended, by saying two-thirds were peaceable, still to maintain&#x2014;that the condition of certain counties in the West of Ireland was bad. Now, my Lords, is that a quite fair description? On November 3 last Mr. Birrell, replying to Mr. Lonsdale in the House of Commons, gave statistics which proved that cattle-driving had taken place in twenty-two counties, and there are only thirty-two counties altogether in Ireland. Let us see which counties those are. There is the county of Dublin; I do not think that county is in the West of Ireland. Then there is County Louth, which is on the extreme east coast; County Meath, which touches the east coast; and County Waterford, which is in the almost extreme south-east of Ireland. Is it, therefore, fair to speak of "a few counties in the West of Ireland"? Included in the counties that are proclaimed by the Government as being in a disturbed condition are King's County, in the centre of Ireland, and West Meath. Perhaps the noble Lord thought that "West " in West Meath made it a western county. The town of Athlone we are taught to regard as being the centre point of Ireland, And the town of Athlone is the extreme western point of the county of West Meath. Have we, therefore, been quite fairly treated by the Government in their turn when they have described the extent of the disorder which exists in Ireland. There is a very old fable on which we were all brought up&#x2014;the story of the beam in your own eye and the mote in your brother's. I suggest that perhaps a reading of that fable might be a very good penance for some members of His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked me a question direct. He asked me what was to be the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0074"/>
<col>99</col>
remedy for congestion. The noble Earl, Lord Dunraven, practically answered the point for me, though not in the way I intended to answer it. He said&#x2014;You have got all the land you want. I confess I was unaware of it. I should have been rather inclined to say that the Government can get all the land they want if they are prepared to pay an honest price. Any of your Lordships could go into Ireland to-morrow, and, if you were prepared to pay the price that is settled by the law of supply and demand, influenced, naturally, by the willingness or the unwillingness or the anxiety of the owner to sell, could buy acre after acre, and you could find scores of men ready to sell. The reason of your difficulties over the settlement of the question of congestion, just like the reason of your difficulties over the solution of the evicted tenants question, lies in the fact that the Government are not prepared to pay that economic price, but prefer to pay a price fixed by a tribunal of which they themselves are members.<lb/>
What remedy does the Government propose, not for the question of congestion, but for the vastly more important question&#x2014;the suppression of disorder? No doubt we shall be told by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, who is to conclude the debate for the Government, that, after all, the real remedy for these things is the granting of Home Rule. But, my Lords, at present if there is not a Home Rule Legislature there is a Home Rule Executive. Who, after all, are the members of the Executive? We have the Chief Secretary, an undoubted Home Ruler; we have the two Law Officers of the Crown, both undoubted Irish Home Rulers; and we have, lastly, the Vice-President of the Board of Agriculture, the keenest Home Ruler of all of them, which is the more remarkable since it is only a few years ago that he was an equally keen Unionist. The Executive at this moment is thoroughly in touch with the Home Rule element in Irish politics. A mere glance at the way in which they exercise their patronage proves that. I have referred to this matter before very briefly. May I be allowed to go in detail through the appointments that Mr. Birrell happened to make during the year 1907? He had to appoint a County Court Judge for Limerick at a salary of &#x00A3;1,400 per annum, and he appointed Mr. Richard Adams, a leader writer on the staff of the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>. He then
<col>100</col>
had to appoint a removable magistrate at &#x00A3;800 per annum, and he appointed Mr. P. J. Kelly, the chief leader writer of the <i>Belfast Morning News</i>, which is the Belfast edition of the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>. He then had to appoint a Local Government Board Inspector at &#x00A3;800 per annum, and he appointed Mr. John George MacSweeney, the Editor of the <i>Weekly Freeman</i>. He then had to appoint a temporary Local Government Board Inspector at three guineas per day and travelling and maintenance expenses, and he appointed Mr. Maurice Cosgroeve, chief leader writer of the <i>Evening Telegraph</i>, which is printed, I believe, in the office of the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>. He then had to appoint a Registrar of the Court of Appeal at &#x00A3;1,500 per annum, and he appointed Mr. Edward H. Ennis, leader writer of the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>. And, lastly, he had to appoint a County Court Judge of Clare at &#x00A3;1,400 per annum, and he appointed Mr. Matthias MacDonnell Bodkin, the chief leader writer of the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>. The <i>Freeman's Journal</i> has done yeoman service for the Home Rule cause <i>ab initio</i>. Could any Home Rule Government have more faithfully rewarded their political supporters? Again, Mr. John Dillon sent a message on December 13 last to a meeting at which he was unable to be present, in which he said:&#x2014;
<quote>"The Land Bill has been framed by the Government on lines given to them by the Irish party."</quote><lb/>
I cannot conceive of a single subject on which I want to agree with Mr. John Dillon, but I have certainly never had reason to accuse him of being untruthful, and His Majesty's Government can only deny this statement by giving Mr. Dillon the lie direct. I shall be interested to see whether that is done from the Woolsack this evening. Is it too much to say that we have a a very good example of the working of a Home Rule Executive? I do not think the experience encourages us to extend to them legislative functions. We are not yet to have the Crimes Act. What other remedy do the Government propose? The noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, asked the question point blank.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY </member>: <membercontribution>More than once.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE </member>: <membercontribution>Has he ever had an answer?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0075"/>
<col>101</col>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY </member>: <membercontribution>Never.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE </member>: <membercontribution>I will not be unfair to my noble friend. I will not ask him whether he expected one. Another remedy has been propounded by the Government. It was propounded last October, but not again now. In October last Lord Denman told us that the Government intended to enlist the sympathy of the people themselves on the side of law and order. I want statistics on this point. How many criminals have you enlisted on the side of law and order since last October? How many cattle-drivers have joined in suppressing cattle-driving? A meeting that was open to all took place a few weeks ago close to where I live in the South of Ireland. It was called to discuss whether it was desirable to start cattle-driving in the surrounding country. Should they drive Brown's cattle? Should they drive Jones's cattle? Should they drive Robinson's cattle? The results of the meeting and the names of those who attended were public property a few days afterwards. There was no concealment; why should there be? There is no penalty for cattle-driving and no inconvenience is caused to those attending the meeting.<lb/>
The Government say&#x2014;Oh, we are dealing with this by means of the ordinary law. But they are not; they do not even put the ordinary law in force. Lord Denman gave us some figures as to the number of prosecutions for cattle-driving up to yesterday. Now the same figures were asked for in the House of Commons at the end of last session, and on December 19 Mr. Birrell gave the number of people who had been prosecuted up to December 12 last; and, will your Lordships believe it, the total which Mr. Birrell gave up to December 12 exceeded the noble Lord's figures by over 200. The noble Lord will find the figures in Hansard. Up to yesterday, according to the noble Lord, there had been 1,210 prosecutions, but by December 12 there were 1,434; up to yesterday 1,114 were ordered to find bail, but on December 12 the number was 1,181; up to yesterday sixty-eight were discharged, but on the 12th of December 109 had been discharged. The noble Lord knows perfectly well that I am not going to suggest for a moment that he dreamed of deceiving the House. He, of course, quoted the
<col>102</col>
figures given him by the Irish Office. But does not this show the state of chaos that must exist in that Department? The Chief Secretary very seldom goes to Ireland. He is known as the absentee Chief Secretary. The Chief Secretary's Lodge is not good enough for him; he prefers a couple of rooms at the Shelbourne Hotel, and following precedent he spent a good part of the recess, when one would have thought the state of affairs in Ireland sufficiently demanded his attention, enjoying a holiday in Switzerland. In these circumstances, is it surprising that even some noble Lords opposite are beginning to think that there may have been a partial failure? The figures which are supplied prove the sort of discipline obtaining in the Irish Office.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD DENMAN </member>: <membercontribution>May I ask the noble Earl whether Mr. Birrell's figures were for the whole of Ireland or for particular counties?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE </member>: <membercontribution>I understand that they applied to the whole of Ireland, but if they only concerned fewer counties it would make the case worse. An examination of Mr. Birrell's figures shows that of the 1,582 persons proceeded against, only seventeen convicted by a jury can be said to have received adequate punishment, because it is well known that binding over to keep the peace is a farce. Bail is hardly ever estreated; it has only been estreated in four cases. The 1,100 or 1,200 bound over to keep the peace suffer no inconvenience; they have only to keep a little more in the background and the agitation will go on unchecked. But whereas there have been 1,051 cattle-drives, proceedings have only been taken in 162 cases. Why have no proceedings been taken in the remaining 889? The figures show, taking the average number at ten per cattle-drive, that something like 10,000 people have been engaged in cattle-driving since it started. Of these, only 1,582 have had action taken against them, and only seventeen have received adequate punishment. Can we wonder at the increase of disorder?<lb/>
Yesterday the first speech was made by a member of the Government in which the idea was contemplated that perhaps some day the Crimes Act or some other process ma be necessary. What will that other
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0076"/>
<col>103</col>
process be? If the Government say the Crimes Act or some other process, they must have had under consideration what steps they may have to take, but there is no mention of legislation on the subject in the King's Speech. Perhaps what the Government will do can be done without legislation. I press, however, for an answer to the question&#x2014;What other process is at the back of your minds? We are told that the time has not yet come for the use of the Crimes Act; the state of Ireland is not yet sufficiently bad. Then I ask, When it is going to be bad enough? There are 840 people boycotted; 351 under police protection; there have been forty cases of firing at persons, and eighty-one of firing into dwellings. How many such cases would justify the Government in carrying out their elementary duty of insisting on obedience to the law? There have been 635 cattle-drives during the first eleven months of last year, or an average of fifty-seven per month, and 537 agrarian outrages. When will the Government be satisfied that it is necessary to do something? The noble Lord said that Ireland must be judged by a different standard. It is judged by different standards. I hesitate to think what a row there would have been if there had been ten cattle-drives in one of the grazing districts in this island.<lb/>
But, worse than that, there has been an agrarian murder. How many lives are to be sacrificed before the Government think it time to do something to check the rising tide of crime? That tide is rising more and more rapidly as the people realise the impotence of the unwillingness of the Government to deal with the criminal classes. The murder of Police-constable Goldrick has been already referred to. Remember in what circumstances it took place. He was murdered while endeavouring to protect two workmen, whose murder had been attempted and who were unpopular with the League because they had committed the unforgivable crime of consenting to work for a poor woman who was under the ban of boycott. Parallels have been drawn between the Craughwell murder and the murder which occurred in Tottenham within forty-eight hours. May I be allowed to carry those parallels perhaps a little further? Have both murders been treated in quite the same way by His Majesty's Government? In connection with the victims of the Tottenham murder
<col>104</col>
the Home Secretary wrote a letter announcing that His Majesty's Government were going to send a subscription of &#x00A3;100 towards the fund being raised, and Mr. Gladstone added that he would be glad to send a donation of &#x00A3;10 on his own behalf. Is it the intention of the Government to make a similar contribution to the Irish case? Is it the intention of Mr. Birrell to subscribe &#x00A3;10 himself to the victims in the Irish case? I should like an answer to that question, or some reason why the two cases are to be treated differently. Lord Denman claimed that the Craughwell murder had no more relation to the state of the country than the Tottenham murder had to the state of London. But was the Tottenham murder an agrarian crime? The motive in the Tottenham case was, as I understand, robbery, and it is ridiculous to suggest that it was part of a great political agitation of a Socialistic nature. But the Craughwell murder was the culmination of an agrarian agitation that has been going on for three years, all the details of which were given yesterday by the noble Marquess behind me. So far it is an isolated instance. It is the first that has occurred in the course of the present agitation. Would to God that it were likely to be the last.<lb/>
I hope the criminals are likely to be brought to justice. Investigation, I know, is proceeding, and it is not my business to speculate whether the unfortunate men now under arrest are guilty or not. It remains to be seen whether any evidence is going to be produced that is likely to lead to conviction. If the preliminary investigation results in the production of any evidence, it remains to be seen whether His Majesty's Government will institute a prosecution before a jury, or whether they will do what they have done in five-sixths of the cases that have come before them so far in the present agitation&#x2014;namely, bind over the murderers to keep the peace for three months. And if a prosecution does take place, it remains to be seen what the jury will do. Will the jury decide the case fairly on the evidence put before them, or will they, in the teeth of the evidence, disagree or find the prisoners "Not guilty "? But is there no guilt outside the narrow legal sense? Whom are we in your Lordship's House to consider most to blame&#x2014;the unfortunate criminals who fired the shot or the Chief Secretary who, by the neglect of his duties during the last three years, has
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0077"/>
<col>105</col>
outwardly encouraged the perpetration of these outrages? Mr. Birrell has educated the population over a very large part of Ireland into the belief that whilst the exceptional law of King Edward III causes them little inconvenience, the law of King Edward VII is unable to touch them. There was a case at Ennis last January, in which a poster was produced that had been put up on the walls in the neighbourhood, saying openly that&#x2014;
<quote>"Our society is led to believe that murder is no sin in a land war."</quote><lb/>
My Lords, the moral guilt of this murder, at all events, is shared by the criminal who fired the shot and the Chief Secretary who has neglected his proper function and failed to maintain law and order, and the blood of Constable Goldrick stains the hands of both. Let us not forget the point to which we have come. Successful agrarian murder has been revived. I do not think anybody will envy His Majesty's Government the epitaph when the time comes for recording their deeds on the pages of Irish political history.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not quite agree with the noble Earl who has just spoken in thinking that this has been so remarkable or so important a debate as he imagines. There are a good many Members of the House who have for a long time been in Parliament, and I think they will remember&#x2014;at least I remember&#x2014;exactly the same kind of debate over and over again during the whole thirty years since I first sat in either one or other House of Parliament. There is the same elaboration of statistics and dispute as to their accuracy, the same lurid description of individual crimes in comparison with others which have taken place here or elsewhere, and the same digressions&#x2014;if I may so say respectfully to the noble Earl&#x2014;into such subjects as the appointment to this or that office of gentlemen employed on the Freeman's Journal or some allied newspaper.<lb/>
The truth is that these debates&#x2014;although I do not in the least deny the necessity for them&#x2014;fall into the same groove for reasons which, I think, a good many of the speakers seem to have entirely ignored or forgotten. Ireland for the last thirty years has been passing through an agrarian revolution&#x2014;
<col>106</col>
an agrarian revolution more complete within so short a space of years than has ever been accomplished without civil war or something like it in almost any country in the world. It has been due, no doubt, in part to the presence of a powerful Government in Great Britain. But does any noble Lord who thinks of it dispute this proposition, that every stage in that agrarian revolution&#x2014;and, I might add, in many other agrarian revolutions in other countries&#x2014;has been accompanied by more or less agrarian crime? To-day it is an abatement, to-morrow it is a recrudescence, but there has been constantly crime of an agrarian kind during all the years through which this period of change has been developed. One would think from hearing these debates that there had been no crime in Ireland during the time of Conservative Administrations, and no agrarian difficulty in Ireland then.<lb/>
I am speaking in the presence of some who have had the responsibility for government in Ireland, and they know perfectly well that you may in debate attack this Government and say that the blood of a police-constable rests upon the head of the Chief Secretary. Will the noble Earl forgive me for saying that that is a figure of speech which is not worthy of his kindly nature? I suppose Mr. Birrell would feel as acutely as any man in this House the sadness of an affair like that murder, and I may say that he purposed to have attended the funeral if he had not been summoned necessarily to London to attend a Cabinet meeting. I am sure that the noble Lord does not in his heart believe that Mr. Birrell would not feel as grieved as he would at an occurrence of this kind. Therefore, let us deal with it as a thing which is constantly occurring. Unfortunately, in a period of change of the law and change of customs it will take a considerable time before what has been settled by both Governments will come finally to its issue&#x2014;because the noble Lord, Lord Ashbourne, is as responsible for one part of the agrarian changes as Mr. Gladstone was for another part. Under those circumstances let us deal with it as a constant difficulty and anxiety of every British Government during the lifetime of the oldest man here. That is what the case of Ireland has been, and, if I might suggest, if there were a little less recrimination there would be a little better understanding of the true bearing of these events. 
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0078"/>
<col>107</col>
Let me confine myself to three points:&#x2014;(1) What is the state of Ireland; (2) what is it that we have done for the purpose of meeting the evil; and (3) what do you say ought to be done? In the first place, as to the state of Ireland, there is the cruel murder which has been referred to. I have inquired into that case, and I speak about it with reserve because two persons are under arrest at the present moment in respect to that murder. But the story has been told that there was a policeman watching at the house of some poor woman who had, with the assent of the evicted tenant, obtained an evicted farm. It is suggested that she had incurred the disapprobation of the United Irish League. That is not so. She had incurred, I believe, the disapprobation of one of those dreadful secret societies which are the result of trying to drive crime underground. A certain man fired at the men who were repairing a wall, and the fine young fellow whose death ensued, with the courage of his race, although unarmed except with a revolver, followed, and the man turned round and shot him dead. It is an atrocious crime; everybody agrees as to that. It is no satisfaction to those who are aggrieved to say that it is the only agrarian murder that has taken place within the last three years, or, I think, more. All I can say is this&#x2014;that two men are under arrest, and the Attorney-General, I know, will do his duty if he can procure satisfactory evidence in regard to that case.<lb/>
As regards other crime, will the noble Earl allow me to correct him as to a few facts? Let me say, in the first instance, I am not for a moment disputing that in certain parts of Ireland&#x2014;I think rightly described as about one-third of Ireland&#x2014;there is in places a deplorable state of things which ought to be punished, that ought to be stopped, and we try and have tried to punish and stop it. The number of cases of firing at persons in 1908 is fifteen&#x2014;that is a very serious crime; riots and affrays, thirty&#x2014;they may be serious or very slight; threatening letters, 233&#x2014; do not think people who are conversant with Ireland attach too much importance to threatening letters, although, of course, it is a crime and a very wicked thing, and ought to be punished; killing, cutting, and maiming cattle&#x2014;a brutal and cowardly class of offence&#x2014;thirty-two cases; firing into dwellings, sixty-six. That is the state of crime in Ireland.<lb/>
I do not deny that it is a serious matter
<col>108</col>
when the number of crimes reaches such dimensions. But, without attempting to institute comparisons, every one must know that there have been periods in Ireland during which crime has been infinitely greater and infinitely more serious. All I mean is, do not let us do more than see things exactly as they are. There are no other figures to which I intend for the moment to refer. But what have the Government done? Prosecutions have been undertaken in every case where evidence could be procured. It is true that evidence in many cases could not be procured, and that any one acquainted with Irish history will know is not uncommon. That, in fact, is our great difficulty. There have been few cases in which evidence could be procured until the end of last year. Now at the end of last year assizes were held in Limerick and Cork, and I can assure your Lordships that the juries in both places, though there was not the slightest attempt at packing, and they were not special juries under the Crimes Act, did deal with the cases before them in the most satisfactory manner. There were sixteen agrarian prosecutions, and in ten cases there were convictions, in three pleas of guilty, and in three disagreements. Of sixty-seven persons charged with agrarian offences at these assizes, the only assizes at which agrarian crimes came forward at all, forty-five were convicted or pleaded guilty.<lb/>
I think I ought to mention that Mr. Justice Kenny, speaking at the close of the December Assizes at Limerick&#x2014;nearly all the cases were tried there, there were but a few at Cork&#x2014;said he could give his testimony to the correctness of the verdicts found by the juries empanelled, and could not speak too highly of their courage, honesty, and sense of justice; their conduct, he said, deserved all praise. That was the result, I hope a good result, of trying to trust a jury without packing or introducing a different class of people like special jurymen; the result was marked by a courageous sense of responsibility. The result has been satisfactory in the convictions obtained at Limerick and Cork in this way. I have asked for and obtained from the usual sources extracts showing that in December and January there has been a much more satisfactory state of things. That is the information given to me; I do not pretend to have personal knowledge.<lb/>
Let me now come to other figures in
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0079"/>
<col>109</col>
reference to proceedings in the Summary Courts; 1,210 persons&#x2014;by some mysterious process increased to 1,400 or 1,500, probably by some error of a compiler&#x2014;were brought before resident magistrates under the Act of Edward III., nearly all cattle-driving cases, but not all; 1,114 were ordered to give bail; 139 refused and went to prison, and those who gave bail, with hardly any exceptions, have observed their undertakings. The noble Earl thinks it a grievance that recognisances were not estreated; but they cannot be unless the undertakings are not observed. Further, I would make this observation to the noble Earl in regard to these cattle-driving cases. He said in all cases of conviction the average was ten persons to each cattle-drive, and therefore he assumed that in the 1,100 cases there must be ten persons concerned. But in the great majority of cases there were one or two men only concerned, and at night, when nobody could see them. But in all cases where evidence has been forthcoming proceedings have been taken, either before a magistrate or a jury. This is the information given to me.<lb/>
Now with regard to boycotting. Nobody has been more severe in condemning this offence than Mr. Birrell, as those who remember the language he used in the House of Commons will allow. In January last there were fifteen cases of persons wholly boycotted&#x2014;I am not sure whether I should say persons or cases, but practically it does not make very much difference&#x2014;ten cases of partial boycotting, and 172 minor cases, where some persons only refused to deal, causing, no doubt, extreme annoyance. It is very difficult to get evidence in these cases, but in one serious case a prosecution is now pending. It is very difficult, I say, to get evidence, but wherever evidence can be procured there will be prosecutions under the ordinary law.<lb/>
I observe that during the debate a good deal of indignation has been expressed at the Government not taking advantage of the Crimes Act for the purpose of proceeding against boycotting, and Lord Ashbourne, who is learned in the subject, assures us such action could be taken. Let me give an illustration. I do not do so in a spirit of <i>tu quoque,</i> and I think it was successful from the course taken under the late Government, and for excellent reasons I have no doubt. In the year 1903 there was, I think, a worse
<col>110</col>
state of things in this respect; there were four persons boycotted wholly, thirty-seven partially, and 148 minor cases. On that occasion there was the Tallow boycotting case. Did the Government proceed under the Crimes Act? No, they instituted an ordinary prosecution, the accused persons were tried, and in both cases the jury disagreed. It was the most serious case of boycotting there had been for a long time, but I think the Government were well advised in not taking action under the Crimes Act. Proceedings were afterwards taken for damages, and the jury awarded in this civil action a large sum of money&#x2014;I think something like &#x00A3;5,000. It was the verdict of a jury, and it did what a prosecution before a magistrate would not have done; and boycotting at that time was stopped by the verdict. This shows, I think, the value and the importance of trying to get an expression of public opinion upon a particular form of offence.<lb/>
We have tried every case where we could get evidence, and what ought we to do? The old controversy emerges in which I have taken a modest, a subordinate part for some years, and many noble Lords have taken part. I ask the question&#x2014;Does it pay to introduce the Crimes Act? Is it not a thing that every constitutional Government desires to avoid? Of course before 1887 it was necessary to bring in a Coercion Bill&#x2014;I call it by its summary term&#x2014;every time a particular question seemed to call for it, and Parliament was very jealous of giving the power. Has any Coercion Act ever been passed on information of the state of Ireland such as has now been given to the House? Was not a much stronger case required to justify the suspension of the Constitution in any way? The reluctance of Parliament now is as strong as ever, and your Lordships should dismiss from your minds the idea that the Government have any idea of palliating or extenuating crime.<lb/>
Our chief difficulty is to get evidence. Our other difficulty is to get juries to convict. What is it suggested we should do? "Oh, you should get special juries!" There was another suggestion by one of your Lordships, and that was that we ought to use the power of what is known as ordering jurors to stand by. That is a euphemism for packing a jury. Packing juries is the broad Saxon; you call it "ordering to stand by." The power exists in England. It has never been used since a case in
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0080"/>
<col>111</col>
England in 1854, when there was a certain number of persons summoned to be jurors who were Peculiar People and disapproved of bloodshed, and therefore in a murder case were ordered to stand by because of their peculiar tenets. Otherwise it is unknown in England. Is it unknown in Ireland? I will tell you a terrible case. It made such an impression on my mind that I shall never forget it. In 1904 or 1903, I forget which, Mr. Wyndham came to the House of Commons and asked us to vote compensation to certain men who had been unjustly convicted in Ireland. It was an application from a Conservative Government and a Conservative Minister. There were four men, and one of them had pleaded guilty, and yet the Government came forward and recommended that he should be paid compensation, because he had suffered an unjust sentence. Why did he plead guilty? Because he was afraid of a packed jury!<lb/>
It is just the same with any other method which is outside the ordinary law, as history tells us. I am not, of course, comparing this with medieval methods of torture&#x2014;an abomination in English law, even in the times of Lord Bacon. Why was that abolished? Because the people found it tended to produce injustice and not justice; and that is the evil of the packed jury. Is that what your Lordships ask us to do? It is useless to cover it over by using the euphemism of speaking of ordering jurors to stand by. The noble Earl knows what is meant by ordering ten, fifteen, twenty, or thirty to stand by until by a process of exhaustion through forty or even fifty you get your jurymen selected out of a panel of, say, eighty. Is that justice? It is not the justice which Englishmen are in the habit of administering in their own country. We should be loath, indeed, to have that in Ireland. The other method is to appoint resident magistrates and to give them the power to try cases which would otherwise be tried by jury. I have given you an illustration of how that works and of what the consequence was in boycotting during the time of the Conservative Government.
<col>112</col>
I will not enlarge upon it or trespass longer on your patience. Our feeling is not a desire either to extenuate the conduct or to minimise the extent of the mischief that is going on in Ireland now. It is certainly not to protect the people who have committed these abominable offences, but that they should be properly punished. It is that we cherish the time-honoured principles of the British Constitution, and we do not want to depart from them. That is the reason for the course we have taken, and we hope that it will succeed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Earl</member> <membercontribution>tempted me to enter upon another field by suggesting that I should say that the only remedy was self-government. Lord Mac Donnell said some things on that more than once. Lord Dunraven said something on it. I wonder how long it will be before your Lordships will come to see that Ireland is not entirely different from all the rest of the world. In every country of our race, not only throughout the British Empire, but outside, indeed in almost every country of Aryan race, the throwing upon a governed people of a good full share of the responsibility of governing themselves has always succeeded. I really do not know that there is any instance to the contrary. The attempt to suppress and to deny them full or indeed any real responsibility in the management of their own affairs has always failed. Your Lordships will constantly have before you this old problem and these old difficulties until you take your courage in both hands and forget that it is the wicked Liberals who want to give something better to Ireland. It would be a grim satisfaction for me if, in addition to the memories I have of the Conservative party's conduct in the past, I may be able to add the memory that at least they were the instruments of giving Home Rule to Ireland.<lb/>

<title>[SECOND READING.]</title>
<p>Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN):</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I invite the House to take to-day the first definite and operative step in carrying out the policy which I had the honour of stating to your Lordships just before Christmas, and which has occupied the active consideration both of the Home Government and of the Government of India for very nearly, if not even more than, three years. The statement was awaited in India with an expectancy that with time became almost impatience, and it was received in India&#x2014;and that, after all, is the point to which I looked with the most anxiety&#x2014;with intense interest and attention and various degrees of approval, from warm enthusiasm to cool assent and acquiescence.<lb/>
A deputation waited upon the Viceroy a few days after the arrival of my Despatch, unique in its comprehensive character; both the Hindus and the Mahomedans were represented; it was a remarkable deputation, and they waited upon the Viceroy to offer their expression of gratitude for the scheme which was unfolded before them. Then a few days later at Madras the
<col>118</col>
Congress met, and they, too, expressed their thanks to the Home Government and to the Government of India. Almost at the same time the Moslem League met at Amritsar, and they were warm in their approval of the policy which they took to be foreshadowed in the Despatch, though they found fault with the defects they thought they had discovered in the scheme, and implored the Government, both in India and here, to remedy those defects. So far as I know&#x2014;and I do beg your Lordships to note these details of the reception of our policy in India&#x2014;there has been no sign in any quarter, save possibly in the irreconcilable camp, of organised hostile opinion among either Indians or Anglo Indians.<lb/>
The Indian Civil Service I will speak of very shortly. I will pass them by for the moment. The noble Marquess (Lord Lansdowne) said truly the other night that when I spoke at the end of December I used the words "formidable and obscure" as describing the situation, and he desired to know whether I thought the situation was still formidable and obscure. I will not drop the words, but I think the situation is less formidable and less obscure. Neither repression on the one hand nor reform on the other could possibly be expected to cut at the roots of anarchical crime in a few weeks, but with unfaltering repression on the one hand and vigour and good faith in reform on the other we all see good reason to hope that we shall weaken, if not destroy, these baleful forces.<lb/>
There are, I take it, three classes of people that we have to consider in dealing with a scheme of this kind. There are the extremists, who nurse fantastic dreams that some day they will drive us out of India. In this group there are academic extremists and physical force extremists, and I have seen it stated on a certain authority&#x2014;it cannot be more than guessed&#x2014;that they do not number, whether academic or physical force extremists, more than one-tenth, I think, or even three per cent., of what are called the educated class in India. The second group nourish no hopes of this sort, but hope for autonomy or self-government of the colonial species and pattern. And then the third section of this classification ask for no more than to be admitted to cooperation in our administration, and to
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0084"/>
<col>119</col>
find a free and effective voice in expressing the interests and needs of their people. I believe the effect of the reforms has been, is being, and will be to draw the second class, who hope for colonial autonomy, into the third class, who will be content with being admitted to a fair and full co-operation. A correspondent wrote to me the other day and said:&#x2014;
<quote>"We seem to have caught many discontented people on the rebound, and to have given them an excuse for a loyalty which they have badly wanted."</quote><lb/>
In spite of all this it is a difficult and critical situation, but by almost universal admission it has lost that tension which strained India two or three months ago, and public feeling is tranquillised, certainly beyond any expectation which either the Viceroy or myself ventured to entertain.<lb/>
The situation has become, at all events, more hopeful, and I am confident that the atmosphere has changed from being dark and sullen to being hopeful, and I am sure your Lordships will allow me to be confident that nothing will be done at Westminster to cloud that hopeful sky. The noble Marquess the other day said&#x2014;and I was delighted to hear it&#x2014;that he, at all events, would give us, with all the reservations that examination of the scheme might demand from him, a whole-hearted support here and his best encouragement to the men in India. I accept that, and I rely upon it and lean upon it, because if anything were done at Westminster, either by delay or otherwise, to show a breach in what ought to be the substantial unity of Parliamentary opinion in face of the Indian situation, it would be a very great disaster. I would venture on the point of delay to say this. Your Lordships will not suspect me of having any desire to hurry the Bill, but I remember that when Lord Cross brought in the Bill of 1892 Lord Kimberley, who was so well known and so popular in the House, used this language, which I venture to borrow from him to press upon your Lordships to-day&#x2014;
<quote>"I think it almost dangerous to leave a subject of this kind hung up to be perpetually discussed by all manner of persons, and, having once allowed that, at all events, some amendment is necessary in regard to the mode of constituting the Legislative Councils, it is incumbent upon the Government and Parliament to pass the Bill which they may think expedient as speedily as possible into law."</quote><lb/>
I think the considerations of social order and social urgency in India make
<col>120</col>
that just as useful to be remembered to-day as it was then.<lb/>
The noble Marquess the other day, in a very courteous manner, administered to me an exhortation and an admonition and homily&#x2014;I had almost said a lecture&#x2014;as to the propriety of deferring to the man on the spot, and the danger of quarrelling with the man on the spot. I listened with becoming meekness and humility, but then it occurred to me that the language of the noble Marquess was not original. Those noble Lords who share the Bench with him gave deep murmurs of approval to this homily which was administered to me. They had forgotten that they once had a man on the spot, the man there being that eminent and distinguished man whom I may perhaps be allowed to congratulate upon his restoration to health and to his place in this Assembly. He said this, which the noble Marquess will see is a fair original for his own little discourse; it was said after the noble Lord had thrown up the reins&#x2014;
"What I wish to say to high officers of State and members of Government is this, as far as you can trust the man on the spot. Do not weary or fret or nag him with your superior wisdom. They claim no immunity from errors of opinion or judgment, but their errors are nothing compared with yours."<lb/>
The remonstrance, therefore, of the noble Lord (Lord Curzon) to the noble Lords sitting near him is identical with that which I have laid to heart from the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>
<p>The House will pardon me if I for a moment dwell upon what by application is an innuendo conveyed in the admonition of the noble Marquess. I have a suspicion that he considered his advice was needed; he expressed the hope that all who were responsible for administration in India would have all the power for which they had a right to ask. Upon that I can, I think,&#x2014;though I am half reluctant to do so&#x2014;completely clear my character, for in December last, shortly before I addressed your Lordships, Lord Minto, having observed there was some talk of my interference, telegraphed these words, and desired that I should make use of them whenever I thought fit, having in view my addressing the House&#x2014;
<quote>"I hope you will say from me, in as strong language as you may choose to use, that in all our dealings with sedition I could not be more strongly supported than I have been by you. The question
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0085"/>
<col>121</col>
of the control of Indian administration by the Secretary of State, mixed up as it is with the old difficulties of centralisation, we may very possibly look at from different points of view, but that has nothing to do with the support the Secretary of State gives to the Viceroy, and which you have given to me in a time of great difficulty and for which I shall always be warmly grateful."</quote></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE:</member> <membercontribution>I think the noble Viscount will see from the report of my speech that the part he has quoted had reference to measures of repression, and that what I said was that justice should be prompt, that it was undesirable that there should be appeals from one Court to another, or from provincial Governments to the Government in Calcutta, or from the Government at Calcutta to the Secretary of State for India. I did not mean to imply merely the Viceroy, but the men responsible for local government.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN:</member> <membercontribution>I do not think that when the noble Marquess refers to the report of his speech he will find I have misrepresented him. At all events, he will, I am sure, gladly agree that, in dealing with sedition, I have on the whole given all the support the Government of India or anybody else concerned had a right to ask for.<lb/>
I will now say a word about the Indian Civil Service. Three years ago when we began these operations I felt that a vital element for success was that we should carry the Indian Civil Service with us, and that if we did not do this we should fail. But human nature being what it is, and temperaments varying as they do, it is natural to expect a certain amount of criticism, minute criticism, and observation, and I have had proofs of that, but will content myself with one quotation from a very distinguished member, the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, well known to the noble Lord opposite. What did he say, addressing the Legislative Council a few weeks ago?&#x2014;
<quote>"I hold that a solemn duty rests upon the officers of Government in all branches, and more particularly upon the officers of the Civil Service, so to comport themselves in the inception and working of the new measures as to make the task of the people and their leaders easy. It is incumbent upon them loyally to accept the principle that these measures involve the surrender of some portion of the authority and control which they now exercise, and some modifications of the methods of administration. If that task is approached in a grudging or reluctant spirit we shall be sowing the seeds of failure and shall forfeit our claim to receive
<col>122</col>
the friendly co-operation of the representatives of the people. We must be prepared to support, defend, and carry through the administrative policy, and in a certain degree even the executive acts of the Government in the Council, in much the same way as is now prescribed in regard to measures of legislation; and we must further be prepared to discharge this task without the aid of a standing majority behind us. We will have to resort to the more difficult arts of persuasion and conciliation in the place of the easier methods of autocracy. This is no small demand to make on the resources of a service whose training and traditions have hitherto led its members rather to work for the people than through the people or their representatives. But I am nevertheless confident that the demand will not be made in vain. For more than a hundred years, in the time of the Company and under the rule of the Crown the Indian Civil Service has never failed to respond to whatever call has been made upon it or to adapt itself to the changing environment of the time. I feel no doubt that officers will be found who possess the natural gifts, the loyalty, the imaginations, and the force of character which will be requisite for the conduct of the administration under the more advanced form of government to which we are about to succeed."</quote><lb/>
These words I commend to your Lordships. They breathe a noble spirit, they admirably express the feeling of a sincere man, and I do not believe anybody who is acquainted with the Service doubts that that spirit, so admirably expressed, will pervade the Service in the admittedly difficult task that now confronts them.<lb/>
The Bill is a short one, and will speak for itself; I shall be brief in referring to it, for in December last I made what was practically a Second-Reading speech. I may point out that there are two rival schools, and that the noble Lord opposite (Lord Curzon) may be said to represent one of them. There are two rival schools, one of which believes that better government of India depends on efficiency, and that efficiency is in fact the end of our rule in India. The other school, while not neglecting efficiency, looks also to what is called political concessions. I think I am doing the noble Lord no injustice in saying that during his eminent Viceroyalty he did not accept the necessity for political concessions, but trusted to efficiency. I hope it will not be bad taste to say in the noble Lord's presence that you will never send to India, and you have never sent to India a Viceroy his superior, if, indeed, his equal, in force of mind, in unsparing remorseless industry, in passionate and devoted interest in all that concerns the well-being of India, with an imagination fired by the grandeur of the political problem India presents&#x2014;you never sent a man with
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0086"/>
<col>123</col>
more of all these attributes than when you sent Lord Curzon. But splendidly successful as his work was from the point of view of efficiency, he still did leave in India a state of things when we look back&#x2014;not in consequence of his policy&#x2014;not completely satisfactory such as would have been the crowning of a brilliant career.<lb/>
I am as much for efficiency as the noble Lord, but I do not believe&#x2014;and this is the difference between him and myself&#x2014;that you can have true, solid, endurable efficiency without what are called political concessions. I know risks are pointed out. The late Lord Salisbury, speaking on the last Indian Councils Bill, spoke of the risk of applying occidental machinery in India. Well, we ought to have thought of that before we applied occidental education; we applied that, and occidental machinery must follow. These Legislative Councils once called into existence, it was inevitable that you would have gradually, in Lord Salisbury's own phrase, to popularise them so as to bring them into harmony with the dominant sentiments of the people in India. The Bill of 1892 admittedly contained the elective principle, and now this Bill extends that principle. The noble Lord (Viscount Cross) will remember the Bill of 1892, of which he had charge in the House of Commons. I want the House to be good enough to follow the line taken by Mr. Gladstone, because I base myself on that. There was an amendment moved and there was going to be a division, and Mr. Gladstone begged his friends not to divide, because he said it was very important that we should present a substantial unity to India. This is upon the question of either House considering a Bill like the Bill that is now on the Table&#x2014;a mere skeleton of a Bill if you like. I see it has been called vague and sketchy. It cannot be anything else on the principle explained by Mr. Gladstone&#x2014;
<quote>"It is the intention of the Government [that is, the Conservative Government] that a serious effort shall be made to consider carefully those elements which India in its present condition may furnish for the introduction into the Councils of India of the elective principle. If that effort is seriously to be made, by whom is it to be made? I do not think it can be made by this House, except through the medium of empowering provisions. The best course we could take would be to commend to the authorities of India what is a clear indication of the principles on which we desire them to proceed. It is not our business to devise machinery for the purpose of Indian Government. It is our business to give to those who represent Her Majesty in India ample information as to what we believe to
<col>124</col>
be sound principles of Government: and it is, of course, the function of this House to comment upon any case in which we may think they have failed to give due effect to those principles."</quote><lb/>
I only allude to Mr. Gladstone's words in order to let the House know that I am taking no unusual course in leaving the bulk of the work, the details of the work, to the Government of India, and discussion, therefore, in this House and in Parliament will necessarily be not upon details. But no doubt it is desirable that some of the heads of the regulations, rules, and proclamations to be made by the Government of India under sanction of the India Office should be more or less placed within the reach and knowledge of the House so far as they are complete. The principles of the Bill are in the Bill and will be affirmed, if your Lordships are pleased to read it a second time, and the Committee points, important as they are, can well be dealt with in Committee. The view of Mr. Gladstone was cheerfully accepted by the House then, and I hope it will be accepted by your Lordships to-day.<lb/>
There is one very important chapter in these regulations which I think now on the Second Reading of the Bill, without waiting for Committee, I ought to say a few words to your Lordships about&#x2014;I mean the Mahomedans. That is a part of the Bill and scheme which has no doubt attracted a great deal of criticism and excited a great deal of feeling in that very important community. We suggested to the Government of India a certain plan. We did not prescribe it, we did not order it, but we suggested and recommended this plan for their consideration&#x2014;no more than that. It was the plan of a mixed or composite electoral college, in which Mahomedans and Hindus should pool their votes, so to say. The wording of the recommendation in my Despatch was, as I soon discovered, ambiguous&#x2014;a grievous defect, of which I make bold to hope I am not very often in public business guilty. But, to the best of my belief, under any construction the plan of Hindus and Mahomedans voting together in a mixed and composite electorate would have secured to the Mahomedan electors, wherever they were so minded, the chance of returning their own representatives in their due proportion. The political idea at the bottom of that recommendation which has found so little favour was that such composite action would bring the two great communities more closely together,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0087"/>
<col>125</col>
and this idea of promoting harmony was held by men of very high Indian authority and experience who were among my advisers at the India Office. But the Mahomedans protested that the Hindus would elect a pro-Hindu upon it, just as I suppose in a mixed college of say seventy-five Catholics and twenty-five Protestants voting together the Protestants might suspect that the Catholics voting for the Protestant would choose what is called a Romanising Protestant and as little of a Protestant as they could find. Suppose the other way. In Ireland there is an expression, a "shoneen" Catholic&#x2014;that is to say, a Catholic who, though a Catholic, is too friendly with English Conservatism and other influences which the Nationalists dislike. And it might be said, if there were seventy-five Protestants against twenty-five Catholics, that the Protestants when giving a vote in the way of Catholic representation would return "shoneens." I am not going to take your Lordships' time up by arguing this to-day. With regard to schemes of proportional representation, as Calvin said of another study, "excessive study either finds a man mad or makes him so." At any rate, the Government of India doubted whether our plan would work, and we have abandoned it. I do not think it was a bad plan, but it is no use, if you are making an earnest attempt in good faith at a general pacification, out of parental fondness for a clause interrupting that good process by sitting too tight.<lb/>
The Mahomedans demand three things. I had the pleasure of receiving a deputation from them and I know very well what is in their minds. They demand the election of their own representatives to these councils in all the stages, just as in Cyprus, where, I think, the Mahomedans vote by themselves. They have nine votes and the non-Mahomedans have three, or the other way about. So in Bohemia, where the Germans vote alone and have their own register. Therefore we are not without a precedent and a parallel for the idea of a separate register. Secondly, they want a number of seats in excess of their numerical strength. Those two demands we are quite ready and intend to meet in full. There is a third demand that, if there is a Hindu on the Viceroy's Executive Council&#x2014;a subject on which I will venture to say a little to your Lordships before I sit down&#x2014;there should be two Indian members on the Viceroy's
<col>126</col>
Council and that one should be a Mahomedan. Well, as I told them and as I now tell your Lordships, I see no chance whatever of meeting their views in that way to any extent at all.<lb/>
To go back to the point of the registers, some may be shocked at the idea of a. religious register at all, of a register framed on the principle of religious belief. We may wish, we do wish&#x2014;certainly I do&#x2014;that it were otherwise. We hope that time, with careful and impartial statemanship, will make things otherwise. Only let us not forget that the difference between Mahomedanism and Hinduism is not a mere difference of articles of religious faith. It is a difference in life, in tradition, in history, in all the social things as well as articles of belief that constitute a community. Do not let us forget what makes it interesting and even exciting. Do not let us forget that, in talking of Hindus and Mahomedans, we are dealing with and brought face to face with vast historic issues, dealing with some of the very mightiest forces that through all the centuries and ages have moulded the fortunes of great States and the destinies of countless millions of mankind. Thoughts of that kind are what give to Indian politics and to Indian work extraordinary fascination, and at the same time impose the weight of no ordinary burden.<lb/>
Now I will come to the question which, I think, has excited, certainly in this country, more interest than anything else in the scheme before you&#x2014;I mean the question of an Indian member on the Viceroy's Executive Council. The noble Marquess said here the other day that he hoped an opportunity would be given for discussing it. Whether it is in order or not&#x2014;I am too little versed in your Lordships' procedure to be quite sure&#x2014;but I am told that the rules of order in this House are of an elastic description and that I shall not be trespassing beyond what is right, if I introduce the point to-night. I thoroughly understand the noble Marquess's anxiety for a chance of discussion. It is quite true, and the House should not forget that it is quite true, that this question is in no way whatever touched by the Bill. If this Bill were rejected by Parliament it would be a great and grievous disaster to peace and contentment in India, but it would not prevent the Secretary of State
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0088"/>
<col>127</col>
the next morning from advising his Majesty to appoint an Indian Member. The members of the Viceroy's Executive Council are appointed by the Crown.<lb/>
The noble Marquess the other day fell into a slight error, if he will forgive me for saying so. He said that the Government of India had used cautious and tentative words indicating that it would be premature to decide at once this question of the Indian member until after further experience had been gained. I think the noble Marquess must have lost his way in the mazes of that enormous Blue-book which, as he told us, caused him so much inconvenience and added so much to his excessive luggage during the Christmas holidays. The Despatch, as far as I can discover, is silent altogether on the topic of the Indian member of the Viceroy's Council, and deals only with the Councils of Bombay and Madras and the proposed Councils for the Lieutenant-Governorships.<lb/>
Perhaps I might be allowed to remind your Lordships of the Act of 1833&#x2014;certainly the most extensive measure of Indian government between Mr. Pitt's famous Act of 1784 and Queen Victoria's assumption of the government of India. There is nothing so important as that Act. It lays down in the broadest way possible the desire of Parliament of that day that there was to be no difference in appointing to offices in India between one race and another, and the covering Despatch wound up by saying that&#x2014;
<quote>"For the future, fitness is to be the criterion of elegibility."</quote> <lb/>
I need not quote the famous paragraph in the Queen's Proclamation of 1858, for every Member of the House who takes an interest in India knows that by heart. Now, the noble Marquess says that his anxiety is that nothing shall be done to impair the efficiency of the Viceroy's Council. I share that anxiety with all my heart. I hope the noble Marquess will do me the justice to remember that in these plans I have gone beyond the Government of India in resolving that a permanent official majority shall remain in the Viceroy's Council. Lord Mac Donnell said the other day:&#x2014;
<quote>"I believe you cannot find any individual native gentleman who is enjoying general confidence who would be able to give advice and assistance to the Governor-General in Council."</quote><lb/>
It has been my lot to be twice Chief Secretary for Ireland, and I do not believe
<col>128</col>
I can truly say I ever met in Ireland a single individual native gentleman who "enjoyed general confidence." And yet I received at Dublin Castle most excellent and competent advice. Therefore I will accept that statement from the noble Lord. The question is whether there is no one of the 300 millions of the population of India who is competent to be the officially-constituted adviser of the Governor-General in Council in the administration of Indian affairs. You make an Indian a Judge of the High Court, and Indians have even been acting Chief Justices. As to capacity who can deny that they have distinguished themselves as administrators of native States, where far more demand is made on their resources, intellectual and moral? It is said that the presence of an Indian member would cause restraint in the language of discussion. For a year and a half I have had two Indians at the Council of India, and I have never found the slightest restraint whatever.<lb/>
Then there is the question, What are you going to do about the Hindu and the Mahomedan? When Indians were first admitted to the High Courts, for a long time the Hindus were more fit and competent than the Mahomedans; but now I am told the Mahomedans have their full share. The same sort of operation would go on in quinquennial periods between Hindus and Mahomedans. Opinion amongst the great Anglo-Indian officers now at home is divided, but I know at least one, not, I think, behind even Lord Mac Donnell in experience or mental grasp, who is strongly in favour of this proposal. One circumstance which cannot but strike your Lordships as remarkable is the comparative absence of hostile criticism of this idea by the Anglo-Indian Press, and, as I am told, in Calcutta society. I was apprehensive at one time that it might be otherwise. I should like to give a concrete illustration. The noble Marquess opposite said the other day that there was going to be a vacancy in one of the posts on the Viceroy's Executive Council&#x2014;namely, the legal member's time would soon be up. Now, suppose there were in Calcutta an Indian lawyer of large practice and great experience in his profession&#x2014;a man of unstained professional and personal repute, in close touch with European society and much respected, and the actual holder of important legal office. Am I to say to that man&#x2014;In spite of all these excellent circumstances to your
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0089"/>
<col>129</col>
credit, in spite of your undisputed fitness, in spite of the emphatic declaration of 1833 that fitness is to be the criterion of eligibility, in spite of that noble promise in Queen Victoria's Proclamation of 1858&#x2014;a promise of which every Englishman ought to be for ever proud if he tries to adhere to it, and rather ashamed if he tries to betray or mock it&#x2014;in spite of all this, usage and prejudice are so strong that I dare not appoint you, but must appoint instead some stranger to India from Lincoln's Inn or the Temple? Is there one of your Lordships who would envy the Secretary of State who had to hold language of that kind to a meritorious candidate, one of the King's equal subjects? I put it to your Lordships in that concrete way. These abstract general arguments are slippery. I do not say there is no force in them, but there are deeper questions at issue to which Lord Minto and myself attach the greatest importance. My Lords, I thank you for listening to me, and I beg to move the Second Reading.<lb/>
Moved, "That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>."&#x2014;(<i> Viscount Morley of Blackburn</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I must begin with an apology to the House if I am not quite as well equipped for this debate as I ought to be. It was only on Saturday, when I landed in England, that I heard of the intention to take the Second Reading of this Bill to-day, that I saw the Bill for the first time, and that I also saw for the first time the prodigious pile of literature on the question to which the noble Viscount has referred. I have utilised the interval in endeavouring to make such excavations as I could in that portentous mass of printed matter, but I am afraid with not altogether satisfactory results. Then, since the publication of the Blue-book, many things have occurred. There have been valuable and authoritative letters in the Press, and papers and communications have come to hand from India. There has been the Mahomedan deputation to the Secretary of State and the reply of the noble Viscount, and finally there have been this Bill and his speech this afternoon. If, therefore, I have not been able thoroughly to digest all this material I must ask for the generous forbearance of your Lordships.<lb/>
We have just listened to a speech from the Secretary of State which, if he will allow me to say so, has been characterised by his usual felicity of diction and eleva-
<col>130</col>
tion of thought. Indeed, the whole of the speeches which the noble Viscount has made on India and Indian reforms since his accession to office appear to me to constitute a notable contribution both to the political thought and the literature of our time. The noble Viscount began this afternoon by congratulating himself upon the reception which his reform proposals have met with in India. He said they had not only met with approval, but they had excited no organised hostile opinion. I think the Secretary of State is quite entitled to congratulate himself upon the general reception of his scheme, and I further agree with him that it has brought about a notable and welcome relaxation in the tension which existed a few months ago in India. But I think it would be unfair to draw from that admission the conclusion that many aspects of his proposals have not excited and do not deserve the most minute and searching criticism. On the contrary, it would appear to me that the more they have been examined in India the greater has been the apprehension&#x2014;I do not mean to use a stronger word than apprehension&#x2014;which they have aroused, and, speaking for myself, the more I have looked into them the more does it seem to me desirable that in some particulars, at any rate, they should, if it may be so, be recast.<lb/>
The Secretary of State for India, rightly, I think, attempted to estimate the impression produced by his scheme upon the different classes of the population in India. I agree with him that as regards the extremists&#x2014;whether they belong to the more advanced or the less advanced section&#x2014;reforms of this sort have nothing whatever to say or to do. That class of persons is implacable and irreconcilable. There is no passage in the utterance of the Secretary of State with which I am in more hearty agreement than that in which he said that unfaltering repression must be dealt out to persons of that class, and that neither himself nor the Viceroy would shrink from employing any measures, whether open to them under the existing law or called for by the circumstances of the case, to cope with this detestable and insidious conspiracy not merely against our rule but against civilisation itself.<lb/>
The noble Viscount then went on to speak of the impression produced by his proposals upon the body of moderate
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0090"/>
<col>131</col>
agitators. Here, again, I think he was entitled to congratulate himself. The only qualification I would make is that the satisfaction to which he referred with legitimate pride is, in the main, Hindu rather than Mahomedan satisfaction, as, indeed, he himself admitted, and that already in some of the speeches delivered by Hindu leaders I observe indications of an intention to make that which they have secured&#x2014;which, in many respects, was beyond their wildest expectations&#x2014;the ground at no distant date for demanding something more.<lb/>
I follow the noble Viscount also in his remarks with regard to the Indian Civil Service. But that is a subject which I should like to amplify. I have wondered during the last few weeks what is the attitude of the Civil servants towards the proposed reforms. I have wondered more particularly what their feelings must be in regard to the proposals to introduce a native into the Executive Council of the Viceroy, and to do away with the official majority in the local Legislative Councils. The few letters which I have received from India since the scheme was published do not fully bear out the sanguine expectations of the Secretary of State. When he appeals to the loyalty of the Civil Service in India he may confidently count upon their sense of duty, chivalry, and devotion to return him an adequate and a more than adequate response. But there is a corresponding obligation towards the Civil Service on the part of the Secretary of State, an obligation which I am sure no one will be more ready to acknowledge than the noble Viscount himself.<lb/>
If there is one thing more certain than another as the sequel of these changes it is that they will add enormously to the labours, the anxieties, and the preoccupations of the Civil servants from one end of India to the other. Exposed as they are now to constant and very often venomous attack from the native Press, there is scarcely one of their administrative or official acts that will not be brought under scrutiny in these enlarged Councils. They will have to spend a large portion of their time in obtaining information for these bodies, and they will have to spend a large portion of their time, as I think unnecessarily, in sitting upon these Councils also. In these circumstances, I am sure the Secretary of State will owe to this class of loyal and faithful Civil servants the
<col>132</col>
fullest measure of encouragement and support which it is in his power to give them. After all, it is the duty of the rulers of India, most particularly those in this country, to remember that they rule Englishmen in India as well as natives of India, that Englishmen in India have, on the whole, the more difficult part to play, and that they stand peculiarly in need of the consideration and support of the Secretary of State.<lb/>
But among the classes to be affected by this Bill there is another and a larger class to whom the noble Viscount made no allusion. I wonder how these changes will, in the last resort, affect the great mass of the people of India&#x2014;the people who have no vote and who scarcely have a voice. Remember that to these people, who form the bulk of the population of India, representative government, and electoral institutions are nothing whatever. What they want is not representative government, but good government; and if you could get to the bottom of their hearts you would find that they identify good government with government by Englishmen. The good government that appeals to them is the government which protects them from the rapacious moneylender and landlord, from the local vakeel, and all the other sharks in human disguise who prey upon these unhappy people. I have a misgiving that this class will not fare much better under these changes than they do now. At any rate I see no place for them in these enlarged Councils which are to be created, and I am under the strong opinion that as government in India becomes more and more Parliamentary&#x2014;as will be the inevitable result&#x2014;so it will become less paternal and less beneficent to the poorer classes of the population.<lb/>
I ought, perhaps, at this stage to say a word of thanks to the noble Viscount for the too generous and magnanimous terms in which he sketched what he believed to be his conception of the objects which, when I was in India, I had in view. I shall feel disposed to take a copy of his language and keep it in my pocket, and when on the platform, or over the way at no great distance, I read of remarks having been made of a very different character, emanating from those who claim to be followers of the noble Viscount, I shall in those moments of discouragement and despair take out that passage from his speech this evening and console myself by reading it.

<col>133</col>
It is true that different ideals actuate those who have to do with the government of India at different times. I accept the statement of the noble Viscount that in the days when I had something to do with that government what we set before ourselves was rather the progress of the people by the removal of abuses, by adopting a just and sympathetic attitude towards them, and by carrying out social, industrial, and administrative reforms. Political concessions were not then in the field. If I had proposed the scheme which the noble Vicount has laid before us I wonder what reception it would have met with, I will not say at the hands of my own party, but at the hands of the party of the noble Viscount himself. We must not forget that the first scheme of the noble Viscount was widely different from the scheme which we are discussing now. It was of a much more moderate description. If he were to taunt me I should be at liberty, I will not say to taunt him, but to point out to him that his point of view has also changed considerably in the last two years. However that may be, let us all admit that the situation has altered, and, so far as possible look at it through the noble Viscount's spectacles.<lb/>
There is one point to which I attach great importance. The noble Viscount spoke to us at some length about the advantage not merely of consulting, but of considering, the man on the spot, and he had an agreeable little gibe at the expense of the noble Marquess who sits next me and of myself. But is it so certain that in these reforms he has himself listened to the views&#x2014;not of the man on the spot, but of the men on the spot? In all his speeches, and indeed to-night, he has spoken as if there were only one man on the spot, the Viceroy. Of course the Viceroy is by far the most important of all the men on the spot, but what we have to consider is not whether the Secretary of State is in agreement solely with the Viceroy but with the Government of India as a whole. If you take the Despatch of the Government of India and the reply of the Secretary of State and put them side by side and analyse them very carefully, you will find, possibly as much to your surprise as it was to mine, that whereas the Secretary of State is constantly calling our attention to the accord that exists between himself and the Government of India, there were, on
<col>134</col>
the contrary, the widest differences between them. The proposals we are now considering are not the proposals of the Government of India at all, but the gloss and alteration of those proposals which commended themselves to the judgment of the Secretary of State. I will make that point quite clear, because it is of vital importance in the consideration of this question.<lb/>
In the first place, the Government of India proposed to retain the official majority in all the legislative councils, and the Secretary of State, it is true, has insisted on it and has even strengthened the proposals of the Government of India with regard to the Viceroy's Legislative Council, but he has dispensed with a majority altogether in the case of the provincial councils. Secondly, the Government of India elaborated a scheme for the representation of classes and minorities in India on these councils, and even suggested recourse to nomination where representation could not be secured. The Secretary of State swept that aside altogether and proposed for their consideration a scheme of electoral colleges of his own. Again, the Government of India said that it would be premature to discuss the enlargement of the Executive Councils in Madras or Bombay or the creation of new Executive Councils in the other provinces. They even said that the creation of councils with executive functions in provinces in which they did not exist would be a large departure from the present system of administration and was a change that could only be recommended after the fullest consideration and consultation with the heads of the provinces concerned. The Secretary of State, in reply to that caution, at once doubles these Councils in Madras and Bombay and announces the creation of new Executive Councils elsewhere. The Government of India said nothing about placing natives on any of the Executive Councils, but the Secretary of State proposes to place them on all. Whereas the Government of India said nothing about any development of local self-government on a large scale, probably because they considered it irrelevant, the Secretary of State, in two paragraphs of his Despatch, proposes a great scheme for de-officialising local bodies and for the introduction of something corresponding to the Local Government Board here. If we collate and compare these Despatches we find, therefore, that, so far from the Secretary of State having accepted the views of the men on the spot, he has, in reality, overruled and
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0092"/>
<col>135</col>
altered them at almost every critical and vital stage, and has substituted for them entirely independent proposals of his own. Do let it be borne in mind that what we are discussing are not proposals that have commended themselves to this great consensus of authority to which the noble Viscount so frequently appeals, but proposals which have commended themselves to him, no doubt with much expert assistance and obviously with the application to these questions of the wide historical and philosophical knowledge and the acute insight for which the noble Viscount is conspicuous. When the Secretary of State tossed that ball over the net to me here this evening I was rather pleased, because I felt that within half an hour it would be possible to return it with even greater vigour.<lb/>
May I take briefly in succession the proposals that this House is to be asked to consider and pass into law? I must apologise if in some cases I appear to depart from principle into minute details, but these details are only thoroughly familiar to those who have been concerned with the administration of India on the spot. In the first place, the Secretary of State proposes a large increase in the numbers on the Legislative Councils. The present strength in the Imperial Council and large Provincial Councils is from twenty-one to twenty-five, and in the case of the smaller Provincial Councils from ten to sixteen. The Government of India and the Secretary of State propose to raise the first figure to sixty-three, the large Provincial Councils to forty-seven, and the smaller Provincial Councils to the totals respectively of thirty-seven, twenty-five, and seventeen. I observe in the Papers no discussion about the question of numbers, but I remember that in 1892 there was no point upon which all the authorities both in India and in England were more agreed than that it was desirable to keep down the numbers on the councils so far as was possible, partly because of the difficulty of getting the men, partly because of the expense, and also because we feared the introduction of the vices as well as the virtues of the Parliamentary system. There may be good reasons for this enlargement with a view to rendering the councils more representative of the different classes and interests than they are now, but you must realise that this is a most immense and in its consequences revolutionary change.
<col>136</col>
Hitherto the councils of the Viceroy and the Governors have been small and compact bodies of men, conducting their legislative proceedings in halls or apartments of no great size, in circumstances of general quietude and decorum, with their proceedings resembling those of a Select Committee of this House. But all that is to be changed. With your large councils you must have larger halls, and you will probably be obliged to build them for the purpose. You are going to have no official majority and you even withdraw from the chair of the council the commanding authority of the Viceroy or the Governor as the case may be, and you are going to concede to these bodies, within certain limits, very wide powers of amendment, resolution, voting, and so on. In one of his speeches the noble Viscount assured us that he had no ambition to set up any sort of Parliamentary system in India, or "even to share in the beginning of that operation." I do not doubt that in uttering those words the noble Viscount was entirely sincere, but believe me that, though it may not be his ambition, it will inevitably be the consequence of his act. These enlarged councils will be increasingly Parliamentary bodies in miniature; attended, no doubt, by many advantages, but also followed by many of the drawbacks with which we in this country are familiar in that system.<lb/>
The noble Viscount has in one case literally gone out of his way to introduce what, at any rate from the Indian point of view, I regard as one of the greatest of these drawbacks. He has actually encouraged and permitted the asking of supplementary questions in the Legislative Councils. We all know that the asking of supplementary questions has developed into a fine art in a Chamber not far removed from this, and some of us in this House endeavoured to the best of our humble ability in our day to perfect the art of rejoinder also. But such is the confidence that I have in the ingenuity and ability of those Indian lawyers who will constitute the main portion of these new councils when they come into existence, that I believe that the utmost achievements of the experts in the House of Commons will pale before what they will accomplish in India. And remember that on the other side there will be no corresponding advantage. The Indian official is primarily an administrator and
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0093"/>
<col>137</col>
secondly a writer. He is not a speaker at all. He has no training whatever, either in the arts of Parliamentary evasion or in the still more difficult science of Parliamentary repartee. There will be no Speaker in the chair to protect him, as in the House of Commons, and no body of tradition already existing in the House to which he can turn for defence. I very much doubt whether, in making this concession, the noble Viscount has realised the enormous difference between the Indian system and our system, and whether, in return for the small, almost microscopical advantages that may result from the change, he is not putting a burden on our administrators in India which will bear hardly on them and will react unfavourably on the administration itself.<lb/>
I next turn to the question of the official majority in the Legislative Councils. Here, as the noble Viscount justly pointed out, he has taken, at any rate with regard to the Supreme Legislative Council, a stronger position than the Government of India. It is, if I may say so, the only respect in which he has bettered the position of the Government of India. In everything else, in my judgment, he has made the position a good deal worse. The Government of India were content with a majority in the Supreme Legislative Council, which should be dependent on the single vote, in the last resort, of the Viceroy, and they were willing to dispense, on ordinary occasions, with the official majority so long as it was, so to speak, in reserve ready to be mobilised whenever required. The noble Viscount has, rightly I think, objected to that. He points out that it would place the Viceroy in an invidious position, that there would be disadvantages in the bringing up of these forces, and that, although the majority need not be large, it ought to be assured and constant.<lb/>
If I may offer an opinion, I entirely agree with this line of reasoning. But I ask the noble Viscount to observe what will be the results. There will be upon the councils of sixty-three which he is proposing&#x2014;I am now speaking of the official members of the body&#x2014;first, the Executive Council, <i>i.e</i>., the Cabinet, the Viceroy and the Lieutenant-Governor, nine; secondly, the official members from the other provinces, eight; and, thirdly, the nominated officials, eighteen. In other words, thirty-five officers are to be taken from their work
<col>138</col>
to sit upon these unnecessarily swollen bodies. I venture to ask the noble Viscount seriously to consider this question&#x2014;where are these men to come from, and who are they to be? Under the existing system there are, in the Viceroy's Legislative Council, in addition to the Executive Council itself, six officials from other provinces&#x2014;Bombay, Madras, and so on. This distinction is usually conferred on those officers as a compliment to an eminent man at the end of his career, or else as a sort of vacation to an officer who has been through a spell of very hard work. But it is notorious that, when they came to Calcutta, in ordinary sessions they had nothing whatever to do except on the rare occasions when the Legislative Council is sitting.<lb/>
And not merely are they themselves idle, but, drawn as they are from their provinces, they create the first of a chain of vacancies which has to be filled up all the way down the scale, with the result that there is an interruption to the continuity and vigour of administration of the most unfortunate description. And now, under this scheme, there are to be, not only six officials in this position, but twenty-six&#x2014;that is to say, thirty-five <i>minus</i> the eight members of the Executive Council and the Lieutenant-Governor. Nothing can be more clear than this, that whether these men are brought from Calcutta or from outside provinces, they will in either case be taken from their work, and more particularly will this be the case in the month of March, when, under the new regulations for discussing the Budget, they will be required from day to day. I hope the noble Viscount will favour us with an opinion on this question, because I think he will find some reason for doubting whether, in order to maintain the majority in these councils of sixty-three, it is desirable to inflict the very serious blow on the continuity of work in Calcutta and elsewhere which must almost inevitably be the consequence.<lb/>
Perhaps, as I have ventured to criticise on that point, the Secretary of State will allow me to say of the proposals for allowing wider discussion, whether of the Budget or general administrative issues, either by amendments or voting, or even by proposing Bills, that I have nothing but approval. Every one of us, whether we have been at Calcutta or in the other provinces, has felt the lack of the oppor-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0094"/>
<col>139</col>
tunity of explaining our policy to the people. At every stage we found ourselves overwhelmed with misrepresentation, ignorance, calumny, abuse. We have, all of us, tried in our way to meet that difficulty. Sometimes we sent official <i>communiqu&#x00E9;s</i> to the papers, but official <i>communiqu&#x00E9;s</i> seem everywhere in the world to carry with them a certain taint of suspicion. Then one Viceroy tried the system of a Government paper in Calcutta, but that was not altogether successful. In my day we had a Press room, in which we used to give out to members of the Press, English or native, whatever Government information it was possible to hand to them. But none of these measures has covered the field, and I earnestly hope that with these enlarged opportunities of discussion which the noble Viscount is creating there may arise for the Government of India the much-desired opportunity of explaining its policy and stating its case.<lb/>
I turn to the question of the provincial legislative councils. Here the noble Viscount has dispensed altogether with an official majority, and he uses two arguments for taking that very decisive and important step. The first is that the experiment has been tried in Bombay with success. I will leave those noble Lords behind me who are familiar with Bombay to answer that point. I will merely observe that Bombay is in a wholly exceptional position from any other capital or province in India. It is a city of a peculiarly cosmopolitan character; it has a very high standard of public spirit; there is a native community there of Parsees, the leading members of which are strong supporters of the Government; and an analogy drawn from Bombay as to what is likely to happen elsewhere is, I think, likely to be erroneous. The second argument is that, as long as the non-officials are in a minority, it is likely to breed in them an attitude of peevish and sulky and permanent opposition, which has an injurious effect on their mind and character. I do not think that being in a permanent minority has had that effect on the non-official members of the Legislative Councils in India any more than it has had that effect on those who are in a permanent minority in this House.<lb/>
I have always found in India a very high standard of good temper as well as ability, and I never remember, even when we voted down our opponents, any symptoms of the character to which the noble Viscount alludes. But, whether that be so or not,
<col>140</col>
what is the alternative to which the Secretary of State now invites us? The non-official majority of these councils is to have the power of moving and carrying resolutions, of introducing and even carrying Bills against the wish of the Government; and the utmost the Secretary of State offers us is this&#x2014;that if they carry anything that is disagreeable to the local government, it may be vetoed by the Governor, and that if they reject any Bill which the local government desires should pass, the Government of India is to be brought in as a <i>Deus ex machina</i> to pass it over their heads. There is none of us who has had experience of administration in India who will not view that position with some dismay. Just as the noble Viscount himself was seeking in his provisions with regard to the Supreme Legislative Council, to save the Viceroy from the invidious position of having a casting vote, so ought he to wish to save the Governors of the provincial councils from the invidious task of exercising the veto. And it is indeed a curious commentary on the well-known and admitted desire, of the noble Viscount to free the local governments of India from the trammels of interference from the supreme Government that, almost within a few weeks of the time when, as we understand, large measures of decentralisation are to be proposed, he distinctly contemplates the issue in which the supreme Government will be brought in to rectify mistakes that have been made in the Legislative Councils. I hope&#x2014;I have no right to express more than a hope&#x2014;that this is a question which the noble Viscount will be kind enough to consider. I really fear he is breeding great mischief in connection with this non-official majority on the Provincial Councils. It will be in the power of these persons almost to bring government to a standstill if they choose. In the present <i>eirenicon</i> which we hope now prevails in India there is, perhaps, not much danger, but I can well conceive a time when passions will be aroused in the future and when the powers now being lightly given may be used with very serious and detrimental effect.<lb/>
I will only make a passing observation about the method of election to the councils, and in that I will follow the lines suggested by the noble Viscount himself. The situation, as I understand, is this. The Government of India, feeling that great caution ought to be observed in
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0095"/>
<col>141</col>
the matter, and conscious of the immense difference that prevails between the conditions of the different provinces, said that they could not prescribe any one scheme for returning members to these councils, but that in some cases they hoped that regular electorates might be constituted, that in others associations might be utilised for the purpose, and that in many cases where no machinery either existed or could be created nomination might have to be resorted to. But then the noble Viscount appears on the scene and sweeps all this away, and, though he does not prescribe&#x2014;he was careful not to do that&#x2014;in very strong language he commended the scheme of electoral colleges to the Government of India. That scheme, in the case of the Mahomedans, has, as he admitted tonight, broken down irremediably. I need not pursue the argument, because the noble Viscount stated, and I think we all agree with his decision, that, in consequence of the representations made to him, he had decided to abandon that scheme in its application to the Mahomedans, and that he was willing to consider an exclusively Mahomedan electorate returning representatives to an exclusively Mahomedan electoral college. I think, if I may say so, that that is a wise and statesmanlike decision. But I would like the noble Viscount to go rather further.<lb/>
We have not yet heard, and I do not know whether the noble Viscount has received, the opinion of the Government of India about electoral colleges in general, but I venture to say, so far as I have a right to speak, that electoral colleges are profoundly unsuited to the Indian system and the Indian character, and that you will find almost everywhere that the result of founding these colleges will be that they will be manipulated by the Hindus, who have a great faculty for organisation of that description, and who in a few years time will have got the whole of the representative system of India into their hands. That, I think, would be an undesirable and serious result, and I hope this is a question which the noble Viscount will be willing to consider before the later stages of the Bill.<lb/>
I approach the last two questions with which I am called upon to deal. One is a smaller one, and the other is a larger one. The smaller one, and yet one of great importance in its possible effect, is the enlargement of the existing Provincial
<col>142</col>
Councils in Madras and Bombay and the creation of new Executive Councils in the other provinces. I have already quoted the remark of the Government of India, in which they say they think the discussion of this question is entirely premature at the present time. But the noble Viscount has rushed in where they feared to tread, and in his Despatch has practically ordered this great change to take place. Are we not entitled to ask for this information&#x2014;do the Governors of Madras and Bombay want their Executive Councils increased from two to four, or are they to be increased simply in order to provide the noble Viscount with an opportunity of appointing to them one, or possibly more than one, native member? Do the Lieutenant-Governors in the other provinces&#x2014;the United Provinces, Bengal, and so on&#x2014;do they want Executive Councils created in their provinces for the first time? There would, in my judgment, be no greater mistake than to suppose that an Executive Council is necessarily a synonym for administrative efficiency. In Madras and Bombay, where these councils have long existed and done excellent work, it is well known that the main reason for their constitution is that the Governor, as a rule, is an English statesman or politician brought from England, ignorant of the country, and requiring guidance. But often as I heard this question discussed in India I never heard but one reply, and it was this, that in the less highly organised and more backward areas the best system of government was that which brought the personality of the Governor into closest contact with the people; in other words, a Chief Commissioner. A Chief Commissioner has no council; he has no secretariat; he has a smaller province and is able to go about himself. He does everything himself and is in direct contact with the population. Then in the more highly organised areas, where there is a much more complex administrative hierarchy, there is required a Lieutenant-Governor. But I never met a Lieutenant-Governor who wanted an Executive Council. I never met one who would not, I think, have shuddered at the prospect. And yet here is the noble Viscount about not merely to increase the Executive Councils of Madras and Bombay, but to supply these councils to a number of these Lieutenant-Governors. I think we are entitled to ask for some information as to their views upon this matter.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0096"/>
<col>143</col>
Here, again, may I make an appeal to the noble Viscount? I have alluded to his well-known desire to decentralise in India. Now, if you have Executive Councils in these provinces, where they do not now exist, what does it mean? It is one of the most centralising measures that you could devise. Executive Councils mean officers&#x2014;men of ability and capacity at the top, omnivorous for work, searching for information, sending for reports from their district officers from all parts of the country. But the district officer is the man whom you want to release, to extricate from the trammels of bureaucracy and officialism, and if you start these Legislative Councils you will be doing precisely the opposite thing, and you will be adding to those centralising features in the government which nobody desires more than the noble Viscount to destroy.<lb/>
Then again, what is to become of the Board of Revenue? Are the Boards of Revenue in the United Provinces and in Madras and Bengal to be dispensed with? And what are we to say of the question of expense? I observe in reading the despatches no mention of the cost of any stage of these proceedings. But look at what it must all amount to. The Secretary of State proposes to appoint the new executive councillors in Madras and Bombay and elsewhere. I gather that the total number of them must be twelve to fifteen. These gentlemen will receive from &#x00A3;3,000 to &#x00A3;4,000 a year a-piece. Then there are the new legislative councils, or, rather, the enlarged legislative councils, with numbers varying from twenty and twenty-five to forty-seven and sixty-three. Every one of the members of these councils has travelling expenses and residential allowance, and really, when the items are reckoned, the bill becomes a very considerable one. I think the noble Viscount will agree that before we enter Committee this information should, if possible, be given to this House.<lb/>
And now I turn, in conclusion, to the last question, which I said was one of great importance, and which the noble Viscount himself was far from minimising, I mean the question of the admission of natives to the Executive Council of the Viceroy, or the Executive Councils of the other governments. I hope I shall be saying nothing in this that will in the smallest degree imply disagreement from that generous conception
<col>144</col>
of the capacities of educated Indian gentlemen which appeared in the speech of the noble Viscount, and which, from my own experience, I desire to endorse most heartily. But it is not a question of the capacity of the individuals; this is a question of a great principle, raising the whole issues of our government in India and the foundation upon which it rests. Yes, that is strong language, but I propose to justify it. Here is this great and, as the noble Marquess called it, tremendous innovation. Not a word about it is to be found in the despatch of the Government of India. Over and over again the Secretary of State has informed us, with pardonable pride, that he is in absolute accord with the Governor-General of India. Yes, but is he in equal accord with the Governor-General in Council? Then what about the Council at home? I think I have a recollection of hearing not very long ago that a committee sat upon this question&#x2014;I think in the India Office here&#x2014;who were reported to be unanimously opposed to the scheme. Then the noble Viscount assured us that he had the support of one conspicuous Indian officer. That may well be, but I do think we ought to know what is the opinion of the Government of India at the present time, and that this House should not be invited to discuss this matter without more information than it at present possesses.<lb/>
More than once in his speech the Secretary of State made use of an analogy against which I hope he will allow me respectfully to protest, and that was the analogy between the Viceroy's Council in India and his own Council in Charles Street. There is not even the remotest resemblance or analogy between the two bodies. The Council of the Secretary of State is a purely consultative body of gentlemen, who are engaged in various activities, and sit on various Committees, who see Papers which are laid upon the Table, but who can, if necessary, be kept unacquainted with all the secret work of government, or at any rate with all that part of the secret work of government which does not involve the expenditure of money. The noble Viscount can with great advantage invite not one but two or three native gentlemen to sit upon his Council, and their advice to him may be very valuable, but the situation is entirely different in India. The Council of the Viceroy there is not a consultative body; it is the great executive body of the country, it is the Cabinet of India.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0097"/>
<col>145</col>
All the functions of government are concentrated in that body at Calcutta or Simla, and further they are all divided up between the different members of that body, each member assuming charge of this department or that, or of a group of departments. And further, the main feature of the system in India is the common responsibility that prevails. There is no inner or outer Cabinet, such as we sometimes hear of in this country; there is only one Cabinet, and because it is small its members know everything. The Commander-in-Chief in India has a voice and a vote upon the question of education, just as the legal member of the Council may give a vote and have an opinion upon the frontier. What then ensues? That in order to fill this Council adequately you want men with a double range of capacities. First, you want a man who has an expert knowledge of the department over which he is going to be called upon to preside, and secondly you want him to possess that wide knowledge of men and affairs which we sum up in the word "statesmanship," which enables a man to give a vote and to exercise an opinion upon large issues, with the details of which he may not be acquainted, but which come before him in his capacity as a public man.<lb/>
It is, of course, conceivable that a native gentleman may possess both those gifts; he may be an expert and a statesman&#x2014;there might be room for him in that capacity, but there is no room for him as a native alone. As a qualified person, possibly Yes; as a native alone, No. The noble Viscount to-night asked us whether it would not be a great shame to exclude a native gentleman of the character that he spoke of, so highly qualified and able as he might be. But the other night, when laying stress upon that same point he went on to say that it would be a great advantage to the Governor-General to have the advice of a man who belongs to the country, and who can give him the Indian point of view. But that is the racial qualification&#x2014;he is going away from the administrative qualification and introducing the racial qualification almost in the same breath as he disowns it. The Secretary of State seemed to think that because he derives great advantage from native councillors in London the Viceroy would derive equal advantage from the assistance of a native member on his Executive Council in India. But he is not denied the advantage of that assis-
<col>146</col>
tance whenever he desires it. Every day, every week, that passes he is in consultation and correspondence with native gentlemen. It is not necessary, to get native advice in India, to put a man into the Cabinet in order to obtain it.<lb/>
May I ask the noble Viscount to consider these questions? If he recommends His Majesty to appoint, as apparently he intends to do, a native gentleman on the Council, he may appoint him because he is the best man and the most competent, but the natives of India will regard him as having been appointed because he is an Indian, and for no other reason. If he is a Hindu, will he have the confidence of Mahomedans? We know he will not. If he is a Mahomedan, will he have the confidence of Hindus? No. If he is a Hindu, will he have the confidence of Hindus? Strange and paradoxical as it may seem to say so, there is no one Hindu capable of carrying the confidence of Hindus generally. Whether he be Hindu or Mahomedan, will there not at once be raised an agitation for the appointment of a corresponding member to represent other sections of the community, Parsees, Sikhs, Eurasians, Buddhists, and others? Further, for this matter must be pursued, if he be a Hindu, to what class is he to belong? Is he to be a blameless and possibly a moderately distinguished official who has mounted the official grade until he has attained the rank of Commissioner or Deputy-Commissioner? If that sort of man is to be appointed, I say unhesitatingly he will not carry throughout the country that respect that ought to attach to a member of the Council. Not only so, his appointment will be received with considerable ill-feeling and agitation among the parties pressing for the change who will think that, having secured the change, they are entitled to put their own representative in the place.<lb/>
This is a matter of importance. Is the man to be appointed to be the blameless official, or is he to be the successful political agitator? I am sure the noble Viscount, if he does not repudiate will deprecate the latter suggestion, but it is certain that the agitating classes in India will claim that the native member, if not now, shall in the future be selected from the ranks of their best men. They have borne the burden and heat of the day, they have been conspicuously successful, and are they to be denied access to the seats of the mighty? It will be a serious matter to consider what class the member shall be taken from.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0098"/>
<col>147</col>
The noble Lord has said that natives of India excel in capacity for acquiring legal knowledge and for the administration of the law, and I agree with him. But is the native member to be appointed to be always the law member? It may be difficult to find a person who is qualified if he is not to be a political agitator and not the legal member, and the position may thus be arrived at that in the future you will have to keep to the appointment of a native law member. Is that to be desired? Looking back over the long history of Indian administration, we find distinguished men, such as Lord Macaulay, Sir J. Fitzjames Stephen, Sir H. Maine, taking their legal training and forensic ability to India and also applying to Indian problems the resources of their great and statesmanlike minds. If it should come about that in the future the law membership of the Council must be reserved for a native, and if that path is closed to Englishmen and the intellectual flow from England to India is stopped, I venture to say that both England and India will suffer from the change.<lb/>
The noble Viscount can of course, as he reminds us, take what steps he pleases and make any recommendation to the Sovereign he desires. But I do, without giving utterance to the slightest feeling of hostility to natives or making invidious comparisons between native and British intellect, invite his serious consideration to these points. If this appointment is made he will for the first time detract in the public estimation from the sense of the absolute impartiality and neutrality that the Council of the Viceroy has always held among all classes in India from the highest chief to the lowest peasant. The native of India will not believe that any member of his race or even of his own creed is capable of that detachment, that absolute sense of justice, and that impartiality which he has always recognised in the Council. In the second place, I doubt very much, if you could take a plebiscite throughout all India, whether you would get a vote for this proposal. I believe it would be rejected by a large majority.<lb/>
In the third place, although this is a consideration to which I do not know that I am entitled to attach great weight, the noble Viscount with his sense of continuity must be aware that this step once taken cannot be recalled. Succeeding Governments will have to do the same thing, the step taken cannot be retraced, and it is
<col>148</col>
certain that an agitation not for one member but for two members will continue and will increase, and it may be that in the future we shall look back with regret to the day when the noble Viscount set rolling this ball, the ultimate destination of which cannot be foreseen. Lastly, although I do not want to lay too much stress upon it, a breach will be made by such an appointment in the crown and core of British sovereignty and rule in India. You are now not only extending the range of the power Indians may exercise over Indians&#x2014;let that be developed to the widest reasonable extent&#x2014;but you are putting them on the council to rule not only Indian but British subjects in India. It is a momentous proposal. The issue seems small, but it is a very considerable one indeed, and I hope your lordships will in the next few weeks regard it as one of the most important matters you are allowed&#x2014;not to decide&#x2014;but to discuss. I am grateful to your lordships for giving attention to what I am afraid have been tedious remarks, and I hope, though they have been critical, you will believe they are not inspired in a sense hostile to the general scheme of the noble Viscount.<lb/>
To sum up my impression in a few words, I would say that I think he is disposed to go a little too fast. If he would moderate his pace, if he would adjust his measure a little more closely to the slower gait of the "men on the spot," to whom reference has so often been made, the better it will be for his scheme and for India. I am sure the noble Viscount can have no higher desire than to carry with him the approval of those best qualified to form a judgment in this country and in India. For my own part and for those who sit near me, I can say we shall be sincerely delighted if we can join hands with him in laying afresh and sinking deeper and firmer the foundations of our rule in the confidence and esteem of the Indian peoples.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, when the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India made his statement in your Lordships' House last December, I expressed my general approval, though on certain points I was unable to follow the noble Viscount. During the course of his remarks to-night he said there was nothing like a past history to help one to a comprehension of the present. I feel, my Lords, that I shall be unable to put my views regarding the Bill properly
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0099"/>
<col>149</col>
before your Lordships unless you allow me, as briefly as I can, to trace the main and most salient points in the long sequence of events in India which culminate in your Lordships' presence here to-night.<lb/>
The Bill is the latest product of that system of education which the wisdom of our predecessors introduced into India. Regarding the wisdom of that policy, the policy of opening to the East the storerooms of Western knowledge, I, for one, have no doubt; and no episode during the stormy days of the Mutiny has appeared to me more worthy of admiration than when Lord Canning, beset on all sides by perils, turned to his Legislative Council and passed the Act upon which the Indian Universities were based. But, although I have no doubt as to the wisdom of the policy of education for India, I have very serious doubts as to the method by which effect was given to that policy. That question, however, is not in issue here to-night, and I only refer to the matter with the object of making my first point, which is that our system of education in India has developed in the students who have attended our colleges and schools a special aptitude for politics. The effect of that is that they throw themselves more into politics than into industrial and commercial pursuits. Accordingly, there grew up an English Press, shortly afterwards followed by a vernacular Press, which was hostile to the Government, and which has been at the root of the present difficulties.<lb/>
During the first twenty-five years after the Mutiny, the Government in India allowed things educational pretty much to take their course, and it was not until the Administration of the noble Marquess, Lord Ripon, that there was a general overhauling of the situation. It will be within the remembrance of noble Lords who may have been in India at that time that two important Commissions were appointed, one to examine into the educational system, and the other to consider the question of the enlargement of local government. The results of the Education Commission were valuable, but the native population attached far more importance to the inquiry into local government. The result was the establishment of a system of district councils and local boards in India, which, at the time, satisfied the aspirations of native politicians. But few years passed
<col>150</col>
before it became clear that the object of native politicians in India was not so much the onerous and thankless task of local government. They flew at much higher game, and aimed at such a change in the system of government as would enable them to control the administration of affairs. It was with that view that the Indian National Congress was formed, which held its first meeting in the year 1885. That Congress laid down its programme in the following terms:&#x2014;
<quote>"That the Imperial and Provincial Legislative Councils be reconstituted on the following bases:&#x2014;(1) The numbers to be materially increased, not less than one-half to be elected, not more than one-fourth to be <i>ex officio</i> members; and not more than one-fourth to be members nominated by the Government; (2) members of Local Legislative Councils to be elected by municipal committees, local boards, chambers of commerce, and universities; (3) the elected members of the Governor-General's Legislative Council to be elected by the elected members of the Local Legislative Councils; (4) all residents in India, without distinction of race, creed, caste, etc., to be eligible for membership; (5) all legislative and financial questions, including Budgets, to be submitted to and dealt with by the councils, which should also have the right of interpellation in regard to all matters of Administration; and (6) the Executive Government to have, for reasons to be stated, the right to overrule the majority; but in that case the majority to have the right to appeal to a Standing Committee of the House of Commons on Indian Affairs which should be established."</quote>
That was the beginning of the Indian National Congress which has played such an important part in the subsequent proceedings.<lb/>
The Governments of Lord Dufferin and of the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition in your Lordships' House took into their consideration the circumstances of the time and the claims of native politicians, and for several years carefully discussed whether any advance could be made in the way of modifying and liberalising the then existing system of government in India. These consultations resulted in the Indian Councils Act of 1892, to which reference has been made in the course of the debate. That legislation for a considerable time seemed to satisfy the aspirations of native politicians; and it was not until the year 1904 that any very serious claim for further political privileges was made in India. In that year there was considerable agitation, got up partly in consequence of what is known as the Partition of Bengal, and for other reasons; and at the Congress which was
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0100"/>
<col>151</col>
held in 1904 the following resolutions were passed&#x2014;
<quote>"That in the opinion of the Congress the time has arrived when the people of tins country should be allowed a larger voice in the administration and control of the affairs of their country by:&#x2014;
(a) The bestowal on each Province or Presidency of India of the franchise to return at least two members to the English House of Commons; (b) an enlargement of both the Supreme and Provincial Legislative Councils&#x2014;increasing the number of non-official members therein, and giving them the right to divide the Council in all financial matters coming before them&#x2014;the head of the Government concerned possessing the power of veto; (c) the appointment of at least one Indian as a Member of Indian Council in London and of the Executive Councils of the Government of India and the Governments of Bombay and Madras."</quote>
That was a new departure in Indian political agitation, but it was a moderate departure compared with the succeeding demand, which was to the following effect:&#x2014;
<quote>"The bestowal on each of the provinces of India of the franchise to return at least two members to the British House of Commons; (b) the appointment of not less than three Indian gentlemen of proved ability and experience, as members of the Secretary of State's Council; and (c) the appointment of two Indians as members of the Governor-General's Executive Council. and of one Indian as a member of the Executive Councils of Bombay and Madras."</quote><lb/>
And even that further claim to political privileges was improved upon by the subsequent Congress, which claimed for India the status of a Colonial Government. Thus, my Lords, you will see that, step by step, the demands of the Congress advanced. In the year 1907 the physical force party prevailed, and the Congress was broken up.<lb/>
Such was the situation in India when the Secretary of State and the Government of India came to consider the situation. Their proposals were put forward in a letter contained in one of the Blue-books laid before us. The proposals were of a very moderate character. The proposals of the Government of India, which had been sanctioned previously by the Secretary of State, were as follows:&#x2014;(1) the creation of advisory councils; (2) the enlargement of the Legislative Councils; (3) such an alteration of the system of election to seats in the Council as would give representation to the landed and moneyed classes and to Mahomedans; and (4) the more effective discussion of the budget. In these proposals there was
<col>152</col>
nothing which was not fully within the spirit and the meaning of the Councils Act of 1892. All the authorities and officers in India were consulted upon these proposals, and after a year's consultation and consideration the Governor-General in Council sent in his final recommendations to the Secretary of State. They were to the effect that advisory councils were not desirable, that the Legislative Councils should be considerably enlarged, that the qualified right of election for seats in the councils should be made absolute, and that the discussion of the details of the budget and the right of interpellation should be considerably extended. The official majorities in all these Councils remained untouched, though an intention was expressed of not making use of the official majorities in ordinary circumstances.<lb/>
Such was the state of affairs when these proposals came before the Secretary of State. In the Secretary of State's letter, in reply, an important advance was made, as Lord Curzon has said, on any proposal that had been made by the Government of India. That important advance was the creation of Executive Councils for Lieutenant-Governorships and the appointment of native members to the Executive Councils of Presidencies. For my own part I am disposed to think that, as government by councils has existed so long in the Presidencies of Madras and Bombay, it is wise to take a step in advance and to admit native members to these Executive Councils. I think the time has come when some progress in a liberal direction must be made in India, and when competent and trustworthy native gentlemen are found they should be utilised and associated with the Government more in the direction of affairs than they are at the present time. I quite agree with the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, when he says that these appointments on Executive Councils ought not to be made the spoil of politicians. If natives are admitted to the Executive Councils of Madras and Bombay, the same qualifications and the same rules of eligibility should apply to them as apply now to the European members of these Councils. At the present time no European can be a member of the Council of the Governor of Madras or Bombay unless he has served twelve years in the service of the Crown. Having regard to the fact stated by Lord Curzon that these Executive Councils are not debating
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0101"/>
<col>153</col>
bodies but that the members hold administrative portfolios, I think it is only proper and right in the interests of the vast majority of the people that no person should be appointed who was not fit for the task. It may be taken as certain that no politician who only acquires his prominence by platform work is competent to administer the work of an Indian Department unless he has also had large experience and special training. I therefore think that if native members are appointed they should be taken from the ranks of the public service, and that the same qualification of twelve years service should apply to them as to Europeans.<lb/>
With regard to Executive Councils for Lieutenant-Governors, I am certainly most strongly opposed to the proposal. I find in the letter of the noble Viscount the Secretary of State the statement that the establishment of Executive Councils for Lieutenant-Governors is not new. So far as my experience goes, it is an entirely novel proposal. Reference is made to the discussions which took place in regard to councils in the time of Sir John Lawrence. I have not lately seen the official Papers, and I hope if the matter is pressed they will be placed before your Lordships. But my remembrance of them is that at that time the discussion concerned the establishment in Bengal and in the United Provinces of a Governor with his Council and not of a Lieutenant-Governor. In the Vice-royalty of Lord William Bentinck in 1835 an Act was passed establishing a Governor and Council in the Province of Bengal and in what is now known as the Province of Agra. The idea was to extend to those parts of India the same method of government as in Madras and Bombay. But no sooner was the Act passed than its unsuitability to that part of the country was discovered, and another Act was passed suspending it and appointing a Lieutenant-Governor with no Council instead of the Governor and Council which had been previously provided for. From then up to the time that I ceased to be connected with India I never heard the desirability of giving Lieutenant-Governors a Council discussed in India. I did hear that the question of creating a Council for Bengal proper&#x2014;that part of Bengal in which the Bengali-speaking people live&#x2014;had been discussed. I myself think there is a great deal to be
<col>154</col>
said for the creation of a Council in Bengal if we could go back on the recent past, because Bengal is the most educated and until a few years past was by far the most docile and the most easily-governed part of India&#x2014;a part in which no serious questions of political difficulty arose. There it seemed to me and to others that municipal government by means of a Council might well be allowed.<lb/>
If any matter was driven home to us at the time of the Mutiny it was the need in Hindustan of concentration of power in the hands of an individual and maintenance of individual responsibility. Any Indian officer of experience can tell you of the suddenness with which emergencies arise, the necessity for individual initiative, and there is no Indian authority of weight who would say that he would like, in these circumstances, to be hampered by a Council and to have to discuss with the members what ought to be done and what ought not to be done in a particular emergency. I have called attention to the demands of the National Congress and pointed out how those demands gradually rose, but in not one of those demands, not even in the most extreme one, was the recommendation of a Council for Lieutenant-Governors ever put forward. That was put forward for the first time by the Secretary of State. Lord Curzon has dwelt on that aspect of the case. He has called your Lordships' attention to the hesitating and tentative way in which the Government of India refer, at the end of their Despatch, to the desirability of considering with care and caution, after consultation with their officers, and so forth, the possibility and the probability of creating a Council. The Secretary of State for India thereupon refers to discussions which seem to me&#x2014;I have not seen the papers recently, and my memory may be imperfect&#x2014;to relate to an entirely different state of things. He decides that it is desirable to solve the question, to invite no more discussion, and to decide off-hand a matter which lies at the very root of your power and your administration in those provinces of India where danger is always nearest the surface. I venture to say that if there is anything which calls for the most careful deliberation, for reference to the Local Governments, for consultation with important native gentlemen and the large landowners who have a stake in the country, it is this question, and above all
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0102"/>
<col>155</col>
others it ought not be decided or carried out in the manner now proposed.<lb/>
I object to the Bill which is before your Lordships to-day for three reasons. I object to the appointment of Executive Councils for Lieutenant-Governorships; I object to the admission of natives to the Councils of Madras and Bombay without the qualifications which apply to Europeans; and I object to the provision of the Bill which makes the powers of Lieutenant-Governors no longer dependent upon the wording of positive law, but upon proclamations and orders of a variable character which can be varied from time to time according to the idiosyncrasies of any Secretary of State of the day or Viceroy in Council. I wish to say one word in regard to the matter which has been dealt with so fully by Lord Curzon&#x2014;namely, the appointment of a native to the Viceroy's Council. I was highly pleased by the exhaustive manner in which Lord Curzon placed before your Lordships the objections to that measure. I consider myself that it is one of the most fatal steps which at the present time could possibly be taken by the Government in this country. The noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, stated the other day that the action of the Secretary of State was practically imposing "a disqualification against Englishmen." I will take higher ground, and say that in the best interests of the native races and of India nothing should be done which would in the slightest degree impair the efficiency of the English Government in India or the respect in which it is held by the peoples of India, and especially the native Princes. I cannot conceive any measures more likely to prejudice the native Princes against us than the appointment of a native to the Viceroy's Council, because the Viceroy's Council has always been looked upon by them as the <i>corps d'&#x00E9;lite</i> of the service&#x2014;composed of men of the highest honour, and in whose absolute impartiality every native of India has complete confidence.<lb/>
During thirty-five years service in India I never heard one breath of suspicion attaching to any member of the Viceroy's Council. The members of that Council are always regarded as of the highest probity&#x2014;men in whom the native Princes repose confidences which they would not repose even in their own people. I regret that such a body as that should be weakened
<col>156</col>
by the introduction of a foreign element; for no matter how competent the native gentleman may be, he is still foreign in that body, and will be regarded as foreign by the native Princes and by the majority of the people of India. I think it must now be admitted that the appointment of a native member of the Viceroy's Council has been accepted by no body of opinion in England or in India, except by the Hindu politicians who support these proposals. It is opposed by the Mahomedans unless they can get a man of their own upon it. I think the vast mass of the English Civil Service in India is opposed to it. All those I have spoken to are opposed to it, and I think it would be a fatal thing if the success of these measures&#x2014;some of them are very great measures&#x2014;is imperilled, as it will be in the opinion of the vast mass of the people of India, by such an appointment as this.<lb/>
One final word in regard to the withdrawal of the majorities in the provincial Legislative Councils. I do not object to the withdrawal of the official majority so long as the nominated members and the official members are a majority in the Council. It is possible to carry any Bill which is not strongly opposed to the feelings of the people by means of the official members and the nominated non-official members forming in the Council a majority. You will have amongst your elected members European members of Chambers of Commerce, you will have a large Mahomedan element, and you will have men of standing and sense nominated by Government on whom they can generally rely. Therefore I do not object to that part of the noble Viscount's proposal. Those are all the remarks which occur to me. While I am in general sympathy with the liberal policy of the noble Viscount, I object to it on these points where it touches the safety of the British power in India, and weakens the initiative and responsibility of the officer on the spot, who in the last resort is the strength of our Empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the general purport of the remarks I have to make is approval of the scheme of reform which will be set in motion by the Bill now before us&#x2014;not critical approval, I might even say destructively critical approval, such as has been expressed by my noble friend who sits in front of me and the noble Lord who has just sat down, but sincere
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0103"/>
<col>157</col>
and, I might almost say, enthusiastic approval. There is not one of the objections which were put forward by the noble Lord who spoke second which has not been present in my mind during the time that I have considered this scheme; but, even when they were put forward with all that brilliancy and cogency of eloquence which we are accustomed to hear from him, they did not convince me.<lb/>
Mine is no recently-formed opinion on this subject. I am not being carried away by the current of public opinion which has recently set in on this subject. Before I left India three years ago I had formed my opinions. I did not express them publicly because I did not think it right to prejudice affairs for which I was just about to quit responsibility; but the noble Viscount the Secretary of State may possibly remember the manner in which I wrote to him on this subject. The records of the Madras Government will show that I myself, just before I left, made a tentative examination of the question of the enlargement of the Legislative Council. I only tell your Lordships this to show that I have not changed my mind because I am no longer a man on the spot. My opinions on this subject were formed while I was a man on the spot.<lb/>
The scheme of reform which the Secretary of State has put forward is based on three propositions which the noble Viscount expounded so brilliantly on December 17 last year and which seemed to me to be almost incontrovertible&#x2014;at least, no effective attempt has been made to controvert them. Those propositions were, first, that something must be done to satisfy what are known as the legitimate aspirations of the people of India; secondly, that what is to be done must be done at once; and, thirdly, that what is done must be a substantial concession. On the first of those three propositions the noble Viscount pointed out that the only alternative to going forward is standing still. He pointed out that that was impossible. I would go further and say that the only alternative to going forward is to go backward. If we can do nothing to meet these aspirations of the Indian people, which, it must be remembered, we ourselves have taught and fostered&#x2014;and it is impossible to insist too much upon that point&#x2014;we must smother and suppress them. If we do not go forward we will be placed in the position of violating pledges which have been made, not only by the authorities
<col>158</col>
in India, but also by the word of the late Queen and His Majesty our present Sovereign. As regards the second point&#x2014;namely, that what is done must be done at once&#x2014;the noble Viscount pointed out, and I fully agree with him, that to delay would seem like fear of anarchism. It would also imply a belief, absolutely unwarranted in fact, that disloyalty in India is widespread, and it would mean distrust of the people of India. I take it that there is nobody who has been responsible for the administration of India who would commit himself to the opinion that the people of India as a whole are not to be trusted. On the other hand, to advance in spite of unrest is to prove to all the great masses of the peoples in India that the great British Government cannot be deterred by bombs, or by anarchists, or, indeed, by any force, from the steady pursuit of her great and noble mission in that country.<lb/>
The third proposition seems to me to require no demonstration. It is self-evident that any concession that is made must be a substantial concession. Even were it possible to delude the people of India by sham concessions, it is inconceivable that we should adopt so unworthy a course. It seems to me, then, that what we have to ask is not whether reform is desirable, but, first, whether the proposed reforms are substantial, and, secondly, whether they are on the best and safest lines. In doing this we must not fail to apply at every stage&#x2014;and the noble Viscount himself has insisted upon that most forcibly&#x2014;a test which is absolutely essential. That test is whether there is any weakening of the power, the influence, or the prestige of the British Government in India. Any proposal which fails under that test, any proposal in regard to which it can be said that it impairs the power or even the prestige of British rule, necessarily stands condemned. We must either govern India or else clear out. That, in simple words, is the exact situation. We cannot be governed in India, and the sooner this is made clear&#x2014;for there is great and urgent necessity that it should be made clear&#x2014;to our own democracy as well as to the people of India the better.<lb/>
On this point depends the decision as to what are the legitimate and what are the illegitimate aspirations of the people of India. Your Lordships all know that the demand of the Congress Indians, simply formulated, is self-government on the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0104"/>

<col>159</col>
Colonial model; and when they are asked to explain rather more definitely what they understand by this demand they are forced to confess that they wish to retain the services of the British naval and military forces to keep invaders out of India and to maintain order within, while for the rest they demand that all administrative power, both executive and judicial, should be put into their hands. No conceivable Government in this country could get British soldiers to go and fight for a Government of Baboos, and if the Rajput, or the Sikh, or the Gurkha were asked to do so they would resent the insult by exterminating by force of arms these childish babblers of Western democratic jargon, which has no more meaning or application in India than Chinese law has in this country of ours. A Government which cannot defend itself, which cannot resist outside invasion or maintain internal order, cannot exist, and that consideration alone, besides many others, makes self-government on the Colonial model an absolute impossibility in India. That is why anything resembling Parliamentary institutions is likewise impossible there. I feel convinced that even the most bigoted democratic doctrinaire in this country would see this if he could be made to spend a year in India and were not restricted to the company of the Congress Indians.<lb/>
There is no notion more ludicrous than that which is unfortunately prevalent to some extent in this country that the people of India are craving for representative institutions. To most Eastern gentlemen&#x2014;I say Eastern gentlemen, because it applies not only to Indians but to Persians and the natives of all Eastern countries&#x2014;there is something positively degrading in the mere idea of popular election. To be invited by a Government to take part in their deliberations and to share their responsibility is an honour, but to the ordinary gentleman of Asia to obtain such honourable public appointment or responsibility by seeking favours from a peasantry or the proletariat seems humiliating and even disgraceful. And this, my Lords, is particularly the case with the Mahomedans in India, of whom one may say that they are the most virile and trustworthy portion of the population. It follows, I think, from what I have said that we must take care that any scheme of reform is not shaping in the slightest
<col>160</col>
degree towards representative institutions, because representative institutions mean self-government and self-government means the surrender of British rule in India. The expansion of the present system seems to me, therefore, to be the obvious and the only course.<lb/>
Now, what is it that is proposed? Roughly, to enlarge the provincial Councils from twenty-four to forty-seven, and the Viceroy's Legislative Council from twenty-five to sixty-three. Nothing will persuade me that that is a very violent or dangerous measure of reform. It is natural that those who are responsible for the scheme and who have put it forward should magnify the reform as much as possible. It is equally naturally that those who, for one reason or another, are opposed to the scheme should also magnify its effect. But if, like myself, you are not actuated by either motive, it does not assume such formidable dimensions, and seems to be, what indeed the noble Viscount himself claimed for it, a moderate and just expansion of the present system. After all, is the number forty-six an inordinately large Council for a province like that of Madras&#x2014;a territory larger in area than the British Isles and containing an equal population&#x2014;when you consider that in every one of our counties the ordinary local parochial affairs are discussed by councils numbering from sixty to seventy. I think there is a great deal of unnecessary alarm in regard to the proposed composition of these enlarged councils. Out of the number of forty-six, to take one of the provincial councils as an instance, no fewer than twenty-three may be officials, and it is no more than eight out of the whole number who will be elected on anything at all resembling a popular franchise. The rest will be representatives of particular classes or institutions. Again, one of the objections made is that it may lead to excessive talking and waste of time. Personally I take a contrary view. When you have a small council&#x2014;I am speaking from experience&#x2014;it is conspicuous to remain silent, and therefore everybody has to get off a formal set speech; but when you have a larger council it is possible to refrain from talking without attracting attention, and human nature being the same in India as it is here I feel very confident that the enlargement of the councils will lead rather to less talking than to more talking. 
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0105"/>
<col>161</col>
As regards the official majority, I think there is needless apprehension. I can hardly imagine circumstances in which there would be a hard and sharp division between officials and non-officials. It is possible, of course, but in most circumstances similar to those which I can call to mind, the officials would be supported by such class representatives as the planters or the landholders, or the representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, and so the non-official majority is not an actual one; it is only a seeming one. I heartily approve, then, of the enlargement of the councils, but the success of the reform will depend, first of all, on the due representation of classes and interests, and, secondly, on the mode of election. This is left to regulations, and again I most cordially approve. It is essential that there should be elasticity. Rules which will do for Madras will certainly not do for the Punjab, and those which are suitable for Bengal will not be appropriate for Bombay. Again, it is only the man on the spot who can possibly frame such rules, and I do not believe it is within the competence of Parliament, without local experience and knowledge, effectively to criticise those regulations when they are made. But, all the same, I do not think that rules should be finally approved and given the force of law without the knowledge of Parliament. I therefore venture to offer the Secretary of State a suggestion which it is my intention to embody in an Amendment in the Committee Stage&#x2014;namely, that the proposed regulations should be laid on the Table of both Houses of Parliament for the usual period&#x2014;I think it is forty days&#x2014;and that they should take effect only if no objection has been made during that period. That would give an opportunity for the ventilation of any criticism coming from India which may transpire during the interval.<lb/>
I am indeed glad to hear that the noble Viscount has abandoned his proposal for introducing a system of proportional representation into India. I am myself an advocate of the system of proportional representation, and if my noble friend Lord Courtney were here I should like to congratulate him on getting his system adopted in every quarter of the globe, notably in the new constitution which has just been drafted for South Africa. But, although I advocate this system for England, I am very clear that it is not applicable to India and to these particular circumstances. In India in this
<col>162</col>
case you want a fixed and permanent proportion between two elements which do not mix and interchange. A Hindu will always be a Hindu; a Mahomedan, always a Mahomedan. It is possible, indeed, it happens not infrequently, that a Liberal becomes a Unionist, and I have known cases of Unionists becoming Liberals; but in India it is a division not of opinions which can change and do change, but of races which can never change. Proportional representation is all very well for getting the right compound of different shades of opinion in a homogeneous community, but what it will not do is to blend antagonistic elements. If the Mahomedans had been dissatisfied in this matter, there would have been a distinct weakening of British power; but that possible objection has been removed by the gratifying statement of the noble Viscount that he has abandoned his suggestion&#x2014;and I always realised from the beginning that it was a suggestion thrown out for the consideration of the Government of India&#x2014;that proportional representation should be adopted. The attitude of Mahomedans is a very clear one. What they say is that when the British Government held the scales even between the Hindu and the Mahomedan they were perfectly content, but that with this new scheme all that will be over and they will have to look out for themselves. Hence it is quite certain that anything which causes discontent to the Mahomedan community in India is a distinct weakening, not only of the power, but of the prestige and the influence of British Government in India.<lb/>
In regard to the question of election by popular vote, there is one little caveat which I should like to enter, and one which has not been referred to this evening. It seems to me that there must be some means of preventing the election of undesirable men. I need not suggest what type of man I mean. The noble Viscount will, I am sure, agree that nothing would be more disastrous to the success of this experiment or to the credit and reputation of enlarged Councils than if certain men were elected to them by the machinations in which the Indian politician is an expert. I would suggest that the regulations should prohibit the election of any man who has incurred a penalty under the criminal law of India, under the law of sedition, or who, for instance, has been dismissed from the public service. The alternative would be
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0106"/>
<col>163</col>
to give a veto to the Viceroy or Governor, and though that would seem to me to be entirely in accordance with Asiatic notions, I think it would be better on the whole to safeguard the purity of the Councils by regulations. I think that if these regulations are well and wisely drawn the enlargement of the Councils now proposed will undoubtedly remove a great deal of the discontent and grumbling which result from the unreality of the present proceedings.<lb/>
But it will have another effect which seems to me not unimportant. Lord Napier, one of my predecessors as Governor of Madras, in 1871 said that one of the advantages of giving more power&#x2014;for that was what he was proposing at the time&#x2014;to the local Legislative Councils would be that "the Government would be protected against influences brought to bear upon it by the India Office." There are times when the local Governments, and, indeed, the supreme Government in India needs that protection, and I, for one, believe that the enlargement of the powers of these Legislative Councils would have that effect. The House may, perhaps, be surprised to hear that thirty-six years ago the Madras Government proposed the establishment of provincial budgets and greater latitude for discussion of affairs in the local Legislative Councils, very much on the lines of the noble Viscount's present scheme of reform. I regard this with pride as yet another proof of the fact, which to me has always seemed undoubted, that the Madras Presidency, both in regard to its people and its government, has always been at least one generation ahead of the rest of India. The Government of India agreed to these proposals; but at the time it was the Home Government who held back and were afraid to alter the Act of 1861. What was thought safe then&#x2014;thirty-six years ago&#x2014;cannot be more dangerous now, and I am proud to say that the Government of Madras, under the <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> of the present Governor, has already led the way in introducing greater latitude of discussion in regard to the budget and other affairs and has done so with very gratifying success.<lb/>
As regards supplementary questions, I am afraid I cannot agree with the opinions which have been expressed, greatly though I respect the opinions of my noble friend on the Front Bench and of those who sit by him and so cordially applauded what he said. It seems to me that the arguments
<col>164</col>
which are used are a very great confession of weakness. Surely it is a poor compliment to the Indian civilian, of whom so much has been said by way of praise this evening, to say that he is not a match for a Hindu lawyer. Personally I have no doubt he would be in this matter of supplementary questions. Your Lordships must remember that the civilian who has to answer questions in the local Legislative Council is not an inexperienced Under-Secretary as in this country; he is not a Minister who is new to his Department, but he is a man who has dealt with the affairs of the Department over which he presides during the whole course of a long official career, and he knows chapter and verse of every question with which he has to deal. Then, surely, it is easy enough, where necessary, to ask for further notice of any supplementary question. I think it is ungenerous to the majority of the people in India who will fill these places in the Councils to suppose, as it seems to be supposed, that this privilege of asking supplementary questions will be systematically and constantly abused. I do not believe it for one moment. I believe also that with proper rules and good chairmanship it will be possible, and, indeed, easy, to check any abuse of the privilege.<lb/>
The Executive Councils are to be enlarged. There is permissive power for enlarging the Executive Councils, for the avowed purpose, I take it, of appointing Indians; and here, again, in spite of all that has been said by my noble friend, I most cordially welcome the prospect. I do not consider it from either of the points which have been put forward this evening, but I regard it as a concession to sentiment, and I believe&#x2014;I always have believed&#x2014;that sentiment is not only a very potent force but a force which cannot be neglected in all human affairs. The noble Lord who spoke second assumed that there were only two classes of men who could be appointed to this post&#x2014;one, the native official, a humdrum middle-class insignificant man, and the other the noisy platform politician; but I can think of many other better classes than either from whom such appointments could be made. I can recall men who, even a generation ago, were recognised by all as having indisputable claims to the title of statesmen&#x2014;men who were the "Dewans" or Prime Ministers of native States, and who had been brought up originally in the British service. It is men of that kind whom I
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0107"/>
<col>165</col>
should like to see on the provincial Executive Councils. I think there are also men of the class of landholder, the territorial aristocracy of the country, who would be eminently suitable for appointments of this kind, and who would be regarded with general respect. But although I myself while in India would have welcomed such an appointment, and do welcome it now, my agreement with the proposal of the noble Viscount was based on the supposition that the appointment of an Indian as such would satisfy the Indian sentiment on the subject. But since then the firm attitude of protest adopted by the Mahomedans has considerably altered the situation. I did know that there was no such thing as Indian national sentiment, but I did not realise that the anti-national feeling went so far. The Mahomedans will feel that we are not holding the scale evenly if they do not get exactly the same as is accorded to the Hindus, and, as I have said before, if the Mahomedans are against us there must be a weakening of British power. I hope, therefore, no appointment will be made by the Secretary of State unless it be in circumstances where none of these objections can arise. It would seem to me better to refrain from initiating any new departure of this kind until public opinion has altered.<lb/>
My noble friend spoke at considerable length and with great force on the subject of Executive Council for Lieutenant-Governors and said he had never heard of a Lieutenant-Governor who desired to have an Executive Council. I cannot say positively that I could quote a Lieutenant-Governor who desired an Executive Council, but I have an impression that there are and have been such, and my view of that question is that to give an Executive Council to a Lieutenant-Governor would be an act of justice to the officials. It would be an alteration in form but not in substance. It is absolutely impossible for any Lieutenant-Governor to do the whole of the work himself, and what actually happens is that the Lieutenant-Governor leaves a great deal of the responsibility and work to men who hold lower rank than the members of Council who share the work with the Governor in the other provinces. My noble friend represented it to be merely a question as between Lieutenant-Governorships and the Presidency Governorships, and he stated that Executive Councils were given to Bombay and Madras be-
<col>166</col>
cause the Governors were sent out from home and needed guidance and information on Indian subjects. I doubt very much whether he would assign a similar reason for the existence of the Viceroy's Executive Council, and personally I have never heard of a Viceroy who wished to get rid of his Executive Council; and, if an Executive Council is good for a Viceroy and good for a Governor I think, on <i>prim&#x00E2; facie</i> grounds, it is quite likely to be a good thing for a Lieutenant-Governor.<lb/>
While I cannot see any danger in the reforms themselves&#x2014;and your Lordships will believe me that my natural predisposition, sitting where I do, would be to be critical&#x2014;I am not quite sure that the manner in which they have been brought forward has been altogether judicious; and I hope the noble Viscount will forgive me if I tread on somewhat delicate ground. The reforms are universally known as Lord Morley's reforms.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member>: <membercontribution>I am not responsible.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member>: <membercontribution>The noble Viscount, of course, is not responsible for that, but there must have been something in the manner in which the reforms were promulgated, were discussed, and finally decided on, which has induced the man in the street and the man on the spot to call them Lord Morley's reforms. Hitherto, as I have understood it, the policy of the Secretary of State for India has been to uphold in every conceivable way the prestige of the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, and even if the Secretary of State were the stronger man and took the initiative it has always, I think, been the custom, with few exceptions, to assign initiative, responsibility, and credit to His Majesty's representative in India.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member>: <membercontribution>I hope the noble Viscount will forgive me, because I think it is an important point. It is a matter, not so much of what is actually done as the mode in which it is done, and I hope that, when the regulations come to be finally approved, there will be no possible ground for suspicion that the regulations have been framed at the India Office in Whitehall and not in the Secretariats of

Simla and the different provinces of India. Everybody should know that they are framed in India in order that the prestige of the Viceroy will not be diminished. While I feel bound to make this criticism, I yield to none in my admiration of the wonderful grasp of Indian affairs which the noble Viscount has displayed and of the generous courage and energy with which he has exercised the powers of his high office. Confident in the strength and the beauty of the great ship which he commands and of the courage and fidelity of his crew, he
<col>168</col>
has steered through the dangerous straits in spite of the storm. I wish him God-speed and a safe passage into the still waters of peace and contentment in India.<lb/>

<section>
<title>INDIAN COUNCILS BILL. [H. L]</title>
<p>Order of the Day read for resuming the adjourned Debate on the Motion for the Second Reading.</p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I hardly think that the speeches which followed that of the noble Viscount yesterday can have been wholly satisfactory to those who framed this Bill. The noble Viscount asked us to give a whole-hearted support to the Bill, and warned us that if anything were done at Westminster to show a breach in what ought to be the substantial unity of Parliamentary opinion in face of the Indian situation, it would be a great disaster. I fully concur in his view, and I am quite certain that it is not the desire of anybody on either side of the House that such a situation should be created. I think it will be remembered that, so far as the maintenance of order and the instructions which he has had to give are concerned, he has had the unqualified and unanimous support and approval of the Members of this House.<lb/>
But on the question of reform it would be absurd to conceal from ourselves that the speech which immediately followed that of the Secretary of State last night did show considerable divergence of opinion from his views. The noble Lord the Secretary of State paid a high and deserved tribute to the spirit in which the noble Lord the ex-Viceroy had carried on the whole of his work in India; and the noble Lord behind me, with equal sincerity, paid an equally high tribute to the spirit which animated the noble Viscount. The fact that no hostile spirit whatever was discernible in either speech, I think adds to the strength of the declarations which were made, and which showed a material difference between the two speakers in regard to the proposals. In view of that divergence I think there will have arisen in the minds of many of us a recollection of the appeal made by the Secretary of State in December last. He pointed out that there was a tendency to fall into a groove in Indian affairs and unless we recognised surrounding circumstances we should remain where we were, and that it was better to make some start rather than no start at all. I feel that we must face the facts.
<col>170</col>
We have raised up by education a very considerable population in India who are capable of taking an interest in political affairs. We have by our example inspired them with the idea of political activity. We have opened to them almost the highest posts in the law. We have given them a considerable position in the Civil Service, and, having invited them, as it were, to the threshold of government, I hardly think we can close the door in their faces. Although I think most of us will feel that there was very great force in the observation addressed to the noble Viscount the Secretary of State, that what the great mass of Indians desire is not Indian government but good government, still we have an instance in Egypt&#x2014;perhaps the best instance&#x2014;of what British government can do in a country which had known nothing but bad government and chaos. One of the main principles of Lord Cromer's action in Egypt always was to associate with him in the Government men differing from him in creeds, habits, and traditions who were none the less the natives of the country; and when we consider the admirable results which have accrued in that country from that policy, I think we ought to take our courage in both hands and go forward as far as we possibly can in the direction of the noble Lord who has brought forward this Bill.<lb/>
I do not think, on the other hand, we can conceal from ourselves that if we pass the Bill in its present form we are practically giving a blank cheque to the Secretary of State&#x2014;a blank cheque on the filling up of which depends practically the whole future of our government and perhaps of our rule in India. This Bill is largely based on regulations. I do not complain of that I recognise that we have on many occasions found ourselves coerced and shackled by the fact that Statute governed so many things in connection with Indian government. I might mention one case which came before my personal notice. By the Act which regulates the Council of India which sits in Whitehall there are various provisions to prevent men who have been too long away from India from sitting on the Council and so forth, and there is one provision that a Councillor who once resigns can never come back; the Secretary of State has no power to reappoint him. Not long ago a member of that Council, a gentleman of considerable attainments and of great knowledge&#x2014;Mr. Findlay&#x2014;was invited by the present
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0110"/>
<col>171</col>
Secretary of State to go to India to perform a special service there. He returned after a time, but it was out of the power of the Secretary of State to call him back to his old duties. I think that when we look at the vast mass of questions that will arise under these regulations we are compelled to acquiesce in the opinion of the Secretary of State that we must not attempt to affirm them all by Statute, but must leave the power to vary them where necessary in his hands. On the other hand, we must realise that these questions are thus taken out of the purview of Parliament.<lb/>
I do not know whether all your Lordships have realised in how different a way and under what different authority these regulations will be made. We all know that as regards appointment to the Viceroy's Council, which does not come under the Bill, the power is absolutely in the hands of the Secretary of State. He can make what appointment he pleases, and he is only accountable to Parliament to justify himself. With regard to the additions proposed to the Councils of Madras and Bombay, with a view, as we understand, of putting native members on these Councils, they are reserved to the Secretary of State in Council, and can be made without the concurrence or even the suggestion of the Governor-General. With regard to all the other points in the Bill&#x2014;the appointment of Executive Provincial Councils, the enlargement of the Legislative Councils, and the rules of procedure&#x2014;those are all made in India, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State in Council. Those are distinctions, but I am not quite certain that there is a difference. A great deal will depend whether these regulations are drawn up on the cautious plan of the Indian Administration or whether they are permeated by the more adventurous spirit which the noble Viscount has infused into what have been erroneously termed elsewhere "the fossils in Whitehall."<lb/>
Lord Curzon yesterday took one by one the provisions of this Bill and the changes which it is proposed to make, and, having summed them up, he used these words:&#x2014;
<quote>"The Secretary of State has in reality overruled and altered the views of the man on the spot at almost every critical and vital stage, and has substituted for them entirely independent proposals of his own."</quote>
That being so, and bearing in mind the
<col>172</col>
difference of opinion which has been already expressed not only here but in India as to some of these provisions, I would urge upon the Secretary of State that he should undertake, in a Bill of this great magnitude, to follow the example of many measures of far less magnitude, and provide that the regulations to be made by the Government of the day under the Bill should be laid before Parliament for forty days and should not take effect if either House of Parliament presented an address to the Crown to nullify or alter them. I do not think that is an unreasonable demand. I could cite, if it were desirable, a long list of measures in which that course has been taken.<lb/>
It has been already agreed that some little latitude should be allowed with regard to the discussion on the promotion to the Viceroy's Council. It is unnecessary really to labour it very much, partly because public opinion has been so centred upon it that that one question has almost dwarfed all the others in the public mind, and partly because nothing I could say, if I entirely concurred, could add to the force of the very weighty pronouncements already made on this subject from both sides of the House. I realise that this is the centre of the struggle and that this House could only touch it by influencing the mind of the Secretary of State. I would say, however, that it would indeed be a tragedy if, when we are moving forward solely with the object of placating public opinion in India and strengthening the supreme Executive, we were to do anything which would have the effect of alienating the sympathy of considerable classes in India and of weakening the central authority. But I must go one step further than the noble Lord behind me, who said last night that, in his opinion, once this appointment of a native was made to the Viceroy's Council, you could never go back from it. I go further and say that, once the statement has been made on the responsibility of the Secretary of State in this House that it is his intention to appoint a native on the first vacancy to the Viceroy's Council, you can never go back upon that. I am very much influenced in criticising what the noble Lord proposes because I believe that it must be carried through, and I believe also that he is going to carry it through, and to do so on the lines of least resistance.<lb/>
The noble Viscount hinted that he would appoint a legal member. In India
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0111"/>
<col>173</col>
natives have risen to higher positions&#x2014;deservedly so&#x2014;in the legal than in other professions. They have obtained a great deal of public confidence as Judges. The noble Lord last night said that you were entering on a new phase when you proposed to give Indians authority in government over Europeans in India. That is, of course, very important. But, on the other hand, we must recollect that in the Courts of Law Europeans have had to plead before Indian Judges now for many years, and Indian Judges, I believe, have been held competent to decide almost any suit in which a European was concerned. Therefore you are taking the Indian at his strongest point if you appoint a legal member of Council from among Indian candidates. On the other hand, even after what was said so well by the noble Lord as regards the services rendered by the legal members to India in times past, it should be remembered that times and conditions have very much altered in regard to these appointments since Lord Macaulay's days. An eminent lawyer who is now asked to go to India to serve on the Viceroy's Council for five years has to consider whether he is prepared to give up his practice entirely in this country. He has to undertake labour which is three times as severe as when Lord Macaulay went to India; and instead of coming back, as Lord Macaulay did, with a moderate competence, he has to conduct these five years' work on not a large margin over his personal expenditure, and he comes back to find a number of careers not open to him in this country which were open to him before. And as time goes on the difficulty of obtaining a really first-class lawyer to go out and hold this very high post may increase. If it be decided to place a legal member on the Viceroy's Council, you are taking the native Indian on his strongest point and the European, as compared to other members of the Council, on his weakest point.<lb/>
It is no part of my desire to travel again over the ground covered last night, but what I think we require to do is to try and get into our minds what the cumulative effects of the Bill will be on those who have to represent us in India. What will be the position of a provincial Governor as compared with the past? Instead of having a practical autocracy as Governor he will share his responsibility with a Council, and with a Council which may not always be in accord with him. He
<col>174</col>
used to have a say as to the nomination of the Legislative Council who sat with him; in future he will have none. He will be face to face with a small Parliament, with, perhaps, a permanent majority against him with enlarged powers, with certainly a great deal more of his time taken up in discussions in a Council having, perhaps, some dangerous elements in its composition. That is an immense change, and it is being carried out without any communication with India at all. I read in <i>The Times</i> the other day that it is only within the last few days that the provincial Governors have been invited to give their opinion as to whether or not this change can be carried through, and also whether it is desirable to add Indian members to the Executive Council. I do not labour this point, partly because it has been so strongly put already, partly because there are behind me three or four noble Lords, who, I hope, will speak, all of whom have intimate knowledge as to the circumstances of working with a Council in Madras and Bombay.<lb/>
But when we come to the legislative proposals, I must say that I think the noble Viscount has been carried away by his own intimate Parliamentary experience. I cannot imagine anything which will be more foreign to the present spirit of conducting business in India than the position in which the Governor is to be placed <i>vis-a-vis</i> his Legislative Council in the future. There is nothing whatever in the Bill or in the regulations which the Secretary of State has foreshadowed to prevent a man who has been the subject of a criminal prosecution and has been deported by the Secretary of State from sitting&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACK-BURN)</member>: <membercontribution>Undoubtedly, one of the regulations will determine certain classes of prohibitions and exclusions. We have not yet the full list of the proposed disqualifications, but such as the noble Viscount mentions will find a place in the exclusions.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member>: <membercontribution>I am much relieved to hear that. I hope that later on the noble Viscount will kindly tell us whether he proposes to make that a prohibition by regulation against a particular class, or whether he proposes to give a veto to the Lieutenant-Governor.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0112"/>
<col>175</col>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member>: <membercontribution>I think it will have to be done by regulation, with excluding categories.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member>: <membercontribution>That is an extremely interesting addition to our information. I think it is quite clear there might be very grave scandal in that respect, and that will be avoided by the intention of the Secretary of State. At the same time, I know that apprehension is very strong that the Lieutenant-Governor may find himself at times in a very awkward situation. The mass of the people of India are not organised, and will have very little voice in the election of these Councils. They may have the right and the opportunity, but I think all those who know India will agree that they have neither the initiative nor the organisation. On the other hand, those who agitate have organisation. A distinguished official writes&#x2014;
<quote>"It will not be long before a firm phalanx of obstructionists sit in our Legislative Council."</quote>
If that is so, the work may be paralysed to a large extent, and I think the noble Viscount has hardly given sufficient consideration to the degree to which the best officials will be called away from their districts and their work to sit in Calcutta or in the other centres. I do not know if he saw the statement made the other day on this subject. This is the statement sent to <i>The Times</i> by a member of the Legislative Council of Calcutta, and it bears out what was stated by the noble Lord yesterday. Writing three weeks ago, this gentleman said&#x2014;
<quote>"I have been here about six weeks. I have been present at one or two meetings, and have, perhaps, done two hours solid work during the whole time. I have no office to attend, and hardly any correspondence worth mentioning.&#x2026;I pass my days in enforced idleness, and now they are going to appoint several more men to similar idle posts."</quote>
That may be inevitable, but it ought to be minimised as much as possible. There is no doubt that you will have a very costly system set up by these proposals.<lb/>
The Secretary of State began his great speech in December by telling us that he would never be a party to establishing a Parliamentary system in India, but I cannot help feeling that he has to some extent proposed by this Bill to introduce some of the very worst features of our own Parliamentary practice. I do not believe that any member of this House who has sat in
<col>176</col>
the House of Commons will not agree that among the greatest abuses, though they may be inevitable, in that assembly is the enormous time which Ministers of the Crown who have important work to do elsewhere are forced to give in attendance on the House of Commons. This may be inevitable in England, but are we to set up this state of things in India?<lb/>
Then there is the point as to supplementary questions. It seems a small matter, but I do not think it is going to be made a small business of in India. I do not believe that our last recruit from the House of Commons&#x2014;the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland&#x2014;will contradict me when I say that the abuse of supplementary questions has produced one of the greatest wastes of time, with the maximum demand on official energy and the minimum of public information. It is a sort of sword-play which is very amusing to the public, but it involves very often hours of preparation for the man who has, say, thirty Questions on the Paper to think of the supplementary questions that may be put to him. It became so great an abuse that well recollect the late Lord Salisbury requesting his own Under-Secretary not to reply to supplementary questions on foreign affairs. I might say also that during the war, both before I was connected with the War Office and afterwards, we had vehement protests from Generals in the field at information which slipped out in answer to supplementary questions, and I should have thought the noble Lord when he was Irish Secretary would have been aware of the awful waste of time involved in replying to these conundrums. Are they going to be of any use in India? I see that the <i>Marhatta</i> said a few days ago&#x2014;
<quote>"The power to ask supplementary questions in the hands of well-informed and skilful interrogators must expose the jugglery of official replies. A skilful cross-examiner may well hope to put the official member to shame by making him appear either ignorant or dishonest."</quote>
That is not what you are establishing this system for. My noble friend, Lord Ampthill, spoke of the difference between a trained administrator and a recently appointed Under-Secretary. I should also like your Lordships to consider the difference between a trained Parliamentarian and an official who is suddenly asked after twenty years service to place himself in
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0113"/>
<col>177</col>
the position of a cockshy for every missile in the shape of questions that may he hurled at him.<lb/>
I would ask the noble Viscount to give attention to the points which I have raised in no hostility to his Bill. I feel that if he is to carry with him anything like the consensus that he desires in this country, it will be very necessary for him to modify in some respects the proposed regulations and to give us assurances on others. In the first place, I would urge that he should alter the regulations in some degree to meet the speeches which have been made, and that he will undertake that they shall be laid before Parliament for the usual period of forty days. Then I would ask him, if he takes power under the Bill to constitute Executive Councils for the various provinces and to increase the Executive Councils of Madras and Bombay, not to put that power into effect before he has received and has presented to Parliament the opinions of those who are chiefly qualified to form an opinion in India&#x2014;the provincial Governors themselves&#x2014;and until Parliament has had an opportunity of expressing an opinion. Thirdly, I would ask him, with regard to the Executive Councils, to consider a modification of the numbers, without which the undue pressure on the officials cannot possibly be avoided, and that he will let us know something about the form of exclusion which he will propose in order to prevent inappropriate persons from being elected to these Councils. I further trust he will remove an unfortunate imitation of one of the worst forms of our own Parliamentary abuses&#x2014;the allowing of supplementary questions.<lb/>
These may not seem very important modifications. They certainly are not intended in any way whatever to interfere with the general course of the reforms. If you compare this proposed legislation with the legislation of 1892, it is an immense step forward. I quite recognise that since 1892 we have had a great development in India. The development of railways and communications alone has brought much nearer to the masses of the people opportunities of observation and co-operation. We have also had a great commercial development, and it is noteworthy in this Blue-book that we show very little symptom of these commercial classes being represented in the Councils. I trust that,
<col>178</col>
even in the question of education, the noble Viscount will not forget the possibility by commercial education of diverting a number of minds into commercial channels, and preventing the mass of Indians looking to politics and the law as the sole means of airing their abilities. But if we do not go the full distance with the noble Viscount it is only for this reason, that, however we look at it, we cannot hide from ourselves that something like nine-tenths of the adult male population of India are, intellectually and politically, in swaddling clothes and do not seem to have the least desire at present to put them off. Therefore I would urge on the noble Viscount, in setting up these semi-Parliamentary institutions, not to mistake the shadow for the substance, not to do something which will give opportunities to a few individuals for self-advertisement but which might altogether clog the wheels of government in India and end in alienating the sympathies of the great mass of the governed classes in India.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>*LORD REAY</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, this Bill enables the Secretary of State and the Government of India to associate more closely with the various governments representatives of the native community. There is one important element which ought not to be overlooked&#x2014;namely, that already a large number of the natives of India, some of them in the Civil Service and others in the provincial service, are in the Administration. No measure of any importance is taken without consulting representatives of the native community. My own experience was that the knowledge required to govern in a country where characteristics of race and religion and political and social ideals are so divergent could only be derived from ascertaining the views of those who represented those characteristics and ideals. I never experienced any difficulty in obtaining the well-considered opinions of those whom I consulted, and, as a rule, those opinions were sound and sober. Eminent members of the Civil Service entertained amicable relations with influential natives, and discussed freely with them the questions which were engaging the attention of Government. By giving to these consultations a more official character we do not introduce any novel procedure, but we give recognition to an element in the administration which is essential to its success. The French, who in Cochin-China are confronted with similar

problems, have given it the appropriate name of <i>la politique d'association.</i> It is the natural result of the education we have given to the natives.<lb/>
When I was Governor of Bombay I appointed to the Legislative Council&#x2014;in those days there were no elected members&#x2014;the leaders of the native community, men who would have been elected if there had been an election; and in dealing with legislative matters, their contributions to the debate were most valuable, and they were quite as anxious as we were that the Bills we introduced should have the practical results desired. They stated their views with courtesy, and were always ready to meet us as far as possible where we differed. Anyone reading the prolonged discussions on the Bill introduced to reform the municipal corporation of the City of Bombay will be struck by the businesslike character of the debates, and the ability displayed in those debates by the non-official members. I would have been willing&#x2014;and it is now very nearly twenty years since I left India&#x2014;to carry out the legislative business of the Presidency without an official majority, and I am quite prepared to accept the proposal of the Government to that effect. It is very unlikely that the non-official members of the Legislative Council will form a bloc. This is much less likely if they are a majority than if they are always a minority. I am not sure that the same might not be said of this side of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Curzon</member> <membercontribution>objected to the enlargement of the Councils, but that enlargement is the result of proposals which have come from the Government of India and from the local governments, and all that has been done by my noble friend the Secretary of State is to embody the proposals with regard to that enlargement which emanated from India. I would point out, with regard to the difficulty that is anticipated, that the increased number of official members need not be taken from the Civil Service only; they can be taken from other branches of the service, such as the Public Works Department and the Educational Service. Therefore there is a wide area of selection. I consider that it will be of great advantage to the Government to have in the enlarged Legislative Councils an expression of opinion of the various communities and the various interests, agricultural and industrial, and to have frequent opportunities of explaining its own policy
<col>180</col>
to the Councils. On many occasions I found it decidedly opportune to state the reasons which had induced the Government to adopt a certain course of action, and I was very glad to hear Lord Curzon emphasise that point. In order to prevent misapprehension and erroneous criticism of the policy of the Government that policy must be explained, and this explanation must reach all parts of the governed area through the members of the Legislative Council who have heard the explanation, whether voluntarily given by the Government or in answer to an interpellation. The wider facilities given, especially with regard to the consideration of the Estimates, I consider politic in order that the Government may hear what are the views of the non-official members with regard to the distribution of expenditure and the ways and means of meeting it. There is no doubt that the tendency of expenditure in India, as elsewhere, is to increase; the taxpayer must be informed why he is taxed, and the discussion of the Budget in the Legislative Council will give him a guarantee that his interests have been duly considered. Lord Curzon pointed out that these reforms will involve expenditure, but I do not think that in India this expenditure will be grudged.<lb/>
The Bill does not throw any light on the constitution of the electorate and on the qualifications of those elected. This has been left to the Government of India. The conditions are so different in the various provinces that it would be almost impossible, and certainly injudicious, to enter into detail. I do not see any objection to an electoral college. Where the electors are spread over a wide area the only way of focussing their votes is in an electoral college, as obtains at present for the election of members of council by municipalities and district boards in Bombay, and this will also probably have to be done in the case of Mahomedans. Besides, the Government have not yet received the Report of the Decentralisation Committee which deals with the constitution of municipal corporations, district boards, and parish councils or village punchayats, which latter 1 suppose will be re-established. As the representatives of these local bodies will, I suppose, be called upon to elect representatives for the Legislative Councils, it may be necessary to give effect to the recommendations of
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0115"/>
<col>181</col>
that Report before a scheme can be drawn up for the constitution of the Legislative Council. Great care should be taken to secure a proper representation of all classes interested in the cultivation of the soil, not only big landlords, but also tenants and ryots, for agriculture is in India the great industry of the country.<lb/>
I have no objection to appointing natives on the Executive Council of a Provincial Governor. The natives are admitted into the Civil Service, they are placed at the head of a district, they are appointed as Judges in the different Courts, they are dewans in native States, and there is no reason why they should be debarred from admission to the Executive Council. I should have had no difficulty in submitting the names of eligible natives, Hindus, Mahomedans, or Parsecs, if I had been asked to do so; and I am convinced that we should have found their co-operation very useful. In making the selection you must take a man who is trusted by his own community as well as by other communities. I do not think that we need fear that a native member would attempt to induce his colleagues to show favour to his own community; and if the attempt were made it would certainly fail, when the subject was considered in the full council. The increase of members of the Executive Council will lead to a better distribution of the work, and give the Governor and the members more time to attend to business which, under present circumstances of the congestion of work, cannot be undertaken. Relief will also be given by decentralisation; but, even then, the burden of administration will be very great, and there must be time for constant intercourse with members of the various native communities in all parts of the province. This intercourse is of very great importance, and on it depends, in a large measure, the success of our Administration.<lb/>
The natives must have easy access to their rulers. The motive of the proposed reforms is to establish closer relations between the ruling power and those who are subject to our rule. Through all the grades of our administration this association must be maintained and developed. Personal influence in India is a mainspring of authority exercised without friction; impartial justice is secured, but it is not sufficient if it is not accompanied by the conviction that the representatives of
<col>182</col>
British rule are desirous of cultivating personal intercourse with His Majesty's subjects. This is as important as official correspondence, and the Service should be organised with a view to allowing for the discharge of this essential duty. In training members of the Civil Service more attention will have to be given to knowledge of Indian history and sociology. On this subject I will not dilate, because the Government will receive recommendations on the subject in a Report on Oriental Studies shortly to be issued.<lb/>
There is no doubt that these reforms will impose on the Civil Service more arduous duties. Their success will depend to a large degree on the ability and tact with which officials give the necessary guidance to the various bodies which are placed on a new basis. It is our duty to give to candidates for the Civil Service such training as will enable them to deal with the problems which they have to solve. An intimate knowledge of the structure of Indian society, of the complex ramifications of race and caste, must be acquired, if our rule is to rest on a solid foundation. Lord Curzon alluded to the people who have no vote and whom these reforms do not touch. I do not doubt that in the future, as in the past, they will receive the protection they require. This has always been recognised as one of the chief duties of the Administration, and there is no reason to anticipate that it will not be considered with the same care.<lb/>
As regards the presence of a native in the Viceroy's Council there seems to be a good deal of apprehension. If I had been asked to submit a name for the appointment, I do not think I should have had any difficulty in giving a satisfactory answer. I could have mentioned the name of a very distinguished native gentleman who enjoyed the confidence of all the communities in the Presidency as well as of his own, the Hindu community. I am sure that he would have gained the confidence of his colleagues, and that his opinions on the subjects with which he would have had to deal would have carried great weight, as they did with the Government of Bombay at the time. He was a man of very exceptional ability, and his judgment was very sound. He would have satisfied Lord Curzon's requirements as an expert and a statesman. He would certainly have discountenanced any hazardous experi-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0116"/>
<col>183</col>
ments, and he was extremely cautious and aware of the limitations of his own countrymen. I cannot admit that such men cannot be found in India at the present time. They have a great sense of responsibility, and this would be enhanced if they were called to discharge important duties. We must not forget that the office of dewan in one of the great native States involves very great knowledge of affairs, and that many men have distinguished themselves in that field as well as in the High Courts of Justice. The noble Lord, Lord Curzon, pointed out that natives could at all times be consulted by the authorities. That is, no doubt, the fact, but, if you attach importance to their advice, why should you not take it in a regular official form attaching responsibility to it? I do not think that the native member will necessarily always be the legal member. Natives with experience of administration in other departments will be available when a vacancy occurs.<lb/>
The Mahomedans claim to send representatives to the various boards and councils. They do not ask for any special privileges, but they wish to be represented as a distinct community forming a nationality by traditions of race and religion. I do not wish to exaggerate the divergences which exist between the Mahomedan and other sections of the Indian people, but it is not possible to ignore them. Anyone who has followed the pan-Islamic movement will be aware of the intense earnestness of the Moslems in defending their faith. To secure the smooth working of the Legislative Councils it will be politic to give the Mahomedans their own representatives in order that they should not have a grievance. We must avoid accentuating the divergences to which I have alluded, and this object will be attained if the Mahomedans have their fair share of representatives. In Mahomedan native States Hindus are appointed to important offices, which illustrates that there is no absolute incompatibility; but there are subjects, for instance education, on which the Mahomedans hold very strong views. There will be difficulties in the creation of a distinct electorate, especially in Bombay, but these difficulties are not insuperable. Justice can be meted out to the Mahomedans without depriving the Hindu community of any advantages they have acquired through their own exertions.
<col>184</col>
I am quite sure that sagacious leaders of the Hindu community will admit the duty of Government to protect minorities in the exercise of their rights. On most questions with which I had to deal. Hindu and Mahomedan interests were identical, and where they were divergent we always tried to bring about a <i>modus vivendi</i> which would allay friction. That object will be much more easily attained if Mahomedan representatives are able to speak with authority on the questions with which the Councils will have to deal, as will be the case under the conditions granted by my noble friend.<lb/>
On the scheme of a council of ruling chiefs, the Secretary of State has pointed out the difficulties which exist, but has left the Government of India a free hand. The extreme importance of friendly relations with the rulers of native States is fully admitted in the November Despatch. They govern one-fifth of the present population of India; they have a great hold on their subjects; their loyalty is of great value to us; and we cannot ignore their opinion on questions which touch India as a whole. In railway management, in taxation, we have to secure their co-operation as well as in the supply of Imperial contingents. If they are not invited to form a council, it should be made clear to them that this does not exclude the strengthening of the confidential relations which have existed between them and the Supreme Government and our desire to enter into frequent communication with them and to promote the prosperity of their States.<lb/>
Those who have been connected with the Government of India know how intricate and complex are the problems which arise. We have to hold an even balance in order that all classes may have confidence in our rule as the source of peace and prosperity, enabling them to reap the fruits of their industry. The policy embodied in this Bill shows that we are ready to open up closer relations with the loyal subjects of His Majesty, and I believe they will show themselves worthy of the trust placed in them and ready to strengthen the Government in its endeavours to benefit the great Indian Empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>*THE EARL OF CROMER</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, it is with some hesitation that I intervene in this debate. Although the present condition of affairs in India had been foreseen
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0117"/>
<col>185</col>
for many years, and is, indeed, the natural and almost inevitable result of the educational reforms which were inaugurated by Lord Macaulay, I recognise that an Indian experience gained twenty-five years ago is not of any great value under existing circumstances. Still, I should like to make a few observations, more especially on the question of the appointment of a native of India to the Viceroy's Executive Council. It is no matter for surprise that there should be considerable difference of opinion on this subject. Even those who, like myself, agree with the proposal must admit that it is to a certain extent a leap in the dark. I regret it has not been found possible to give to the House in an official form the views of the Council of the Viceroy with regard to this scheme. I am aware that the Secretary of State is under no statutory obligation to consult the Government of India on this question officially. But I think that it would have been more satisfactory, both to your Lordships' House and to the country in general, if we had been placed in possession of the views entertained on this subject by those whose Indian experience is both prolonged and recent. However, the House has been informed that the Viceroy himself is in favour of the proposal, and as Lord Minto would certainly not express an opinion on the subject without having consulted his confidential advisers, we may assume that some at least of those advisers are in favour of the project.<lb/>
The Secretary of State has drawn a very striking contrast between the two different schools of thought on this subject&#x2014;namely, those who attach special importance to efficiency and good government and those who are more in favour of the extension of the principle of self-government, though, perhaps, the latter definition is not very correct. But there is a third school to which, possibly, the Secretary of State belongs, and of which certainly I myself am an adherent. That school consists of those who are in favour of endeavouring to effect a working compromise between the two extremes. The same difficulty frequently confronted me in Egypt. When. some important appointment had to be filled up, the question arose whether it should be given to a European or to a native. In other words, the political argument and the efficiency argument came into conflict. The difficulty of finding an efficient native was greater in Egypt than
<col>186</col>
it would be in India, considering that the education of the Egyptians had been neglected for years. The efficiency argument was generally very strong on its own merits. I generally had to pose as the <i>advocatus diaboli</i> in favour of the political argument. The departmental officers would say&#x2014;
<quote>"Your political theory is excellent, and we entirely agree in it, but this is not a suitable occasion for putting it into force. You must wait for some other opportunity."</quote>
Under these circumstances, I frequently had to yield, but I always bore in mind the great importance of the political argument, and when the opportunity was favourable I put it into effect.<lb/>
In like manner the main test by which the proposal of the Secretary of State is to be judged is this&#x2014;is the political argument or the efficiency argument to be allowed to predominate? My own view, after giving the matter very great consideration, and also, I must frankly admit, after a good deal of hesitation, is that, in this case, the political argument ought to be allowed to predominate over the efficiency argument. If I thought for one moment that the appointment of a native of India to the Viceroy's Council would in any way shake the supremacy of British rule in India&#x2014;and there has been some faint allusions to that in the course of the debate&#x2014;I should be the first to object to the proposal, and I think in all probability the noble Viscount opposite would object too. But my hope certainly is that, so far from being at all weakened, the supremacy of the British Government will rather be strengthened by the proposal. I am perfectly well aware that there are many formidable objections to the proposal in detail, but they appear to deal with matters which are of secondary importance. I do not think it is possible to blind ourselves to the fact that there is now throughout Asia a movement going on having for its object the association to a greater degree than formerly of the natives of those countries, not merely in the framing of their laws, but also in the direction of the appointment of natives of capacity to high administrative posts. I do not think it would be politic to oppose an absolute <i>non possumus</i> to this movement in respect of the largest and most important of these Asiatic countries. Not only that. If we consider our own democratic institutions, the sympathy which is felt with native aspirations by very large and influential
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0118"/>
<col>187</col>
bodies in this country, and also the effects of the educational system which, whether wisely or unwisely, we have adopted for the last fifty years in India, I do not think it would be possible to resist this movement for any very considerable length of time.<lb/>
It should be remembered that the position of India at the present time is almost unique. It is, so far as I know, the only important country in the world where education is advanced which is governed in all essential particulars by non-resident foreigners. It is also the only country where the Civil Service, in all its higher administrative branches, is in the hands of aliens appointed by a foreign country under stringent educational tests. That the system has yielded very good results up to the present everyone, I think, will admit; but, on the other hand, I cannot help thinking that the time has now arrived when it requires not radical alteration, but some reasonable modifications. If we are to modify it&#x2014;and I think everybody agrees that it must be modified&#x2014;it must be in the direction of allowing the natives of India greater scope either in Legislative or in Executive work. The opinion appears to be held amongst many that there is less objection to granting to natives of India increased legislative than to granting them increased executive functions. I rather challenge that position. The East is full of surprises, and with the example of Japan, and more recently of Turkey, before us, I think he would be a very rash man who would prophesy what would be the result of introducing anything like Parliamentary institutions into India. I know that the legislative experiment has to be tried, but I must confess that I have no very great confidence in the result of the experiment. If we consider the immense diversity of race, religion, and language in India, and also the fact that we shall be endeavouring to transplant to India a plant entirely of exotic growth and placing it in a very uncongenial soil, I must confess for my own part that I shall be very much surprised if the legislative experiment does succeed.<lb/>

What the natives of India really require, and what I think should in reason be bestowed upon them, is to take some minor but effective share in the real government of their country, and that they can only do if they are given some administrative functions. These considerations are,
<col>188</col>
to my mind, of such importance that they outweigh the very considerable objections in detail which have been urged against the project and about which I would like to say a few words. I do not attach any very great importance to the objection that it is impossible to find any native of India who will generally represent native opinion and who has sufficient capacity to be appointed to the Viceroy's Council. I do not know what the facts may be at present, but I can say that when I was in India twenty-five years ago there were men like Sir Salar Jung and Sir Madhara Rao who were not only very capable administrators, but who were, also, statesmen in the fullest acceptation of that term. They, of course, possessed special knowledge of the provinces in which they resided. The same may be said of the Indian civilians who are appointed to the Council. But they were also men of sufficient capacity to give valuable advice on the affairs of India generally. Surely this race of men cannot be extinct. I do not, therefore, attach much importance to this objection. I quite admit that there is something in the objection that the appointment of natives would hamper discussion in the Council and render it impossible for that free and intimate communication which is certainly very desirable between members of the Cabinet. The caste system does, most unfortunately, place a very considerable barrier to social intercourse between Europeans and Hindus. Moreover, the difficulty does not only arise in the case of Hindus. I have always regarded it as a most unfortunate circumstance that the Mahomedans in India have, by long association, become so far Hinduised as to have, to some extent, adopted Hindu caste practices. I do not doubt that the noble Viscount (Lord Morley) and the noble Earl (Lord Crewe) are in constant and intimate communication with each other. What, however, would be the result if the religious sympathies of either the noble Earl or the noble Viscount prevented them from adjourning to the tea-room in the course of debate, and discussing matters over a cup of tea and some bread and butter? That, however, will be the position of the native members of the Council in respect to their European colleagues. The difficulty, I admit, is considerable, and, moreover, it is insuperable. But there is no necessity to exaggerate it. I cannot see why, in spite of this social barrier, as regards all political and business relations there should not be
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0119"/>
<col>189</col>
free and intimate discussion between the native and European members.<lb/>
I am always rather reluctant to draw any analogy between Egypt and India, because, although there are some points of similarity, there are a great many points of difference. At the same time, a case did occur two or three years ago in Egypt which is so much to the point that I will draw attention to it. Very constant complaints were being made that the Egyptian Ministers, who are all natives of Egypt, were too much under the control of the diplomatic representative and of the various English officials in the Egyptian Service. Although that criticism was mainly directed against myself, I quite agree that there was a certain amount of force in it, the truth being that Egyptian affairs when we took them in hand were in such a chaotic condition that we had to go through a period of transition, during which it was necessary to assert the paramount ascendency of British influence. The system was, however, a bad one, and there was no intention that it should be made permanent. Before I left Egypt, I took some steps to remedy it, and my successor has taken further steps in that direction. I will tell you what I did. The educational system had been the subject of very severe and unjust criticism in Egypt. I went to His Highness the Khedive and suggested that he should appoint as Minister for Education a very distinguished Mahomedan Judge, who I will not say was an Anglophobe, but who had the reputation of not being a great Anglophile. Moreover, he had made himself rather conspicuous by the somewhat acute, but perfectly honest, criticisms he had made on the educational system. A good many of my advisers shook their heads and said they thought I was wrong in suggesting him to the Khedive for this appointment. But what was the result? The first result was that this gentleman was a good deal embarrassed by his utterances in Opposition&#x2014;an embarrassment not unfamiliar to politicians in this country. He was very soon sobered by the responsibilities of office. He very soon came to understand that a great deal he had heard when in Opposition was not only exaggerated but entirely untrue, and he eventually&#x2014;I may say almost immediately&#x2014;worked most harmoniously with myself and the English officials. I think that entirely disproved the rather sombre anticipations which were put forward as regards his nomination. In
<col>190</col>
fact, I may say the only cause of difference I had with this gentleman was one which will elicit the sympathy of noble Lords opposite. He was rather in the habit of bringing forward far-reaching and costly proposals for reform, without having any clear idea where the money was to come from to carry them into execution. With that exception I do not think I had any difference with him at all.<lb/>
Another objection which has been urged, and which I quite admit is a very formidable objection, is the question whether a Hindu or Mahomedan is to be chosen. That is the point which causes me most to hesitate. Various proposals have been put forward to meet this difficulty, but they are all open to considerable objections, and I think the noble Viscount has done well to reject them. The difficulty has to be faced. There is no way out of it, but it does admit of mitigation. There is no reason whatever, because a Hindu is first appointed, that another Hindu should be appointed when the place falls vacant. Indeed, whoever is Secretary of State, I hope he will consider as favourably as possible the desirability of allowing a Mahomedan to have his turn after the Hindu. Natives will also have to be appointed to the Executive Councils of Bombay and Madras&#x2014;there will thus be an opportunity of doing something for the Mahomedans. These arguments are not entirely satisfactory, because the difficulty still remains, but the objection, great as it is, does not, in my mind, weigh against the general advantages of adopting the scheme of the noble Viscount.<lb/>
Turning to more general issues, the noble Viscount must be gratified at the way in which his proposals have been received. Nothing, of course, will satisfy the extremists. They are disappointed because the reforms do not go far enough. I cannot help thinking that one of the causes of their disappointment is that they go so far that, to a certain extent at all events, they have cut the agitation from under their feet. That there is a good deal of force in this argument on which much reliance appears to be placed I fully admit. I was glad to hear the noble Viscount say that only three per cent. of the educated classes of the country could be counted as extremists; it must not, however, be forgotten that this small residuum of three per cent. is capable of doing a great deal
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0120"/>
<col>191</col>
of mischief in respect to the remaining ninety-seven per cent. The noble Viscount said the only way to deal with extremists who overstep the law was stern repression. I entirely agree, but I do hope that some effort will be made to deal with the extremists who dwell in this country. I do not know whether your Lordships' attention has been drawn to a letter which appeared in <i>The Times</i> the other day. The writer of that letter, who calls himself the editor of the <i>Indian Sociologist</i>, defended the murder not only of Englishmen but of defenceless Englishwomen on the somewhat irrelevant and unconvincing ground that Milton and Cromwell were regicides and that the French erected a statue to Joan of Arc. He also warns us solemnly that we are not to send our kith and kin to India because they will run a very great risk of being murdered, and as far as I can gather from his letter he seems to think it is a very right and proper thing that they should be murdered. I am well aware that the place for a man of that sort is not a gaol but a lunatic asylum; and I am very glad to hear that the matter is receiving the consideration of the noble Viscount. An answer was given in another place to that effect, and I hope it will be found in some way possible to stop these proceedings. I am informed that the man who wrote this letter was educated at Oxford, and for my own part I certainly think that an educated sympathiser with criminals of this description is as guilty as, if not more guilty than the thrower of bombs and the man who uses the knife of the assassin, who are his dupes in India.<lb/>
For the rest, the policy of the noble Viscount has been to rally the moderates, and I think it may be said that the moderates have been rallied. The whole of the Mahomedan population may be counted as moderates, and I therefore heard with pleasure the noble Viscount's declaration that he was going to make some concessions that would conciliate the Mahomedans. As to the regulations, I was very glad to hear the noble Viscount say that he was disposed to consider some proposal which would enable Parliament to form an opinion of those regulations when they were framed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member>: <membercontribution>I gave no assurance of that kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member>: <membercontribution>I thought the
<col>192</col>
noble Viscount rather hinted that something of that sort would be done. I think, however, it certainly would be very desirable that Parliament should have the opportunity of seeing those regulations, and I consider it not improbable that in Committee some Amendment in that sense will be moved from these Benches. On the matter of supplementary questions, I wish to express my very cordial concurrence with Lord Curzon and Lord Midleton. I am afraid that whatever we do a large number of the men elected will be professional agitators or astute lawyers, who will be able to take full advantage of any opportunity of that kind. I hope that on that point the matter will be reconsidered when the regulations are framed.<lb/>
I entirely sympathise with the general scheme of the noble Viscount., and I hope he will not think that such criticisms as I have made derogate from that sympathy. I attach very great importance to what the noble Viscount said in regard to unanimity. I hope that when this reform scheme goes to India it will not be with the grudging consent of Parliament or as the view of one party in the State, but with the unanimous consent of Parliament and, as far as possible, of the British nation, and I trust that when we get into Committee we shall be able to come to some conclusions that will ensure that unanimity.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, every Member of your Lordships' House who has so far spoken has at some period been connected with the Government of India. I venture to intrude for a few moments although I have no similar claim to your attention; but I do think there are some things which in a discussion of this kind may be usefully said even by one who is in a completely detached position so far as the Indian Government is concerned. There is a general consensus of opinion which has found expression in this debate that something must be done; and general consent has reached this point, that that something must be a development of the powers and functions of the Legislative Councils. That being so, I venture to deprecate a good deal of the criticism that has followed and which is really rather inconsistent. I think that those who consent to the end had better not begrudge the inevitable machinery which must be employed to bring about those changes.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0121"/>
<col>193</col>
With regard to supplementary questions, it seems to have been forgotten that the regulation of the procedure of the Legislative Council is not vested in the Legislative Council, as is the case in regard to the two Houses of Parliament here, but in the Governor-General in Council, and it is entirely within the power of the Governor-General in Council to make rules which shall deal with any appearance of abuse of privileges. If in a Legisative Assembly the right to ask questions of Ministers exists, supplementary questions are inevitable. I have had some experience as a subordinate Minister in answering questions, and I have had more experience in watching the practice of questioning, and I can say that, in the absence of the right to put supplementary questions, a Minister will be able to put off the querists altogether with information he professes to give.<lb/>
Another point of objection is the waste of time and ability, and the increase of burden on the taxpayers, by requiring the presence of so many official members in the Viceroy's Council in order to establish a Government majority. The noble Lord who spoke last night with all the knowledge gained from his experience in India dwelt on the inconvenience and expense of appointing deputy officials, and the dislocation that might be caused throughout the whole hierarchy of officials in consequence; but if the representative character of the Viceroy's Council is to be conceded, and if it is necessary to have a number of officials for a Government majority, it is of no use to grumble about the consequences. It is urged by some that the Government majority is not a necessity, and that the use of votes by members who merely express the will of the Viceroy differs little from the use of the veto. As a compromise I suggest that the gentlemen who may form the Government majority should not be required to leave their functions in various parts of India, but should be allowed to vote by proxy, their proxies being in the pocket of a member of the Government. That could be done under the regulations. The regulations are of the utmost importance. Something has been said in favour of laying them on the Table of both Houses of Parliament, but I do not think that suggestion would stand examination. I think the regulations must be made in Calcutta, and must come into force there.
<col>194</col>
Upon the question of the manner of election, I entirely accept the conclusion of my noble friend the Secretary of State in giving way to the representations made to him on behalf of the Mahomedan population, though I do so with regret. I think my noble friend himself said that he arrived at this decision with regret; he did so because he felt it necessary to defer to the anxieties of the Mahomedans in India, but he added that he himself believed, as I do most completely, that those anxieties were misplaced. Under the scheme of election which was foreshadowed&#x2014;not too clearly, I admit&#x2014;in the Despatch, the Mahomedans would have obtained as full a proportion as they could desire. The Mahomedans and the non-Mahomedans, through the process of election suggested, would have got their separate representation in the ultimate Legislative Council in the exact proportion proposed to be given, and no cajolery or manipulations could have interfered with their getting that representation. I share the desire that Hindu and Mahomedan should be brought together in one electoral college, in order, if possible, to break down those antipathies which exist in so much force. My noble friend used an expression yesterday which I thought was not a very happy one. He said they would meet to pool their votes. They would not. They would meet together in order to elect a certain number of the members of the Legislative Council, but each elector would have only one vote and each vote could be given to one man only. The votes would be given to separate persons, and in the case of one man getting more votes than were necessary for his election they would be passed over to another candidate of that particular section. The result is that supposing the conclusion had been come to that one-fourth of the electoral college should be Mahomedan and three-fourths non-Mahomedan and that the body to be elected numbered twenty, the Mahomedans would certainly get five representatives and the Hindus, if they stuck together and voted for their men, would get the other fifteen.<lb/>
My noble friend deprecated entering into the question of proportional representation and referred to a saying by Calvin of those who had taken to another study&#x2014;that they were either mad when they took to it or became mad afterwards. Of course, the application of the parallel to students of proportional representation is easy. I do
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0122"/>
<col>195</col>
not know whether my noble friend would say that his master and mine, Mr. Mill, was mad before he took to it, when he took to it, or after he took to it. He certainly held it for the last thirteen or fourteen years of his life. He was regarded as sane and his teachings as well worthy of consideration; and there are other persons who have been reckless enough to enter on this particular subject without, I hope, altogether losing their reputation for sanity in consequence. The unfortunate ambiguity of the Despatch did give rise to the misconstruction which led the Moslems astray and excited their anxieties. The truth is that the scheme of my noble friend proposed and gave absolute justice to both branches of the community in India, favouring neither one nor the other.<lb/>
My noble friend spoke of the general acceptance of his scheme in India. He proceeded to refer to the particular classes of politicians there, and dwelt upon the effect produced by his scheme on each of them. The noble Viscount did not hope to secure much adhesion from the irreconcilables who had a tendency to physical force; and satisfaction was expressed by the noble Lord opposite that the Secretary of State, in referring to them, had talked of unfaltering repression. The noble Earl who has just sat down referred to the same words but in a different way, for he spoke of unfaltering repression with extremists "who overstepped the law." The noble Lord last night used the expression "unfaltering repression" without any such qualification. I daresay he did not realise his omission, but I think it is very unfortunate that there should be an omission of that kind. We all agree that unfaltering repression is a necessary action when the law is overstepped. It is, of course, very essential that the law itself should be just, and that it should not aim at repressing mere desires for an ideal future which may never come. I am sure that the Secretary of State when he talks of unfaltering repression uses the phrase only in reference to the necessity of preventing crime or the incitement to crime, which everybody agrees must be suppressed.<lb/>
I deprecate the division of the politicians of India into the three classes mentioned yesterday. I deprecate the habit of thinking of them in that fashion. I trust that the general effect of what my noble friend the Secretary of State has done will be a great reduction in the number of irreconcilables,
<col>196</col>
though some, of course, will continue to exist&#x2014;they exist everywhere&#x2014;and the development of constitutional methods of procedure. I deprecate entirely pronouncements as to what may or may not be the outcome of all these changes in the distant future. It has taken a long time to come about, but my noble friend said last night and said truly, that what he is proposing to-day is the development of what Mr. James Mill wrote in 1833, and of what the Queen said in her Proclamation to the people of India in 1858. It is a mere form of evolution of the principle that fitness is the sole qualification for office, and that no discrimination should be made, as far as possible, in respect of race and creed. What is proposed now is the development of what was said then. Yet it is probably true that Mr. Mill did not conceive then what is being proposed now, nor can we now say what will be the development fifty years hence of the beginnings we are making to-day.<lb/>
I see no reason whatever for laying down the maxim that Colonial self-government can never, under any circumstances, come to pass in India. When we consider what has been done in the last thirty years in Japan and observe the movement in China, is it not rash to declare what may be the ultimate form of government fifty years hence in India? We have had government for the people in India. It is impossible to carry that on without proceeding to government through the people of India. By and by you will come more and more to government by the people. If it is done cautiously, as I have no doubt it will be done, there is no necessity to trouble much about the ultimate goal. There must be great changes, there will be great changes, and the mass of the people of India will be associated more and more with every branch of the administration and government of India from the highest to the lowest. I am content to watch and wait, and, if the act done to-day is good, to support it thoroughly, leaving to the future the working out of one of the greatest problems that ever befel statesmen or nation&#x2014;the problem of gradually moderating the government of a whole subject people by an imported handful of persons of another race, another creed, and another training. It is wonderful, under such conditions, that the problem has been so successfully met as it has been up to this time. Not a few of the people of India think that the creed of the governing race
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0123"/>
<col>197</col>
is an impiety, that their lives are bestial, and their touch an abomination. We have to work all that clown, and we shall only do it by great toleration of their ideals and by not attempting to circumscribe to-day what may come to pass hereafter.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>*THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the Bill has keen so fully discussed from this Bench as well as from other quarters of the House that I shall compress as closely as I can the few observations I desire to offer; and I shall endeavour to be doubly careful in what I say, because the noble Viscount opposite administered to me last night a very gentle rebuke to the effect that when I referred to this subject in the debate on the Address I read him a lecture or homily. I can assure the noble Viscount that nothing was further from my thoughts than to lecture him, and, having referred to the passage in question, I remain of opinion that there was nothing in it which could be so described. I was referring to the measures taken by the Government of India, with the concurrence of the noble Viscount, for dealing with sedition, and I ventured to offer the opinion that for those measures to be successful they must be prompt, and that you must trust, not the man on the spot, but the men on the spot, by which I meant all men in authority in all parts of the country. If the noble Viscount really wishes to know what was in my mind when I referred to the necessity of not depriving the Governor-General in Council of any weapon which seemed to be necessary, I was thinking of those deportations under the regulation of 1818 to which the Government of India has had resort, and which the noble Viscount, reluctantly, I have no doubt, but in a manner which greatly redounds to his credit and courage, has from time to time authorised. I intended to indicate my approval of what had been done, and my hope that a similar policy would be followed in the future.<lb/>
In the course of this debate, the noble Viscount has referred to the fact that this Bill is in a sense the outcome of another Bill for which I had a considerable share of responsibility in 1892. May I say that if any credit was due for the initiation of the measure of 1892 it was due rather to my distinguished predecessor and old friend Lord Dufferin, from whom when I arrived in India I inherited the outline of a measure
<col>198</col>
of this description. In those days, as now, there were differences of opinion as to the pace at which it was safe to proceed, and I am inclined to think that in those days the Government at home was rather more inclined to put on the brake than His Majesty's present Government. At any rate, we produced amongst us a measure which certainly was a very cautious measure. It was our earnest desire to infuse new life into the Legislative Councils, and we were fully prepared to resort to election whenever it seemed to us that election could safely be resorted to. It seemed to us best to work so far as possible from the bottom upwards, and to take as the basis of our scheme the existing municipal boards and corporations. Having those principles and views constantly present to our minds, we did not feel ourselves able to recommend anything approaching a complete or symmetrical measure of reform. We thought it desirable to confer upon those newly-created constituencies only the right of recommending certain persons for appointment to the councils, subject to the approval of the head of the Government, and we took the utmost pains to protect the Government and to safeguard its authority by leaving it in possession of an official majority, and by very carefully restricting the right of free debate and the right of addressing questions to the Government. Our Bill was a considerable step in advance, and I think it was favourably regarded in India as such.<lb/>
But the question now arises whether the time has not come to go a step further. I think that question has by common consent been answered in the affirmative, and to that extent the noble Viscount certainly carries with him the opinion of both sides of the House. I will not dwell upon the reasons for which such a forward step is necessary. I am inclined to think the feeling present to most of our minds is that, in cases of this kind, you cannot stand still. You cannot go back, you cannot stand still; therefore you must go more or less forward. At certain points, moreover, I believe the Act of 1892 has not operated exactly as might have been wished, and there are defects in it which it should not be beyond our power to remove. That later consideration is evidently very much in the mind of the Government of India. The noble Viscount will recollect that in the forefront of the Despatch of 1907&#x2014;the Despatch on which this scheme is founded&#x2014;Lord Minto's Government stated that the
Act of 1892
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0124"/>
<col>199</col>
was unsatisfactory in that it did not give a sufficiently large share of representation to the most powerful and stable elements of Indian society. By that it was explained was intended the ruling chiefs of India, the great landowners and the representatives of commercial interests in India.<lb/>
The Government proposed in the first place to supplement the Legislative Councils by the appointment of advisory councils and councils of chiefs upon which the classes to which I have just referred were to be largely represented. In the next place, the Government proposed to institute certain changes in the Legislative' Councils themselves, and, more particularly, I find they proposed that there should be an additional electorate, recruited from the landed and moneyed classes. They desired that there should be more representation given to the classes who are now liable to be crowded out. That was, it seemed to me, the dominant note in the original project put forward by Lord Minto's Government and approved by the noble Viscount, and in exactly the same spirit was framed the proposal for giving special representation to the Mahomedan community. In regard to the discussion of the Budget, all that was proposed was that it should be dealt with by separate heads, so as to afford fuller opportunities for criticism, but not a word was said of any change in the rules as to the right of interpellation by members of Council. I think Lord Minto's scheme may be not inaptly described as having been conceived in a very generous and sympathetic spirit to the people of India, but it was a very carefully guarded scheme. It was pointed out in the Despatch that the Government of India desired to avoid any surrender or weakening of the supremacy of the British power in India. It was urged that the executive authority of the Government of India should be maintained in undiminished strength. In a very remarkable passage which follows they declare that if that undiminished authority is to be secured to the Government of India it should always have a numerical majority on the councils. The passage runs:&#x2014;
<quote>"The principle of a standing majority is accepted by the Government as an entirely legitimate and necessary consequence of the nature of the paramount power in India, and so far as they know it has never been disputed by any section of Indian opinion that does not dispute the legitimacy of the paramount power itself."</quote>
That is, I conceive, not an unfair outline of the original scheme put forward with
<col>200</col>
the concurrence of the noble Viscount opposite in August, 1907. Then came the consultation with the local Governors which went on for a very considerable time, and upon that consultation, the details of which are recorded in the two copious Blue-books, was founded the revised scheme of Lord Minto's Government.<lb/>
Now, the original scheme came out of this ordeal very little altered. The Secretary of State appears to question that. But as I read the Despatch addressed to the noble Viscount by Lord Minto's Government, after the consultation, it stops short of contemplating anything like popular election, it desires to secure representation for the land-owning and the moneyed classes, and recurs to the proposal that there is to be an advisory council and a council of chiefs. In fact, the idea seems to have been to rally the conservative classes in India to the support of the Government. It preserves the official majorities. It secures adequate representation for the Mahomedan community. It contains no proposals for altering the regulations in regard to questions. It proposes that there should be a right of discussing the Budget, but on the clear understanding that any opinion formed by the council on the Budget should take the shape of a recommendation which of itself would have no operative effect. That was the scheme which came before the noble Viscount opposite.<lb/>
I am very anxious to do the noble Viscount no injustice; but I think I am within the mark when I say that his scheme, the details of which are to be found in the Bill on the Table, in the noble Viscount's Despatch to the Government of India, and in his speeches in Parliament, goes very considerably beyond what was suggested to him by the Government of India. I hope he will not think me irreverent if I use an expression derived from a game of cards which is very popular on the other side of the Atlantic, and say that the noble Viscount saw Lord Minto's hand and went one better. I say that because the scheme of the noble Viscount is certainly based on popular election. It certainly gets rid of the official majority. It certainly extends the power of dealing with the Budget, and the right of interpellation is put considerably beyond what was proposed by the Government of India.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0125"/>
<col>201</col>
But it does more. The noble Viscount's scheme breaks entirely fresh ground in this, that it deals with the question of Executive Councils&#x2014;both the Viceroy's and Provincial&#x2014;which, as he knows were only dealt with in Lord Minto's Despatches in a very tentative fashion. Of course, he may say, with great fairness, that many of these things are left to be dealt with by regulations under the Bill. That, no doubt, is the case. But the general result, so far as I can see, of his action has been that he has converted an extremely cautious proposal made to him by the Government of India into a scheme which, in my judgment, is very much less cautious and reaches very much further. And this is done at a moment when the greatest possible caution is necessary in dealing with Indian affairs. It was truly said by my noble friend Lord Midleton that the effect of these proposals on the Legislative Councils cannot be really understood unless you consider, not the effect of each single separate proposal, but their cumulative effect taken altogether; and I do not think that aspect of the case was much touched upon by the noble Viscount in his statement the other evening. Taken by themselves, however, these things are serious enough. You have a large increase in the number of the Councils You have a system of election which I shall always maintain is foreign to the ideas of the people of India. It is a European system which they do not understand, and which I do not believe they greatly care about.<lb/>
Then there is the question of the right of the head of the Government to object to the appointment of an unsuitable and undesirable member. The noble Viscount made this evening an announcement which interested us extremely, and which I am bound to say goes far towards disarming any misgivings which I have on this particular point. We understand that in the rules which are to be promulgated there are to be certain categories of exclusions, and I have no doubt that in that net the noble Viscount will catch some of the personages whose presence on the councils would be most objectionable. But so long as the head of the Government has no right of objecting to a particular member on the ground that his presence would fatally impair the efficiency or good order of the council, so long will there be a risk, and a very considerable risk, that men will be elected&#x2014;I am not speaking now of men who
<col>202</col>
have actually undergone imprisonment or anything of that kind&#x2014;that men will be elected who can be familiarly described as very dangerous firebrands, and who will take advantage of their presence on the council in order to make good government extremely difficult, if not impossible. I am afraid one must admit that in the eyes of the people of India themselves it will seem most strange and unaccountable that the Government should tolerate upon these bodies the presence of men who are known to be flagrantly disloyal and promoters of sedition. They will ask themselves why these things happen. A friend of mine showed me not very long ago a very interesting passage in an article published in a magazine in this country by a rather well-known Indian gentleman, Ooday Pertab Singh, Rajah of Bhinga, in Oude. It runs:&#x2014;
<quote>"A man desirous of entering the council has now but to make a few speeches before a debating club of schoolboys denouncing the foreign rule as a curse, painting every official European as a scoundrel and every supporter of the British rule as a vagabond. Thus he paves his way to election to a municipal or local board, as a member of which he decries every measure originating with the Government as inhuman and unjust. He is honoured with the appellation of the champion of liberty, and has not to wait long for a seat in the legislative Councils, local or supreme."</quote>
That is how Indian natives look at the admission of gentlemen of this undesirable class to seats on the Legislative Council. I trust, therefore, that the noble Viscount, when he comes to deal with the question of regulations, will consider very carefully whether it is not necessary to strengthen the hands of the heads of the local Governments on this particular point.<lb/>
I pass from that to the question of the official majorities. I confess that I am sorry that the official majorities are to exist no longer. I think it is a dangerous thing to expose these local Governments to the risk of being out-voted in council. I think it would be a shock to their authority, a shock which, if possible, we should avoid.<lb/>
A good deal, again, has been said as to the effect of these changes upon the position of the officials who will take part in the proceedings of the Legislative Councils. I am bound to say that I entirely agree with what has been said by my noble friend Lord Curzon as to the very deplorable effect which it may have upon their position in the future. In the first place,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0126"/>
<col>203</col>
this work cannot help distracting them and luring their attention away from what is their real official business. They have plenty to do, and you take them away from their proper work, disorganise the department to which they belong, and give them work for which a great many of them are by no means specially fitted.<lb/>
Lord Ampthill thought that this argument was a rather unkind cut to the Indian Civil Service. I do not think so. The Indian Civil servant has his particular <i>metier</i>, and performs it extremely well, and I desire to associate myself with all those who have spoken with respect of this most distinguished body of public servants. But they have not been brought up to take part in the hurly-burly of public discussion. When I heard this point discussed this evening, my memory recurred to some words which were spoken at this Table by Lord Rosebery on the occasion when we were all of us lamenting the death of the Duke of Devonshire. Lord Rosebery said that none of us, probably, knew how much anguish the Duke of Devonshire used to feel when he was called upon to make an important speech. These words, I think, must have come home to many of us. I suspect most of us have at different times shared that feeling of anguish, but, if we have that feeling, what will be the feeling of a wretched assistant secretary who has got to go down to the council and stand an hour or two hours heckling at the hands of men who could hold their own at that amusement with any Scottish heckler or with any Irish Member of Parliament? Have none of us ever felt when we had office work to do, and when we have had a speech to make the next day, that our office work rather suffered in consequence? And do you not suppose that these poor gentlemen will, occasionally, spend many hours of misery and trepidation with a debate hanging over them, and that their thoughts will be turned away from their proper work to the task of preparation?<lb/>
As I said a moment ago, a great deal depends on the rules which are to be made. As my noble friend truly said, this Bill is really a blank cheque, and, until the rules are made, we do not know how the cheque is going to be filled up. We are very anxious to elicit from the noble Viscount a little more information as to the extent to which he proposes to take Parlia-
<col>204</col>
ment into his confidence with regard to these rules. I certainly gathered from him last night, and I gathered it with the very greatest pleasure, that in some shape or form Parliament was to have an opportunity of becoming aware of, and, therefore, the opportunity of discussing, these new rules. May I read the words which the noble Viscount is reported in the newspapers this morning to have used:&#x2014;
<quote>"No doubt it is desirable that some of the heads of the regulations, rules, and proclamations to be made by the Government of India, under the sanction of the India Office, should be, more or less, placed within the reach and knowledge of the House so far as they are complete."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member>: <membercontribution>May I explain to the noble Marquess exactly what I meant and what I mean? As he will remember, I first of all read out the language used by Mr. Gladstone in 1892, and accepted at that moment by Lord Curzon, to the effect that the regulations, rules, and proclamations formed under the Act must be made in India by the Government of India. That was my general view. Then I went on to say that I thought it was right that the heads of these regulations, so far as we had then arrived at them, should be stated to Parliament, and my intention is, when we go into Committee, when, I believe, I shall have the opportunity of making some general observations on the Bill of a very short kind, to explain to the House what the general heads of the regulations are at the stage at which we have now arrived&#x2014;I am in telegraphic communication with the Government of India&#x2014;what is their effect, and what they come to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member>: <membercontribution>I am very much obliged to the noble Viscount for his explanation. I do not think we all understood what he said quite in that sense, and, until we have had an opportunity of listening to the promised statement on the rules, I would prefer to withhold further observations, except this general observation, that the circumstances do not seem to me to be in any way the same as the circumstances of 1892, and that, on the face of it, I should think that there would be a good deal to be said for the view that Parliament should be given an opportunity of seeing the whole of the rules in their complete form, and then, if necessary, it would be open to anyone to call attention to them or even to move a resolution with regard to them. Of course, the noble Viscount will not imagine for a moment that I want
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0127"/>
<col>205</col>
to suggest that the rules and regulations should be brought in as a Bill and debated clause by clause. That is not my intention at all.<lb/>
May I pass for one moment to the question of the Executive Councils? We are to have enlarged Executive Councils in Madras and Bombay, and we are to have, or we may have, new Executive Councils in other provinces. One comment I venture to make upon that is that this part of the scheme has, apparently, been put through with very great haste and with not nearly the same amount of discussion and consideration which has been given to the part of the scheme which deals with Legislative Councils. The noble Viscount thought last night that I had lost my way in that part of the Bill. I do not think I have. I told the noble Viscount that I had strong views with regard to the appointment of an Indian member on the Viceroy's Council, and then I went on to say that, until the Despatch of October, 1908, we had never heard anything, and the Government of India had never said anything at all about reforms in the Executive Councils, and that is the case. The first reference to the question is to be found in paragraph 76 of the October Despatch, and what is said in that paragraph? Lord Minto's Government postulates, in the first place, that we are to have experience of the working of the new Legislative Councils before the question of Executive Councils is taken up. It postulates that there is to be a consultation with those who are test qualified to advise before the matter is disposed of, and, finally, there is no reference of any kind in that paragraph to the Viceroy's Council. What does the noble Viscount do? He does not wait for the experience of the new Legislative Councils. He does not wait for the consultation. There is a rumour that some kind of consultation is in progress at this moment. I do not know whether I am right or wrong, but what I want to ask is are we going to be told why this long and laborious consultation with experts of all kinds was necessary in the case of the Legislative Councils, why are we given all these copious materials for forming a judgment on that point, and why was there, apparently, no consultation, and why are we given no materials for forming a judgment in the case of the Executive Councils?<lb/>
I am afraid His Majesty's Government have rather got into a habit of legislating
<col>206</col>
first and consulting afterwards. We had a leading case in the Old Age Pensions Act of last year, and I think there is going to be another leading case in the Bill for the disestablishment of the Welsh Church. There is on record a considerable amount of expert opinion unfavourable to that part of the proposal which gives Executive Councils to the Provincial Governments. The noble Viscount, I am sure, remembers that in 1905 the matter was mooted in Bengal, and I have seen it stated in the Press, and it has never been contradicted, that the proposal was unanimously rejected at that time by the Government of India. If I am wrong the noble Viscount will have an opportunity of contradicting me. There does not seem to me to be any point in the scheme where consultation was more called for than this particular point. Is it really quite fair to impose upon a Lieutenant-Governor of a province an Executive Council which, perhaps, he does not want, to convert his subordinates into colleagues, and to associate with him, whether he likes it or not, one or two Indian colleagues&#x2014;is it fair to do all that without, at least, giving him an opportunity of urging anything that he can urge in opposition to the proposal? There is a very remarkable feature in the scheme&#x2014;and here we are dealing with a clause in the Bill and not with regulations which may be hereafter made. Under a clause in the Bill, as I understand it, the Bombay and Madras Councils are to consist of four members.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member>: <membercontribution>Of a number not exceeding four.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member>: <membercontribution>Of whom two are to be qualified by official experience?</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member>: <membercontribution>My point is this. Will it, under this clause,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0128"/>
<col>207</col>
be open to the Secretary of State to put into the Council of a Governor two Indian gentlemen neither of whom has had any official training or experience, who may indeed have acquired a political celebrity, but who have never been successful in acquiring a reputation as trained and efficient administrators? That is the real question, and I hope it will be answered.<lb/>
With regard to the appointment of an Indian Member on the Viceroy's Council may I be allowed to say that, although I do not see eye to eye with the noble Viscount upon this point, I do most entirely appreciate the feelings which induced him to make the proposal? I think, if I may say so, that the passage in his speech which dealt with that question was one which, perhaps more than any other, appealed to the sympathies of the House. If I may use the expression used by my noble friend Lord Cromer, I understand that this is a case in which the Secretary of State thinks that political&#x2014;or perhaps I should say sentimental&#x2014;considerations should be allowed to outweigh considerations based on efficiency pure and simple. I am the last person in the world to desire that in a case of this kind no weight should be given to sentimental considerations. I think it would be a bad day when in our public life we ceased to have regard to considerations which may fairly be described as sentimental considerations.<lb/>
But I would ask this question&#x2014;What sentiments are we thinking and talking about? Is it Indian sentiment, or are we quite sure that it is not European sentiment which we are taking into account? If it were possible to ascertain what Indian sentiment is upon this subject I believe there would be a preponderance of Indian sentiment against putting an Indian upon the Viceroy's Council. I do not know to what quarters the noble Viscount would look for an opinion of the contrary kind. The inarticulate masses for whose benefit we govern India know nothing about the Viceroy's Council, and would be profoundly indifferent. The fifty-three millions of Mahomedans are up in arms against it, and will remain up in arms against it unless the noble Viscount gives them what he has peremptorily refused to give them&#x2014;a second Mahomedan member to serve alongside of a Hindu member. Then what about the sentiment of the chiefs and rulers of
<col>208</col>
India? What is the advice which the noble Viscount has received upon that point? I am under the impression that it will be eminently distasteful to the chiefs and rulers of India that they should be governed&#x2014;that orders should be issued in the name of the Government of India&#x2014;by a gentleman who, if the indication given to us by the noble Viscount is correct, would probably be an extremely able Calcutta lawyer. Therefore I really believe that if one could conceive of an Indian <i>referendum</i> upon this point you would be answered by a great preponderance of opinion against the addition of a native member to the Viceroy's Council.<lb/>
But let me put sentimental or political considerations on one side. What about the practical effect of the proposals? I presume this is one of those cases where His Majesty's Government desire to introduce representative institutions "of a practical kind," as recommended for Persia in the gracious Speech from the Throne. The practical result which the noble Viscount expects to obtain is that the Viceroy will be given a responsible adviser with a knowledge of the country who will act as a kind of counterpoise to the exclusively British element. All I can say is that the Viceroy's Council never was recruited upon principles of that kind, and I am forced to believe that if you are going to appoint an Indian gentleman to the Viceroy's Council and prefer him to other competitors because he is an Indian, you are in fact introducing a test of a wholly novel description. But the noble Viscount explained matters a little more fully yesterday. We understood from him that these appointments are to be filled with reference to the merit of the particular candidate, and if that is really so&#x2014;if we could be told that the Secretary of State will look round and will not give the appointment to an Indian gentleman unless he is convinced that that Indian gentleman is really a stronger candidate from an official point of view than any other candidate in the field&#x2014;then my objection is to some extent, but not entirely, mitigated.<lb/>
But what really as rather shaken my confidence in the judgment of the noble Viscount on this point is the appeal which he has made in this House to two analogies&#x2014;the analogy of his own Council in Whitehall, and the analogy of Indian Judges. Surely it is notorious that the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0129"/>
<col>209</col>
whole position and functions of the Secretary of State's Council are wholly dissimilar from the position and functions of the Viceroy's Council in India. The Secretary of State's Council has no initiative; it is purely consultative; it has no executive functions; and, last but not least, the two Indian members of the Secretary of State's Council are wholly removed from the kind of influences to which an Indian in Calcutta will certainly be exposed. The analogy of the Judges seems to be equally wide of the mark. The Judge has to administer judicially a code of law from which he cannot depart. The functions of the Viceroy's Council are executive in the strictest sense of the word.<lb/>
I regret the effect of this new departure upon the efficiency of the Viceroy's Council. The claims of efficiency may, no doubt, sometimes be pushed too far, but I confess I think that in this case efficiency ought to come first, and I think we are justified in claiming that the institution known as the Governor-General in Council has been one of the most efficient instruments of government in the world. The noble Viscount referred very appropriately the other day to the admiration expressed by ex-President Roosevelt for our system of Indian government. What has been the secret of the success of that government? It is that it has been so constituted that it has been able to observe the strictest possible neutrality so far as the people of India are concerned, and that is why the people of India trust it. I say it with no disrespect to Indian gentlemen, I do not believe that you can find such a thing as an absolutely neutral Indian, and if he is neutral nobody would believe that he is. But I know that the noble Viscount has burnt his boats so far as that part of his scheme is concerned. I can only hope that he may prove to be right, and that I may prove to be wrong. But with regard to the provincial councils a good deal yet remains open, and I earnestly hope that the noble Viscount will take in good part and will consider attentively the suggestions that have been made to him with regard to one or two points in his scheme that deal with these Councils.<lb/>
I make one suggestion. I am afraid the noble Viscount will reject it summarily. But I do wish that he could find it consistent with his duty to postpone for the present. and entirely without prejudice, the two
<col>210</col>
clauses dealing with the Executive Councils. If he would do that, if he would allow those clauses to come up in a separate Bill after he had elicited opinions from all those whom he would naturally consult, I feel quite sure the House would consider them with an open mind and with no desire to impair the usefulness of the scheme as a whole.<lb/>
I apologise to the House and to the noble Viscount for having dealt somewhat critically with his proposals. But we who have had some experience of Indian affairs are bound to tell him what we think about these proposals, we are bound to warn him if we think any of them are of a dangerous character, and, after all, we are playing for tremendous stakes. This Bill may prove&#x2014;or rather, I would say it will prove&#x2014;to be a turning point in the history of our position in India. We should be untrue to ourselves if, while there is still time, we did not urge him to consider well whether at some points he is not going to travel rather too fast over ground which we all of us know is honeycombed with pitfalls and dangers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>*THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I ought, I think, to apologise to the House for rising to address your Lordships at all at this hour of the evening; but I think it would scarcely be respectful that the debate should close without one or two observations being made from this Bench. My noble friend the Secretary of State for India will take an opportunity before the House is put into Committee on the Bill to make a general statement dealing with the various points raised in the course of this debate. I shall, therefore, confine myself to one or two observations on the question of the Legislative Councils, their constitution, and their proposed procedure. I confess that the demand made for a veto by the principal authority on the appointment or election of any particular member does seem to me to be going very far. It certainly does seem to me that the introduction of the electoral system can be of very little value if the man elected can be declared incapable of sitting not on any specific ground, but simply because the Lieutenant-Governor or Governor-General does not desire to see him on the Council. A power of that nature given to an individual is a dangerous power, and one
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0130"/>
<col>211</col>
to which it is unlikely my noble friend could agree.<lb/>
A word or two seem necessary on the question of official majorities. What seems to me the case is this. A Council composed of an official majority and an unofficial minority works very well in ordinary times. but if it comes to a state of things when the official majority is always drawn on one side and the non-official minority on the other, then we may be quite sure that there is something altogether wrong with the condition of the Government of the country or province. You may get your way but in a manner that is by no means satisfactory, a manner that makes it scarcely worth getting. So far as the Colonial Office is concerned, if such a state of things were to become habitual, we should regard it as a very strong case for some form of outside inquiry. The blame would not necessarily be upon the Governor or the Government, but there would be indication that in some way the machinery of Government had broken down. If you have an unofficial majority in this case I understand the carrying through of what are called "wild cat Bills" is in the last resort prevented by the use of the veto. Further than that&#x2014;and this, of course, is a safeguard which does not exist in the case of all unofficial majorities&#x2014;when it is thought necessary to pass a particular measure in the teeth of an unofficial majority, a power is given to do so. That seems to me to safeguard your position, but it is really safeguarded, as pointed out by Lord Ampthill, in an entirely different way by the fact that these unofficial majorities are not, or certainly ought not to be, solid bodies. I should not think very much of a Governor who did not somehow find means of detaching some of the non-official members from their colleagues and transferring them to the supporters of his own point of view. I do not say that if he failed to do so on a particular occasion he would show himself inefficient, but assume that the non-official members were drawn up in a line opposed to the official members in a given case. I should be disposed to think that the executive officer, though he might be a good Governor in other ways, was not a very efficient politician or had not the qualities of a skilful diplomatist.<lb/>
The noble Lord said last night that after all there was no great hardship in being in a perpetual minority, and he pointed
<col>212</col>
to these Benches as illustrating the possibility of being in that position and yet surviving. Well, my lords, appearances are sometimes deceptive. We may maintain a calm demeanour and even attain at times to the appearance of a spurious joviality, but the noble Lord will guess, if he does not know, the effect on our general character, our tempers, and our minds, of living in a state of being perpetually outvoted. I am speaking quite seriously when I say that if the noble Lord opposite had shared our fate during the ten years before we came into office, he would know the truth of what I am saying. Most of us towards the end of those ten years were beginning to lose interest in public life, and began to think it might be well to turn our attention to the cultivation of our gardens, and had it not been for the emergence of the fiscal question, which gave new life to proceedings in your Lordships' House, I am not sure but some of us would have done so.<lb/>
I pass to points upon which it is supposed some danger might arise, and the use of supplementary questions has been mentioned. Well, I should have thought that this power would prove a very useful safety-valve, I assume under proper restrictions. The noble Lord seems to forget that many more men like to talk about their grievances than expect redress. I was looking the other day at an account, by a very skilled observer, of one of the native races that come under my Office&#x2014;more advanced, no doubt, than some of the races in India; and he said of them that it was a characteristic that if they had a grievance they would come and talk about it, perhaps for an hour on end, and were so satisfied at having relieved their minds by this long and elaborate complaint that they often walked away without waiting to hear what he had to say in reply. That, of course, is an extreme instance. At the same time I think noble lords underrate the value of this safety-valve of talk, and I cannot help thinking that if supplementary questions were forbidden, a great deal of the reality of the Legislative Councils must necessarily pass away. It is said that it would be hard upon officials, would take up too much of their time, and that they would be engaged in oratory against skilled speakers who merely wished to cause annoyance. Now I have always found that the man who knows his subject, orator or not, makes a good speech upon it. The speeches that are ineffective, are those made by men
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0131"/>
<col>213</col>
who really do not know what they are talking about. I cannot in my own mind doubt that experienced administrators will find no difficulty, in nine cases out of ten, in dealing with popular, glib but infinitely less informed speakers whom they may have to encounter.<lb/>
I pass to a different point&#x2014;the regulations which are to fill in the framework of the Bill. One noble Lord said we were asked to give a blank cheque, and in one sense it is a blank cheque; but it is like one of those cheques signed by a body of trustees&#x2014;it will have a great many other signatures at its foot besides that of my noble friend. Something has been said about these regulations being laid on the Table of the House, with a view, I suppose, of their being altered upon the presentation of an Address from either House. That is a demand to which we could not assent. In the first place, it would be entirely foreign to practice in these matters, and to the principle laid down by Mr. Gladstone quoted by my noble friend and in general terms, I think, agreed to by the noble Lord opposite. The noble Marquess said this did not mean that the regulations would be debated clause by clause in Parliament; but it was a large demand to make by Members of this House, who have a strong position and control of our legislative proposals here&#x2014;complete control except in regard to details in the region of finance. If they are going to ask also for control over purely administrative matters, they are making a demand never made before, and one to which I do not think my noble friend could possibly agree. It would simply mean that the ultimate form of the regulations would be settled by a few noble Lords who are competent to have an opinion on the question from their Indian experience and who sit on the Bench opposite. That is the simple outcome of the proposal, and, if noble Lords think of it seriously, they must see that it is not a proposal which my noble friend behind me could possibly accept.<lb/>

Then I turn to the question of the native member of the Executive Council, and here I think some confusion seems to have arisen by the use of the word "representative." It is sometimes said that if an Indian member is placed on the Viceroy's Executive Council he is to be the representative of India. It is undoubtedly true, as has been already pointed out, that no one man
<col>214</col>
can be the representative of India, because there are so many Indias. But I do not understand that, if and when this gentleman is put on, he is to be put on as the representative of India. My noble friend's proposition is not to create a representation but to remove a disability, and that is surely a very different thing indeed. A closer analogy than those which have been made seems to me the removal of Catholic disabilities in 1829. If you were to take the specific instance of the disability which still exists in appointing a Roman Catholic to the office held by my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack or the Lord Lieutenacy of Ireland, the removal of that disability does not necessarily mean that a Roman Catholic will always be appointed to that particular office. It would mean, just as my noble friend's proposition means, that, other things being equal, the person who holds that creed is as fit as any other person to hold that particular office. That is all that can be actually said to be meant by my noble friend's proposition.<lb/>
The ultimate method of working out the proposition is, I admit, a different matter. It may so happen that the appointment of a native member will tend towards the filling of one particular office by a native rather than by another. Obviously there are some posts on the Viceroy's Council which could never be held by a native, but we ought, I think, to get rid of this notion of representation, which has been rather unfortunately imported into the question&#x2014;unfortunately because it gives a wrong idea both to people in this country and in India as to what is really meant by the proposal. I very heartily re-echo one remark that fell from the noble Earl on the Cross-benches, and that is the extreme importance of this proposition being so far as possible a unanimous one, when it reaches India. The value of anything proposed by my noble friend, I quite admit, must be diminished if it becomes the subject of acute controversy here with men, like the noble Lord opposite, who are well known and thoroughly respected in India.<lb/>
This debate has undoubtedly been maintained on the high level which distinguishes your Lordships' House. Here and there there has been an observation which we on this side of the House have heard with regret. I thought, if I may say so, that the whole tone of
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0132"/>
<col>215</col>
the remarks of the noble Lord opposite, Lord Curzon, was somewhat unduly pessimistic about the entire scheme. He seemed to speak with lights turned half down and to the sound of rather melancholy music. I do not also, I admit, entirely appreciate the observations of the noble Lord behind me with regard to the future destinies of India. I do not know that the prophecies to which he objected were exactly necessary prophecies, but I am quite sure that the noble Lord's prophecies in turn were not needed either. What will be the future of India fifty, sixty, or a hundred years hence need not, I think, trouble us. It is on the knees of the gods, and all we have got to do is to provide, as best we can, for the conditions of the moment, having, of course, an eye to the future, but not troubling ourselves about what may happen in days when, to use Sheridan's words&#x2014;"all of us are dead and most of us are forgotten." I think that my noble friend behind me has good reason to be satisfied with the recep-
<col>216</col>
tion of his Bill. He has been himself the recipient of many tributes which, I can assure the House, give even more pleasure to his colleagues than they do to himself. I trust that the future course of the Bill in its later stages will be easy and prosperous.</membercontribution></p>

<title>AUSTRALASIA AND NAVAL DEFENCE.</title>
<p><member>LORD BRASSEY</member> <membercontribution>rose to call attention to the proceedings of the Colonial Conference, 1907, in relation to Naval Defence; and to the correspondence relating to the Naval Defence of Australia and New Zealand [Cd. 4325], 1908.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Lord said</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I desire briefly to call attention to the policy of concerted action between the Mother-country and the Colonies for naval defence. The subject is important to-day; it must become more important in the near future. It was fully discussed at the last Colonial Conference; and on his return to Australia it was brought before the Parliament of the Commonwealth by Mr. Deakin in a powerful speech. The Colonial Conference of 1907 marked a new departure. It was seen that our Colonial fellow-subjects no longer lean wholly on the Motherland for naval protection. They are ready, nay eager, to relieve us of some of the responsibility which we have hitherto borne, practically unaided. We must not look for increased contribu-
<col>218</col>
tions from the Colonies to the Imperial Exchequer. The Premiers insisted on the unpopularity, and, indeed, the impossibility, of accepting serious financial burdens. In young countries Budgets are charged with heavy demands for public works&#x2014;railways, harbours, irrigation, and other undertakings&#x2014;which can only be carried out by the aid of the local government. While unable to share the burden of Imperial expenditure on the Navy in any adequate degree, assurances were given at the Conference that Australasia stands prepared to establish a local force for naval defence. The Commonwealth is secured from attacks in strength by the Imperial Navy. The valuable coasting trade, estimated at &#x00A3;170,000,000 annually, may be interrupted by feeble raiders. In the absence of the Imperial squadron Australasia is defenceless. That is not a condition in which a spirited people can be content to remain.<lb/>
The Colonial Governments have no difficulties as to manning. At the Conference the Premiers pointed with just pride to their Naval Reserves, newly raised at the instance of the Admiralty. It is more difficult to build vessels in sufficient numbers. The cost of the small flotilla of destroyers and submarines recommended by the Admiralty for the defence of the Australian ports is estimated at &#x00A3;1,300,000. The somewhat larger, but still inadequate, flotilla of vessels of the same type recommended by the naval officers of the Commonwealth is put at &#x00A3;2,300,000. In the first creation of Colonial navies the Mother-country may give much-needed aid by the loan or the gift of vessels which we are well able to spare. The submarines recommended by the Admiralty for the defence of the Australian ports may be locally built. The destroyers and the dep&#x00F4;t ships can be loaned or given from the Imperial Fleet.<lb/>
Having provided for harbour defence, the local Navy of Australia requires a cruiser squadron. In a paper contributed to the <i>Navy League Annual</i> by Captain Collins, R.N., the acting representative of the Commonwealth in London, some details are given of the scheme set forth by Mr. Deakin for the establishment of a local naval force. Mr. Deakin relies on the loan from the Imperial Navy of four third-class cruisers of the <i>Pelorus</i> class&#x2014;of 2,125 tons. We can spare these vessels. Cruisers of a larger type are also necessary. Patrol duty in Australian waters demands the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0134"/>
<col>219</col>
employment of cruisers capable of keeping the seas in all weathers&#x2014;vessels of considerable dimensions, and therefore costly. We have on the British Navy List twenty-six protected second-class cruisers. We are more than equal in this class to the combined strength in that class of the United States, France, Germany, and Russia. <i>Experto credo;</i> and remembering the anxiety at the Admiralty when hasty preparations were called for on the occasion of the Penjdeh incident, I venture strongly to urge that two or more effective second-class cruisers should be laid up in reserve in Australian ports. In peace they would be valuable as drill-ships. In war they would be on their station and instantly ready for service.<lb/>
A policy of liberal aid to the Colonies in their first naval efforts is for mutual advantage. With a falling revenue and increasing charges for naval construction, we stand in need of support from our Colonial fellow-subjects. The annual cost of the Australian squadron at the date of a recent Return was &#x00A3;300,000. A large amount falls to be added to cover the cost of the ships. When a local force has been created it may no longer be necessary to maintain in full strength an Imperial squadron on the Australian station. In providing the vessels required for the young navy of Australia we give help where and when it is needed, and in giving that help we do something material to cement Imperial unity.<lb/>
In conclusion, I may briefly refer to some observations lately published on the defence of Australia by Captain Cresswell, Naval Director to the Commonwealth. Captain Cresswell has long advocated a local naval force for Australia. He reasonably contends that such a force is the more essential in view of the concentration of the Imperial fleets in home waters. As Captain Cresswell points out, there would be no more weakening distraction to an Admiralty charged with the conduct of a great naval war than responsibility for the safety of vast interests at a great distance. To defend Australia from the heart of the Empire must involve a prodigious effort. It may be compared to the lifting of a weight at the end of a pole. I have endeavoured to indicate a policy which would relieve us in some degree of a very heavy responsibility, and which involves no appreciable addition to the Navy Estimates.</membercontribution></p>
<col>220</col>
<p>*<member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, Australia is making arrangements at the present time to build two destroyers. They are to be twenty-six knot speed, with a radius of 4,500 miles of action, and it is intended that they shall be built strong enough to deal with those terribly heavy seas which occur on that coast, and be really seagoing vessels. If they insist upon those points they cannot get the very great speed which we have recently got in some of our lighter-built torpedo-boats. Australia is now starting a small navy of her own, and I only hope it will grow into one in proportion to her importance and her wealth. In his speech published in the Blue-book, to which Lord Brassey has referred, Mr. Deakin said that Great Britain's contribution for defence was six times as large as that of Australia. He took that of Australia as being 6s. a head. As the inhabitants of Australia are man for man richer than those of England, I think the Common-wealth ought to be able to undertake to find a much larger sum for her own defence. I look on the correspondence in the Bluebook as forming an excellent basis for enabling Australia to start a navy of her own, with the aid of officers and men now serving in our own Navy, thereby relieving the British Navy from the duty of protecting commerce in Australian waters. Under the new scheme the Admiralty would not be bound to maintain a squadron in Australian waters. It would be almost impossible in time of war to send destroyers to Australia. After the long sea voyage, considerable repairs would be required before they would be fit for service. Therefore I am very glad that Australian arrangements have taken the direction of beginning with the provision of destroyers. They would be ready out there when war began. Such vessels would not be able to engage in daylight with the class of vessels from which our commerce would be in danger&#x2014;fast light-armed steamers. Such steamers arriving at the Australian station would, in the absence of opponents, make a flying base on the coasts and islets that surround our Colonies, and take matters easily, but if a destroyer with a 4,500 miles radius were in the neighbourhood, the steamer would have an anxious time when in harbour with night watches fatiguing her crew, and with decks always clear, while time would be given for our own cruisers to arrive and deal with her. In fact, the knowledge that destroyers or submarines were in the neighbourhood would double the time that an
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0135"/>
<col>221</col>
enemy's cruiser would be innocuous while coaling or refitting.<lb/>
One of the most important parts of the Blue-book is the statesmanlike speech in which Mr. Deakin referred to a possible invasion of Australia, and the strength of the territorial force that Australia ought to be able to raise. Mr. Haldane, in his recent speech at Newcastle, referred to the same subject, and expressed a hope that Australia would be able to raise five divisions for a territorial force. Last week I witnessed the play, "An Englishman's Home," and I would have suggested to the Under-Secretary for War, had he been in the house, that furlough might be granted to Major Du Maurier, the talented author of the play, on condition that he should visit Australia and apply himself to the writing of a similar piece with Colonial surroundings. If such a play were produced, the chances of Mr. Haldane's inducing Australia to raise the five divisions would be considerably increased. Unless Australia is prepared to fill her cradles, encourage immigration, and occupy all the habitable land in that vast continent with men of British breed, I think there will be little hope of her being able to maintain her independence for another fifty years, even with the aid Great Britain would be able to give. As part of the Anglo-Saxon race, the Australians should be prepared to take their full share of responsibility for the defences of the Empire. One part of the Blue-book touched upon the question of the loan of a cruiser, and I think that the Admiralty ought to be able to find some vessels among those they have put down for scrapping. But perhaps Australia would not take such a vessel. If a dep&#x00F4;t ship could be found and the Commonwealth Government would undertake to keep her engines in repair, such a cruiser would be able to deal effectively with small vessels.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, as far as one can see, although the different Colonies have been discussing the subject of naval defence, they have not actually come to any definite conclusion with their reservation in regard to Mr. Deakin's proposition put before the Conference, upon which he asked the advice of the Admiralty. According to the agreement of 1905 we are bound to keep in Australian waters a certain number of ships, Australia agreeing to pay &#x00A3;200,000 a year. This contribution, they say, is not particularly popular; the Colonies would rather like to
<col>222</col>
see their own ships flying the Australian flag. The action of New Zealand has been most patriotic; they have increased their original contribution from &#x00A3;60,000 a year to &#x00A3;100,000, saying at the same time that they made no reservation whatever, knowing that Great Britain would do the best for the protection of New Zealand's shores, and they asked no more. In regard to Mr. Deakin's proposition, no answer has been received to a letter sent to Australia last August. Since then Mr. Deakin has gone out of office and a new Government is in power, and all that has been heard unofficially is that the Australian Government contemplate the building of two destroyers in this country and one in their own. My noble friend touched upon the manning question and said he thought the Governments of the Colonies would have no difficulty in manning the fleet. I am not altogether sure that my noble friend is correct in that assumption. So far as the Admiralty know, there has been occasionally a certain amount of difficulty in filling up the number of men for ships on the Australian station, the ships there being provided with nucleus crews with, the intention of their being completed locally. My noble friend also touched upon the question of lending or giving to Australia or other colonies a third-class cruiser or other warship. I am informed by the Admiralty that after careful inquiry there does not appear to be any vessel suitable for the purpose. There are, of course, cruisers which your Lordships have seen in the Solent, but they are scarcely fit to send to the Colonies; they would require much expenditure upon them. The Admiralty are willing to lend a ship of the "Apollo" class for training purposes, and an offer has been made to New Zealand to which no reply has been received. So far as the Admiralty are concerned they view with sympathy any effort the Colonies may make towards establishing a fleet for their own protection, and will give most careful consideration to any scheme that may be submitted to them, and will be pleased to give any advice that may be of service to the Colonies.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BISHOPRICS BILL. [H. L.]<lb/>
[SECOND READING.]</title>
<p>Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p><member>,* VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, in moving the Second Reading of a Bill to facilitate the foundation of new bishoprics and the alteration of dioceses and to amend the Bishops' Resignation Act, 1869, it may, perhaps, be advisable that I should make a few observations upon the past Parliamentary history of this subject within our own time. When, now a good deal more than a generation ago, the Church of England awoke from what had been a long period of religious stagnation to real
<col>232</col>
activity of spiritual life, I think one of the first matters that engaged the attention of those who were promoting her work was the defect in her organisation as regards the number of dioceses and the duties imposed upon the Bishops of those dioceses. Of course, in an Episcopal Church a diocesan Bishop is necessarily the head of all spiritual work within his diocese; but, in addition to that, Parliament has imposed upon our diocesan Bishops very considerable administrative responsibilities and jurisdiction, the exercise of which must in any case take up a large amount of their time.<lb/>
Owing to the great growth of population in our country, especially within certain areas, it had become evident many years ago that certain dioceses were far too large for the effective control and supervision of their Bishops, and a movement was originated for dividing those dioceses in order that they might be brought into manageable shape. I am afraid it is not too much to say that in not a few cases the Bishops of such dioceses as those to which I am alluding have been completely overborne by the mere machinery of their administrative duties. Men of great ability, zeal, and energy have been so overborne by those duties that they have simply found no time for that pastoral and paternal work which I am sure every member of the Episcopal Bench must feel is, after all, the most important part of the duties of a Bishop. By degrees several of the larger dioceses have been divided, and I think within the time to which I am referring as many as nine new bishoprics have been founded, solely by contributions from the revenues of existing Bishops whose dioceses were divided and by the voluntary offerings of Churchmen without any call whatever on the funds of the State or on the common fund of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners.<lb/>
This movement, of course, like all movements of the kind, has had its opponents. I do not wish to dwell upon the opposition which it has experienced at the hands of those who are not members of the Church. I never could understand the reason for that opposition, because I should be very sorry to attribute to any of those who, being Nonconformists themselves, have opposed the foundation of new bishoprics, no better feeling than an ignoble desire to force the Church to disestablish-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0141"/>
<col>233</col>
ment and disendowment by preventing her from obtaining through Parliament, which is the only way she can obtain them, facilities for the performance of her proper work. But there has been opposition within the ranks of Churchmen themselves. Some have suggested&#x2014;and with considerable surprise I saw the suggestion repeated the other day&#x2014;that by the foundation of new bishoprics money which Churchmen might have contributed for another great need of the Church, the increase of the incomes of the poorer benefices, was practically being diverted from that purpose to the foundation of bishoprics. I was very glad to see that in another place the Prime Minister expressed his entire dissent from that opinion. I believe that absolutely the contrary has been true. I believe anybody who cares to look into the matter will find that wherever an unwieldy diocese has been divided and a new bishopric founded there has been, in every way, a growth of spiritual and active life in the Church within both those dioceses; and I could name one divided diocese of the kind in which, to my own knowledge, the Bishop of part of the diocese has, by his own generous initiative, raised more money for the endowment of small livings quite recently than has ever been dreamt of in that diocese before. I am sure that what has hitherto been done in this respect has promoted the welfare of the Church in all that could be desired.<lb/>
But another objection has been raised, and it is this. Some persons have considered that by dividing dioceses and constituting new bishoprics with, necessarily, smaller incomes than those to which we have hitherto been accustomed, the dignity and influence of the diocesan episcopate will be lowered. I do not think there has been any result of that sort. It has been suggested&#x2014;and it was suggested in a debate on this subject some thirty years ago, I think&#x2014;that the way to meet the case of these large dioceses was not so much to divide them as to aid the diocesan Bishop with a suffragan Bishop. No doubt some of the spiritual work of a diocesan Bishop can be and is done by a suffragan Bishop, but, nothing can relieve the Bishop of a diocese from the responsibility, which no one else can bear, for the proper carrying out of his functions as regards jurisdiction and administrative work. And I think it may be said that
<col>234</col>
the more the suffragan Bishop relieves the Bishop of the diocese from confirmations, or from attendance at church openings or matters of that kind, the fewer opportunities does the diocesan Bishop enjoy of meeting with the people of his diocese both clergy and laity, and of that personal contact with them which alone can give him a real knowledge of persons and places such as is necessary, above all things, for the proper exercise of his paternal influence as a Bishop, in matters with which he is concerned.<lb/>
I have heard it complained&#x2014;I have never made the complaint myself&#x2014;that, in their control of ecclesiastical ritual, the diocesan Bishops have not been so active as some persons holding what are known as Protestant opinions have desired. I have had the honour, as some noble Lords may be aware, of serving as Chairman of the Royal Commission on Ecclesiastical Discipline, and I can say from my own experience what I believe would be concurred in by all my colleagues, that we were very much struck with the extreme difficulty of the proper supervision of dioceses, in these and in other matters also, when they were of an unwieldy size In fact, where there have been these extravagancies in ritual, they have existed I think, to a greater extent, and have been much more difficult to deal with, in those very large dioceses than in the small dioceses; because, in the first place, it is extremely difficult in a very large diocese for the Bishop to be acquainted with such practices, and, in the second place, when he does become acquainted with them they have very likely arrived at such a point that it is far more difficult to deal with them, either by law or by the exercise of the paternal and personal influence to which I have already alluded and which is infinitely better than coercive law can possibly be in matters of conscience of the kind, than if his diocese had been smaller and he had been better acquainted, of his own knowledge, with what was going on within it. <lb/>
Those are, I think, the two main objections which have been raised by members of the Church to the extension of the Episcopate; but, nevertheless, nine new bishoprics have been founded within the time to which I have alluded. They have been founded under very considerable difficulties. The Bills relat-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0142"/>
<col>235</col>
ing to them have been introduced time after time into the House of Commons before they received the Royal Assent, causing much waste of Parliamentary time, great disappointment to the Churchmen who were specially interested in those measures, and also very great labour to those who endeavoured to carry the Bills through. If it was merely that in each separate case the assent of Parliament was required by an Act to the foundation of a new bishopric, that would be bad enough; but matters are really infinitely worse than that. When I represented the City of Bristol in the House of Commons I naturally took a great interest in the foundation of the Bishopric of Bristol, and I remember that I had to be responsible, more or less, for passing no fewer than three Bills with regard to that diocese, the first one being the Bill which originally founded the diocese, the second being a Bill to allocate&#x2014;of course, with the consent of all parties&#x2014;something more of the stipend of the Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol to the new diocese than had at first been thought fit, and the third for altering boundaries. No one who does not know the procedure of the House of Commons can quite appreciate the immense labour and trouble required to pass a Bill of that kind&#x2014;a Bill which really was opposed by nobody, but which the mere interference of a single Member might have prevented from becoming law in the course of the session. The Royal Commission on Ecclesiastical Discipline had this matter before them in connection with the enquiries to which I have alluded, and they unanimously made the following recommendation&#x2014;
<quote>
"That for the purpose of effective supervision and administration it is desirable that many dioceses should he subdivided, and that a general Act providing machinery for the creation of new dioceses by Order in Council should be passed so as to prevent the necessity of the enactment of a separate statute on the formation of each new diocese."</quote><lb/>
The Bill to which I ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading to-day has for its main object the carrying out of the recommendation of the Royal Commission. In the first place, it proposes that, with the consent of the Archbishop of the province and of the Bishop whose diocese is affected, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners might formulate a scheme for the foundation of a new bishopric, provided that such endowment for the new bishopric as they considered adequate was ensured, no
<col>236</col>
portion whatever of such endowment to come out of their common fund. The scheme so framed would, of course, be submitted to the Privy Council&#x2014;in other words, to the Government of the day. If approved of by the Government of the day, it would be brought before Parliament and lie on the Table of both Houses for thirty days, and if not objected to by either House within thirty days the bishopric would be founded and the scheme would have the force of law. In the same way by an Order in Council a dean and chapter might be formed in new dioceses that have been already constituted and which do not possess them, or in any new diocese which may be constituted in future<lb/>
Then there is another provision in the. Bill dealing with the pensions of retiring Bishops. Under the present law the pension of a retiring Bishop, whatever the income of his See, is stereotyped at &#x00A3;2,000 a year, or, I think, one-third of the income of the See, whichever should be the greater. Those figures are obviously too high for the incomes of some dioceses that already exist, and they would certainly be too high for the incomes of dioceses that may be founded in the future. The amount of such pensions, like the amount of endowment of future bishoprics, is left to the decision, first, of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and then of the Government of the day and of Parliament in each particular case. Those, my Lords, are practically the sole contents of the Bill. <lb/>
Now perhaps I may be asked what steps will be taken if this Bill should receive the assent of Parliament in the course of the present session. I have made careful enquiry on that subject. In Yorkshire one new diocese would be founded, and in the east of England two new dioceses would be founded, I think I may confidently say, within the term of a year from the present time. The great arch-diocese of York has a population of 2,000,000, and it is proposed to divide that by allotting a new diocese to Sheffield, with a population of 840,000. I understand that seven-ninths of the money required to be subscribed for that purpose has already been subscribed. St. Albans, with a population of 1,336,000 at the last census, has 630 benefices and 1,015 clergy within its borders. The diocese of Ely, which embraces three and a half counties, has 763 clergy. The diocese
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0143"/>
<col>237</col>
of Norwich, comprising the great county of Norfolk&#x2014;the fourth in area in England&#x2014;and the county of Suffolk, has 890 benefices and 1,006 clergy. It is proposed out of these three dioceses to constitute two new bishoprics, a bishopric of Suffolk and a bishopric of Essex, allocating &#x00A3;3,200 a year from the incomes of the existing Bishops towards the endowment of the new dioceses, and, of course, making up the balance by voluntary subscriptions. The diocese of St. Albans would then consist of Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire, and the diocese of Ely of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire. All the necessary funds, I am told, have been subscribed in Hertfordshire and Essex, and nearly all in Suffolk. In all cases the funds have been subscribed not merely by a few rich men whose fancy may be to constitute new bishoprics, but by the great body of Churchmen in the respective counties or cities concerned with a general desire to improve the work and the organisation of the Church to which they belong. <lb/>
It is proposed, I understand, that the incomes of the new bishoprics should be somewhat less than the incomes of those which already exist. I believe that the bishopric at present with the smallest income is endowed with &#x00A3;3,000 a year. It is proposed in these three cases that the endowment shall be &#x00A3;2,500 a year, with sufficient provision for a house for the Bishop. I do not propose this Bill with the smallest wish that there should be a very great creation of new bishoprics. I feel very strongly what was said a few weeks ago by His Grace the Archbishop of York, that you must have a very strong local feeling before you can constitute a bishopric of any real strength. He said, I think, that such a desire must be based on self-consciousness and pride of locality. With that I entirely agree. There must be that feeling of separate existence which makes a separate community. So guarded, I believe this Bill will work great benefit to the Church and do no harm to anybody who is not a member of it. And I would add that if anybody should object to the reduction of episcopal incomes to the extent to which I have referred, I think it should be remembered that the great expense of many of our dioceses is the maintenance of the palaces which are allotted to our Bishops. In these new bishoprics the houses need not be comparable in any way with such
<col>238</col>
places as Farnham and Auckland Castles, which are, of course, relics of past times. At the same time I think everybody would wish that the endowment of a bishopric should be sufficient to enable a Bishop to exercise that generous hospitality which I believe our Bishops always do exercise, both to the clergy and laity of their dioceses and to candidates for ordination, to the great benefit of the Church. I have to thank your Lordships for listening to my arguments in support of this Bill, and I now beg to move that it be read a second time. <lb/>
Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Viscount St. Aldwyn.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAUCHAMP):</member><membercontribution> My Lords, on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Home Department I rise to express a general approval of the terms of this Bill, and to say that although. important points of detail may arise at a later stage, still I shall be very glad to give the noble Viscount all the assistance in my power in passing the Bill through your Lordships' House. The noble Viscount has dealt so lucidly with the object of the Bill, and has answered, I think, so completely any arguments which might be advanced against it, that it is unnecessary for me to say much to your Lordships. I might, however, refer to one point on which I think the House will be agreed. It is obvious that great care and caution should be exercised in such an important matter as the enlargement of the Episcopate, but, as at present advised, at any rate, it seems to me that the provisions of the Bill as they stand, necessitating that the scheme should lie on the Table for thirty days, will probably be sufficient to meet the case. Certainly no member of your Lordships' House who had the advantage of acquaintance with Bishop Creighton and realised how much overwork contributed to his early death will fail to do his utmost to pass this Bill into law. It is difficult to exaggerate the amount of business detail, often of a trivial character, which a Bishop is called upon to attend to, and from my own experience I can corroborate the noble Viscount's words as to the advantage which accrues from the sub-division of a diocese. As a consequence of the constitution of the new diocese of Birmingham, I believe laymen have contributed far more largely than they did before for general
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0144"/>
<col>239</col>
diocesan purposes, both in the new diocese and in the diocese left behind. That, I think, goes to prove the statement which has just been made by the noble Viscount, and I do not doubt that what has happened in the past will probably happen again in the future. </membercontribution></p>

<p><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF ST. ALBANS:</member><membercontribution> My Lords, having been Bishop of a new diocese in the North which was manageable, and being now, unfortunately, in the position of Bishop of an absolutely unmanageable diocese in the South, perhaps I may be allowed to say a few words upon this Bill. When I heard of the question being asked in another place as to the possible impoverishment of the clergy as the result of this Bill I could not help feeling that anyone who knew the real state of things in a new diocese would be able to answer that objection at once. It happened that in the year 1897 I visited officially the diocese of Newcastle for the first time, and I found that during the fifteen years since the See had been constituted the number of clergy had increased in the diocese from 216 to 318 &#x2014;rather a large increase, I venture to say, within that period&#x2014;and every single fund had increased in the same proportion. I am almost afraid to mention the sums of money that had been raised in those fifteen years; they might seem exaggerated; but they were raised for the purposes of Churches, parsonages, and everything which concerns the Church; and if I were to state what had been done there to help the impoverished clergy I could prove that there had been a great improvement in consequence of the constitution of that diocese. <lb/>
Coming South, at the earnest request of the authorities of both Church and State, I found myself in charge of a diocese as unhappily constituted for purposes of supervision as it is possible to conceive. I have two counties, Essex and Hertfordshire, which once found a rather natural centre in London. In 1846 they were transferred to Rochester; in 1877 that was found to be wholly impossible and the diocese of St. Albans was founded and really without a centre, for St. Albans is in the western part of Hertfordshire and never in any form can be made a centre for Essex. London has extended into Essex, and London over the border, as it is called, has a population of 800,000 and will soon have
<col>240</col>
a million, so that I have to supervise a diocese a large part of which is really in London, extending over the counties of Essex and Hertfordshire; and if anybody is acquainted with the means of locomotion in these counties he will know perfectly well that they are based on the principle that every sane man desires to go to London in the morning and return in the afternoon and to go nowhere else. The result is that a man who wishes to go to Hertfordshire from Essex or <i>vice versa</i>, except through London, finds the greatest difficulty in doing so. <lb/>
When this diocese of mine was founded the population was not quite half what it is to-day. From 658,000 in 1871 it rose to 1,336,267 in 1901, and to-day it has a population considerably exceeding one and a half millions. With population, benefices have increased, and every additional benefice adds considerably to the Bishop's responsibilities and labours. The noble Viscount mentioned just now 630 as the number of benefices in my diocese; the number to-day is 635. Benefices are continually being added, the number of clergy necessarily increasing as the population increases. It is not merely the ordinary population. I am annually asked to take at least twenty extra-parochial confirmations in various schools. I have often said that if dumping requires an illustration it will be found in Essex and Hertfordshire. The fact is that every large London parish desires to have its schools or asylums in the counties outside London, and these require chaplains and supervision by the Bishop; there are also a great number of secondary schools, so that the Bishop in charge of such a diocese with no real centre has not the time for that mature thought which he ought to give to the affairs of his diocese. Therefore I venture to say the case is plain and clear, in such a diocese as mine, for some relief. If you continue the present condition of things in these unwieldy dioceses it will mean short tenures of office for the Bishops, as no Bishop could retain the diocese in full vigour for more than a limited number of years. Each one of us would, no doubt, be perfectly willing to be sacrificed. But it is not a matter for the Bishops alone. It is just as much a question for the dioceses which have no fair scope for expansion and for realising their common life if their areas are too large.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0145"/>
<col>241</col>
Speaking for my own diocese, at any rate, the diocese itself feels most strongly the necessity for division. In 1905 I put the question before my diocesan conference, and there was a unanimous vote of the clergy and laity in favour of division. A committee was then formed, and early in 1906 we determined to canvass the diocese and ask for assistance. It was thought that in about three years &#x00A3;45,000 might be raised to supplement the surrender of part of the Bishop's income, but in about a year and a half the whole of that sum had been raised or guaranteed. I appealed to the diocese to, if possible, raise &#x00A3;5,000 on a given Sunday to complete the fund, and the amount raised was rather more than &#x00A3;7,000. This, I venture to think, shows no lack of local interest. <lb/>
I have had nothing but good will from the Nonconformist bodies in reference to this matter, and if Nonconformists object to an increase in the Episcopate it is certainly not in my diocese. A public meeting which I convened in the Town Hall at Stratford in order to test local Church feeling on the matter was so crowded that people were compelled to stand, and a Presbyterian mayor attended to express his goodwill and his hope that the scheme would succeed. I went, in the same way, to Colchester, and there the local interest was equally as great and a Congregational mayor came to wish "Godspeed" to the scheme. This is the experience I have had in my own diocese. Determining that if the scheme took effect it should not be merely by large donations from the wealthy but by the general goodwill of the people at large, I delivered addresses at some twenty centres explaining the office of a Bishop and what he has to do, and I venture to say that the inhabitants of the diocese of St. Albans, knowing far more than they did five years ago what the work of a Bishop is, are almost unanimous in favour of this scheme. If this is the case in reference to one particular area, I venture to say it may be repeated elsewhere.<lb/>
The question simply is whether it is desirable to arrive at extension of the Episcopate by Bills dealing with specific dioceses, or by such a general enabling measure as that which the noble Viscount has laid on the Table to-day. Two years ago I had an opportunity of discussing
<col>242</col>
the subject with the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and it is no breach of confidence to say that, the two methods being put plainly before him, the late Prime Minister strongly favoured the general enabling method embodied in the noble Viscount's Bill. It is simply and solely on the lines with which we are already familiar in relation to extension of parishes. When it is desirable to divide a parish the Ecclesiastical Commissioners have the power, with due consent, to form a new parish. In the same manner, in regard to the Episcopate, if there is no demand on public funds, if the funds are simply raised by voluntary contributions and surrender by the Bishops of existing incomes, and, further, if there is no idea of increasing the number of Bishops in this House, then I submit there is no reason why this matter should not be considered as one of administration, Parliament having the fullest opportunity during thirty days of expressing dissent to any proposal. I venture, therefore, to express a strong hope that the Bill will pass your Lordships' House, and in another place receive such facilities as will enable it to become law this session. </membercontribution></p>
<p><member>*THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I shall not detain your Lordships for more than a few minutes, but I do not like to remain quite silent lest that silence should be misunderstood. Those who are in positions of central responsibility in the Church, like myself and my most reverend brother the Archbishop of York, are eagerly anxious that this Bill should become law. It is the product of long deliberation, it has been drafted and re-drafted by different hands, and practically this consideration has always resulted in a Bill like that which is now presented by the noble Viscount. No one could have explained the position more clearly than the noble Viscount, and no one is more entitled from experience and knowledge of the subject to be its exponent. The Bill has been supported by my right reverend brother the Bishop of St. Albans, whose experience has been of a practical and unique character. I, too, can speak from some personal experience. I was for some years Bishop of Rochester and have of recent years had the diocese of Canterbury under my control. In each of those cases the diocese has been divided, the former since I left Rochester and the latter while I have held the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0146"/>
<col>243</col>
See. In each case the gain in improved work and more effective administration has been marked. It is no mere money question. There is a general demand, on moral and religious grounds, for such a measure. We look for better supervision, with more local enthusiasm, zeal, and activity as the result of dioceses of more manageable size. I can say that from observation both in the north of England and in the south, and I am certain that if your Lordships give a Second Reading to this Bill and it should pass through the House of Commons and become law during the present session the gain to the country as well as to the Church will be great in the stimulus which will be given to effective moral and religious work. The proposals in the Bill hurt nobody; they are proposals of obvious and natural common fairness; and I find it difficult to understand how the Bill can be reasonably opposed by any man who has the religious and moral welfare of his country at heart.<lb/>

<title>FIREARMS IN IRELAND.</title>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution> rose to ask His Majesty's Government whether the following statement, which had appeared in several newspapers, was substantially correct&#x2014;viz.:
<quote>
"At the weekly Petty Sessions at Ennis, Mr. C. L. Rynne presiding, a number of persons were prosecuted at the suit of the Inland Revenue Commissioners, through Mr. D. O'Connell, supervisor, for carrying arms without a licence. In one case it was proved that Michael Lyons was found lying drunk in a lane off one of the principal streets. In his pocket was found a seven-chambered revolver, loaded in six chambers, with one empty cartridge; defendant said he got the revolver for his own protection; the Chairman said the Court would put down this conduct; every second man coming into Ennis had a revolver in his pocket; it was simply intolerable, and should not exist in any civilised country where the law was enforced. Defendant was fined &#x00A3;2 108. At the same Sessions two men were charged with possessing guns, and another, John Donohue, was charged with having a revolver without a licence. Constable Crowley deposed that he arrested defendant for drunkenness. He had on him a five-chambered revolver and fifty-five rounds of ammunition";</quote>
and, if so, whether they saw no risk in allowing the free carrying of arms to continue in Ireland.
<col>244</col>
The noble Earl said: My Lords, I desire to direct your Lordships' attention to a recent instance of the evils which proceed from the unwarranted carrying of firearms. A report has appeared in several newspapers in terms which your Lordships will read in my Notice. The Chairman of the Ennis Petty Sessions said the Court must put down this carrying of firearms; that every second man coming into Ennis had a revolver in his pocket; and that it was simply intolerable and should not exist in any civilised country where the law was enforced. One man had a revolver and fifty-five rounds of ammunition, and another was drunk in possession of a five-chambered revolver. I am quoting only a single instance; I believe many could be produced, but it seems hardly necessary that I should trouble the House with many details on the subject. I may remind your Lordships that the only way by which these evil practices can be arrested in Ireland is in the event, which frequently happens, of the persons who carry the revolvers not having even gone to the expense of taking out the necessary licence.<lb/>
To give your Lordships some idea of the state of things, I will take the charge of Mr. Justice Kenny to the Grand Jury at the Connaught Winter Assizes, held in Limerick. He said that, when reading the deposition in several cases, he had been&#x2014;
<quote>
" very much struck by the general and prevailing use of firearms in these several counties, and particularly of revolvers."</quote><lb/>
He added that&#x2014;
<quote>
"In the counties Clare and Galway a large proportion of the outrages were accompanied by the use of firearms. In the county of Clare alone there were eleven cases of firing into the dwelling-house and ten cases of firing at the person. He need scarcely impress upon the jury that that was a very terrible condition of things, disorganising society and bringing, as it necessarily would, untold misery to many a home."</quote><lb/>
The Grand Jury&#x2014;they were all tradesmen&#x2014;passed a resolution recording their "unanimous protest against the indiscriminate sale of firearms," and requesting the Judge to report the matter to the Government. Mr. Justice Kenny pointed out that the resolution was a very proper one to pass, but said he thought the foreman of the Grand Jury should make the representation to the Executive Government direct. As I say, I could give your Lordships many more instances of a similar
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0147"/>
<col>245</col>
kind. There was one in Galway reported in the newspapers only two days ago, and I may say that other Judges during the same winter assizes made very strong observations with regard to the unwarranted use of firearms.<lb/>
When this matter was last under discussion in your Lordship' House the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack greatly understated&#x2014;of course, it was not his fault, because he could merely give up the figures which were supplied to him by the Irish Office&#x2014;the number of outrages by firearms which had occurred. He said, I think, that there had been something like eighty-one outrages, whereas in the other House it was stated by the Chief Secretary himself that during the first eleven months of the year 1908 there had been 193&#x2014;I think that was the number. At all events", it is quite clear that this offence is very prevalent and is spreading. What does Mr. Birrell say? Taken to task with regard to this matter, he said that&#x2014;
<quote>
"If a measure had been introduced applying to all parts of the country, I certainly, on behalf of Ireland, would offer it nothing but a general support; but what Ireland objects to is the invidious singling of it out as if the Irish people were such savages as to be unfitted to carry these arms."</quote><lb/>
What I have to say, in reply to that, is that Ireland has been singled out, but in exactly the opposite sense, because Ireland alone is free from any restriction as to the purchase of firearms. If a man wishes to buy a revolver, all he has to do is to pay the licence duty, and, provided he does that, he is free to purchase as many firearms as he chooses. In England, Scotland, and Wales there is the law of 1903, which places certain restrictions upon the sale of pistols, upon the ages of persons who may be allowed to purchase them, and other matters of that sort. From that Act Ireland was exempted. Why? Because at that time the Peace Preservation Act was in force, and under the terms of that Act it was not possible for men to purchase firearms without limitation or restriction. Therefore, when the Chief Secretary says that Ireland objects to being singled out, I reply that Ireland has been singled out, and in a way which is most prejudicial to peace and to property. The only check that exists in Ireland on the purchase of firearms is the Excise duty; that is the only thing. It is sometimes argued that the offences are committed by
<col>246</col>
the Irish because of their great desire for Home Rule and because they have not been able hitherto to obtain it. I do not think that argument will be advanced in reference to the use of firearms. I put it to noble Lords from Ireland whether, if they did obtain the blessings of Home Rule, firearms would be likely to diminish in quantity.<lb/>
Now, do the Government consider this state of things safe? And if they do not, are they prepared to do anything? I much regret that the present Chief Secretary for Ireland shows no disposition to do anything of any sort himself. He encourages the magistrates. He says they are quite right to protest against this importation of revolvers. He says the Judges are quite right. But with regard to the Executive authority, he says he himself is not prepared to introduce any exceptional legislation for Ireland. It is not necessary to introduce any exceptional legislation. All that it is necessary to do&#x2014;I merely suggest one check; it is a small one&#x2014;now that you have, by doing away with the Peace Preservation Act and making it possible for anyone in Ireland to obtain any number of revolvers he chooses, produced a state of things not conducive to the safety of life and property, is to introduce a small Bill, omitting from the Pistols Act the clause which exempts Ireland from its operation. I suggest that to the Government as a way in which they could deal with this matter very simply. I beg to put the Question standing in my name on the Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>*LORD DENMAN:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, in replying to the noble Earl I will, first of all, confine myself to the Question on the Paper. The noble Earl asks His Majesty's Government whether a statement which has appeared in several newspapers is substantially correct. I believe it is substantially correct. But the speech of the noble Earl would seem to imply that the state of things referred to is due to the non-renewal of the Arms Act. As the noble Earl in his Question quotes Mr. Rynne, the Chairman of the Petty Sessions at Ennis, as his authority, I should like to read to the House what Mr. Rynne said on a subsequent occasion on this matter. He said this:&#x2014;
<quote>
"He would here take the opportunity of stating that the remarks at the last Ennis Petty Sessions made by him as Chairman and by other magistrates
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0148"/>
<col>247</col>
had been made use of to an extent not intended. Efforts had been made to show that these remarks indicated a very disturbed and lawless state of the county. He did not for a moment admit that the county was in any way less law-abiding, or more disturbed owing to the repeal of the Arms Act."</quote>
Therefore I think it is a mistake to infer that these particular cases are due to the non-renewal of the Arms Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN:</member> <membercontribution>He said that every second man who entered Ennis had a revolver in his pocket.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD DENMAN:</member> <membercontribution>But he also said that he did not consider the state of the county affected by the non-renewal of the Arms Act. The noble Earl has made some observations about the non-renewal of that Act. I should like to remind the House that the Arms Act was passed in the first instance in the year 1881 by a Liberal Government; and it was, at all events, intended that its duration should be for a term of five years. It was subsequently renewed; but in 1906 Mr. Bryce and his colleagues, in view of the peaceful condition of the country at that time, thought it undesirable to differentiate between Ireland and other parts of the United Kingdom. Consequently it was decided not to renew the Act. Now we are told that there has been a large increase in the number of weapons in Ireland, and that intimidation is due to that increase.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ASHBOURNE:</member><membercontribution> Is facilitated.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD DENMAN:</member><membercontribution> Is facilitated by that increase. But, if there has been an increase in Ireland, I should like to point out that there has also been a very considerable increase in other parts of the United Kingdom, and I will quote some figures to the House to bear out that statement. In 1897-98 there were, in England and Wales, 172,321 gun licences issued; and ten years later&#x2014;in 1907-8&#x2014;there were 201,247. In Ireland in 1897-98 there were 14,098 gun licences issued, and in 1907-8 there were 19,690. Therefore the House will observe that there has been an increase in England and Wales for these ten years of nearly 30,000, whilst for the corresponding period there has been an increase of over 5,000 licensed arms in Ireland&#x2014;but of that increase nearly 4,000 occurred in the years between 1900 and 1903, at the time when the late Government were in office. According to the census of 1901 the popula-
<col>248</col>
tion of England and Wales is between seven and eight times that of Ireland, so that it is evident that the number of gun licences in England and Wales per head of the population is considerably in excess of the number in Ireland. I do not quote these figures for the purpose merely of comparison between this country and Ireland, because I think they are quite sufficient to call for very serious consideration in themselves&#x2014;I am speaking of the figures for England and Wales&#x2014;although I believe that the extent to which firearms are carried in Ireland is very generally disapproved of by all classes of the community in that country. I do not wish to imply for one moment that firearms are used in this country, as they have been used in Ireland, for firing into dwellings and as aids to intimidation; but I think it must be a matter of concern&#x2014;in fact, I know it is a matter of concern&#x2014;to trio police and others that amongst so large a proportion of the population the possession of firearms should have increased in this country to such a very large extent, and I think it must be admitted that what I may term the indiscriminate arming of such a large proportion of the population is not a desirable state of things. Of the large number who have got licences there are, I have no doubt, many who have little experience and little knowledge of the use of firearms, and must on that account be a danger not only to themselves, but to their neighbours; and then there are people of undesirable character, both British and foreign, in whose case the possession of firearms must constitute a danger to those with whom they are brought into contact. Therefore the Government are seriously considering at the present time whether it may be possible to find means to place further restrictions upon the carrying and use of firearms, particularly, I may add, of pistols and revolvers, in all parts of the United Kingdom.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ASHBOURNE:</member> <membercontribution>Will the Government, in that consideration, apply their minds to the very obvious expedient of bringing in a short Bill to deal with the present state of affairs? The introduction of the case of England and the suggestion that there is not such a grievance in Ireland because, with a much smaller population and with different laws, there has not been the same increase in the carrying of arms there, is simply playing with the question. The noble Earl, in his clear and
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0149"/>
<col>249</col>
temperate statement, drew attention to the fact that the law is not the same in the two countries, and that you have a more reckless want of law in Ireland.<lb/>
The complaint is that in Ireland there is no check or stint on the possession of firearms. I do not say that each particular crime can be traced to the non-renewal of the Arms Act, but it is obvious to every man of sense that by that action you give facility for crime. Any one can now go to a gun-maker and, lodging two shillings as a deposit, obtain possession of a pistol or revolver. It cannot be denied that such a state of things gives treat assistance for the commitment of crime and outrage. This is really a very important question, and it is not sufficient for the House to be told that the Government are considering the general question of the carrying of firearms. Here is an evil in the living present in Ireland, and the question is&#x2014;What are the Government going to do to rectify it? The noble Lord comforted himself by saying that there was a large increase in firearms between the years 1900 and 1903, when the late Government were in power. I should be glad if we could have the statistics showing what took place during the period before the late Government went out of office and what has taken place since the Arms Act was dropped.<lb/>

I am not satisfied with the way in which this question has been dealt with by the noble Lord. The figures as to the increase which he gave are not so very instructive, because before the Arms Act was allowed to be dropped discrimination could be shown in regard to the licences granted. There is no discrimination now, and if a person has a gun licence he can obtain pistols and revolvers at his own will. Can the noble Lord tell the House whether the licence duty is paid by everyone in the possession of arms in Ireland? I do not wish to say a word against the integrity of the Irish people; but, after all, the paying of licence duty is an acquired taste, and I fear they have not yet acquired it. Therefore the payment of licence duty is no check at all as to the number of people in the possession of arms. At these times when the Government are not too well off it might be a useful thing for them to give attention to this matter. I am sure that any responsible police officer in Ireland would say that the duty has not been paid with anything like adequate completeness since the dropping of the Arms Act.
<col>250</col>
The case to which the noble Earl has drawn attention is, as far as I know, the first one that has been reported where persons have been summoned at the petty sessions court for not taking out licences. Have there been any other cases, or is this an isolated case? I trust that we shall have a Return, not only of the number of licences for all kinds of arms issued while the late Government were in office, but continued down to the period when the present Government allowed the Arms Act to drop, and also showing how many licences have been taken out since, and what prosecutions, if any, have been instituted in reference to the matter. I do not wish to use any harsh or unnecessarily aggressive language, but it must be obvious that the Government are dealing with a position of deadly peril when they allow everyone in Ireland who pleases to carry arms; and what is needed is not the general considertion of the matter as it affects the United Kingdom, but prompt action in the particular case of Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup> <member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES <memberconstituency>(THE EARL OF CREWE)</memberconstituency></member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the noble Earl who introduced this matter did so, if he will allow me to say so, very moderately indeed. He stated his facts and drew his conclusions in a manner of which we on this side certainly cannot complain, and I have, indeed, no complaint to make of the way in which the subject has been touched upon by the noble and learned Lord who has just sat down. Of course, noble Lords opposite do not agree, and will never agree, with us in our disinclination to apply to Ireland a different code in a matter of this kind from that which we apply to England or to the rest of the United Kingdom. That is a matter on which I am afraid the two sides of the House must agree to differ. It has been' pointed out, with perfect truth, that the Pistols Act, introduced, I think, by the noble Earl now on the Front Bench opposite in the year 1903, does not apply to Ireland. But the noble and learned Lord seemed to be under some misapprehension as to what the Pistols Act is. It does not oblige any person to take out a special licence for the possession of a pistol. In England there is only one form of licence, the gun licence, and that covers the possession of a pistol as well. The Pistols Act deals severely with the vendor of a pistol to a person who has no licence,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0150"/>
<col>251</col>
and it also deals severely with the vendor of a pistol and the possessor of a pistol if he is under a certain age. The Government, in considering the matter, will certainly bear in mind as one possible expedient the application of that Act to Ireland. My noble friend behind me stated that the matter is under consideration. I quite agree with the noble and learned Lord that it is not a subject which ought to be in any way shelved or allowed indefinitely to rest; but I think it is perfectly relevant to say, as my noble friend behind me said, that this is not an Irish question only. The noble and learned Lord spoke of the particular case which the noble Earl has placed on the Paper. That was the case of a man who was found drunk with a pistol in his possession. There were no suspicions, I believe, in any way connecting him with agrarian crime or with crime of any kind. It was an ordinary case of what one can only call this utterly stupid practice of carrying revolvers and pistols.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ASHBOURNE:</member><membercontribution> There is very little stupidity in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CREWE:</member> <membercontribution>I am delighted to hear it. The noble and learned Lord will not say for a moment, I think, that all the pistols possessed by people in Ireland, whether they live in the north or in the south, are kept and used for the purpose of committing outrages, any more than that the enormous number of revolvers and pistols carried through the streets of London are kept with the object of committing crime. Personally I should like to see it made as difficult as possible&#x2014;almost impossible, if it could be done&#x2014;for any private person to own a revolver or pistol at all. Noble Lords opposite who have had experience of using revolvers know how much practice it takes to be able to use one effectively for purposes of self-defence, and, as a rule, in an ordinary hand a revolver is an infinitely more dangerous object to its possessor than it is to any person against whom he may desire to defend himself. But, however that may be, it is undoubtedly the fact that both in England and in Ireland pistols and revolvers are carried to an altogether improper extent by those who can only use them for purposes of mischief. We are considering carefully how this may best be checked in either country. It might be possible to proceed by way of the revenue. I cannot say whether that would be found to be
<col>252</col>
a feasible method. I note once more the particular suggestion of the noble Earl, that the Act of 1903 should be applied to Ireland. And I believe that what my noble friend behind me said is perfectly true, that this indiscriminate carrying of firearms in Ireland is regarded with great dread and dislike by a very large number of people who are not in sympathy at all with the political views of noble Lords opposite, and that public opinion would support a, stringent measure to render their possession difficult, provided, of course, as I say, that Ireland were not picked out as a specially criminal country for this purpose. I hope noble Lords opposite will be satisfied with our assurance that we are considering the matter very carefully. It is not altogether an easy one, but we are anxious to arrive at a proper solution of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>*THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, in these not infrequent Irish discussions we so rarely extract any grain of comfort from the statements made to us from the Bench opposite that I cannot resist rising to express my gratitude for the grain of comfort afforded by the statement of the noble Earl who has just spoken. We take note of his assurance that His Majesty's Government are giving this matter their serious attention, and I hope that my noble friend who moved this evening, or some other member of the House, may before long recur to the question, and that we shall then be able to elicit from His Majesty's Government a categorical statement of their intentions. The noble Earl gave us to understand that whatever measures were resorted to would apply, not to Ireland alone, but to the whole of the United Kingdom. I do not imagine that in the rest of the United Kingdom there will be any general disinclination to submit to rules more stringent than those now in force concerning the carrying of firearms; but I must protest against the assumption that there is no special case for dealing with Ireland. It has been established by this debate that the law at the present moment discriminates in favour of Ireland in regard to the carrying of firearms. Can the noble Earl or anyone else suggest a reason why it should be so? It has been admitted in this House and elsewhere that one-third of Ireland is in a dangerous and disorderly state, and, in spite of that, you submit to a condition of the law under which it is actually easier for persons to carry
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0151"/>
<col>253</col>
firearms in these districts than it is in the most law-abiding parts of this country. What has been the result? The result has been that the trade in firearms in Ireland has proceeded at an extraordinarily brisk pace, and you have, been told by the magistrate in the case discussed this evening that every other man carries a revolver in his pocket. Now, will anyone suggest that in districts where cattle-driving is going on it is not infinitely more dangerous that the people who take part in them should carry firearms than that they should be unarmed? The matter is really a serious one. I cannot admit that the English analogy is worth anything; and I wish, in conclusion, to say that no legislation which the Government may determine to adopt can possibly be of a kind which would occasion any real hardship to the people of Ireland. Irish farmers do not want revolvers to drive off crows. They
<col>254</col>
do not want rifles to carry about with them wherever they go; and there really is no hardship in rendering it somewhat more difficult than it is at present for the population in these disorderly parts of the United Kingdom to carry arms.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN):</member> <membercontribution>The noble Earl, Lord Camper-down, referred to some figures I gave in the debate the other day, and said they understated the case. I think the noble Earl will find that my statement of the figures was perfectly accurate; but, if he thinks not and will be so kind as to let me know the part in which he believes there was an error, I will make further inquiry, and, if wrong, will substitute the right figure.</membercontribution></p>

<p>Order of the Day for the House to be put into Committee, read.</p>
<p><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, before moving that the House do resolve itself into Committee on this Bill, I desire, with your Lordships' indulgence, to make one or two observations. The debate on the Second Reading was a very remarkable one in many respects. There was, if I may say so, great knowledge shown. Noble Lords, with enormous experience and knowledge of India gave the House the benefit of their opinions on the Bill, and I am bound to say that the criticism was perfectly fair, and that it was made in a temper towards the Bill and towards those who were responsible for it of which no kind of complaint could be made. 
<col>256</col>
I think the noble Lord who was my predecessor at the India Office described truly the mood of the House when, in an early sentence of his most interesting speech, he said the House and the country had come to a position when we had to face the facts, and that the facts we had to face made it impossible either to stand still or not to make a move in advance. I believe that the passing of the Second Reading of the Bill without a Division was a sign of the sense that this House has of the peculiarity and gravity of the situation we have to meet. It was inevitable, in such a situation and with a Bill of the magnitude and importance of this, that the authors of the Bill should have to face a great deal of criticism and observations, and two or three noble Lords opposite, and one or two behind me, did criticise the Bill and make points of objection to this or that feature in it. It was impossible to bring forward any Bill whatever, whether a very moderate Bill or a fuller Bill such as the one we are now talking about, without exposing a good deal of surface to criticism; but, having carefully studied and weighed all the points that were made on the Second Reading, I do not feel that the foundation or substance of the Bill has been damaged, or that any good reason has been shown why we should not proceed with it, and proceed with it with a determination&#x2014;this is a very important point&#x2014;not to whittle it away in Committee, not to defeat the effect which, as Lord Curzon admitted, it had had of relaxing the tension in India&#x2014;that nothing done in Committee shall impair that most desirable consequence.<lb/>
It has been said that I, as the responsible Minister, have rushed this Bill, or, at all events, some points of it, and I have seen it stated in some of the Indian telegrams that there was a frantic haste in the construction of this measure. I cannot imagine what people can mean who consider the facts. It is three years ago since this policy was, as it were, put on the anvil. The Government of India sent a Despatch containing their views of the policy which they hoped might be embodied in a measure, so far as Parliamentary sanction was necessary. We at the India Office considered those proposals most carefully. We sent them back a reply begging them to reconsider this or that point and to submit
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0153"/>
<col>257</col>
the whole case to the local Governments and local authorities. That was done. It took a very long time, but it was very carefully and even exhaustively done. The end of it was a second Despatch in October of last year. We considered it again, and made certain modifications in it. But those were not hastily made. Does anyone believe that an Indian Secretary, is there any one of the fifteen men who have held the office of Indian Secretary who would have dreamed of framing and completing a measure of this importance without consultation with the Viceroy and the Government of India? It was quite impossible and inconceivable, and I can only say that I am entirely guiltless of the frantic haste and hurry of which I have been sometimes definitely accused.<lb/>
The noble Marquess opposite pointed to the last stage of all, and referred to my requirement, so to call it from the Government of India, that their views, so far as the heads of the regulations were concerned, should be in my possession when I had to move the Second Reading of the Bill in your Lordships' House. It is quite true that no great length of time was given for the consideration of those proposals to be framed afterwards in the regulations. But the local authorities had had all the topics before them for three years, and had had, I think, two solemn and formal inquisitions into them, and had given a great deal of evidence to the Decentralization Commission, much of that evidence touching points now in the Bill. The air had been full of all these topics for three years, and surely, then, there was nothing unreasonable or hurrying in asking these gentlemen and the authorities they represented what they thought as to the line of this or that regulation? I hope, therefore, that noble Lords opposite, and your Lordships at large, will absolve me from having been hasty at all. On the contrary, no one could have been more deliberate or more anxious to have consultation with the Government of India than I was, and I do not believe that anybody there would say otherwise.<lb/>
I promised, in reply to the request of the noble Marquess opposite, that I would on this occasion describe to the House, so far as I could, the general heads of the regulations so far as we have yet arrived in discussing and settling them. Everybody agrees that it is for the Government of India to shape and frame these regulations
<col>258</col>
in conformity with principles laid down at home, but not arrived at without full consultation and deliberation with them. I will state first the points already settled which were to be dealt with by regulations, rules, or proclamations. The first regulation already settled fixed the number of members of the Imperial Council and the Councils of Madras, Bombay, Bengal, the United Provinces, Eastern Bengal, Punjab, and Burma. I will not trouble your Lordships with the numbers, but they are fixed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>Do they approximate to the maximum laid down in the schedule?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>I am not sure that they do. Perhaps the noble Marquess will allow me to look that up. The number of the Imperial Council is to be sixty-five, including the Viceroy; Madras, Bombay, Bengal, and United Provinces, forty-seven each; Eastern Bengal, thirty-seven; Punjab, twenty-five; and Burmah, seventeen. The next point was the quorum, which was fixed at twenty-one for the Imperial Council; fifteen for Madras, Bombay, Bengal, and United Provinces; twelve for Eastern Bengal; and eight for Punjab and Burma. The third point settled was the term of office, which is three years for ordinary members and one year or less for the class known as experts.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>Who are the experts?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>They are, I understand, experts who are called in. The noble Marquess would know that better than I do. The expert is a man invited, as I understand, into the Council. We have settled, too, the method of filling casual vacancies. In the case of casual vacancies to be filled by election, the proper body or group of bodies will be informed of the vacancy by the head of the Government and requested to elect a member. If no such member is elected within three months of the date of receiving the request, the head of the Government may then nominate, at his discretion, a person belonging to the community or local area which the body or group of bodies is supposed to represent.<lb/>
I come to the second head&#x2014;rules settled in principle. The discussion of the annual
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0154"/>
<col>259</col>
financial statement is a most important branch of the new system. I need not dwell upon this system, because it is described very fully and clearly in the Blue-book, and it is not easy to summarise. But, quite shortly, it comes to this. In regard to the Imperial financial statement, the Legislative Council will resolve itself into committee and discuss it by heads sitting <i>de die in diem</i> till it is finished. Each head will be explained by the member in charge, and every member may move resolutions and divide the committee on them; such resolutions being in the form of recommendations to the Government, who, of course, are not bound any more than they are either in your Lordships' House or in another place to take action upon them. When the committee has finished, the Government will make such alterations in the Budget as they think fit, and the Budget in its final form will be submitted to the council, when there will be a general discussion, but no more resolutions. All through, certain items of revenue and expenditure, including the State railways and the Army, are excluded from the debate. That is a very important limitation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member>: <membercontribution>What will be the approximate dates of discussion?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>I cannot tell the noble Lord offhand. The discussion on the provincial Budgets will be on somewhat similar lines, except that a standing finance committee of the council will be appointed, not more than twelve in number, and equally divided between officials and non-officials, to consider the Estimates in a private and informal manner in their first stage. In their second stage the council will resolve itself into committee; and in the third stage the council as such will discuss them, as in the case of the Imperial Council. The subjects of general interest will be discussed subject to the following &#x2014; conditions, which have not yet been put into the form of rules:&#x2014;(1) Resolutions must relate to matters of public and general importance; (2) no resolution shall of itself have any force or effect; (3) the order of business is to be under the entire control of the president; (4) the president to have power to disallow any resolution if, in his opinion, it is contrary to public policy; (5) certain classes of
<col>260</col>
subjects, to be defined when the rules of the business are drafted, to be expressly excluded. So much for the matters that are settled in principle.<lb/>
The Bill leaves the following points to be dealt with by regulations, rules, or proclamation. There are three possible ways of proceeding&#x2014;regulation, rules (a narrower instrument), and proclamation, which only arises, I think, in two or three cases. The points to be dealt with are:&#x2014;(1) The number of members, only the maximum being fixed by the Bill; (2) the number of a quorum; (3) the term of office; (4) the manner of filling casual vacancies; (5) the conditions under which and the manner in which persons resident in India may be nominated or elected; (6) the qualifications for being nominated or elected a member. There are rules not yet settled affecting the discussion of the annual financial statement, the asking of questions, and so on. As to the Executive Councils, they are to be called into existence by proclamation, and we are now considering&#x2014;and the Government of India especially&#x2014;what powers of the Lieutenant-Governor shall be exercised by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, the number of the members of council, their qualifications, their powers and duties, and the way of appointing temporary and acting members.<lb/>
The next question is the regulations still under consideration. All that has been decided as to the manner of election&#x2014;and this, of course, affects the burning question of Mahomedan representation&#x2014;is that there is to be election in the proper and natural sense. The ordinary way for nomination was for the Viceroy or Lieutenant-Governor to ratify the recommendation. The question arises&#x2014;Ought we to persevere with that system and still retain what is called nomination, but what is really ratification or confirmation in the case of members elected? The view of the Government is that it would make election rather&#x2014;I do not say farcical in effect, but it would certainly make it look farcical if, after expanding the Act of 1892 in order to carry further the principle of election, we reserved to executive authorities the power of saying whether election should be void or should be a valid choice. We have decided that there is to be no ratification.<lb/>
Of course, that leads to the necessity of going into the question of qualification.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0155"/>
<col>261</col>
Every legislative body&#x2014;certainly the House of Commons&#x2014;exercises its right of excluding from membership within it persons coming within certain categories. We have not yet quite settled what those disqualifications are to be, and the Government of India in a telegram about ten days ago have provisionally proposed the following as disqualified persons:&#x2014;(1) Females; (2) persons of unsound mind; (3) persons under twenty-five years of age; (4) insolvents, subject to the conditions which exist in our own country in the matter of bankruptcy; (5) persons who have been convicted of a non-bailable offence, when such sentence has not subsequently been quashed or reversed; (6) persons who have been dismissed from the service of the Government&#x2014;the noble Marquess will recollect a discussion on the propriety of the exclusion when he was Viceroy&#x2014;and declared ineligible for employment under the Government in future. The Government of India are now specially considering a question undoubtedly of great moment&#x2014;namely, whether the persons dealt with under Regulation 3 under the Act of 1818, should be declared for ever disqualified. Nine or more persons are now deported under that regulation. I slipped into an error the other day in replying to Viscount Midleton on this subject. The noble Viscount asked a question upon this point along with others. I meant to answer some in the affirmative, and in doing so slipped into the error. I do not now bind myself to take the view I then expressed. I think it requires a great deal of consideration. All these questions of disqualification have come into prominence because of the cessation of the ratification and confirmation from executive authorities. The moment you arrested that process it became necessary to lay down rules and categories of exclusion. In regard to all these categories, and in the question of the deported men and so forth, I hope the House will take the counsel which my noble friend Lord Courtney gave the other day and which, I confess, I have much at heart. I think it is vital for the success of this policy and this measure. If we are going to give these great extensions of power, let us not do it in a grudging way. If we make the list of disqualifications too large, if we include certain classes of people in India, I am afraid it would leave what I may call a "ragged edge" behind. It is vital that we should leave as little ragged edge as
<col>262</col>
possible, if ragged edge there be at all. Of course it will be necessary to make provision to meet the case of corruption in elections. On any member becoming disqualified under any of these heads, the head of the Government will have power to declare his seat vacant. It is proposed by the Government of India that the oath or declaration of allegiance should be taken by every nominated or elective member before he takes his seat, and unless he does so he shall not be qualified to sit.<lb/>
As to the rules as to questions, there are already rules on this subject, and the only important alteration will probably be in respect of supplementary questions. We heard a great deal in the debate on the Second Reading as to the evils that would arise from a promiscuous multitude of supplementary questions such as we are familiar with in this country. Upon this point no final decision has been arrived at, but the Government of India propose as follows&#x2014;namely, that no discussion shall be permitted in respect to an answer under this rule; that a member who has asked a question may be permitted to put a supplementary question or questions for the purpose of further elucidating any matter of fact upon which information has been asked for in the original question; and that the president may disallow a supplementary question without giving any reason therefor. That is the last explanation with which I need trouble the House as to the purport and scope of the rules and regulations, and I hope the noble Marquess will consider that I have explained them pretty fully and discharged the pledge which I gave on the Second Reading.<lb/>
Moved, That the House do now resolve itself into Committee.&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Morley of Blackburn.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HARRIS </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I think it was understood, at the conclusion of the debate on the Second Reading, that those noble Lords who had not had an opportunity, owing to the exigencies of the convenience of your Lordships' House, of speaking on that occasion should be allowed, on the Motion to go into Committee, to offer their remarks as if it were the Second Reading stage. I should not, even with that permission, have presumed to intervene at this stage were it not for an overwhelming feeling that, having had the honour of administer-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0156"/>
<col>263</col>
ing the affairs of some millions of His Majesty's subjects in India, it is my duty to express my sense of the momentous importance of the proposals in this Bill, proposals which contain a germ not unlike the mustard seed.<lb/>
I shall not detain your Lordships at any length on the subject of the enlargement of the Legislative Councils. It was my duty in 1892 to apply the Act of that year to the Legislative Council of the Government of Bombay. It fell to my lot to distribute the new seats that were allotted to various interests and classes, and that distribution has, upon the whole, stood the test of time, subject, I believe, to one alteration. As to the enlargement of the Legislative Councils, I see no great objection to it, but I think I might warn your Lordships that it will not add so largely to information on the subject of a legislative proposal as might be supposed, because such proposals are subjected to opinions of responsible bodies representing different classes, interests, professions, and I might almost say trades, before the matter is introduced to the Legislative Assembly. I do not, therefore, think that the enlargement of these Councils will add very much to the information given to the public in discussion beyond what has already been given under the old system.<lb/>
As regards the subject of interpellation, I was delighted to hear from the noble Viscount that a rule will give the president full authority to disallow a supplementary question. That is very desirable in a country like India, where, however hard the work of the secretariats may be, and however anxious the officials are to do their whole duty, the Departments have not the means of obtaining information in order to reply to questions accurately such as exist in this country. The only other point with regard to the Legislative Councils on which I would touch is that of the annual financial statement, and really the Governor in Council has not very much latitude, the amounts being very largely ear-marked. I should like to illustrate what my own experience was in this matter. I suppose I was as much abused during my time as most Governors and Lieutenant-Governors, and I attributed a large part of that abuse to the fact that, as regards such money as I could allot, outside of the ear marked amount, to education, I did allot to primary education in preference to
<col>264</col>
higher and secondary education. That aroused the animus and the hatred of a very large part of the vernacular Press engineered by the Brahmins, who were disappointed that the money should go to classes whom they despised. I think, however, I shall have the sympathy of the noble Viscount in that I tried to do my best for primary education.<lb/>
I turn to the proposals with regard to the Executive Councils, for, in my bumble opinion, they are the most momentous that have been put before Parliament in regard to India since the administration of that country was taken over by the Crown; and I ask myself two or three questions: Are the it men the noble Viscount wishes to find to be found in such numbers as to allow any choice? Are the conditions of intimacy in India such as to facilitate consultation within the Executive Council? Lastly, will these changes add to or maintain that confidence in absolute impartiality which is the strength of British rule in India? It is as well to bear in mind that my remarks apply solely to Presidential Councils, upon which the noble Viscount evidently contemplates putting two more members.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>I never said that.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD HARRIS </member>: <membercontribution>Well, in the Bill it is provided that there shall be two more ordinary members.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>There may be.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HARRIS </member>: <membercontribution>There may be two more ordinary members. In his speech in the autumn, the noble Viscount used expressions which have undoubtedly excited the hopes of those classes in India whose one aim and object is to obtain an official position. It is evident that they contemplate that the seats will be given to natives in India; and as the noble Viscount has provided in the Bill for two additions to the Provincial Councils I cannot help thinking he has in his mind the fact that if native members are added to these councils it will be obligatory to divide the seats between Mahomedans and Hindus. Up to now, in the case of the two members of the Governors' Councils it has been customary&#x2014;at any rate, it was in Bombay&#x2014;to divide
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0157"/>
<col>265</col>
those seats evenly between the revenue side and the judicial side. It is well to bear in mind what has been said by the noble Viscount and two other noble Lords as regards the individuals whom it may be possible to find. It is significant that the noble Viscount and Lord Reay had in mind the judicial service&#x2014;gentlemen who had gone in for the profession of an advocate or of a judge. The noble Viscount appealed for our sympathy as to what kind of reply he was to make to some distinguished lawyer if he had to explain that he could not select him for the Viceroy's Council; and evidently he had in his mind that it was more likely to be somebody in the legal line who would be selected than one in the administrative line. My noble friend opposite&#x2014;Lord Reay&#x2014;said he had no hesitation in saying he could have found a suitable native gentleman if he had been asked to select some one for his Council, and I cannot help thinking that he had in his mind a distinguished Judge. I think that is rather ominous.<lb/>
Where will the distinguished men on the revenue side be found? The noble Earl, Lord Cromer, had to go back for thirty years to find two such native gentlemen. I had the advantage the other day of discussing this subject with a distinguished ex-Indian Civil Servant who approved of the noble Viscount's proposals. I suppose his service was thirty or thirty-five years. I asked him to tell me, in his long experience, how many natives he could, in fact, say he would have trusted as certain to be just and courageous in a crisis. He thought for some little time and then replied "Two"&#x2014;and that in an experience of thirty or thirty-five years! If on the Executive Governments two members of the legal profession are to be added to the one judicial member already there, the revenue side of the councils is going to be swamped. Quite three-fourths of the work of an Executive Council is revenue work. Some of that work is bound to come up for discussion before the whole Council; and I know from experience that there is very often a want of sympathy between the legal and revenue sides, which will make it most dangerous for the latter; and, after all, it is the revenue side that one has to think most of in the administration of the affairs of those silent millions.<lb/>
I had some experience of trying to select a native of India for a very high position.
<col>266</col>
I had to appoint a gentleman to an acting position as collector for a month or two, and I had to make up my mind whether I should appoint a native gentleman or a European. I knew the native gentleman in question; he came of a distinguished branch of a family who had been accustomed to revenue work. I had this responsibility, that if I selected him and he made no mistake my successor would be bound to make the same promotion when the next acting vacancy occurred. I selected the native gentleman believing he was capable, and during that term nothing critical arose and he did not fail. My successor, as I anticipated, had to appoint him again. Something critical, however, did arise at that time, and he retired and allowed a young police officer of three years service to run the whole show. That is not by any means a solitary instance of incapacity for revenue work amongst the natives of India. I do not know why it is, but the native does prefer the judicial side and he leaves the revenue side to Europeans; and I am apprehensive that, under the proposals outlined by the noble Viscount, the revenue side is going to be swamped.<lb/>
I next turn to a very delicate subject which was touched upon the other night by the noble Earl, Lord Cromer, and which goes to the root of the whole matter. I ask myself whether the addition of these native gentlemen to the Governors' and Lieutenant-Governors' Councils will improve the intercommunication between the members of those Councils. Will this novelty which is going to be introduced lead to greater harmony? I am afraid that it is impossible for the European to know the natives of India even as well as he can know the natives of many other parts of Asia, and for this reason, that he is rigidly excluded from the home life of Hindus and Mahomedans. A native can judge what is the effect of home influence upon a European; the European cannot judge what is the effect of home influence upon a native public man. When it has fallen to the lot of one of your Lordships to entertain an Asiatic gentleman in your own home, what was the class of hospitality you offered? I venture to say that it was complete, that you welcomed him to your domestic circle where, if he pleased, he could judge, in the confines of the society of your wife or daughters or family, what influences the domestic circle had upon your opinion as a public man. But the European has no
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0158"/>
<col>267</col>
opportunity of forming the same opinion in regard to a native of India. It is their religion, their custom; we have bowed to it most respectfully and have made no effort to intrude upon their privacy. But it must make some difference as regards our social acquaintance with them. I ask, therefore, Is the introduction of these native gentlemen going to maintain those harmonious relations within the Governor's Council which it is desirable should be maintained? Is it going to maintain that confidence in the impartiality of British rule which is, as I have already said, our strongest weapon in India? I am a little doubtful, seeing that so many questions come up in which the animosity of the two great religions are concerned.<lb/>
Let me illustrate my point by a personal experience. Soon after I arrived in India a terrible calamity occurred. Two poor Parsee girls were killed by a fall from the tower of the University of Bombay, and the whole Parsee community was convulsed with the conviction&#x2014;it amounted to that in the minds of a large number of them, and to suspicion amongst the more thoughtful, perhaps&#x2014;that this was due to violence caused or threatened by some Mahomedans. Your Lordships may ask what business that was of Government. You may say it was the business of the coroner's jury to ascertain the cause of death. But India is a country of petitions. A petition came in this case to Government making allegations, and it had to be answered. I trust that our answer was just, but, whether it was or not, I am certain it was regarded as absolutely impartial. But if there had chanced to be at that time a Mahomedan sitting as a member of the Governor's Executive Council I do not think the confidence in the impartiality of that decision would have been quite as strong.<lb/>
At moments of crisis and of great difficulty I personally would prefer to depend upon the experience as well as the impartiality and the courage of men who have been tried in public positions. When I went to India the distinguished Judge to whom reference was made the other day was regarded as a leader of advanced thought and of reform among the Hindus in some domestic matters. The subject of infant marriage was a very critical one at the time. The following year, I think it was, I heard that distinguished native gentleman hissed in Convocation in Bombay
<col>268</col>
because his infant daughter had been married. I cannot help thinking that domestic influence had been too strong, even in the case of a man of the highest judicial reputation, of the most eminent ability, and of the most attractive personality. A crisis came in that man's life, and, for some reason or other, he failed. Yet he was a man who would have been picked out amongst all the natives in that part of India for capacity to fill such a distinguished and responsible position as that of a member of the Viceroy's Council. Those are the thoughts that have been passing through my mind since the noble Viscount propounded his scheme last year. I listened with the closest attention to the speech of the noble Earl on the Cross Benches (Lord Cromer), because I thought I recognised that there had been the same doubt in his mind as to whether these changes would, after all, be for the advantage of India, and that, of course, is what we are all striving for.<lb/>
Brought up as a child in India, I personally have to thank the natives of India for that devoted attention which they give to European children. I have travelled all over India and have had the honour of administering the affairs of a large Province. I have been most profoundly anxious as to whether what the noble Viscount now proposes will conduce to the advantage of those millions whose comfort, rest, and peace depend upon the impartiality of our rule. I have come to a conclusion different from that of the noble Earl, Lord Cromer. I cannot get over my apprehensions that it this great and momentous change of adding natives to the Executive Council of the Viceroy and of the Presidential Governors we are running serious risk of qualifying that confidence in our impartiality which has been the glory of our system of government and which, whatever happens, must ever redound to our credit, and which I honestly believe to be our greatest safeguard.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD NORTHCOTE </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, in the list of points which the noble Viscount read out, some as being settled and others still undetermined, there was one point which he said was not absolutely fixed yet&#x2014;namely, the question of the number of members on the Councils. I would like to ask the noble Viscount whether the principle is definitely fixed that there is to be a non-official majority on the Provincial Councils. If that is still open to recon-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0159"/>
<col>269</col>
sideration, I should like to urge a few reasons against it; and, if it is fixed, I should like to explain why I most respectfully differ from the noble Viscount on the matter.<lb/>
I submit that there are three reasons why this need not be done, at all events at the present moment. In the first place, this Bill, if it passes into law, will confer very largely-increased powers upon the natives of India, and, even if this provision securing them a majority upon the Legislative Councils were abandoned, they, nevertheless, would reap very distinct advantages under the Bill. In the second place I would point out that even Mr. Gokhale, one of the most prominent leaders of native opinion in India, never pleaded for more than a "respectable minority" on the Viceroy's Council. I cannot see why what is sauce for the goose should not be sauce for the gander, and why, if the Secretary of State considers that an official majority is necessary on the Viceroy's Council, it is not equally, or almost equally, necessary on the Provincial Councils. Then, in the third place, I submit that in reality this Bill is more in the nature of a disfranchising than an enfranchising measure, because it will take away power from the British representatives&#x2014;who, as the late Lord Kimberley said, alone represent the hundreds of millions of agriculturists&#x2014;and give the control of the Councils into the hands of what I may term professional middle-class politicians, the Banias and barristers, backed by the Brahmins, who represent but an insignificant minority of the people.<lb/>
So far as it is a question of securing from the local Government or from the Imperial Government concessions in the matter of abatements or advances of public money, I quite acknowledge that these gentlemen will always be ready to make appeals and pass resolutions or votes in favour of obtaining such remissions. But now may I quote an instance which occurred to myself, and which will explain why I have had to make a somewhat uncomplimentary reference to a considerable section of my then native advisers? In the year 1901 the attention of the Bombay Government was drawn by a very distinguished Indian civilian, Sir Frederic Lely, whose services have recently been utilised by His Majesty's Government in a very important and interesting Report on Decentralisation,
<col>270</col>
to the miserable condition in which the agriculturists of Gujarat found themselves owing to the enormous proportion of their number who were helpless in the grip of the moneylender. Their farms were all mortgaged up to the hilt, and noble Lords acquainted with the conditions of life in India know that when an unfortunate ryot once gets into the grip of the moneylender he is in a state of servitude for the remainder of his life, from which he has not one chance in a thousand of escape. My colleagues and I brought in a measure prohibiting the ryot from mortgaging more than two-thirds of his holding. It was a Bill containing that one single principle. The native members had ample time to consider it. They memorialised my noble friend Lord Curzon, and got up an agitation throughout the Province declaring that we were attempting to take away one-third of the ryots' property; and when we brought the measure forward in Council, after an unsuccessful attempt to postpone the measure for six months they rose in a body and left the Council Chamber. As we had an official majority I was wholly unmoved by the spectacle, which I have seen many a time in another place, and we passed the Bill, which I am happy to learn from the accounts I have since received from India has been of very great advantage to the poor cultivators of Gujarat. But supposing that, instead of our having an official majority, the native members had possessed such a majority. In that case they could have postponed the Bill, fostered agitation throughout the Province, and kept the native cultivators in a state of misery. Therefore it is that I am very unwilling to abandon the principle of the retention of an official majority. What is to happen? The noble Viscount says that any resolutions to which the Government of the day object can be simply ignored or disallowed. But surely it is more reasonable and more constitutional that they should be vetoed by a majority than that the Governor should be continually placed in the position of being at first outvoted in Council and then of exercising his authority in disallowing or ignoring the resolutions adopted.<lb/>
One word more with regard to the question of the appointment of natives. The noble Viscount spoke of the eminent qualifications which many natives undoubtedly possess, but I think rather for judicial than for administrative work. I agree with my noble friend Lord Harris on that point, and
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0160"/>
<col>271</col>
I think it is very easily explained by the fact that the work of a Judge is rather to interpret a law already made, in the interpretation of which the keen and subtle intellect of the native finds ample scope, than to carry on the administrative duties which fall upon the shoulders of a revenue officer. There are many points upon which, if time permitted, I would gladly have said a few words. But I may say that I associate myself most entirely with the general criticisms on the Bill which have fallen from the noble Lords sitting below me. I will not waste time by repeating imperfectly what they have said much better. I can only say, in conclusion, that although I do dissent very strongly from this provision of the Bill, I do so in no party spirit. I recognise the great zeal and ability which the noble Viscount has shown in framing this measure, and I sincerely trust I shall never take any share in mere party opposition to a Government charged with so difficult and delicate a task as the administration of our Indian Empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD WENLOCK </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the noble Viscount has invited us to agree to the proposals he has submitted in this Bill, and I hope I may say for myself, as one who has taken a part in the administration of public affairs in India, that I have approached this subject with the very greatest anxiety and interest. I am well aware that the noble Viscount has been placed in a position of enormous difficulty and has had to confront problems which did not present themselves at that time, many years ago, when I was in India; and I trust that in the remarks I may have to make to-day I shall not say anything to add to his difficulties.<lb/>
Turning, in the first place, to the Legislative Councils, I have not concealed from myself that the time must come when we would be bound to associate the natives of India more with us in the government of the country. At the same time I think it is of the utmost importance that care should be taken that none but the very best men should be selected for these positions. I failed to gather from the noble Viscount how many of these members of Council it is proposed should be put forward by popular election; but I understand that the members so elected are to take their place without any power of veto on the part of the Governor. The noble Viscount said that he considered fitness the real test of eligibility, and I ask him whether he thinks popular
<col>272</col>
election is going to be the means by which he will discover the fittest men to take these responsible places. I think the noble Viscount will have very great difficulty in applying that test, because the best men in India, those whom the Government would like to see associated with them in the government of the country, will not be willing to submit to the ordeal of popular election. Therefore I should be very glad to know that only a small number are to be elected by popular election, and that the regulations will be so drawn as to enable the selection of the best men to aid in this particular work.<lb/>
I come to the question of the Executive Councils. I have an Amendment on the Paper regarding this particular measure, and I will state the reasons which have actuated me in putting down that Amendment. As I read the Bill, it will be open to the Secretary of State in future to appoint two natives on the Executive Councils of the Governors of Bombay and Madras and also on the Councils of Lieutenant-Governors. With a Council consisting of two European and two native members a Governor will be called upon to decide all questions which may arise between the two sections, and, whatever may be his decision, he will be subjected to a great deal of hostile criticism from the party which he does not happen to please. This is a very invidious and difficult position in which to place the Governor, and it is a point which requires most careful consideration. The Amendment I have placed on the Paper is to the effect that the consideration of this particular proposal should be postponed for the present. I was much struck with what fell from the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, when he suggested that it would be very much better that the House should be in possession of the views of the Government of India and of the local Governments themselves on this particular question before it was pressed forward. I hope the noble Viscount will allow this to be done, and will bring in a separate Bill presently containing the proposal he may have on this subject cleared up by the views which may be expressed by the various Governments concerned. I press this upon him, because I feel that this is one of the most important measures which have ever been submitted for the government of India.<lb/>
The proposal to associate two native gentlemen with the actual day-to-day work
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0161"/>
<col>273</col>
of the Government is an important and novel step, and one upon which the destinies of India will depend in a very large degree for a long time to come. Therefore I beg that your Lordships will allow this matter to be hung up, as it were, if only for a short time. I think it is important that we should know more of the subject before we allow the Bill to pass in its present form, and I sincerely hope that when my Amendment is reached we shall hear that the noble Viscount is willing to give time for consideration and consultation with those most deeply affected. I was rather surprised to hear the other day from my noble friend who leads the House that we ought not to concern ourselves with more than the conditions of the moment and should not bother our heads very much about what will occur one hundred years hence.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>I ought to explain what I said, because I see that it has been Misunderstood not only by my noble friend opposite but also by some writers in the Press. I was alluding to what seemed to me the rather unfortunate intervention of a prophecy by my noble friend behind me&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH </member>: <membercontribution>I expressly said I was not prophesying.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CREWE </member>: <membercontribution>The noble Lord may not place his prediction precisely in the form of a prophecy, but he seemed to foretell certain possibilities with regard to very extensive changes in the government of India, and I merely intervened to state my opinion that the less said about large changes in the future form of Indian government the better for everybody. I did not for a moment mean that we should not now take action with an eye to the future, or with an endeavour to forecast what would be best in the years to come for the advantage of the Empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD WENLOCK </member>: <membercontribution>I am sorry if I misrepresented what the noble Earl intended to convey. As far as I can see, the effect of the measures now proposed will be felt in India one hundred years hence and a good many years after that; and as future generations will erect a superstructure on the foundations we are laying now, it behoves us carefully to consider these proposals before we agree to them.</membercontribution></p>
<col>274</col>
<p>*<member>LORD SANDHURST </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, so many ex-Governors have addressed your Lordships that it is with great hesitation that I add to their number, but I shall not detain you for more than a few minutes. One cannot help sympathising with the aspirations of my noble friend the Secretary of State, as portrayed in the statement which he laid before your Lordships a few days ago, and there are few who will deny that the Act of 1892 requires some extension. But, in listening to the noble Viscount, one is so charmed with his speeches, couched in so lofty a tone and full of such high ideals, that one is apt to be carried away and to think those ideals almost attained, leaving out of sight or not analysing the means by which they are to be reached. I do not think any one of your Lordships was unmoved by the speech delivered by my predecessor in the Governorship of Bombay (Lord Harris), and I am bound to say that in a great deal that he said I find myself in concurrence. But one or two speeches have been delivered containing criticisms of a very vital nature, and when I listened to the speech of the noble Lord on the Front Bench opposite (Lord Curzon), I almost expected that he would move the rejection of the Bill. While, however, one may agree with many of the criticisms that have been made, it is quite obvious, I think, to any one who knows India, that to move the rejection of this Bill, to say nothing of carrying that Motion, would have a very bad effect.<lb/>
The one or two points on which I wish to touch are those having to do with administration. Lord Curzon referred to the derangement and dislocation which would occur when officers were taken away from their work to attend these Councils. I go further than the noble Lord. I say that we have not enough men to do the work as it is, even in times when things are going smoothly. In my time I was so unfortunate as to have my Presidency devastated by two calamities&#x2014;plague and famine. I had to take officials from every conceivable department to carry on the work of administration, and also to borrow a great many men from the Military Department, who did their work admirably. But if I had had to send some of my most experienced men to the Viceroy's Council the difficulties would have been considerably increased. As to supplementary questions, I can conceive their being extremely disagreeable and tiresome for the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0162"/>
<col>275</col>
presidents of the Councils and also for the officers who may have to answer them; but I do not think that is quite such a vital matter as has been stated. With regard to the civilians themselves, I have generally found that they are capable of doing most things, and, as circumstances develop, I have no doubt that, irksome as the duty will be, it will be well done.<lb/>
I say nothing as to the effect of the inclusion of native Indians on the Viceroy's Council, though I concur in the opinion that the change will rather weaken than add strength to the Government of India. My noble friend the Secretary of State for the Colonies has spoken of this as an enabling Bill, but as the prospect of a seat on the Executive Council has been held out to the natives, I do not see how you can possibly withhold it. It is as good as promised, so far as I understand the Bill. I see that an Amendment has been placed on the Paper to the effect that the qualification for membership of the Executive Councils should be the same for an Indian as for a European&#x2014;namely, twelve years service. But I am afraid that, even if you find men good enough for the position of chief of a department&#x2014;and I am afraid I must concur in much that was said by Lord Harris as to that&#x2014;you will be drawing those members from one class of the community to the exclusion of others, whilst if you do not have a qualification you will find yourselves in the difficult position of being compelled to take men inexperienced in Government work. The position of a member of an Executive Council is not merely one of honour and glory; it entails also being the head of a department or a group of departments. A department takes its character entirely from that of the man who is its head. The character of the head of the department may be said to permeate it; his experience guides it, and his knowledge stimulates it, and I am anxious as to what would happen in the various departments if you got men inexperienced and untrained in Government service at their head.<lb/>
One thing which occurs to me is whether the quinquennial period is not too long for these Indian gentlemen to hold office in the Executive Government. There are, of course, the two great communities, the Mahomedans and Hindus, but in the Presidency of Bombay there is another community of great position and great enter-
<col>276</col>
prise, the Parsees, who also have shown considerable aptitude for affairs. With the quinquennial period it might be ten years before one of those gentlemen got office. Perhaps the noble Viscount will consider whether it would not be advisable, so as to enable the change in the representation of the communities to work more smoothly, to shorten the period of office.<lb/>
Those are the points to which I desire to draw attention. But, at the same time, I cannot help sharing in some of the apprehensions that have been expressed by noble Lords of similar experience in India to my own. We have done so much&#x2014;slowly, it is true, but everything in the East is slow&#x2014;we have done so much for social improvement in India, for the redemption of woman, the protection of girlhood, the raising of low castes from the bondage of centuries, and the preservation if not the creation of the rights of ryots, that I am rather fearful that, if there is any weakening at the centre or at the extremities of the Government, we will be giving a certain set back to that slow but gradual and assured improvement. And as we are not legislating for to-day, or even for a few years hence, but are at the beginning of something the end of which we cannot really foresee, I sincerely trust that the regulations will be framed by the Governor-General in Council with the utmost care, caution and consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT CROSS </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I should not have intervened in this debate except for the fact that I was responsible to Parliament for the introduction of the Act of 1892. A Paper of Lord Dufferin's, when he was Viceroy, got out surreptitiously in some way, and this forced our hands at that time and made it necessary to do something; and when my noble friend Lord Lansdowne became Viceroy he and I concocted the Act of 1892. Thanks to the way in which that Act has been administered, I think everyone will admit that, as far as it goes, it has been a great success. I believe my noble friend at that time would have gone a considerable step further than we did in that Act, but I had the greatest possible difficulty with my colleagues in the Cabinet in inducing them to permit me to introduce at that time even the Bill as it was passed. Many of them had great apprehensions, and the noble Marquess who was then at the head of the Government, Lord
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0163"/>
<col>277</col>
Salisbury, had the greatest possible objection to many provisions in the Bill; but he ultimately yielded to argument, and he said he was quite satisfied with the way in which afterwards it was worked.<lb/>
Now I, for one, am quite prepared to say that, although I believe that Act, thanks to the way in which it has been administered, has worked extremely well, the time has come when further advance ought to be made in the same direction; and I congratulate the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India on the cautious way in which he has approached the subject. I have no fault to find individually with the provisions in the Bill which deal with the discussion of the Budget and with supplementary questions. I observed with great pleasure that when the noble Viscount received a deputation from the Mahomedans, for whom I have great respect and regard, he met them as far as he could on many points, and I was pleased to see that they were met in such a spirit. One point on which I, in common with many noble friends, have very great doubt is the placing of a native on the Viceroy's Executive Council. I agree with a great deal that has been said as to the danger that may take place in consequence. As there is only to be one on the Viceroy's Council, I think the Government will find itself in a difficulty when it deals with Mahomedans and Hindus. If the native upon it is a Hindu, the Mahomedans, I apprehend, will not acquiesce, and if he is a Mahomedan, the Hindus will not acquiesce. I do not suggest that two should be appointed, though I understand there will be two on the Executive Councils.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>Not necessarily.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT CROSS </member>: <membercontribution>Not necessarily. There may be; but there are not to be two on the Viceroy's Council. I have not yet heard in this debate how the idea of having natives on the Executive Councils is viewed by the rulers of the Native States in India. Perhaps the noble Viscount will be able to give us some information on that point. I entirely agree that so far as the regulations and rules are concerned, they must, to a very great extent, be left to the Government of India itself. The mere fact that the Government of India has, so to speak,
<col>278</col>
sanctioned the admission of a native into the Executive Council puts it in a very different form in England, because if we were to reject that after it has been accepted in India, it would have a bad effect.<lb/>
I see that there is an Amendment on the Paper to the effect that the regulations should be laid before both Houses of Parliament for actual discussion. I entirely object to that. You cannot govern India by Provisional Orders. The subject is far too large; but I have not the smallest doubt that the noble Viscount the Secretary of State will give us every explanation that is required as to the main principles of the regulations, leaving matters of detail to be settled entirely by the Government of India. I sincerely hope the House will now go into Committee, on the Bill, and, as it has been introduced after a great deal of discussion in India, I think it would be fatal to reject it; and the effect in India would be extremely bad if the Bill were tampered with in Committee in either House of Parliament.<lb/>

<p>Moved, That Clause 1 stand part of the Bill.&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Morley of Blackburn.</i>)</p>
<p>*<member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, this is, perhaps, the best moment at which to say something in addition to what was said the other day and in the light of what has passed this afternoon on the question of numbers. The question of numbers on the new councils, both of the Viceroy and of the Governors, is raised by sub-section 2 of Clause 1. I must confess that I had hoped that when he addressed us this afternoon the noble Viscount, in addition to giving us the information that he did in respect of the proposed regulations, would have availed himself of the opportunity of replying in some measure to the criticisms and observations that were made the other day, and I rather gathered from the tone of his utterance the other night that that was then his intention. Of course, he is within his right to choose his own moment for giving us
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0164"/>
<col>279</col>
further information, and therefore I hope he will pardon us if we take hold of different points in this Bill for endeavouring to elicit something in addition to what he has so far given us.<lb/>
On the question of numbers, I took the liberty the other day of putting before the House certain considerations which led me, at any rate, and I believe a good many others, to think that the numbers in these new councils will be unduly large. I pointed to my recollection of the fact that in 1892, when the last Bill for the extension of the Legislative Councils was introduced, grave doubt was expressed about the addition of very large numbers to these Councils. Now we have in this Bill a schedule containing the proposed numbers of the Legislative Councils, and the Secretary of State this afternoon has given us the exact numbers which, I understand, are to be fixed by regulation. As regards the Legislative Council of the Viceroy, I would ask him to favour us with some explanation. When the Viceroy and the Government of India put forward their proposals first in August, 1907, they asked for a council of fifty-four. In their letter of October, 1908, which I understood the Government had accepted, they asked for a Council of sixty-three. The schedule of the Bill, as it is printed and in our hands, contains the maximum number for the Council of the Governor-General of sixty, but the noble Viscount this afternoon told us that the number he proposes is to be sixty-five. I think some explanation is required upon that point.<lb/>
As regards the numbers in general, I hope the House will realise that, while we all agree in principle to the extension of these Councils, and to a considerable extension, yet the numbers we are now asked to accept will mean a very marked and serious change. It is exceedingly doubtful whether you will get suitable men. Lord Sandhurst, speaking from his own experience, said that not only did he have difficulty in finding the men for a much more limited number of posts in his day, but that he was very doubtful whether more would be forthcoming. There is the further point, on which stress was laid the other day and on which I shall be very grateful if we can hear something from the Secretary of State, of the strain that is going to be imposed upon our officials both in the Provincial Councils and still more in the
<col>280</col>
Viceroy's Council. I really can hardly exaggerate what I believe will be the unfortunate effect of this proposal on those officers. The other day Lord Reay, who spoke from his experience of Bombay, said we need not be disturbed about this matter, because officers of the Public Works and the Education Department could be very well taken from their offices and brought into Council to supply the requisite number to vote for Government when required. Public Works officers in India are officers who have to do with the construction and maintenance of roads, bridges, tanks, canals, and all the business of irrigation and communications in general, while, as regards education, the work in India is much the same as here. Is it really to be contemplated that, with a view to keep the Government going in the Legislative Councils in India, you are to take these public works and education officers away from their duties and detain them at headquarters day after day in order, in the case of the Viceroy's Council, to give you a majority, and, in the case of the other councils, to prevent their having a serious breakdown? I cannot conceive anything more dangerous to the <i>morale</i> and efficiency of the service.<lb/>
Then there is the question of expense. I hope the noble Viscount will tell us what he contemplates will be the initial payment and the total cost of these new officers to be placed on the Legislative Councils; and I wish I could persuade him that, by raising these councils to the totals contemplated, he is really going to introduce some of the features which we are all most anxious to keep out of India&#x2014;the features inseparably attached to a Parliamentary system. If he had given us councils of, say, from thirty to forty or forty-five, I think we should all have accepted them with pleasure; but when I contemplate councils of fifty, and even sixty, I feel that many of those features must arise and that the Government of India will be the sufferers in consequence.<lb/>
The second point that arises in connection with the question of numbers is that which was raised so forcibly by the noble Lord behind me, Lord Northcote&#x2014;the question of dispensing with the official majority in the Provincial Councils. This appears to me to be the part of the Bill on which that question can be most easily raised, and I hope the noble Viscount will be able to give
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0165"/>
<col>281</col>
us some explanation on the point. Let me recall to the House that this is not a proposal that emanated from the Government of India. It is a proposal that, I believe, has carried with it the consent of the Government of Bombay, for reasons which I endeavoured to explain the other day. To what extent it carries with it the approval of the other. Governors and Lieutenant-Governors we have not been told, but all the ex-Governors sitting in this House who have spoken on the subject have expressed themselves in terms of disapproval; and the principal ground of our disapproval is one which I am sure in its spirit, if not in its form, will commend itself to the noble Viscount. Lord Reay said last week that he was confident he could have passed the same measures as he did even if he had not had an official majority in his Council. True. But his Council was very different from that which is being constructed by the noble Viscount. He had a council of limited numbers, composed for the most part of persons nominated by himself; but now we are to have councils constituted for the most part by election, and we have yet to see what the character of those bodies will be as time develops. Lord Northcote gave a notable experience of his own to-night, which I should like to supplement by mine.<lb/>
The noble Lord alluded to a case which I remember very well, because I gave him the most ardent support throughout his struggle, in which he was endeavouring to introduce and carry into law a measure of the utmost benefit to the poor cultivators of Gujarat. That measure was received with a storm of misrepresentation and abuse, and I am sure it could not have been carried into law in any Council on which the Governor had not an official majority. I take another case. It fell to me to carry into law, in the Imperial Legislative Council, a measure of a similar character for the prevention of the alienation of land which was going on to an alarming degree among the yeoman class in the Punjab. So much perverted ingenuity and hostility were applied to it in the Punjab that we decided to deal with the measure in the Imperial Legislative Council. Even there we had some difficulty, but we carried it into law in the face of the keenest criticism in the Province, and so great a success has it been for the protection and benefit of the class of people of whom I speak that petitions continually reached the Government of India in my time for an extension
<col>282</col>
of the provisions of the Act to other parts of India. If we had had a local Legislative Council of the character we are going to have in the future under this Bill, if the Lieutenant-Governor had not had an official majority and this Bill had been introduced in such a Council it would have had no shadow of a chance of passing into law.<lb/>
Take another case. Bengal offers a most striking illustration of the force of what I am saying. During the past fifty years we have been passing a series of measures in order to relieve the unhappy peasants of Bengal from the injurious effects of the Permanent Settlement too hastily conceded more than a hundred years ago. Every one of these proposals has been steadily opposed by the whole of those interests&#x2014;barrister, professional, land-owning, and so on&#x2014;which are going to be placed in predominance in future on these councils, and it has only been by the exercise of the official majority and the power of Government that these measures have been passed into law. Noble Lords may say that is all very well, and that no doubt this will be one of the inevitable, and, perhaps, unfortunate results of these changes; but that the Supreme Government may safely be left to deal with such cases. Surely the noble Viscount would not welcome such an idea. Will it not be a serious thing for the future of land legislation if this legislation, hitherto dealt with by the provinces, should be handed over to the Government of India and decided upon possibly over the heads of the local Governments, because you have chosen, for other reasons, to create these large councils and to deprive the Governor of an official majority?<lb/>
There is only one other consideration I will submit on this point. The other day Lord Crewe, with characteristic humour, said he should not think much of a Governor who would not be able, by diplomatic methods, known, no doubt, well to himself, to keep his non-official members in good hand so that they would vote for such proposals as the Government might desire. I do not say that such methods are unknown in India, but it must be remembered that you have no guarantee that the majority of your Provincial Councils will be members who will be open to those influences. You are throwing open a wide field of election, and there are a good many of us who contemplate that in future you will have
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0166"/>
<col>283</col>
returned to these councils a strong body of extremists who will constitute what in this country we should call a permanent Parliamentary opposition; and I think the time may well arrive when the Governor will find it difficult to exercise successfully those powers of persuasion to which the noble Lord referred.<lb/>
Lastly, let us look at it from the point of view of the members of the Legislative Councils themselves. You are going to invest them with a great responsibility. For the first time you are going to dispense with the supreme power of Government, and trust them to discharge their duties with honour and credit. So far so good. Yet at the same time you do not carry your trust to its logical conclusion, because all the while you hold in reserve the veto of the Governor if he be a Provincial Governor or the authority of the Governor-General in Council if it be an Imperial matter. Well, is that not giving with one hand and taking away with the other? Here you are affecting to give these wide and liberal concessions to natives, and yet you say that, if they abuse them, the Viceroy or the Governor, as the case may be, will have to set matters right. I must say I rather deprecate the Viceroy or the Governor being brought in to extricate the Provincial Councils from the mistakes which they may possibly make. These are the only remarks with which I need trouble your Lordships on this Clause, and they are merely addressed with a view of eliciting from the Secretary of State some information, first, on the point of numbers, and, secondly, on that of the official majority.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have listened to the rather powerful observations of the noble Lord with some curiosity. If he takes this view of, for example, the abolition of the principle of an official majority, I am at a loss to understand&#x2014;I hope he will not think I am taunting him at all&#x2014;I am at a loss to understand why he did not vote against the Second Reading of the Bill. The Bill, if it contains any principle at all, contains the principle of extending the powers which the measure of Lord Cross first opened. That measure first opened the elective principle, and, by assenting to the Second Reading of this Bill, the policy of extending the elective principle is accepted with all its consequences. I know that the noble Lord when he was Viceroy
<col>284</col>
did not see his way to political concessions, but looked to efficiency as the true aim and end of British administration in India. That is a perfectly defensible view, but it is not the view of this Bill. What would be the advantage, what would be the sense of adopting the elective principle, if the councils had at the same time retained the old method of an official majority which would reduce the power of elected members to a mere farce?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member>: <membercontribution>The noble Viscount does it on the Viceroy's Council.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>As I have mentioned all along, the Viceroy's Council is on an entirely different footing. I accept that. The noble Lord will remember that I urged the Government of India, in the case of the Viceroy's Council, to retain the principle of an official majority, because that is not merely a legislative body, but a great executive body, quite different from the Legislative Councils. It would be a complete mockery to invite people to take a larger share in the administration of their country if the official majority were to be retained, and if all resolutions, votes, and proceedings were to be mere pious opinions. That is my answer on that point. The noble Lord does not accept the principle of the Bill. I do not think I am overstating the case. If he did accept the principle of the Bill he would see that to retain in any form the official majority would be to balk the whole purpose of this policy. It has been suggested that the votes of nominated members might take the form of proxies. I am not sure that my noble friend Lord Courtney did not suggest that the other night. It has also been suggested that the Government should fill up <i>cadres</i> to meet their need. I will read the view expressed by the Government of India upon the point raised by the noble Lord as to the inconvenience of officials being withdrawn from their work.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>What is the document from which the noble Viscount is about to quote?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>It is a private telsgram. It is not a document which I should be prepared to lay before Parliament, and therefore I do not
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0167"/>
<col>285</col>
technically quote it; but the House will be interested to know the view taken by the Government of India on this argument. They say that their proposals for these Councils were so framed as to reduce this withdrawal to a minimum, and I certainly say, without any hesitation or qualification, that they do not anticipate any difficulty on that ground. In the Viceroy's Council the difficulty will only arise in the case of eight officials nominated, as the noble Lord knows, to represent provinces. One of these, the member who represents Bengal, can discharge his duties as a Bengal official just as readily as before; he is not withdrawn from the scene of his work. As to the provincial members other than the Bengal member, their labours will only be slightly greater than at present. The introduction of debates on matters of public and general interest will tend to furnish occupation for them. While in Calcutta they will not be idle. The remaining official members of the Viceroy's Council will be secretaries of departments, heads of departments, and officers at headquarters, and they can attend the Council in addition to their other duties. In the case of Provincial Councils, the official members will ordinarily be officers stationed at headquarters and will not be withdrawn from their other work. That is the answer on that head. The noble Lord asked for information with regard to the expense of the Bill. That is a perfectly just observation to make, but the estimate is not yet complete, and I am afraid, therefore, I cannot supply noble Lords opposite with any information. As to numbers, the noble Lord has, I think, been slightly confused. He has added to the nominated members the <i>ex-officio</i> members, but they are two different categories of members.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member>: <membercontribution>My point was this. As regards the Legislative Council of the Governor-General, I said that in August, 1907, they proposed a council of fifty-four; that then, in the Despatch of October, 1908, which I thought was agreed to by the Secretary of State, the number had risen to sixty-three; that in the schedule of this Bill the maximum number is printed as sixty; but that when the noble Viscount read out to us the regulations this afternoon he gave us the number of the Viceroy's Legislative Council, not as sixty, but as sixty-five, I think there must be some mistake.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>LORD WENLOCK </member>: <membercontribution>Before we pass from the subject of numbers, might I ask the noble Viscount if he can inform the House what are the numbers of the elected members for the Provincial Councils of Madras and Bombay whose election to the Council will not require the assent of the Governors?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>The Legislative Council of Bombay will consist of&#x2014;Officials, eighteen; non-officials, twenty-eight; the total, excluding the Governor, is forty-six, the maximum under the Bill being fifty. Fifteen will form a quorum.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD </member>: <membercontribution>The question put by Lord Wenlock raises an important point. I am in favour of the withdrawal of the official majority in Provincial Councils, but I voted for the Second Reading of the Bill on the understanding that the elected members would not be in the majority. I believe the most forward representatives of educated India will be satisfied if the official and non-official nominated members should always be in the majority; in other words, that the elected members should be in the minority. It was on that understanding that I voted for the Second Reading of the Bill, and I should like the noble Viscount to say whether in this assumption I was right or wrong.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>That, of course, is a point that the Government of India will deal with by regulation. It is not to be dealt with by the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the noble Viscount has conducted these discussions with so much consideration towards those who sit opposite to him that I noticed, not without regret, an observation that fell from him a moment ago, when he taunted my noble friend behind me with not moving the rejection of the Bill on the Second Reading because my noble friend held strong views as to the size of these Legislative Councils and as to the necessity of maintaining an official majority upon them. When the noble Viscount asks those who share my noble friend's opinions why we did not move the rejection of the Bill on Second Reading,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0168"/>
<col>287</col>
he knows quite well that we should have been very slow indeed to take a step of such tremendous importance as the rejection of a Bill brought to us in the circumstances in which the noble Viscount brings this Bill to us. But, my Lords, because we do not desire to reject the Bill, or, indeed, to move any Amendments in it which could properly be described as wrecking Amendments, we do not consider that we are relieved from the duty of criticising any provisions which seem to us open to criticism, and of giving the noble Viscount the opportunity of affording us the explanation we desire, and it has been with that object that attention has been called to some of these clauses.<lb/>
The noble Viscount tells my noble friend that two features in his scheme&#x2014;the large number on the Legislative Councils and the question of the official majority&#x2014;are in the nature of principles and essential to the measure. Surely it is not fair to describe any one of this series of changes which the noble Viscount proposes as by itself a principle of the Bill. The principle of the Bill is the popularisation, if I may say so, of the Legislative Councils, and what we have to consider is not so much each of these individual proposals upon its own merits as the cumulative effect of the whole of them when regarded together. Some of us hold very strongly that the large number at which you are going to fix the strength of these councils is a dangerous feature in the Bill. We believe that it tends to convert them into something very different from what they are now, and to make them, in effect, little Parliaments with a great many of the attributes of a Parliament; and when you couple with that the disappearance of the official majority the risk appears to us infinitely greater.<lb/>
When the noble Viscount tells us that these things form part of the principle of the Bill, I would remind him that the Government of India did not ask for the abandonment of the official majorities. The Government of India desired to keep them, so far as we are aware, and, as my noble friend Lord Northcote told the House this evening, even so extreme a reformer as Mr. Gokhale, in the document published in the Blue-book, a document which contained far-reaching proposals, did not include a proposal for getting rid of the official majorities. I will not dwell, be-
<col>288</col>
cause it is not necessary to do so, on the evidence given to your Lordships during the course of this debate by noble Lords who have held high office in India and who have certainly put forward some considerations to show why these steps should riot be taken. Our fear with regard to these proposals is that they will have the effect of exposing the Governments, when once the official majority has disappeared, to a series of slaps in the face, and some of us who think we know something about Indian affairs do not believe that it is a good thing that any Government, whether the Imperial Government or the Provincial Governments, should be liable to rebuffs of that kind.<lb/>
The noble Viscount has not adduced in any arguments to show that our apprehensions are ill-founded, and I confess I think it questionable whether we might not have asked the House to consider the propriety of substituting for the numbers in the schedule of the Bill other numbers of smaller dimensions. But these schemes under which a particular number of members is assigned to each of the Councils have no doubt been carefully thought out, and if we were to attempt to touch the numbers in the schedule the noble Viscount might very fairly turn upon us and ask if we had an alternative scheme. I will not pause to enquire whether it is very likely that any alternative scheme would be accepted by the noble Viscount. Although, therefore, we feel it our duty to place on record our misgivings upon these two points, I, for one, would not encourage your Lordships to propose to amend the schedule by putting in other numbers, and as we are not prepared to offer a substantive proposal to the Committee upon this point, it may, perhaps, be desirable that we should proceed to another Clause of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>I want to say one single word in reply to what the noble Marquess has said about my taunting the noble Lord opposite, Lord Curzon. I think I particularly said that I did not taunt him. The treatment of the Bill by the noble Lords opposite has been so entirely serious and considerate, so generously recognising the enormous responsibility that weighs upon the Government and upon the Minister concerned, that I should be the most graceless of men if I had thrown out any taunt of the kind, But my point was that his powerful
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0169"/>

argument about the official majority really got its power from the assumption that the Bill was unsound in principle.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member>: <membercontribution>My argument derived such power as it possessed from the Despatch of the Government of India, with which I was in entire agreement.<lb/>
On Question, Clause 1 agreed to.<lb/>
Clause 2:</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> <membercontribution>moved an Amendment to provide that not two, but all, the ordinary members of the Executive Councils of Madras and Bombay should be persons who at the time of their appointment should have been in the service of the Crown in India or of a native State for at least twelve years. The Executive Council of a Presidency was, he said, the supreme administrative agency; it controlled and directed the whole administration of the Presidency, and the appointments to the Council had been hitherto considered of such a vital character that no person bad been chosen without long experience of the work and without being a man of eminence and remarkable for prudence. He understood that there was no intention to alter the character of the work performed by these Executive Councils, though it would be more distributed than at present. It was most essential that members should come to the work of the Council with that knowledge which could only be acquired by experience. These appointments must be given either as the spoil of politics or from the point of view of the interests of the millions committed to our charge. It seemed to him that there could be no doubt as to the choice, and he hoped the choice would be made in the way he desired.<lb/>
Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 2, line 9, after the word 'direct' to insert the word `all,' and to leave out the words `two at least.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord MacDonnell of Swinford.</i>)</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>I am sure the noble Lord will see that his Amendment would do what is really fatal. It would put a limitation upon the choice of ordinary members. For example, a Judge, however eminent, if he had not served twelve years would be disqualified
<col>290</col>
under this Amendment. My noble friend Lord Reay the other evening described a gentleman, well known to himself and whom everybody would accept as well fitted to be a member of one of these Councils; but the noble Lord's Amendment would exclude that gentleman. I do not know why my noble friend should assume that a Governor-General or a Governor of Bombay would recommend to the Secretary of State an intriguing politician. Why take this pessimistic view? Personally, I would like to see upon the Councils of Bombay and Madras an Anglo-Indian who was not an official at all. I think the work of the Executive Councils would be greatly benefited by having almost constantly the advice of a civilian. It would infuse a new element into these councils. Therefore I cannot accept the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD REAY</member> <membercontribution>hoped the Amendment would not be pressed. If it were carried very important sections of the community would be excluded, and as the noble Viscount had pointed out, the selection would be unduly restricted. The Amendment would exclude such a gentleman as the founder of the Scientific Research Institution in Bangalore&#x2014;the late Mr. Tata&#x2014;who, in his (the noble Lord's) time, was one of the most distinguished representatives of the commercial and industrial activity of Bombay. He would have brought into the council a new and useful element. His advice on financial questions on the subject of technical education, which was then under consideration, on juvenile labour in factories, on Customs duties, on Excise would have been most valuable. He therefore deprecated putting a limitation upon the choice of these new members. He agreed with Lord Harris as to the importance of the revenue element, but did not think there was the slightest risk under the enlarged councils of the revenue element not being fully considered. At the present moment the two members of the Governor of Bombay's Council were both taken from the revenue side. The Governor would be fully justified in submitting the name of a gentleman taken from the Bench or the Bar to strengthen his Council.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>We were not able to catch the whole of the noble Viscount's argument in reply to the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0170"/>
<col>291</col>
noble Lord on the back bench. This clause does seem to some of us objectionable upon a ground which, I think, was mentioned the other evening in debate&#x2014;that under the clause as it stands the head of the Presidential Government may find himself in this position. He may find himself with two members with official training on one side of him, and two members without any official training, and possibly both of them natives, on the other. That might place the Governor of the Province in an invidious and awkward position. If, however, the noble Viscount does not see his way clear to accept the Amendment, I do not think we need press it from this side. But I would like to ask whether he would see any objection to agreeing, instead of saying of whom two at least, to say of whom three at least shall be persons who have been in the service of the Crown, leaving only one without official experience.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>My own intention is, if the Bill is passed, only to appoint three members; but this would, perhaps, be better discussed upon Lord Wenlock's Amendment to leave out the clause. I should contemplate an Executive Council of three, of whom I hope one would be an Indian. It would be my intention to appoint an Indian.<lb/>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>Does the noble Viscount agree to the substitution of three for two?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>No. I think it would be better to leave it as it is, and see how it works.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD WENLOCK</member> <membercontribution>then moved to omit from the Bill Clause 2, which ran:&#x2014;
<quote>"2.&#x2014;(1) The number of ordinary members of the councils of the Governors of Fort Saint George and Bombay shall be such number not exceeding four as the Secretary of State in Council may from time to time direct, of whom two at least shall be persons who at the time of their appointment have been in the service of the Crown in India for at least twelve years.</quote>
<quote>"(2) If at any meeting of either such council there is an equality of votes on any question, the Governor or other person presiding shall have two votes or the casting vote."</quote>
He hoped he had made clear, in the few remarks he had addressed to their Lordships earlier in the evening, his object in moving this Amendment. He deprecated
<col>292</col>
legislating on these lines in a hurry, and thought their Lordships should wait to see what those out in India thought of the proposal. He hoped, therefore, the Government would consent to postpone the passing of this clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p>Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"To leave out Clause 2."&#x2014;(<i>Lord Wenlock.</i>)</quote></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>I am afraid I cannot accept this Amendment. The noble Marquess the other night made a strong point of bringing up this proposal in the form of a separate Bill to be introduced at some later time. Your Lordships will recollect that this proposal comes from the Government of India&#x2014;paragraph 76 of the Government of India's Despatch. Noble Lords will observe that the clause is purely permissive. If the Government of India and the Secretary of State do not desire to extend, there is nothing in the Bill that makes it obligatory on them to do so. I would like to point out a rather remarkable discovery that has been made. I am advised by the Law Officers of the Crown that His Majesty already has power without this Bill to add a third member to the Executive Councils of Bombay and Madras respectively, and such third member need not possess the qualification of twelve years service of the Crown. Therefore, there is nothing to hinder the Secretary of State from adding a third member to either of these Councils to-morrow. But I am well content that it should come before your Lordships for consideration. The Government of India, in the seventy-sixth paragraph, says that experience will probably test this. In other parts of the Despatch they express the opinion that the work thrown upon the Governors will be so heavy that they will need the aid and support of another member. Lots of difficulties may occur in consequence, such as those the noble Marquess pointed out in connection with the Amendment of Lord MacDonnell, but those have to be faced. There is no reluctance on the part of the Government of India to accept this proposal, in spite of experience and so forth not being yet ripe or even begun. It is, however, a work of supererogation really to put in the clause, but it would be fatal now if Parliament, having been consulted, did not accept the proposal for the Council being raised to four if thought necessary.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0171"/>
<col>293</col>
As I have said, my own intention is not to augment it beyond three, but we thought it better to take power for another member who some day may be needed.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>The noble Viscount has a happy knack of opening masked batteries upon the House. He opened one not many minutes ago when he produced from his pocket a more or less private telegram from the Government of India, upon which he relied to support one of his arguments; and now he has opened another masked battery by quoting an opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown, which goes to show that the clause under discussion, or part of it, need not have been inserted in the Bill at all. The noble Viscount was kind enough to give your Lordships the opportunity of discussing the subject; but, whatever our conclusions may be, he is in a position to give effect to his opinion whether we approve of it or not. We may have what opinion we may think proper as to the appointment of these new members of the Executive Council; but the noble Viscount tells us that the Law Officers advise him that it is open to him to appoint them without legislation. In these circumstances the discussion becomes&#x2014;if I may borrow a phrase of the noble Viscount&#x2014;rather of a farcical description.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>The Law Officers do not say that we have power for four.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>At any rate, there is, we are assured, power to do a great part of what the noble Viscount desires. The noble Viscount rests his case mainly, I understand, on the views of the Government of India as stated in the seventy-sixth paragraph of their Despatch of October last; but the noble Viscount must be aware that the Government of India go out of their way in that Despatch to tell the India Office that, in their opinion, we should wait for further experience of these new Legislative Councils and of the amount of extra work which their existence may occasion to the Executive Government&#x2014;that we should wait until that experience has been acquired before we make these important innovations. The words are clear and unambiguous. Lord Minto's Government say&#x2014;
<quote>"It may be that experience will show the desirability of strengthening the hands of the
<col>294</col>
Lieutenant-Governors in the larger provinces by the creation of Executive Councils, and assisting the Governors of Madras and Bombay by enlarging the councils which now exist in those Presidencies .... But it would be premature to discuss these contingencies until experience has been gained of the working of the new legislative bodies."</quote>
But the noble Viscount will not wait until he has gained experience of the working of the new legislative bodies. He proposes to legislate immediately. It was in those circumstances that I ventured to suggest to the noble Viscount, not really in any hostile spirit, that it might be worth while to postpone these clauses and deal with them in a separate Bill after he has obtained from the Government of India a report as to the manner in which the proposal is regarded by the higher local authorities in India. As far as the documents on the Table are concerned, there is nothing to show that there has been that consultation which Lord Minto's Government evidently considered desirable. Indeed, it is all the other way, because such evidence as we do possess goes to show that the higher authorities in India, including the Viceroy's Council, at no very remote date looked askance upon the proposals to tamper with the Executive Councils. Therefore, it does seem to me that my noble friend Lord Wenlock is not unreasonable when he makes to the noble Viscount the suggestion that this matter might be allowed to stand over for the present. The Bill would then deal as the Act of 1892 dealt with the Legislative Councils, leaving the other part of the question, the Executive Councils, which are really separate and distinct, to be dealt with hereafter, when the noble Viscount himself and Parliament generally have had a fuller opportunity of weighing the different considerations which bear upon the question.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON)</member> <membercontribution>pointed out that the clause was not compulsory, but entirely permissive. Having the opportunity now of dealing with the Indian problem, it would be unwise to leave an opening for another Bill and not to dispose of the matter now as far as they could.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>Will the noble Viscount give the Committee some kind of assurance that no immediate action will be taken under this clause until the kind of consultation which the Govern-

<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>I can assure the noble Marquess that no action will be taken under the clause without full consultation with the Government of India&#x2014;I would almost say without their assent, but I ought not to say that, because it is the Secretary of State who makes these appointments, and I do not think I ought to debar myself from using powers that I possess. But my noble friend may take it from me that I have no desire to act precipitately.<lb/>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<lb/>
Clause 2 agreed to.<lb/>
Clause 3:</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> <membercontribution>moved to omit Clause 3, which ran as follows:
<quote>3.&#x2014;(1) It shall be lawful for the Governor-General in Council with the approval of the Secretary of State in Council, by proclamation, to create a council in any province under a Lieutenant-Governor for the purpose of assisting the Lieutenant-Governor in the executive government of the province, and by such proclamation&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>(a) To determine what powers and duties of the Lieutenant-Governor shall be exercised and performed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, and what shall be the number (not exceeding four), qualifications, powers, and duties of the members of any such council; and</quote>
<quote>(b) To make provision for the appointment of temporary or acting members of the council during the absence of any member from illness or otherwise, and for the procedure to be adopted in case of a difference of opinion between a Lieutenant-Governor and his council, and in the case of equality of votes, and in the case of a Lieutenant-Governor being obliged to absent himself from his council from indisposition or any other cause.</quote>
<quote>(2) Every member of any such council shall be appointed by the Governor-General with the approval of His Majesty, and shall, as such, be a member of the Legislative Council of the Lieutenant-Governor in addition to the members nominated by the Lieutenant-Governor and elected under the provisions of this Act.</quote><lb/>
He feared that the discussion which had just taken place had somewhat prejudiced the chances of success of his Amendment. He was not impressed by the statement of the noble Viscount the Lord President of the Council that safety lay in the fact that the clause was permissive. His
<col>296</col>
feeling was that if this clause obtained a place upon the Statute Book the pressure brought by politicians in India and England would be such as to force the hands of the Government and deprive them of freedom of action. He agreed to the proposal to add additional members to the Councils of Madras and Bombay, because he thought that in those Councils the experiment could be safely made. The circumstances in which we were placed rendered it impossible to remain quiescent. A forward movement of some sort must be made. Inasmuch as participation in the executive work of the Government was desired by the most prominent representatives of educated Indian society, he thought the best way of complying with their desires was to allow an experiment to be made in the Presidencies of Madras and Bombay. But in regard to the creation of Executive Councils for Lieutenant-Governors a different set of considerations arose. In this matter, the persistent opinion of Indian administrators from 1868 to the present time was that it was very much better, having regard to the necessity of close touch with native populations, to retain the system of Lieutenant-Governors in preference to the system of government by council. There was only one part of India in which a considerable body of opinion prevailed as to the wisdom of that decision, and that was in regard to the Lower Province of Bengal. But he did not now propose to touch upon that. The question now for them to decide was whether they would have corporate government, whereby the Executive Government was weakened, or personal government, whereby the Executive Government was strengthened. He supposed no one would maintain that it was desirable to introduce the tedious and procrastinating system of government by council in Burma, a country which, even in recent memory, had been the scene of sanguinary wars. In the United Provinces, the country with which he was most recently acquainted, he considered that that system of government was wholly unfitted to the circumstances of the locality. In those Provinces the tradition of personal rule and the recollections of recent war were so strong that no person of importance in those provinces would understand what was meant by divesting the Lieutenant-Governor of personal rule. In those provinces, inhabited as they were by martial, but, he was glad to say, loyal races, the forces of disorder were very near the I surface. He might mention a case, known
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0173"/>
<col>297</col>
to Lord Curzon, where he had seen the entire structure of British rule disappear in a night, and when he reached the city the next morning he found a city full of sullen people on the one side and the entire British garrison under arms on the other. What would a Lieutenant-Governor do if he had to consult with his Council and waste time in debate in a case like that? It was not safe to entrust the fortunes of from 40,000,000 to 50,000,000 of people under these circumstances to the control and management of a Council. However useful a Council might be in the more settled portions of the country, in those parts which were yet mindful of the effects of war the people had always looked, and would look for many a year to come, to the direct personal rule of the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province. Our great difficulty in these parts of India was the protection of the vast mass of the people from oppression frequently brought to bear upon them. It would be impossible if a Council had to be consulted to give them the speedy remedy now afforded by the Lieutenant-Governor going on tour, entering the villages, making himself acquainted with their particular wants, and thus bringing ryots and landlords together and endeavouring in that way to effect a reconciliation. This was the ordinary work of a Lieutenant-Governor on tour, and if he had to manage these things through a Council his efficiency would be greatly reduced. In the two Bengals different considerations arose, but even there, as the province had been divided in two, there existed no reason arising from administrative efficiency, for the introduction of a council in either. There, so long as the province remained divided, he thought it would be unwise to break with a system which had served us so well in the past and which, though it might be distasteful to a small minority, was acceptable to the vast bulk of the people. This change in our system was demanded by a very small and microscopic part of our Indian fellow-subjects. Taking those who were educated in English and those who were educated in the vernacular, the total of those who demanded the change did not amount to more than four per cent. of the entire population. He was in hearty sympathy with the bulk of the scheme of the noble Viscount, but on this point, to which he attached great importance, he did feel that they were going a little too far.

<quote>[<i>The sitting was suspended at a quarter to eight o'clock and resumed at nine o'clock.</i>]</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, before your Lordships adjourned for dinner we had just listened to a powerful speech from Lord MacDonnell, who was for many years Lieutenant-Governor of one of the principal Provinces in India. Special weight, I think, attaches to what fell from the noble Lord on this question, because it is a matter of common knowledge, not only that his experience as a Lieutenant-Governor was unusually prolonged&#x2014;it lasted for six years instead of the ordinary five&#x2014;but that no Lieutenant-Governor, certainly in my time, established a greater reputation for administrative ability and command of all the problems of government. The noble Lord gave us his own personal opinion as to the proposal we are now discussing to add Executive Councils to the Lieutenant-Governorships of various Provinces, and I propose, in the few remarks that I shall address to your Lordships, to place before you the opinions of those who are, perhaps, if not equally qualified, at any rate nearly equally qualified, with the noble Lord to pronounce upon the matter.<lb/>
Your Lordships' attention has been called to the remarkable words of the Government of India. It is necessary to draw attention to them again, because here they speak in language somewhat different from, and stronger than, the language they employed in respect of additions to the Executive Councils of the Governors of Bombay and Madras. In the case of this proposal for the creation of Executive Councils in the Provinces ruled by Lieuteant-Governors&#x2014;an absolutely new proposal&#x2014;they say that it would be&#x2014;
<quote>"A large departure which could only be recommended after the fullest consideration, and after consultation with the heads of the Provinces concerned."</quote><lb/>
Our case on this side of the House is that, so far as we know, there has been no such full consideration, and, to the best of our knowledge, no consultation with the heads of the Provinces concerned.<lb/>
When I addressed your Lordships the other day I spoke with some wonderment
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0174"/>
<col>299</col>
as to the origin of this proposal. But since then the Secretary of State has presented to your Lordships the Report of the recent Royal Commission of Decentralisation in India. In that Blue-book, which contains some very startling proposals, but others which, I hope, will be of great use to the noble Viscount in carrying out his views with regard to the reform of Indian administration&#x2014;in that document I came, much to my surprise, on this proposal. That body definitely recommend the creation of Executive Councils for Lieutenant-Governors. Without wishing to disparage that Royal Commission, I ask your Lordships to consider of whom it was composed. It contained two members who had never been in India, one of whom was the chairman; it contained two Bombay officials, who would, I think, be predisposed to a system with which they were familiar in their own Province; it contained not a single Lieutenant-Governor or representative of a Lieutenant-Governor.<lb/>
The Royal Commission on Decentralisation allude in their Report to the well-known discussion in India in 1867, when the idea of a Governor-in-Council for Bengal was discussed. But they do not state the whole facts. They give us to understand that on the one side, in favour of a Governor-in-Council, were Sir Bartle Frere, Sir H. Maine, and Sir William Grey, while against it were the Viceroy (Sir John Lawrence), and Sir William Muir. But they were not the only ones against it. The Commission do not mention in their Report that the proposal was then rejected by four to three, the Viceroy having placed on record that&#x2014;
<quote>"personal administration by a single head without a council is the best form of government for many parts of India, Bengal included."</quote>
Nor do the Commission mention the more recent and exhaustive discussion of the subject in India in 1905. Their Report contains the following astonishing paragraph&#x2014;
<quote>"The Home Secretary to the Government of India declined, under instructions from that Government, to inform us as to more recent discussions, or to give his own views upon the question."</quote>
It may have been a prudent, but it was a somewhat prudish, act to refuse this information, since it is accessible to any one who cares to refer to the last Bluebook about the reconstitution of Bengal [Cd. 2,746, 1905]. There, on pages 8 to
<col>300</col>
11, will be found a full discussion of the question of attaching executive councils to Lieutenant-Governors undertaken by the Government of India only four years ago, and resulting, not in a divided opinion, as in 1867, but in a unanimous pronouncement against the change now proposed.<lb/>
The arguments cover three or four pages of print, but there is only one passage that I think I need read&#x2014;
<quote>"Here we arrive at what is, in our view, the crowning drawback of the system [of Executive Councils for Lieutenant-Governors]&#x2014;namely, that what is best for a Province in India is not the rule of a Committee but the rule, or at least the responsibility in the last resort, of an individual. . . . The decisions of such a body carry less weight because their origin and sanction are obscure, and because they lack the personal touch which is an almost inseparable feature of strong government."</quote>
That was a unanimous Despatch from the Government of India. And by whom was it signed? It was signed by three eminent officers, one of whom was till his recent death a Lieutenant-Governor, and two of whom are so now. The first was Sir Denzil Ibbetson, the fine flower of the Civil Service and late Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, who, I remember, felt more strongly upon this than upon almost any subject of Indian administration. The two others were Sir J. P. Hewett, now Lieutenant-Governor of the United Provinces, and Sir E. N. Baker, now Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal. We had then in the Government of India Sir E. Law, who, on the eve of leaving India after five years of strenuous and successful service as a member of the Viceroy's Council, recorded his opinion that&#x2014;
<quote>"Administration by a Governor or Lieutenant-Governor with an Executive Council results in paralysis or worse of the governing authority. The ideal is an administrative head directly in touch with the people and in intimate relation with all their executive officers."</quote><lb/>
I submit that these views are entitled to considerably more weight than the pronouncement of a Commission not one of whose members had any experience of the work of an Indian Lieutenant-Governor, and some of whom had no knowledge of India at all. But the consensus of modern authority is not exhausted by the above survey. Since Lord Morley introduced his Bill this particular proposal has been unsparingly condemned by Sir C. Elliott, formerly Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, and by Sir C. Crosthwaite, formerly
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0175"/>
<col>301</col>
Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Provinces. We have heard the same view expressed by the noble Marquess who was for five years Viceroy of India. Therefore this change up to the present has not had the acknowledged support of a single ex-Lieutenant-Governor or a single ex-Viceroy. I regret that we have not had the advantage to-night of hearing the opinion of Lord Elgin, who has observed a silence on this Bill which I must say has filled me with some regret.<lb/>
The situation, ominous as it was, has been rendered somewhat worse by what the Secretary of State told us to-night. He proposes to take power in this Bill to create these Councils, and I need hardly say that I am sure he will not upon this occasion shelter himself behind the defence that it is merely a permissive power, because it is certain that if you introduce into an Act of Parliament a clause to the effect that it shall be lawful to the Governor-General in Council to give Executive Councils to certain provinces, the Secretary of State who is responsible for that Bill is bound to do it, at any rate in the case of the most advanced Provinces. Otherwise, what is the point of introducing it in the Bill? The noble Viscount told us earlier in the evening that this is one of the reforms that are to be introduced by proclamation. In other words, if we were to allow this clause to remain in the Bill as it is with no further information at our disposal, all future opportunity of considering the matter would be lost. Thus it may come about that a change not advised by the Government of India, disapproved of, so far as I know, by the Government of India, opposed by every Lieutenant-Governor or ex-Lieutenant-Governor who has spoken or written on the matter, and likely to be introduced in a manner which will give us no opportunity of criticising it, may, if this Bill is accepted without amendment, be thrust upon the Houses of Parliament. I hope that if we appear critical or even hostile about this particular clause the noble Viscount will not bring against me or any of my friends the charge that we are, therefore, trying to wreck the Bill. He knows as well as anybody that we accept the general principle of the Bill; we even go further and are anxious to assist him, so far as we can, in passing it into law.<lb/>
In his speech this afternoon the noble Viscount deprecated any idea of rushing
<col>302</col>
this matter. I submit that in this matter we are being absolutely rushed. We know nothing about this proposal except that the Government of India say that it is premature, that it ought only to be recommended after the fullest consideration and after consultation with the heads of the Provinces concerned. I hope the noble Viscount will see that it is not unreasonable on our part to urge for some further explanation, and, if that is not forthcoming, to ask for the postponement of this particular clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON</member> <membercontribution>entirely agreed with what Lord Curzon had said with reference to his noble friend who had moved the Amendment. Lord MacDonnell's experience and statesmanship were well known and his judgment, of course, would have very great weight with any one at all familiar with Indian politics or Indian administration. But he ventured to say that Lord Curzon had misconceived the effect and intention of the clause altogether. The noble Lord had quoted the names of most distinguished Indian statesmen and administrators who in the past had entertained a very different view as to the proper method of administration. The present position was that they had advanced and were advancing in the development of the government of India. The step that was being taken to-day was a great step in advance, and the opening of a new chapter in the history of India. He was not blind to the fact that there were great risks. They had to face the facts, and there must be a change in the Government of India which would associate a larger section of the people of that country with the Administration. The argument of Lord Curzon was in favour of an autocracy as being the very best form of government.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member>: No.</p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON</member> <membercontribution>said that no doubt fifty years ago the very best form of Government was that of a single authority, having both military and financial power and also exercising great judicial functions. The theory on which this Bill was founded, on the other hand, was the association of the elective principle with the government of India. No one would be a stronger opponent than himself to the setting up of our Parliamentary institutions in India, but it was desirable to have behind the Administration of
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0176"/>
<col>303</col>
India a greater popular force than that behind it at the present moment. He would not be tempted to reopen the question of the partition of Bengal, or he might express the opinion that while the noble Lord's policy with reference to dealing with the Government of Bengal was, in the main, sound, he did not think the way in which that great reform was carried out was a right way. He would have thought than an adaptation of the Government of Bengal to what existed in Madras and Bombay would have been the better mode of carrying out what was a necessary administrative reform. But with regard to Madras and Bombay, the noble Lord would admit that government there with an Executive Council had worked efficiently.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member> <membercontribution>said he had never argued the question of Madras and Bombay, where Executive Councils had existed for many years. The position of Lieutenant-Governors was wholly different.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON</member> <membercontribution>said his answer to that was this. If Executive Councils had worked well in Madras and Bombay, why should they not work well in other Provinces?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member>: <membercontribution>Oh, really!</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON</member> <membercontribution>said the Bill provided for the extension of the best mode of local government to other portions of India which did not possess it at present. If the Amendment were carried did they not think they would be opening another Indian question?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member> <membercontribution>said this change had never been asked for.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON</member> <membercontribution>said it was impossible to carry on a duel across the Table. He might be wrong; but his own conviction was that if they introduced large changes into the local government of India, they could not have one description of government in one part and another description in another part. His belief was that there would be fresh agitation and unrest which it was most desirable to avoid. The wording of the clause was clear. It provided that it should be lawful for the Governor-General in Council with the approval of the Secretary of State in
<col>304</col>
Council, by proclamation, to create a Council in any Province under a Lieutenant-Governor for the purpose of assisting the Lieutenant-Governor in the executive government of the Province, and by such proclamation to determine what powers and duties of the Lieutenant-Governor should be exercised and performed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, and what should be the number (not exceeding four), qualifications, powers, and duties of the members of any such Council. The English language was not capable of defining better what was to be an optional or discretionary power. There would be no compulsion, and the Government of India would exercise the power with discretion, wisely, and well. His noble friend Lord Curzon had stated that no member of the present Executive in India had approved of this scheme; but his noble friend the Secretary of State would be able to give the noble Lord the authority of an existing Lieutenant-Governor in favour of this change. It was certainly not the unanimous opinion in India that this change would be a doubtful one to make. The position of the Secretary of State, clothed with these powers, would be this, that he would proceed cautiously in the matter, take the opinion of men on the spot, and not rush into it as if it were a thing finally settled. He would be very sorry to see this provisional power taken away from the Secretary of State. He felt strongly that if the change were brought into operation it would, with the wisdom which would characterise the Government in India and the Secretary of State's Council at home, effect a great improvement in the administration of India and would not be a step that Parliament would regret having taken. He hoped the Committee would not strike out the clause altogether.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD AMPTHILL</member> <membercontribution>did not altogether share the apprehensions expressed by Lord Curzon, particularly as under the wording of the clause the initiative rested with the Government of India. The clause commenced&#x2014;
<quote>"It shall be lawful for the Governor-General in Council&#x2014;"</quote>
and he thought it followed from that wording that nothing could be done unless those principally concerned and those who would be chiefly responsible for carrying out the change in India were agreed upon the subject. But his chief object in rising
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0177"/>
<col>305</col>
was to say something in regard to the arguments used by the noble Lord who had moved the omission of the clause. He could not allow them to pass unchallenged, because they constituted a very serious criticism upon, and disparagement of, the system of Government in Madras and Bombay. The noble Lord's argument, in its crudest form, was that personal government was stronger and that corporate government was weaker. He denied the truth of that argument, and pointed out that if it were a sound argument it must also apply to the Government of India itself, which was that of a Governor-General in Council. Lord MacDonnell had spoken of government by council as a "tedious and procrastinating system." The noble Lord had had a lengthy experience of the Lieutenant-Governorship system, but could not claim the same experience of government in Council; and he (Lord Ampthill) indignantly denied that there was anything tedious or procrastinating about the system of government in Council. If government in Council were tedious and procrastinating so must also be the government of India under the Viceroy; and he doubted very much whether Lord Curzon, although he supported the argument, would admit for one moment that the government of India, under either his own direction or under that of his eminent predecessors, was open to that charge. Nor could he (Lord Ampthill) agree that government by a Lieutenant-Governor was personal government, while that of a Governor in Council was not. The personality of the Viceroy or Governor was not in the slightest degree minimised or obliterated by the existence of a Council. Every noble Lord in that House knew how the remarkable <i>regime</i> of his noble friend was spoken of in India. It was always referred to as the Government of Lord Curzon. Similarly, his noble friends Lord Harris, Lord Wenlock, Lord Reay, and Lord Sandhurst impressed their personalities upon the governments over which they presided. The government of a Governor in Council was every bit as personal as that of a Lieutenant-Governor. Then, as regarded sudden decisions, the noble Lord opposite imagined that in a crisis it would be necessary at Madras or Bombay to summon a meeting of the Executive Council and have a debate. He presumed that the noble Lord imagined also that when some crisis arose on the North-west Frontier it was necessary for the Viceroy to summon a meeting
<col>306</col>
of his Council and discuss the situation. He could assure him that nothing of the kind took place. In the case of the Viceroy, it was a matter of almost weekly occurrence that important decisions had to be given without any reference whatever to the Council; and in the Presidency Governments it was certain that in any emergency the Governor would act without waiting to summon a meeting of his Council. He thought that where a Governor in Council would act on his own responsibility a Lieutenant-Governor would be more likely to refer first to headquarters; the very nature of his office made it natural that he should do so. It would be extremely inexpedient to omit the clause in view of the important step to which they were committed. The avowed object of enlarging the Executive Councils of Madras and Bombay was to give the possibility of appointing Indians. If their Lordships omitted this clause they would be telling the people of the rest of India that they were not going to have any opportunity of sharing this privilege. The clause was not mandatory but permissive, and the initiative was to be entirely in the hands of the Government of India. Therefore, personally, he had no hesitation in supporting the retention of the clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member> <membercontribution>did not propose to deal with the merits of the case or desire to oppose the clause. But he wished to make an earnest appeal to the noble Viscount not to proceed with the clause at once. The noble Viscount the Lord President of the Council had admitted that there were manifest risks in carrying out this project. They all agreed that there must be large risks. In his speech on the Second Reading he had put it in this form, that they were making a leap in the dark. The question was how far were they to leap at once. If a house were on fire it might be wise to jump out of the window if one were on the first floor, but if on the sixth storey it would be better, perhaps, to wait for a fire escape. It was a question of the degree of risk, and before taking this risk he would like to know what the authorities in India thought of the proposal. Their Lordships had no evidence before them in an official form as to the opinion of the present authorities in India on the subject, and that information should be obtained before a decision was pronounced. The Lord President had referred to the clause as being permissive. If it were not
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0178"/>
<col>307</col>
to be acted upon, what was the use of its insertion in the Bill? But, even if there were no present intention of acting upon it, when once the Bill was passed what guarantee was there that it would not be acted upon at some future time? They might have a Secretary of State who would not possess the strength of the noble Viscount opposite, and they knew what would happen when the Bill had once been passed. The members of Congress would put strong pressure on their friends in another place. Pressure might, in turn, be placed upon the Secretary of State, who might, perhaps, yield too hurriedly; and therefore before agreeing to the placing of such an important provision on the Statute-book Parliament should be in full possession of the views of the authorities on the spot. It did not at all follow that if the clause were delayed it could not be passed this session. Why could not the noble Viscount consult the Government of India, and, if the clause were thrown out now, lay Papers before Parliament, when possibly it could be reconsidered? He did not wish to wreck the Bill, but thought their Lordships would be incurring a grave responsibility in giving these powers without knowing the opinions of the Government of India and the local authorities. As one who greatly sympathised with the noble Viscount, he would make an earnest appeal to him to meet their views on this particular point.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>There is nothing that would be more agreeable to me than to meet the view of my noble friend; but let us see what it comes to. My noble friend desires to know the opinions of the Government of India and of the Lieutenant-Governors and so on. I put it to the two noble Lords opposite who have been Viceroys of India whether they are going to put on record in a Parliamentary Paper the opinions of this or that Lieutenant-Governor for or against this or that change, but especially against. How unpleasant, how weakening to the authority of a Lieutenant-Governor it would be to have it placed on record that he could not find any Indian gentleman to put on his Council, or that he did not want a Council, but preferred his own personal rule&#x2014;how indiscreet it would be to have his opinion placed before the two Houses of Parliament. I submit that that is the answer to that part of my noble friend's question. He begs us to postpone this clause. Do the Committee
<col>308</col>
realise how we stand, and why we have taken this great task in hand at all? It is because there is a condition of things in India admitted by everybody&#x2014;not denied by noble Lords opposite who know India so well&#x2014;that demands dealing with without delay. Are you going to deal with a grave and serious situation of this kind piecemeal? When the Minister responsible for India tells Parliament that they are confronted with rather a serious situation, and when the Government of India, as shown in Lord Minto's early Despatch, say things of the same kind, are you going to face that situation seriously and firmly and completely, or are you not? Is it worth while to delay and have another India Bill, with prolonged debates and I know not what, India in the meantime tossing it all about, arguing it and saying "We always told you that Parliament was not up to this!" Lord Curzon said we might bring in another Bill this session. There is another place, and my opinion is that that other place will be greatly occupied, and I only trust to my own good fortune and some firmness in getting this Bill through before the dog-days. I hope to get it through immediately by using all the influence I can with my colleagues to press it forward. How should we look if this House, for example, which has discussed this Bill, if I may say so, with great authority, knowledge, and good temper, broke off and left a ragged edge? Lord Curzon questioned whether there was any Lieutenant-Governor who supported the proposal. In reply I will give him the name of one. The Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal is strongly for it, and is confident that he could find fit and capable men to man such a council.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member>: <membercontribution>He signed the Despatch that I quoted.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>I know; but still there it is. There are Lieutenant-Governors who doubt whether they could get men, and so forth. I do not wish to deceive the House for a moment. There are Lieutenant-Governors who doubt it, to be sure, but the Government of India, and especially we who are not Lieutenant-Governors but who have to look at the Indian situation as a whole, are bound to make up our minds; and I am perfectly certain that there is not a man in this House who would have been more determined to make up his own mind upon a
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0179"/>
<col>309</col>
point like this than the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, unless it may be the noble Marquess who preceded him in the Government of India. Your Lordships acknowledge that they are to have Legislative Councils, and if you postpone or delay, or allow this business to drag on, the tension might easily return. If this Bill is dealt with either here or in another place&#x2014;I am sure it will not be here&#x2014;in such a way as as to make it a failure or a wreck, those responsible will take an enormous responsibility, and if your Lordships to-night play with any part of the Bill, you will be setting, if I may say so, a very evil example. As for the arguments of the noble Lord, they are good, sound, bureaucratic arguments; but it is the bureaucratic system that we are going to make a breach in, and this is one portion of the operation. I therefore hope the Committee will allow the clause to stand.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD MAcDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member> <membercontribution>said he believed the rules of the House permitted him to make a few remarks in reply to what had been said. He did not propose to follow Lord Ampthill, except to say that the noble Lord's conception of the duties and status of a Lieutenant-Governor left something to be desired. In regard to the appeal which had been made by the Lord President that their Lordships should pass the clause and trust to the Secretary of State for India carrying it out under the orders of Parliament, he would ask their Lordships to consider what influence the view of Parliament had upon the noble Viscount in regard to the appointment of the member of the Viceroy's Council. He supposed that if this Bill were passed and the Secretary of State of the day held the same views as to appointments as the noble Viscount the present Secretary of State held as to the Viceroy's Council, the same regard would be paid to the opinion of that House in reference to the creation of Councils for Lieutenant-Governors as was being paid to it in regard to a member of the Viceroy's Council. In regard to the argument that they might create turmoil and tension in India by the rejection of this clause, he would remind the Committee that the most advanced section of Indian politicians had never asked for the clause. He had endeavoured, on the occasion of the Second Reading, to trace the progress of Indian claims for political privileges from the time of their origin in 1885, during the Viceroyalty of Lord Dufferin, up to the time
<col>310</col>
that they reached the point when the National Congress were brought face to face with what he might call the Indian Terror. In none of their resolutions was there any claim made for the appointment of Executive Councils for Lieutenant-Governors. That proposal, as Lord Curzon had said, was first raised in a tentative and very doubtful way in the Despatch of the Government of India at the beginning of October last. It was taken up in the Despatch of the noble Viscount, and it there assumed the appearance of reality. They were now told that if this proposal, which had never been asked for by the most advanced Indian politicians, and which was in contradiction to the universal and continuous advice of the most careful and prudent of Indian administrators, were not granted that evening they might look out for difficulties in our Indian Empire. They would never do any good in India by being afraid. Things ought not to be done in a hurry. In the last resort they depended upon themselves, and if anything were done in a hurry or which tended to disintegrate the Indian Public Service then indeed the time had come to look for a liquidation of the Indian Empire. He did not look upon the present disturbances with apprehension. He thought they were largely due to the nervousness of the men on the spot, and it would be a fatal mistake to give to Lieutenant-Governors a Council for which they had not asked, which no Indian political party had demanded, and to do that before the Lieutenant-Governors were even asked their opinion. He was very sorry to have the appearance of differing from the noble Viscount, the great bulk of whose scheme had his entire approval. But, with regard to this clause, he honestly believed that if their Lordships conceded the point asked for they would be seriously affecting the safety of the Empire. He therefore intended to press his Amendment to a Division.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE EARL OF CREWE </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I need not inform the House that I am really not competent to enter into the details of this particular discussion, but one observation which fell from the noble Lord who has just sat down seems to me to call for some comment. The noble Lord said that this particular proposal had never been invited or asked for by the extreme advanced section in India. I am inclined to say, what of that? This Bill, as I understand it, is not framed to meet
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0180"/>
<col>311</col>
the desires or aspirations of the very extreme politicians of whom the noble Lord speaks as the advanced section. The proposals of the Bill must surely be considered on their merits, with a view to the acceptance they receive from the moderate and rational section of Indian opinion, and I should have thought that the fact that the extreme section had never asked for this reform would, in your Lordships' eyes, have been regarded as a recommendation for the proposal. Therefore, I confess I am entirely unable to follow the noble Lord's arguments on that point. As regards the general merits of the proposal, I should only say this, speaking, of course, without any local or technical knowledge. Your Lordships have agreed to give further considerable powers of self-government in the Presidencies, and it certainly does strike one, speaking from the point of view of general politics rather than from the point of view of one who is competent to judge of India, that the effect of denying or of delaying for long similar privileges to the Provinces must accentuate the difference between the two conditions. I should ask your Lordships, therefore, to pause before you, instead of rounding off this measure, leave what the noble Viscount has called a ragged edge, with almost a certainty of continued agitation for what appears to one who looks upon it, as I do, to be in itself a moderate measure of reform.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, after the long discussion which has taken place, I am not going to enter into a dissertation as to the respective merits of government by a Lieutenant-Governor without an Executive Council and by a Governor with an Executive Council. Each system has its own merits. But what we are asked to do this evening is to assent to a clause under which the Secretary of State will be given the power to create in those Indian Provinces where the system of government by a Governor in Council is unknown a new system under which for the first time Executive Councils will be created.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>The initiative being with the Government of India.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>On the initiative of the Government of India, with the sanction of the Secretary of State
<col>312</col>
for India. That is a very serious innovation, and our point on this side of the House is that we have not been supplied with any sufficient information as to the reasons for which this change is desired. An immense weight of authority has been cited by my noble friend behind me against the proposal. I will not travel again over that ground; the names which he cited are well known to all who are intimate with Indian affairs, and no one will be bold enough to contend that the authority of those high officials is an authority which can be lightly brushed aside. Then we know that this formed no part of the request put forward in October last by the Government of India; it was put forward merely as a suggestion to be hereafter considered. But, besides that, is there any evidence to show that a change of this kind really is desired generally by the people of India, if you can, indeed, speak of the people of India? The noble Earl who leads the House took exception to the statement made from these Benches that no demand of that kind had been put forward by the National Congress. Now, we know perfectly well that the demands of the National Congress represent the highwater mark of Indian pretensions, and if we find that this demand is not included among the pretensions of the National Congress, we are, I think, justified in holding that in the view of those sections of the Indian public which are most interested this particular change has not appeared to enter into the region of practical politics. The noble Viscount the Lord President of the Council dwelt at some length upon the fact that this was merely an enabling or permissive clause. So it is; but surely we are not to be told that these clauses are put into the Bill merely as a sort of shop-front decoration, not to be turned to account. The remark seemed to me to be a little inconsistent with another remark which fell from the noble Viscount, that this clause opened a fresh chapter of Indian history.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON </member>: <membercontribution>The noble Marquess misunderstood what I said. I was referring to the Bill, and was quoting the remark of my noble friend the Secretary of State.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>I entirely accept that. I agree that the Bill does open a new chapter, and I maintain that this is not an essential feature of the Bill. I draw a great distinction between
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0181"/>
<col>313</col>
this clause and the rest of the Bill, between this clause which deals with the creation of new Executive Councils and the immediately preceding clause which deals with certain changes in those Executive Councils which already exist. What is it we ask for? We do not, as the noble Viscount seems to think, want to wreck the Bill. We do not even want to wreck this clause. All we say is, let the noble Viscount hold his clause back, and, if the clause were to disappear this evening and in the meantime the noble Viscount were able to collect a great mass of that information which he has not yet been able to produce, we might regard the clause in a different light. The noble Viscount the Lord President of the Council told us that the object of this clause was to associate the people of India more closely with the government of that country, and he seemed to think that the disappearance of the clause would rob the Bill of that salutary effect. But, my Lords, this is only a small fraction of the proposal. The manner in which the people of India will be brought into closer contact with the government of the Indian Provinces is by the extension of the Legislative Councils. The creation of new Executive Councils is a wholly different matter, and I do not think it deserves to be described as a proposal eminently calculated to associate the people of India with the government of India, or with any part of it. Earlier in the debate, a reference was made to the Report of the Royal Commission on Decentralisation. This matter of Executive Councils is referred to in the Report of the Royal Commission, which is one of the most recent pieces of evidence in our hands. Now, what has the Royal Commission got to say upon it? They tell us that, in their opinion, a good deal is to be said for doing away with the system of what they call single Lieutenant-Governorships. But what is their proposal? They say that it would be highly undesirable to have a civilian Lieutenant-Governor with a Council attached to him, and they say that if the thing is to be done the proper way to
<col>314</col>
do it is by appointing a Governor from home and then giving him a Council. That is a wholly different proposal, and one against which a great deal is to be said. It seems to me an objectionable proposal, because it would have the effect of robbing the Indian Service of some of the few great prizes open to it. But that is the proposal of the Decentralisation Commission&#x2014;not a Lieutenant-Governor with a Council, but a Governor, as a rule exported from home, with a Council, and that is not the proposal which has been adopted by His Majesty's Government. We are told that among the points still being considered by the Government of India was that of the powers to be given to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. Well, if they are still considering this point, the point which certainly arises under this clause, why are we accused of being unreasonable in asking that this proposal may, for the present, at any rate, be held over? If my noble friend opposite takes the sense of the Committee I shall vote with him on that understanding, not that I wish to proclaim unalloyed hostility to the proposal, but that at present I am not prepared to accept it upon the ground that, on the one hand, there is immense weight of authority against it, and, that on the other hand, a very slight amount of authority has been produced in favour of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD SANDHURST</member> <membercontribution>said that if his noble friend the Secretary of State still refused to accept the Amendment he would be compelled to vote against him, because he did not believe that at the present time, at any rate, these Provinces were ripe for the scheme proposed. Reference had been made to this being a permissive clause. If it were merely permissive, he failed to see why there should be so much hurry.<lb/>
On Question, whether the clause proposed to be left out shall stand part of the Bill?&#x2014;<lb/>

<p>Amendment agreed to accordingly.</p>
<p>Clause 4 agreed to.</p>
<p>Clause 5:</p>
<p>*<member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member>: <membercontribution>On this clause, may I ask the noble Viscount a question? I understand that the clause provides for the rules which will authorise the discussion of the annual financial statement of the Governor-General in Council and of the local Governments, as the case may be, and of any matter of general public interest, and also the putting of questions. I understood the noble Viscount to say, in his opening speech to-night, that in the public interest the Viceroy may, without giving any reason, closure any supplementary question. I wish to ask if the same power will be vested in a Governor and Lieutenant-Governor, because it is in the Provincial Legislative Councils that the trouble is far more likely to arise.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: I quite understand that that will be so.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>The present rule runs thus&#x2014;
<quote>"The President may disallow any question without any reason therefor, other than that, in his opinion, it cannot be answered consistently with the public interests, and in such a case the question shall not be entered in the Proceedings of the Council."</quote>
I take it that the new rule will be virtually in accord with that?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>That is in the Viceroy's Council?</membercontribution></p>
<col>316</col>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: Yes.</p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>I think that will go on.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD HARRIS </member>: <membercontribution>May we understand that the same rule as to the power of disallowing supplementary questions will apply in the Provincial, Councils?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>I suppose so.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member>: <membercontribution>It is very important that we should be quite clear on the point of supplementary questions. I understood the noble Viscount to say that no discussion would be allowed in respect of any answer that might be delivered by an official to a question, but that the maximum power conceded to the interrogator would be that he might supplement his first question by a second, or possibly even a third, but that the supplementary question or questions might only be on questions of fact, and that whether they were on questions of fact or otherwise it would be within the power of the President to disallow them in the public interest, if he so desired. Is that a correct version of what the noble Viscount said?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: Yes.</p>
<p>Clause 5 agreed to.</p>
<p>Clause 6:</p>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0183"/>
<col>317</col>
<p>*<member>LORD AMPTHILL</member> <membercontribution>moved to amend this clause, which ran&#x2014;
<quote>"The Governor-General in Council shall, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State in Council, make regulations as to the conditions under which and manner in which persons resident in India may be nominated or elected as members of the Legislative Councils of the Governor-General, Governors, and Lieutenant-Governors, and as to the qualifications for being, and for being nominated or elected, a member of any such council and as to any other matter for which regulations are authorised to be made under this Act, and also as to the manner in which those regulations are to be carried into effect,"</quote>
by inserting after the words "a member of any such Council," the words&#x2014;
<quote>"including the conditions under which and the manner in which persons otherwise qualified under the regulations shall be disqualified for being, and being nominated or elected a member of any such council."</quote>
The addition of these words might seem, at first sight, superfluous or mere tautology, but he thought he could show that that was not the case. He was well aware that qualifications necessarily connoted disqualifications. If they declared that certain persons were qualified, they <i>ipso facto</i> excluded all others who were not so qualified and thus set up disqualifications; but he thought it was very important to emphasise the fact that there were to be positive disqualifications from being elected a member of one of the Legislative Councils. The noble Viscount had enumerated certain disqualifications of a very obvious and inevitable kind; but in regard to sedition mongers and persons who had been associated with anarchism in India the Secretary of State hesitated and refused to commit himself to a definite conclusion. The noble Viscount had said that to exclude definitely persons who had been engaged in political agitation of this kind would leave a ragged edge. His (Lord Ampthill's) view was that if they left a loophole for the election of any such persons to these Councils they would be creating a ragged edge and preventing the smooth perfection of the whole scheme. An idea was widely current in India that the surest road to official advancement or honorary distinction was abuse of the Government. We were responsible for the existence of that notion, and he thought that now was the opportunity of removing so mischievous an impression. The idea was due to a variety of causes. In the first place, it was due to the general scheme of education imposed upon the people of
<col>318</col>
India. Universities had been set up, and there had been chosen as a subject for the contemplation of undisciplined bands of young men in India the constitutional history of England. That history was generally a history of men who had been on the worst possible terms with the Government of the day. Students in India had not those moderating influences at hand which acted upon students in this country, and if they were brought up on the poetry of Milton, the history of Macaulay, the rhetoric of Burke, and the philosophy of Mill, we had only ourselves to thank if they turned that inaccurate history, that misleading rhetoric, and that entirely&#x2014;to the East&#x2014;inappropriate philosophy against ourselves. That system of education had undoubtedly produced the idea that agitation against the Government and abuse of constituted authority was the best road to prominence and distinction; and&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CREWE </member><membercontribution>: I venture to think the noble Lord is travelling some way from his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD AMPTHILL</member> <membercontribution>said he was sorry the Leader of the House should inflict that rebuke upon him, but what he was trying to prove was that it was necessary to show that political agitation was not the road to advancement. That idea existed, and it was necessary to show that it was incorrect. The existence of the idea was also due to the constant example afforded by party politics in this country and to the mistaken generosity of the Government in India, which was inclined to apply English notions of political license to the different conditions of the East. On this account it was desirable to lay down marked disqualifications as well as the negative disqualifications which resulted from the existence of qualifications. The addition of the words in his Amendment did not in the slightest degree alter or affect the sense of the clause. They merely emphasised that which they knew it was the intention of the noble Viscount and of the Government of India to carry out.<lb/>
Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 4, line 1, after the word 'council' to insert the words 'including the conditions under which and the manner in which persons otherwise qualified under the regulations shall be disqualified for being, and being nominated or elected a member of any such council.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Ampthill.</i>)</quote></membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0184"/>
<col>319</col>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>I cannot think that anything would be gained by the addition of the proposed words; and may I say that I did not see, any more than the noble Earl behind me, the relevance of the noble Lord's references to the rhetoric of Burke, the poetry of Milton, and the philosophy of Mill. This is a matter of regulation. It is one of those regulations upon which, as I told the House at the beginning of our proceedings to-day, our minds are not made up. But I should not easily come to the conclusion&#x2014;I say this frankly and in advance&#x2014;that the fact of a man having one day or another taken a mischievous part in a political agitation, when he was young, perhaps, should act as a disqualification for ever for his sitting in a Legislative Council. I shall be very hard to convince upon it, but it is under discussion and we shall see.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot help feeling some doubt whether the categories of disqualification which the noble Viscount gave to the House earlier in the evening will really prove to be a sufficient way of achieving the object we all have in view&#x2014;namely, the exclusion from these Executive Councils of persons who really will not only add nothing to their efficiency but whose presence upon them will amount to something very like a scandal in the eyes of the people in India. I notice that at one point the disqualification extends very far indeed. A person, the noble Viscount told us, who has been dismissed from the service of the public is to be disqualified. I can quite conceive that a man may have got into a scrape early in life and lost his place in the Service, and subsequently, by many long years of good and honest work, retrieved his reputation: such a man might make a very useful member of Council. On the other hand, when the noble Viscount tells us that in his view it is extremely doubtful whether a person who has been deported under the Regulation of 1818 for being implicated in seditious practices should not be qualified for a place on a Council, I confess that there I part company from him. I greatly prefer the old system under which the elected members of Council were in the first place elected and then had their election confirmed by the head of the Government. That, I know, seems to the noble Viscount a very ridiculous arrangement, but I can assure him that it is one which has a very considerable
<col>320</col>
significance, because in the eyes of the public in India there is all the difference in the world between a member of Council who owes his place in Council simply to the fact that he has been elected by what the noble Viscount describes in the introduction to this Bill as the popular vote&#x2014;there is all the difference in the world between a man who comes in with the popular vote behind him and nothing else, and the man who comes into Council having been elected by his neighbours or fellow countrymen but whose election has been sanctioned and approved by the Government. This arrangement enabled the Government with due discrimination, to exclude improper people from the Councils; I am afraid on the other hand that no scheme of categories, however elaborate, will be sufficient to prevent from time to time the preferment of men with very questionable antecedents, men whose admission to membership of the Legislative Councils will be looked upon with wondering eyes by many people in India, and will be very far, indeed, from conducing to the efficient conduct of the legislative business of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>If I thought there was going to be a great return of these extreme and obnoxious characters I would have no more to do with the Bill. It is because I do not anticipate that that I am making these proposals. I submit to the noble Marquess that to ask the Government of India to frame categories of exclusion is a very delicate and difficult thing. I would far rather trust to the power of the Councils in the matter. Not so many years ago a member was returned to the House of Commons for an Irish constituency, and the House declared that he could not sit as he had not purged himself of certain serious offences. In the same way I take it that these Councils, with an authoritative president, would be able to exclude a thoroughly obnoxious person.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member><membercontribution>: How could they keep him out?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: By by-laws, or other means. It might just as well be asked how did the House of Commons declare that the particular person to whom I have referred should not take his seat. I cannot imaging why this could
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0185"/>
<col>321</col>
not be left to the discretion of the Councils. I can assure the noble Marquess that innumerable difficulties will present themselves by drawing up classes and sub-classes.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>It is the noble Viscount who has been drawing up classes and sub-classes. My argument is that I do not like classes and sub-classes, and would very much prefer to go back to the old arrangement, under which, for sufficient cause, a particular individual elected by one of these constituencies could be refused by the head of the Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>But even there you have difficulties, for you are leaving it to the caprice possibly of the head of the Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>I would not leave it to the caprice of the head of the Government. I would allow the refusal of the head of the Government to be subject to the consideration of the Governor-General in Council, or, if the noble Viscount prefers it, of the Secretary of State.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CREWE </member>: <membercontribution>May I remind the Committee that the only question before us is the Amendment of the noble Lord opposite, by which a positive form is to be given to certain unnamed disqualifications rather than leaving it in a purely negative form. The discussion seems to me to have wandered very far indeed from that.<lb/>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<lb/>
Clause 6 agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD AMPTHILL</member> <membercontribution>moved to insert, after Clause 6, the following new clause&#x2014;
<quote>"Before any proclamation, rule, or regulation under this Act is made, the draft thereof shall be laid before each House of Parliament for a period of not less than sixty-five days during the session of Parliament, and if either House before the expiration of that period presents an Address to His Majesty against the draft or any part thereof, no further proceedings shall be taken thereon, but without prejudice to the making of any new draft, proclamation, rule, or regulation."</quote><lb/>
He said the clause embodied a suggestion he had ventured to make on the Second Reading. The noble Earl the Leader of the House said, at the conclusion of the debate on the Second Reading, that he
<col>322</col>
did not think the Secretary of State could accept this Amendment; he trusted that this was merely a cautious reservation of opinion and that the noble Viscount had meanwhile recognised that something of this kind was desirable. The object of the new clause was to reserve to Parliament the right of considering constitutional changes in the Government of India before they were actually carried out. The Bill had been described as a blank cheque; and, in fact, supposing Clause 3 were reinstated, it would enable the Governor-General in Council, subject merely to the approval of the Secretary of State, to alter the form of I government in any of the Provinces under Lieutenant-Governors&#x2014;a great constitutional change. But, as it stood at present, the Bill enabled the Secretary of State, at his own discretion, to make changes of hardly less magnitude in the constitution of the Presidency Governments. Nobody could hold more strongly than he did the opinion that Parliament should not attempt to direct the details of administration in India, and he agreed most cordially with the principle by which the effective part of this Bill had been left to regulations in order to give the necessary elasticity and discretion to the men on the spot. But when it came to an actual constitutional change it was another matter, and Parliament should not part with the right of withholding final approval. It was for this reason that he thought any proclamation which might be made under Clause 3, supposing that clause to be eventually restored, and any rules and regulations made under Clauses 5 and 6, should be laid before Parliament in the manner suggested by ample custom and precedent. The noble Earl the Leader of the House, in his remarks on this subject, had suggested that Parliament should cut off its nose in order to spite its face; in other words, he would deprive the House of Commons of an undeniable right and an important duty in order that that right might not be exercised or that duty performed by their Lordships' House. He could not believe that the Secretary of State for India or His Majesty's Ministers as a whole would take this view, which he ventured to think was not only unsound from the point of view of Imperial statecraft but also obviously inconsistent with the principles of the democratic government of the Empire. He did not think there need be any fear of unnecessary or capricious use of this power by Parliament. Indian
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0186"/>
<col>323</col>
questions were not, and never had been, made a subject of party politics in their Lordships' House; and there was the further consideration, put forward by Lord Crewe himself, that a great number of the men most competent to deal with these questions were members of that House. In each session of Parliament there were between fifty and 100 sets of rules and regulations laid for the appointed number of days in this manner on the Table, but during the past ten years only ten addresses to the Crown had been moved, and of that number only two were moved in their Lordships' House. As regarded the length of time which he suggested, sixty-five days, there were two considerations&#x2014;first, the great distance of India and the time that communication took; and, secondly, the immense importance of the questions as compared with that of other questions treated in this way. He could also furnish ample precedent for a period as long as sixty-five days, and cited various Statutes with this object. His Amendment was designed solely to safeguard the elemental rights and responsibilities of the Imperial Parliament, and it was not likely, having regard to the traditional attitude of Parliament and the usage of both Houses, that any administrative inconvenience would result from the adoption of this course.<lb/>
Amendment moved:&#x2014;
<quote>"To insert, after Clause 6, the following new clause:</quote>
<quote>7. Before any proclamation, rule, or regulation under this Act is made, the draft thereof shall be laid before each House of Parliament for a period of not less than sixty-five days during the Session of Parliament, and if either House before the expiration of that period presents an Address to His Majesty against the draft or any part thereof, no further proceedings shall be taken thereon, but without prejudice to the making of any new draft, proclamation, rule, or regulation."&#x2014;(<i>Lord Ampthill </i>)</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member>: <membercontribution>I rise not entirely to support the noble Lord but to deliver a few observations on the subject of his Amendment. The noble Viscount the Secretary of State was kind enough to tell us earlier what would probably be the course of events followed with regard to filling up the blank cheque and making it operative in India. As I understand, there will be a series of regulations and a number of rules and proclamations, and the question is whether it is reasonable for us to ask the noble Viscount to let us see any of those regulations, rules, and
<col>324</col>
proclamations before they come into operation.<lb/>
In his speech to-night the noble Viscount divided them into three or four different classes. He told us, first, that a number of rules had already been settled, and that these rules related in particular to the numbers of the Councils, the quorum to be present, and the tenure of office; secondly, that there was a class of rules which had been settled in principle only but not in detail, and that these related to the discussion, for instance, of the Budget both at Calcutta and in the Provincial Councils; thirdly, that a discussion on general questions was proceeding between the Secretary of State and the Government of India; and, fourthly&#x2014;and this is the point to which I invite the attention of your Lordships&#x2014;that there was a large range of subjects not yet settled. We quite understand that. These are vital questions that it may well take time to decide.<lb/>
What are included in this range of subjects on which the Government of India and the noble Viscount have not yet made up their minds? First, there is the question of disqualifications. Is it possible to suggest, I will not say a compromise upon this matter, but a combination of the features of the system suggested by the Secretary of State and of that advocated by the noble Marquess behind me? The Secretary of State has sketched a category of very necessary and very obvious disqualifications, and I am sure we can trust the Government of India and the Secretary of State in combination to draw up a satisfactory category of this nature. But is there not very great force in the argument that fell from the noble Marquess&#x2014;the argument that it is quite conceivable that persons may be returned to these Councils in the future who may be, not merely political agitators in the ordinary sense, but people who have dabbled in sedition even if they have not been actually convicted of crime? To this the noble Viscount replies that he has every confidence that that class of man will not be returned. I wish in all sincerity that I could share that confidence. I feel tolerably certain that as time advances places on these Councils will be the recognised reward of political agitation. It is sometimes a passport to the House of Commons for a man to have been engaged in a conflict with the Government and even to have been a guest
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0187"/>
<col>325</col>
of His Majesty in prison. So also you may find in India that persons quite unfitted to sit upon these Councils will be returned. I admit the difficulty of framing a net which will catch persons of that sort.<lb/>
During the whole time, however, that I was in India I never heard any objection to the present rule giving the Governor-General power to decline to nominate any person who had been recommended for nomination; and so well did that rule act as a safeguard that I cannot recollect its being put into operation. I remember that there was once a possibility of a gentleman being returned to Council who would not have been accepted. Steps were taken to ascertain from me in advance what would be the attitude of the Governor-General in the matter, and as soon as it was known that the appointment was one which the Governor-General could not accept the nomination was not proceeded with. I submit as a suggestion to the noble Viscount whether it is not worth considering that side by side with the system of exclusions which he has outlined some such power should be reserved to the Governor-General as has hitherto been enjoyed by him without the slightest dispute or difficulty.<lb/>
Among the other subjects still unsettled is the entire system of nomination and election in the future. That is one of the most stupendous changes to be introduced by this Bill. As we all know, there is some apparent difference of opinion between the Secretary of State and the Government of India on the matter. The Government of India are opposed to any system of indirect election through colleges. At any rate, in their despatch they recommended a system of election through existing bodies or associations, supplemented, in cases where these bodies did not exist, by nomination by Government, but the noble Viscount would not have anything to say to that, and proposed a system of election by electoral colleges. He has not told us what has been the answer of the Government of India to his suggestions. I do not desire to press him upon that point to-night, but I submit that inasmuch as so many of the vital questions of this Bill, that which really fills in the framework of what we have been discussing to-night, have still to be settled by these rules and regulations, it is not unreasonable to ask that Parliament should have some opportunity, I do not say of delaying, but, at any rate, of considering these matters.</membercontribution></p>
<col>326</col>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: Considering them after or before the rules are framed?</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member>: <membercontribution>I will explain. The noble Lord behind me (Lord Ampthill) proposes that before any proclamation, rule, or regulation is made the draft thereof shall be laid before each House of Parliament for a period of not less than sixty-five days during the session of Parliament, and then he suggests the contingency of either House presenting an Address to His Majesty. From what fell from the noble Viscount the other day, I think that is a course which he would not favour. I hold myself that it is in excess of the necessities of the case. All that we want is an opportunity of seeing these rules, regulations, and proclamations, and an opportunity in a perfectly friendly manner of discussing them across the floor of the House with the Secretary of State. The noble Viscount might, therefore, consider the question of agreeing to the Amendment down to the words "session of Parliament," substituting, if he wishes, forty for sixty-five days. The suggestion I submit is that the noble Viscount may, perhaps, be prepared to agree to the proposal that before any proclamation, rule, or regulation under this Bill is made&#x2014;I mean before it comes into effect&#x2014;the draft thereof shall be laid before each House or Parliament for a period of not less than forty days during the session of Parliament. The Secretary of State may ask what is the object of this. Our object would be to have an opportunity of discussion upon the matter, and, if thought desirable, of making representations to the Secretary of State. There is a great difference between what was done in 1892 and what is now proposed. You are now creating what is almost representative government, and it is not unreasonable to ask that when these great and vital changes are being made this House should have some idea of what is going on. I hope the Secretary of State will be able to meet us in the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord who has just spoken used very different language indeed in the proceedings on the Bill of 1892. He then said what I take to be the exact opposite of what he is now saying. In moving the Second Reading of the Bill I urged upon the House the advice given by Mr. Glad-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0188"/>
<col>327</col>
stone in regard to an Amendment moved to the Indian Councils Bill of 1892. The noble Lord and I were then both in another place. A member on my side of the House and in the minority moved an Amendment. Mr. Gladstone rose and urged his supporter not to divide on the Amendment, and in doing so used this language&#x2014;
<quote>"The best course we could take would be to commend to the authorities of India what is a clear indication of the principles on which we desire them to proceed. It is not our business to devise machinery for the purpose of Indian Government."</quote><lb/>
The noble Lord (then Mr. Curzon) said&#x2014;
<quote>"Speaking on behalf of the, Government, I entirely endorse that part of Mr. Gladstone's speech in which he said that it is not for this House to determine a plan or devise the machinery of an Indian Councils Bill, but that the initiative must be made by the Government of India."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member>: Hear, hear.</p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord will, I know, draw a distinction between initiative and later proceedings. The point is the same. The point in 1892 was that it was only the Government of India who really could be satisfied as to the best technical details of machinery. On this occasion what is proposed is that before the Act comes into operation the two Houses of Parliament are to discuss and decide whether the regulations ought or ought not to come into effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member>: <membercontribution>I did not say that. I suggested that the Amendment should end at the words "session of Parliament."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member><membercontribution>: I was, perhaps, wrong in bringing my noble friend Lord Curzon into that. But the noble Lord who moved the Amendment asks that before any proclamation, rule, or regulation is made the draft shall be laid before each House of Parliament for sixty-five days&#x2014;Heaven only knows why the period of sixty-five days is taken&#x2014;and that if either House before the expiration of that period presents an Address to His Majesty against the draft or any part thereof no further proceedings shall be taken thereon. The rules being made and the whole scheme being before Parliament for sixty-five days, suppose the House of Commons
<col>328</col>
were to pick holes in it and come to a conclusion dissenting from some of the rules, while the House of Lords approved the rules? What a situation for the Government of India! My view is to leave to the Government of India as much elastic power as possible, so that they may, should circumstances seem to demand it, alter any rule. But this provision would prevent such alteration, however necessary the alteration might prove to be. Nothing could be more hideously inconvenient for effective government in India. It would be inconvenient and unconstitutional. On the question of its being unconstitutional, I will quote the language&#x2014;for we are really now on a great issue&#x2014;used by the late Lord Salisbury in June, 1893. Lord Salisbury said&#x2014;
<quote>"I apprehend that the constitutional doctrine is this. The House of Commons has the absolute right of selecting a group of statesmen from whom an Executive is chosen, and it has the absolute right of dismissing those statesmen from office when it ceases to trust them; but it has not the right&#x2014;</quote>
this is what the noble Lord opposite is asking the House to assert&#x2014;
<quote>"to take the management and conduct of the Executive into its own. hands. The Executive Government so selected has, according to our constitution, the right and the duty of discharging the office of Executive and the prerogatives of the Crown."</quote><lb/>
I should say that that doctrine was thoroughly sound. But under the noble Lord's Amendment the Government of India would be placed at the mercy of rival votes in the two Houses of Parliament. My view is that the regulations should come into force as soon as they have gone through the framing by the Government of India and received the approval of the Secretary of State, who is the representative of Parliament. I am quite willing to insert a new clause after Clause 6 in the following terms&#x2014;
<quote>"All proclamations, regulations, and rules made under this Act shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament as soon as may be after they are made."</quote>
There is no intention there to suspend their operation for one minute. The moment they have been passed in India and approved by the Secretary of State in Whitehall their operation ought to begin.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> <membercontribution>did not think it would be difficult to show that the language of Lord Salisbury applied to a very different set of facts. One of the expressions used by
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0189"/>
<col>329</col>
Lord Salisbury was the "management of the Executive." He did not think any question of that kind arose in the suggestion of Lord Curzon. If the constitution were founded on the principle that a group of gentlemen were chosen to carry out the administrative work of government and that having been chosen their acts were not to be interfered with or refuted by Parliament, how was it that in one out of every ten Acts at least there was included the very clause which Lord Ampthill had moved, with the object of giving Parliament an opportunity of considering before an order which had been drawn took effect, whether it should be brought into action? If the noble Viscount had said that India was on a different plane, and that Indian Government was of so peculiar a character that Parliament having laid down certain principles should leave the whole responsibility in the hands of the Secretary of State, that, he thought, would have been a more tenable ground on which to found himself. The noble Viscount could not ride two horses at once. He could not tell them that the Bill was the opening of a fresh chapter in Indian history, and at the same time ask them to be governed by exactly the same rules and regulations as affected the Act of 1892, which was of a very much more limited scope. Personally, he could not see that the amended clause as proposed by Lord Curzon would in any way derogate from the authority of the Secretary of State. The noble Viscount had asked for very wide powers indeed under the Bill. He bad pressed the actual wording of the Bill to an extent which, having sat opposite to him for a great many years in the House of Commons, he had never known him to attempt in that House. The noble Viscount had now asked their Lordships to pass clause after clause without a single amendment and without a word of difference, and the more the noble Viscount insisted upon that the more he thought he was entitled to say that what was being asked for was a blank cheque as to the manner of filling in which Parliament was given no information. In the circumstances, although he hoped Lord Ampthill would not press the latter part of his Amendment to which so much exception had been taken, he trusted that the laying of the draft proclamations, rules, and regulations on the Table of Parliament would not be made absolutely the dead letter which it would be if the Secretary of State's suggested new clause were adopted.</membercontribution></p>
<col>330</col>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CREWE </member>: <membercontribution>There are two entirely separate propositions before the Committee. There is, first, the Amendment of the noble Lord opposite, Lord Ampthill, which does not, I gather, find complete favour with the Front Bench on his side of the House. I therefore will not attempt to deal at all fully with it. I said something about it on the occasion of the former debate. It does seem to me to be a most astonishing proposition. I can recall nothing like it in my Parliamentary experience. To suggest that any rule and regulation made by the Government of India under this Bill should be not merely the subject of full discussion in either House of Parliament, but that it should be within the absolute competence of noble Lords opposite, with their permanent majority, practically to frame any rule or regulation in any way they please, does seem to me the most amazing proposition I have ever heard put forward in your Lordships' House. On the other hand, there is the proposition of the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, which, I understand, is also favoured by the noble Viscount who spoke last; but, that, of course, is a far more moderate proposition, because, although it gives great scope for discussion in both Houses, it gives no power of alteration to either. The proposed rules and regulations may be picked to pieces dialectically to any extent, but no power of alteration is given to either House of Parliament. Before, however, the rule or regulation is made, it must lie on the Table for sixty-five or forty days during the session of Parliament. Is that a practical proposal? Some perfectly trivial rule is, we will assume, proposed in India in the early autumn, say in the month of August. It remains suspended until Parliament meets&#x2014;and we do not, I hope, always meet in the autumn. It therefore remains suspended perhaps until the middle of February. It then has to lie on the Table, and cannot come into operation until after Easter. Is that a reasonable position in which to place the Government of India? I cannot conceive any body who would less like being placed in that position than Lord Curzon. If it had been done when he was Viceroy I think he would have regarded it as an unwarranted piece of interference, I do not say with the prerogatives of the Government of India, but with the current course of their business, that this matter should be discussed in this way in Parliament. Under the clause as proposed by
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0190"/>
<col>331</col>
my noble friend the Secretary of State the rules would come into operation, but it would be open to anybody in either House to discuss them and the power of amendment would be always there. If in your Lordships' House or in the other House a case was made out which convinced the Secretary of State and the Indian Government that a mistake had been made, any regulation could afterwards be modified or withdrawn. I should have thought that quite as great a safeguard as we possess in most matters of legislation. But I am reminded of another argument. Why is this state of things to apply only to India? Are your Lordships going to apply this sort of meticulous supervision to the Crown Colonies? In what respect does the case of Ceylon, or the West Indies, or Nigeria differ from India in these matters? And if every regulation which may be presumed to possess anything of a constitutional character is to be submitted to that spirit of preliminary observation in your Lordships' House, I can only say that the government of those parts of the Empire will be made as difficult as I think Indian government will be made if the noble Lord's Amendment is accepted.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>I will not attempt to examine the analogy which the noble Earl has presented to the Committee. I distrust analogies generally, and particularly the series of analogies made use of in the discussion of this Bill. I cannot admit any analogy drawn from our great self-governing Colonies as a precedent which necessarily applies to the Government of India, I was indeed struck by the rather reckless use of such an analogy by the noble Earl the Leader of the House the other evening when he told us that he could not conceive any Indian Lieutenant-Governor having a difficulty with his Legislative Council, because, he said, a Colonial Governor always was able, or ought to be able, to manipulate his Council. Therefore I will not pay much attention to that analogy. The noble Earl was a little severe on my noble friend Lord Ampthill. What my noble friend was evidently anxious to obtain from His Majesty's Government was some assurance that these most important matters should not be entirely withdrawn from the cognisance of Parliament. After all, we are dealing, not with small and insignificant points of detail, but with capital points of
<col>332</col>
first-rate importance&#x2014;capital points with which the Secretary of State tells us he is not yet able to deal because some of them still require further examination and consideration, and with which, therefore, he intends to deal, not within the compass of the Bill, but by regulations and proclamations to be hereafter issued. We wish to have an early and sufficient opportunity of considering and offering observations upon those regulations and proclamations, and I do not think that a very unreasonable request. We are constantly stipulating that schemes issued under Acts of Parliament are to come up for consideration by the Houses of Parliament. We did it only last night in the case of a Bill creating new bishoprics. We said, not only that the schemes were to be laid on the Table, but that they were not to be effectual until Parliament had sanctioned them, or until they had lain a certain number of days without a resolution being carried against them. One word only with regard to the alleged precedent of 1892. Noble Lords opposite must know that the Act of 1892 was child's play compared to the Bill now upon the Table. But that is not all. When the discussion took place in the other House of Parliament to which the noble Viscount referred, what was being discussed was not an Amendment such as that proposed by my noble friend, still more not an Amendment such as was suggested by my noble friend Lord Curzon, but an Amendment which was simply to the effect that the rules and regulations were to obtain the "sanction" of both Houses of Parliament. We have none of us asked for that. Even my noble friend Lord Ampthill did not ask for that. Lord Curzon asks for a great deal less. He only asks that the rules before they take effect should lay for a certain number of days on the Table. The noble Viscount is, I think, anxious to meet us, perhaps not quite as much as we should wish, but to the extent of giving us as early as possible adequate opportunity of offering our criticism&#x2014;we ask for nothing more&#x2014;upon any of the more important regulations which may be issued under this Bill. What I venture to suggest to the Committee and to the noble Viscount is this, that my noble friend should not press his Amendment, even in the modified form, to-night, but that we should consider on Report the form of words which the noble Viscount read out to-us just now. That seams to me to be for the moment a reasonable solution of the difficulty.</membercontribution></p>

<title>INDIAN COUNCILS BILL [H.L.]</title>
<p>Amendments reported (according to order).</p>
<p><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have now to move an Amendment. It is, in effect, the full restitution of what was the third clause, which your Lordships rejected on Thursday last. I hope your Lordships will believe that in moving what is in effect the restoration of this third clause I am not animated by any particular pertinacity. Of course, I regretted the rejection of the clause, and I regret it still, and I have a particular reason for regretting it, because I understand from authorities in India that the effect there is unfortunate&#x2014;that is the word&#x2014;that the effect of the rejection of this clause is unfortunate, very unfortunate. I am sure every noble Lord in the House is keenly alive to the cardinal importance of the way in which the people of India&#x2014;all the various communities which make up what we call India&#x2014;watch what we are doing at home here in the India Office and in Parliament, and it is above all things desirable that we should allow no impression to get abroad in India that we are negligent in looking at the real effect of what we are doing. Feeling this, and observing that both the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition and the noble Lord opposite, Lord Curzon, were careful to say&#x2014;and Lord Curzon has repeated it in a letter which appeared in <i>The Times</i> on Saturday&#x2014;that they had no rooted objection to the principle of the clause, that their resistance to the clause was not meant to be of a permanent kind, and the noble Marquess even suggested that we should by-and-bye, in the course of the present session I think he said, bring up that clause in the form of a Parliamentary Bill, I telegraphed to the Government of India and to the Viceroy as to their views. I thought it was just to Parliament and to your Lordships to find out what their view was, because, as I understood, the objection of the noble Lords opposite, of Lord Lansdowne and Lord Curzon, and of my noble friend on the Cross Bench, was founded upon this, that the opinion of the Government and authorities in India had not been effectively ascertained.<lb/>
I have now received a reply to that inquiry of mine. With your Lordships' permission I am not going to argue as to the merits
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0193"/>
<col>337</col>
of the clause. That was argued adequately and sufficiently in Committee. I am not going to say a word about the arguments for or against the clause. I have to communicate to your Lordships the views of the Government of India. These are not the exact words of the telegram, for reasons which the noble Marquess will understand, but it is as good as a textual reproduction.<lb/>
"The Government of India in 1905"&#x2014;that was before the present Government took office&#x2014;"discussed the question of Provincial Executive Councils. At that time their opinion was adverse to the introduction of councils in provinces administered by Lieutenant-Governors; but since then conditions have changed and they are still changing. Our opinion now is that the arguments then used against government by Executive Councils are not any longer of the same force. When the constitutional changes now proposed"&#x2014;in the Bill which your Lordships read the second time a few days ago&#x2014;"come into operation the situation will be different, and that is our reason for modifying our views. There must then, under the new conditions, be a large increase in the work of Lieutenant-Governors, and we anticipate it will be necessary to give them some kind of further assistance, not only in respect of the actual work of these Legislative Councils, but also with a view to relieving the Lieutenant-Governors of minor executive matters. We refer to this point in paragraph 76 of our Despatch of October 1, as it came under consideration when the general question of reform was being examined. There are already very great calls made upon the time of Lieutenant-Governors in the matter of tours, receptions, and so forth, and there can be no doubt that indirectly the enlargement of Legislative Councils proposed in this Bill will multiply the occasions requiring the Lieutenant-Governors to deal with questions of public importance. We consider that in all probability the best means of giving the required assistance will prove to be the creation of Executive Councils. The members of such a Council would be responsible Ministers who could speak in the matter of government in a way that no secretaries or other officials could do. For the reason we have given we are in favour of having the power proposed by Clause 3 in the Bill, and we should regret if the opportunity which now presents itself of obtaining that power for us were to be lost. We are
<col>338</col>
altogether opposed to the proposal which we understand has been put forward to create forthwith Councils in all the larger Provinces, and we desire to make that point clear. We see no present necessity for a general change of this character, and it should be made, if it is to be made, only in the light of experience. That Clause 3 would give us. We should exercise the power given under Clause 3 gradually and cautiously and only after the fullest consideration of the effect of the new conditions in each Province."<lb/>
Now, my Lords, that is the position taken up by the Government of India. That is the request, if I may so call it, that they address to Parliament&#x2014;namely, that we should take this opportunity of giving them those powers, of caution in exercising which they give an assurance that I know every noble Lord in the House will thoroughly trust. I submit that it would be prudent for this House not to postpone this. The noble Marquess opposite says, Postpone it. Why? We all know what happens in a session of Parliament. Supposing towards July the noble Marquess will say, Now the time has come when we could give the Indian Government the powers which we refused them in March. I cannot think that is a businesslike or politic course. I cannot think on what substantial grounds he will resist my proposal to reinsert the clause giving the Government of India powers which the noble Marquess does not deny might, with a little more experience, be useful, and which, as I say, they undertake to use cautiously and carefully.</membercontribution></p>

<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have in the first place to tender my thanks to the noble Viscount opposite for his courtesy in having allowed me during the course of the morning to see the important telegram, the substance of which he has just communicated to the House. Let me say at once that the fact of that telegram having reached the noble Viscount affords sufficient explanation for the otherwise extremely unusual course which he has taken in regard to this Amendment. The clause which the noble Viscount desires to restore to the Bill was thrown out the other evening. I think only eighteen of the supporters of His Majesty's Government were found to go into the Lobby in support of it, and naturally the House concluded that, so far as it was concerned, the clause was disposed of. I cannot recall any instance in which a clause taken out of a Bill in the Committee stage has been reinstated within a very few days except by the general concurrence of both sides of the House. The question is, has the noble Viscount, in the remarks he has addressed to us, made out a case for that general concurrence?<lb/>
May I be allowed to summarise what I conceive to be the contents of the telegram which the noble Viscount has read to the House? In the first place, the Government of India admit very frankly that they have entirely changed their minds on this subject since the year 1903. I make no complaint about that; there may be sufficient reason for that change of mind. But they go on to state the reasons which have induced them so to change their mind. They point, in the first place, to the probability of these new and enlarged Legislative Councils imposing a very heavy strain upon Lieutenant-Governors of Provinces. They call attention to the fact that there will be ample discussions on the Provincial Budgets, that we may expect criticism of all branches of administration, and they also touch on the possibility of attack in the guise of supplementary
<col>340</col>
questions. And they suggest that these additional burdens which are to be thrown upon the heads of Provincial Governments can be best alleviated by placing alongside them Executive Councils somewhat as we know them in the two Presidencies of Madras and Bombay. But, in spite of the weight which the Government of India attach to these considerations, they make it perfectly clear that they have no idea whatever of making a general change in this direction at present. That is, I understand, categorically stated. They say, and say with great propriety, that further experience is desirable before such a change is resorted to, and they desire that the effect of the new councils which we are about to create in the different Provinces should receive full consideration. To that they add, unless I am mistaken, a very important observation to the effect that they have not yet been able to make full inquiries into the needs of the different Provinces, and they limit themselves to this substantive proposal, that, for the present, an Executive Council should be created in the Province of Bengal, and in the Province of Bengal alone, after the Legislative Council has been called into existence.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member>: <membercontribution>Will the noble Marquess permit me to interrupt him? I think he misplaces the point of the argument. I think the Government of India are dealing with the proposal that they should set up these Councils in all the larger Provinces, and it is to guard themselves against that supposition that they express the intentions the noble Marquess is dealing with.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member>: <membercontribution>I do not think my interpretation differs materially from the noble Viscount's. They limit their proposal to the Province of Bengal, where they think an Executive Council might be created after the Legislative Council has come into existence. I desire to call the attention of the House to what seem to be three very noteworthy admissions contained in the telegram which the noble Viscount has communicated to the House. In the first place, I think your Lordships should observe that the argument founded upon the necessity of alleviating the burden of the Lieutenant-Governors rests entirely upon anticipation. It is not a case of anything the Government of India know, but it is because they antici-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0195"/>
<col>341</col>
pate certain results from the enlargement of the Legislative Councils that the addition of this clause to the Bill is suggested. And it is remarkable&#x2014;and I really think I am entitled to dwell on the fact&#x2014;that the anticipation of the Government of India on this point is very much the same as the anticipation which was made on this side of the House by several noble Lords who spoke on the occasion of the Second Reading. They anticipate, just as we anticipate, that the result of this legislation will be to set up in the different provinces little Parliaments on the Western model&#x2014;Parliaments which will create an immense amount of new business which will weigh down the heads of the local Governments and their secretaries, and, therefore, necessitate the creation of what been described as responsible Ministers, who are to bear a part of their burden.<lb/>
The second admission which I find in the telegram is this. It is frankly stated that the Government of India have not yet been able to make full inquiry into the circumstances of the different Provinces. That was our main argument the other evening&#x2014;that you were going to do this in anticipation of the full inquiry that we thought necessary into the needs of the different Provinces, and I trust the House will not forget that, in the often-quoted Despatch of October last year, the Government of India dwelt emphatically on the fact that it was, I think the expression was, "even premature" to discuss the expediency of making this great change until we had had, in the first place, experience of the new condition of things, and, in the next place, full consultation with the provincial authorities. What has happened? We have, obviously, had no experience of the new order of things, and we now learn that such consultation as there was has been limited to a purely domestic consultation between the Secretary of State and the Governor-General of India in Council, the latter of whom, we have been told again to-night, are very recent converts on this particular subject.<lb/>
I come to the third admission which I discover in the telegram. It is that there is no question whatever of introducing these new Executive Councils except in the one Province of Bengal, and after the new Legislative Council his been created. I venture to say that the telegram, so far as it proves any thing, proves, not the case
<col>342</col>
of the noble Viscount, but the case of those who argued against him on this side of the House. The need for these Councils has not yet arisen; consultation has not yet taken place, and there is only one Province out of the whole of India in which the Government of India are prepared to apply the clause should it pass into law.<lb/>
What I venture to say to the House is this. What good purpose shall we serve by announcing to the whole of the Provinces of India that they may get Executive Councils if the Government of India and the Secretary of State shall be so minded, when we know perfectly well that neither the Government of India nor the Secretary of State has any intention whatever of giving Executive Councils except in this one Province? Is it not perfectly certain that the result will be agitation of a very inconvenient kind? I saw in the paper this morning that there has already been a large meeting in Eastern Bengal in the important town of Dacca, where a distinguished concourse were unanimous, apparently, in proclaiming that the time had come when they should have an Executive Council. And so it will be in all the other Provinces if we put this clause on the Statute-book.<lb/>
Only one word more. I must say I resent the argument that a clause of this kind may be heedlessly admitted into a Bill of this importance because it is merely an enabling clause. The argument in favour of an enabling clause is that, supposing hereafter there is a desire to introduce this change, there would, unless we have taken these powers, have to be fresh legislation with all its troubles and uncertainties. I say we have no right, in order to save ourselves the trouble of further legislation, to put into a Bill of this kind, prematurely, a clause of this immense importance. Therefore, I venture, with all deference, to say that, in my view, the announcement made by the noble Viscount really does not alter the case as it presented itself to us the other evening, and that we should do well, and that common prudence, indeed, requires us for the moment at any rate, not to consent to the addition of a clause which is opposed by a great deal of very high authority, and in support of which the noble Viscount has not been able to produce arguments of a kind sufficient to modify the decision we came to the other evening.</membercontribution></p>

<p>*<member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I do not propose to enter into discussion of the merits of this question. My noble friend behind me refrained from entering into the general arguments, and I, of course, am far less competent to do so. But I must express the deep regret which we on this side of the House feel that the noble Marquess, on behalf of those who act with him, has arrived at the conclusion that this clause ought not to be reinserted. We have heard a great deal at different times about the opinion of the man on the spot, but, for this purpose, I am afraid that this House is the spot and that nothing that can be said by the Government of India will, as we gather from the noble Marquess, alter the opinion on this subject of noble Lords opposite. In these circumstances we are, of course, obliged to submit to the force majevre of the Benches opposite, and we shall not put your Lordships to the trouble of once more walking through the Lobbies on this subject. I confess that some of the concluding sentences of the noble Marquess' speech struck me as strange. He objects to this clause on the ground that it is an enabling clause, and the conclusion that we reach from that statement is that in this important matter no discretion ought to be left to the Government of India, and that every time the Government of India desires to exercise the powers conferred by this clause it is to come to your Lordships' House for leave. That seems to me a strange departure in the Government of India. I can recall nothing like it in my recollection, and I very much doubt if noble Lords who have been concerned with Indian Government can either. I should have thought that the desire to proceed cautiously expressed in the telegram which my noble friend read would have appealed to noble Lords opposite, and would have offered a fair reason for giving this power to the Supreme Indian Government. The noble Marquess said that, if given, it would lead to agitation all over India in each province where these powers are desired. Surely the Indian Government must be better judges of that even than the noble Marquess himself, with all his experience of India. The Indian Government are willing to take that responsibility; they desire to exercise these powers when it seems good to them, after an inquiry which in each case they can conduct at the time and in the manner that appears

best to them. I confess their demand seems to me to be thoroughly reasonable. But, as the noble Marquess has intimated the course that he and his friends propose to take, it is really of not much use to discuss the question further.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am not sure that the noble Earl has been altogether fair, either to the position taken up by the majority of noble Lords on this side of the House or to that taken up by the noble Marquess. I did not understand the noble Marquess to take the line as to the necessity or the possibility of future legislation which has been attributed to him by the noble Earl. What was the object that actuated the majority of noble Lords the other night in temporarily, at any rate, deleting this clause? We felt, in view of the expressed opinion of the Government of India as recently as October last, that it was not unreasonable to ask that there should be presented to this House the opinion not merely of the Government of India as at present constituted, but of all those classes of people whom this proposed reform will most immediately and directly affect. Now the noble Viscount says to us, "I have given you to-night the opinions of the men on the spot." With all submission, he has done nothing of the sort. What he has given to us is the opinion of the Government of India.<lb/>
I would not presume for one moment to throw in the face of the Government of India that they have changed their opinions since 1905. Their composition is entirely different, and even if it were not so they would be quite at liberty to change their views. But what we are concerned is to know what has occurred to change their opinions between October 1, 1908, the date of their Despatch, and March 9, 1909, the date on which we are discussing this matter in your Lordships' House. Surely the situation is exactly the same now as it was the other evening, with the exception that we have had the important telegram from the Government of India which the Secretary of State has read. I do not think that we here are so much concerned to ascertain the present judgment of the Government of India, although, of course, I am not wishing to minimise the significance to be attached to it. I think what we want to ascertain is the opinion of rulers of the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0197"/>
<col>345</col>
provinces to which these Councils are to be attached, and of the important classes of the community in those parts of India. We shall make no greater mistake in introducing this legislation than if we shape and mould it exclusively to meet the needs or the demands of one class in India. We have to consider all those great classes in the community&#x2014;the moderate, sensible, loyal&#x2014;very often rather speechless&#x2014;men who are the backbone and support of our administration in India. My own belief, from such knowledge as I have of those classes in India, is that in the bulk of the provinces to which we are referring they would be unanimously opposed to these proposals. Is it unreasonable to ask, therefore, that before we proceed further in the matter, we should have placed before us the views, if possible, of the Lieutenant-Governors; or if, as the noble Viscount said the other day it is rather an invidious thing to ask a Lieutenant-Governor to state his objections in public, should he feel objections, is it unreasonable to ask that some steps should be taken to ascertain what is the public opinion in the provinces concerned?<lb/>
The noble Earl who spoke last talked as if the noble Marquess was inviting the House permanently and finally to expunge this clause from the Bill and only to deal with the matter as necessity arose by special legislation at a later date. Is that the case? Is it not the fact that this Bill will go down to the other House of Parliament, and that after discussion there it will come back to this House? I am sure, speaking for myself and other noble Lords connected with India, nothing would please us more than if, in the interval, the noble Viscount was able to put before us a consensus of opinion sufficiently strong to induce us to give that assent to this clause of the Bill which we have so readily given to its main principles. One other point. The argument in the telegram which was read to us is an argument for Executive Councils for Lieutenant-Governors, on the ground of the great addition to their labours that is to be imposed by the new scheme of Legislative Councils adumbrated by the Secretary of State. Incidentally, I suppose I might say that that justifies a good deal of the criticisms passed by myself and other noble Lords in this House upon the scheme of enlarged Legislative Councils. But I pass that by. I put to your Lordships this question&#x2014;If the
<col>346</col>
argument is a valid argument, why is it to apply to Bengal alone? Is it not certain that, if your Lieutenant-Governor is to be so overwhelmed with his duties on these enlarged Legislative Councils, that he will have to spend hours of his time sitting in Council, making speeches, answering questions, and so on, and if for that reason he requires the executive assistance which the noble Viscount contemplates&#x2014;is it not certain that that argument applies equally to Eastern Bengal with Western Bengal, to the United Provinces with Bengal, and to the Punjab with the United Provinces? Even if it does not follow in logic, I venture to say that it will follow in practice. Already meetings have been held and an agitation raised in India on this subject. The noble Marquess alluded to the meeting held yesterday to press for a Council for Eastern Bengal. Once you give Executive Councils to the two Bengals you cannot withhold them from the United Provinces and the Punjab; and thus from this only half-considered beginning you will really be taking steps to revolutionise the government of India.<lb/>
All we say is before your Lordships take this step let us have some authority in its favour&#x2014;some authority in addition to that of the Government of India. Up to the present moment every Lieutenant-Governor, so far as we know, who has spoken has spoken against this change. Is it not possible for the noble Viscount to recruit some Lieutenant-Governor who can speak in its favour? But, putting on one side the Lieutenant-Governors, whom the noble Viscount dismissed the other day as bureaucrats, do let us have the opinions of the leading classes in the Provinces concerned. If in the interval between now and the return of this Bill from the House of Commons the noble Viscount is able to give us the information which we desire, I do not think he will find at all a recalcitrant attitude on the part of noble Lords on this side of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p>On Question, Amendment negatived.</p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I now have to move, in conformity with an undertaking I gave the other night, that the following new clause be inserted after Clause 4&#x2014;
<quote>"All regulations and rules made under this Act shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament as soon as may be after they are made."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0198"/>
<col>347</col>
The opinion of Lord Ampthill, who moved an Amendment on the point in Committee but subsequently withdrew it, I daresay is that the regulations under the Act ought to be laid before the two Houses of Parliament before they become effective and operative. I submit that this is an untenable and impossible Position to take. I think the passage I quoted when we first went into Committee from the late Lord Salisbury was quite definite upon that, and I do not believe the principle laid down by Lord Salisbury is one that anybody who has thought at all carefully about the relations of the Houses of Parliament to the Executive Government would wish to differ from. The only effective way of pulling up the Executive Government which has made regulations or taken some other action that is disapproved of is by a vote of censure on the responsible Ministers. You cannot with proper regard to the Constitution or to effective government, allow either House of Parliament to be constantly overhauling, meddling with, and directing the Executive Government, and I am surprised that that is not accepted by the Front Bench opposite as a very strong Conservative doctrine whatever else it may be.<lb/>
Supposing we allow these regulations to lie on the Table of the two Houses of Parliament before coming into operation; suppose one House approves and the other disapproves of them, what happens to the Government of India during that time? You are, first of all, having friction between the two Houses upon a matter which neither House, if your Lordships will permit me to say so, is particularly competent to decide. This House has a superiority in the way of ex-Indian rulers, but it will be admitted, and was admitted by Lord Curzon when he was in the House of Commons, that India is the scene where these regulations and rules ought to be settled and that Parliament is not a competent body to take that operation out of the hands of those on the ground. And while this friction exists the regulations are hung up, though they may be of an emergency character. Then see how cumbersome it might be. The other House is constantly congested and overwhelmed with work. Is it commonsense to add to that congested state of things the duty of supervising all these regulations that may be made by the Government of India under this Act?
<col>348</col>
I cannot think that is a very sensible proposal. I am sure Lord Curzon, who has written and spoken on this matter, will agree that the system of administration in India to-day founded on the old Act of 1858 is capable of improvement, and if we were to start a new system of government we should not enact afresh the Act of 1858. It is a cumbrous system.<lb/>
The relations between the Viceroy and the Secretary of State are themselves not always very easy to adjust, but to require the assent of both Houses to the regulations under this Bill would render the system more cumbersome. On those grounds I deprecate the view taken with great sincerity and argued with great force by Lord Ampthill. At the same time, I agree that the rules and regulations cannot be withdrawn from the cognisance of Parliament, and by the Amendment I propose the opportunity will be given, as soon after the rules are made as is possible, for Parliament to consider them and, should Parliament think fit, to pass censure upon the Government in respect to any of the rules. The possibility of a vote of censure would be in the mind of the Government of India and of the Secretary of State and act as a check upon any hasty or misguided regulation. All the regulations being laid on the Tables of both Houses as soon as possible after their passing in India, Parliament in either House could demand modifications and cause alterations to be made. That I consider the sensible, businesslike, constitutional method of proceeding, and I therefore move the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p>Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"After Clause 4 to insert the following new clause:&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>'All regulations and rules made under this Act shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament as soon as may be after they are made.'"&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Morley of Blackburn</i>.)</quote></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the words which the noble Viscount has put down hardly show that he has had much regard to the plea which we made on the last occasion for a little more generous treatment in regard to these regulations. I do not question the spirit in which the noble Viscount has made this proposal, but I must point out to your Lordships that the words will really have no effect whatever in modifying the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0199"/>
<col>349</col>
condition of affairs created by the Bill. Suppose these regulations and rules to be laid before Parliament, they are to be laid after they have come into effect, after the whole work is done, and after the time when your Lordships or the House of Commons could possibly interfere to produce, not compulsion on the Secretary of State or the Government of India, but even to use persuasion and to bring the force of argument to bear upon them. The noble Viscount says the proper way to proceed is to move a vote of censure on the Secretary of State. A vote of censure if carried, at all events in the other House, must lead to the resignation of the Government. It is possible to argue that a Judge cannot be interfered with by any resolution of Parliament except by an Address to the Crown for his removal; but the principle on which a Judge proceeds and the sentences which he has it in his power to give are laid down by Act of Parliament.<lb/>
I would point out to the noble Viscount that the Bill which he has laid before us is a skeleton Bill. It is the filling in of this Bill which is the whole importance. It is unlike any Bill we have ever seen laid before Parliament in regard to this country, and, therefore, the same rules are not applicable. Take, for instance, the question of these Legislative Councils. The constituencies which are to be created, the method of using the franchise, the collection of votes, whether by electoral colleges or otherwise, all are left, not in the language of the statute, but to regulations which may be issued by the Government of India under the authority of the Secretary of State. Compare that with any English Bill. A Bill for changing the franchise in England requires schedules, in which you have the franchise properly laid down and the constituencies demarcated to the last village and the last field. I really think the noble Viscount, in proffering us the words he has done, has not realised how very small a concession he has made to what is a very strong and genuine feeling that Parliament ought to know something more of what is to be done before passing the Bill and leaving it entirely in the hands of the Secretary of State. The Executive Councils, as the Bill stood, were left entirely in the hands of the Government of India and the Secretary of State. The time at which they were to be nominated, whether they should be nominated or not,
<col>350</col>
whether the huge expense involved in them should be incurred, were all left to regulations which we could not have touched. It is exactly the same in regard to the whole of the Legislative Councils.<lb/>
The words on the Paper form one of four different courses by which Parliament in various Acts has preserved some hold on regulations or action taken in accordance with statute. The noble Viscount lays them on the Table so that it may be possible for us some day, if we like, to discuss the regulations, but we cannot influence their being called into effect. It is possible to go a step further&#x2014;to place them on the Table, but not to put them into effect during the period for which they lay on the Table. That is the second course. The third and stronger course is to enable Parliament within those days to express dissent to any particular regulation. To that course the noble Viscount has suggested various objections, one of which has been the friction which might be occasioned if one House approved and the other House disapproved of a particular regulation. The fourth and still stronger course is one which was forced upon the late Government in 1897 by the vigorous efforts of the party opposite. We were forced to put into a Bill the provision that a particular set of regulations should lie on the Table for forty days, and should not merely not become operative if either House dissented, but that in both Houses a resolution of assent must be moved and carried. And when I remind your Lordships that so strong a provision as that was found necessary in a mere question of whether or not man&#x0153;uvres should be held over certain parts of the country, I think it will be felt that in a Bill of this magnitude it is not unreasonable to ask that Parliament should have some power of expressing its opinion. After what the noble Viscount has said, I will not ask either for the assent of Parliament or even what my noble friend Lord Ampthill contended for, the power of Parliament to dissent from the regulations; but I would ask that, in cases not of unimportant rules which are made every day by the Government of India and which do not require the consent of the Secretary of State, but in the case of really important rules and regulations under this Bill which require the assent of the Secretary of State, we may have them laid for forty days before both Houses before being set in operation.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0200"/>
<col>351</col>
I therefore venture to move, as an Amendment to the Amendment, that all regulations and rules made under the Bill shall, in so far as they require the approval of the Secretary of State in Council, be laid before both Houses of Parliament, and shall not receive the approval of the Secretary of State in Council until they have lain for forty days on the Table of both Houses.</membercontribution></p>
<p>Amendment moved to the Amendment&#x2014;
<quote>"To leave out all words after the word 'shall,' in order to insert these words 'in so far as they require the approval of the Secretary of State in Council be laid before both Houses of Parliament, and shall not receive the approval of the Secretary of State in Council until they have lain for forty days on the Table of both Houses'"&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Midleton</i>.)</quote></p>
<p>*<member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I recollect the case which the noble Viscount who has just sat down quoted, and I do not think the present Bill offers any analogy whatever to the Military Man&#x0153;uvres Bill. Under that Bill the noble Viscount, who was then Secretary of State for War, asked for very strong powers enabling the War Office to appropriate land for the purpose of man&#x0153;uvres. That proposal was exceedingly unpopular in the House of Commons, and I think if it had been pressed to a Division the noble Viscount would have found himself in a minority. Therefore, he saved the position by agreeing that the powers should be exercised only in the event of both Houses consenting. Moreover, that was an English Act, and I venture to say there is no analogy whatever between that Act and the present Bill. I myself have been the subject of the very procedure which my noble friend the Secretary of State has informed the House is the proper way for dealing with a Minister who is supposed to make an executive mistake. On a memorable occasion a proposal was made to censure me for my conduct in an Indian question&#x2014;namely, the cotton duties. A vote of censure was moved upon me in respect of that administrative act done by the Secretary of State in Council. That was the question argued, and I remember quite well candidly admitting to the House of Commons that I knew what the Motion meant if carried. It was upon that that the House divided, and that procedure, according the late Lord Salisbury, has the authority of our constitutional system. The late
<col>352</col>
Lord Salisbury put the point tersely. He said:&#x2014;
<quote>"I apprehend that the constitutional doctrine is this. The House of Commons has the absolute right of selecting a group of statesmen from whom an Executive is chosen, and it has the absolute right of dismissing those statesmen from office when it ceases to trust them; but it has not the right to take the management and conduct of the Executive into its own hands. The Executive Government so selected has, according to our constitution, the right and the duty of discharging the office of Executive and the prerogatives of the Crown."</quote>
If the Secretary of State sanctions regulations he ought not to have sanctioned, the proper course of procedure is to censure the Minister. That is the strongest Parliamentary control that you can exercise upon a Minister. The idea of having the various minuti&#x00E6; of legislation in India&#x2014;the settling of boundaries, constituencies, mode in which persons should be elected and so forth&#x2014;submitted for the approval of the Imperial Parliament is, I think, almost ludicrous. I venture to ask that the noble Viscount's Amendment to the Secretary of State's Amendment should not be pressed, as it is one to which we could not possibly assent.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD AMPTHILL</member>: <membercontribution>I trust your Lordships will allow me to say a few words, seeing that the Secretary of State referred to me several times during the course of his speech. The noble Viscount reiterated, but in a less unpleasant manner, the attack made upon me on the last occasion by the noble Earl the Leader of the House, an attack of which the purport was that in my proposed Amendment I was making an extremely ridiculous suggestion. Both the noble Viscount and the noble Earl suggest, for the purposes of their argument, that the issue of these proclamations, regulations, and rules will be part of the every-day administrative and executive business of the Government of India. Unless I have totally misunderstood the whole object and effect of the noble Viscount's scheme of reform and everything that he has said upon it, they are nothing of the kind. If this scheme of reform were more matured, the substance of these proclamations, regulations, and rules would be embodied in clauses of the Bill or in schedules to the Bill, and would thus come before Parliament. It is only because delay is inadvisable and because the circumstances in India render a certain amount of variety and elasticity
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0201"/>
<col>353</col>
indispensable, that changes which would otherwise be brought about by clauses of the Bill have been reserved for future consideration and for eventual execution by means of proclamations and regulations. The noble Earl suggested that these proclamations were acts of the Government which might be constantly modified or reversed. Is it really seriously contended that when the Government of India issue a proclamation changing the constitution of the government of one of the great Provinces of India, it is a matter of ordinary every-day administration in which the decision might be reversed, say, in the following year? The whole object of the Amendment which I proposed was to prevent the withdrawal from Parliament of the consideration of constitutional changes. It is just because all these new changes contemplated in the proclamations and regulations are actual constitutional changes and not ordinary every-day executive acts of the Government, that I suggested that Parliament should have an opportunity of criticising. Both noble Lords have quoted a saying of the late Lord Salisbury, but I submit that it is not at all appropriate to this case. If I am not misinformed, that saying was made in connection with a very different and very minor matter. It had regard to the question of simultaneous examinations for the Civil Service. That is more of an administrative act; it certainly is not a question of constitutional change. But in regard to these proclamations and regulations it is a question of constitutional change. No one can dispute that when you alter the whole from of government, when you establish what have been called <i>quasi</i>-Parliamentary institutions, those are more than administrative and executive acts; they are acts of constitutional change. Hitherto the practice of the Imperial Government has been that such changes should be made only with the assent of Parliament. It is really, therefore, astounding that the bureaucratic theory should be put forward in its extreme form from the Benches opposite while here on this side we are defending the principle of the democratic government of the Empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I think the Government of India would find it extremely difficult to work the Act if great freedom were not allowed to it in making rules and regulations and from time to time altering and varying
<col>354</col>
them in accordance with the circumstances of the case. It is not as if we were dealing with a new business. We have already, under the existing Act of 1892, had occasion to make regulations and rules, and under the various Acts regulating the Legislative Councils rules have also been made. They have worked well for a time, then afterwards they became inadequate or inappropriate. It was easy to alter them with reference to the circumstances of the case and subject to the control of the Secretary of State. No complaint whatever has been made of that, and I trust that the same procedure will, with your Lordships' permission, be continued under this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am very anxious that the House should not suppose that my noble friend who moved this Amendment or those who agree with him are really unreasonable in the demands which they desire to put forward. Let me say at once that nothing is further from our intention than to ask for any arrangement under which ordinary details, such as the rules of business which govern procedure in these Councils, should be constantly subject to Parliamentary review. Those are minor matters with which we have no desire to concern ourselves. Nor do we wish, as has been suggested, to be continually interfering in what was described just now as matters of executive administration. But what some of us do desire is that before new measures of really cardinal importance, measures such as those dealing with the introduction of popular election and things of that sort, are finally dealt with, there should be an opportunity, before it is too late, for Parliament to express its opinion upon what is proposed.<lb/>
May I again refer to something contained in the Report of the Decentralisation Commission? That Commission has a very interesting chapter upon the organisation of the Government of India. After describing the constitution of the Indian hierarchy and the way in which everything is eventually subject to the Secretary of State, they go on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"The Secretary of State is in his turn responsible to Parliament. Parliamentary legislation has at one time or another created the Government of India, authorised the establishment of the large Provinces ruled by Lieutenant-Governors, and brought the Presidency Governors of Madras and
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0202"/>
<col>355</col>
Bombay into subordination to the central Government. From Parliament, too, are derived the constitution and functions of the Indian Provincial Legislatures, the High Courts, and the method of recruitment of the Indian Civil Service, and any material change in these would, as a consequence, involve Parliamentary sanction."</quote>
Our contention is that under the rules and regulations which this Bill authorises you to make you do propose to introduce material changes in these matters, and we desire that these changes should not be entirely withdrawn from the consideration of Parliament. The noble Viscount says they are not entirely withdrawn from the consent of Parliament, because Parliament has only to censure the Secretary of State and has its remedy in that form. But we do not desire to have continual votes of censure upon the Secretary of State. What we do desire is that the Secretary of State should have an opportunity of considering, while there is yet time, any useful suggestions which may be made to him in either House of Parliament. That is the effect of the Amendment of my noble friend.<lb/>
What the noble Viscount offers us, I am afraid, gives us but very little indeed. I was in hopes the other evening when he produced his Amendment that he was going to attempt to meet us. But really will the noble Viscount tell us that his Amendment gives us anything at all? I am quite anxious to be converted if the noble Viscount can convert me. Will it not, without the noble Viscount's Amendment, be perfectly competent to any member in either House to call attention to any proclamations, rules, or regulations which are from time to time issued by the Government of India? I take it that it would, and therefore I do not think the noble Viscount's Amendment helps us much. My noble friend, on the contrary, says he does not want to interfere with ordinary matters of detail, but that when there is a measure of first-rate importance, a measure which has to come home for the approval of the Secretary of State, then, says my noble friend, let Parliament have a look at it before the Secretary of State finally burns his boats. There is no malevolence in that suggestion. It is, on the contrary, intended to secure for Parliament an opportunity to which I humbly think it is entitled.<lb/>

I have, however, no desire to press our views upon a point of this kind unduly,
<col>356</col>
and I am bound to say that I think the case has been somewhat altered by the omission of Clause 3 from the Bill, because with that clause the only portion of the Bill in which I find any reference to proclamations disappears. If Clause 3 goes there will be no proclamations, and we need have no anxiety as to the reference of proclamations to Parliament. May I say, in passing, that in his speech the other evening the noble Viscount said that in his contemplation proclamations might be resorted to in two or three cases, but I have been unable to find any case except the one to which I have referred&#x2014;namely, in Clause 3 of the Bill. Therefore, it stands in this way. We need no longer have any anxiety with regard to proclamations, because they for the moment have disappeared. We do not want to interfere with regard to minor rules, and therefore all that is left are the regulations which are issued under Clause 6 of the Bill. If, then, His Majesty's Government press us hard upon this point&#x2014;and the noble Viscount, Lord Wolverhampton, made a very earnest appeal to us not to insist upon it&#x2014;I should respectfully advise my noble friend who has moved this Amendment not to carry it to a Division. But I am bound to say I recommend that concession rather in deference to that strong wish which has been expressed by noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite, than because I am at all convinced that my noble friend behind me is really unreasonable in his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member>: <membercontribution>By your Lordships' indulgence, perhaps I may be allowed to make a single observation. The noble Marquess implies that by this Amendment I really give nothing, or very little. I do not agree. He pictured an inquisitive member of either House desiring to examine and criticise the regulations. Well, he will not know what the regulations are unless, in the terms of my Amendment, it is the business and the duty of the Secretary of State to lay all the regulations and rules immediately before Parliament. Members of both Houses thus have the whole panorama of regulations and rules before them, and will be able to take what course they may think fit. I gladly recognise the spirit of the noble Viscount who was my predecessor at the India Office, but I do not believe that his proposal is within the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0203"/>
<col>357</col>
lines of the constitution. It was rather a surprise to me to find myself here, of all places in the world, vindicating the wisdom of our ancestors; and I would only recall to those two noble Lords that under their own Act of 1892 no regulations at all were laid before Parliament until a private member&#x2014;Mr. Caine&#x2014;moved for their production, so little did noble Lords opposite then think it requisite that the regulations should be laid on the Table. That Act was also spoken of as a very great and remarkable step in advance; yet none of the regulations were to be laid until a private member made the demand.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member>: <membercontribution>I rather expected the challenge to which we have just listened, and in that anticipation I refreshed my memory regarding the debates to which the noble Viscount alluded. I did not find in them any reference to the measure of 1892 couched in quite the strong language that the noble Viscount has used. But, even if that were so, there surely is a very great difference between the situation in 1892 and now. I remember very well being called upon to carry that Bill through the House of Commons, and I recollect the speech of Mr. Gladstone to which the Secretary of State alluded the other evening. The regulations which it had been proposed by some members of the House of Commons should be submitted to Parliament were regulations only by which the nominated members of the Viceroy's Council were increased from twelve to sixteen and by which the nominated members of the Councils of the Governors of Madras and Bombay were increased from eight to twenty. I took up the position then, under instruction from my chief, and I hold the position now, that those were regulations entirely within the scope and authority of the Governor-General of India, and that they were not matters which legitimately ought to be brought within the purview of Parliament. But surely the position is very different now. Nobody will contend that there was any analogy between the limited concessions of 1892 and the very advanced steps about to be taken now. However, I do not desire to pursue that point. The position has changed. As the noble Marquess has pointed out, proclamations have gone out of the Bill. With rules of business we do not want to interfere. As regards regulations, the noble Viscount the Secretary of State gave us an assurance
<col>358</col>
that the regulations which are framed by the Governor-General in Council in India will be laid on the Table of this House immediately they arrive in this country. We shall then have an opportunity of discussing them, and with that opportunity I, at any rate, and I hope I speak for noble Lords on these Benches, will be satisfied.</membercontribution></p>

<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member>: <membercontribution>The noble Viscount has, I understand, suggested that the next stage of the Bill should be taken to-morrow.

I have endeavoured to make inquiries with regard to the position of affairs in the other House, and I am assured that, from that point of view, it will make no difference to the noble Viscount at all whether we read the Bill a third time to-morrow or early next week.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member>: <membercontribution>I must remind the noble Marquess that, for various reasons, the progress of the Bill has been twice or thrice retarded, quite willingly on our part, in order to meet the convenience of the noble Marquess and one or two of his friends. Otherwise we should have had the Bill finished some time ago. I desire, naturally, that the Bill should get to the other House as soon as may be. But there is another argument. I think any appearance of slackness, if I may use the word without offence, on the part of either House would have an undesirable effect in India. It is well that they should see us doing the best we can, without rash celerity, to get the Bill forward, and therefore I should deprecate delay unless anything is gained by it.</membercontribution></p>

argument, I remain under the impression that there is not much in that, and that it will not make very much difference to the fate of the Bill in the House of Commons whether we read it a third time to-morrow or at a later day. With regard to the Indian argument, I cannot help thinking that, whatever other criticism this House has been open to with regard to its dealings with this Bill, we are not open to the criticism of having indulged in dilatory tactics. I therefore trust the noble Viscount will not ask us to take the Third Reading to-morrow.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War the Questions standing in my name on the Paper&#x2014;viz.&#x2014;(1.) The number of candidates for commissions in the Regular Army, and the number of commissions offered at all entrance examinations from 1905 to the present date. (2.) The number of officers, including quartermasters, due to be transferred to the Special Reserve Battalions Infantry in time of peace and on mobilisation in accordance
<col>360</col>
with Army Order of December 23, 1907; the number of Line officers who have been so transferred; is it the intention to fill the places vacated by them in their regiments by extra officers appointed to the Line, and, if so, the number of extra officers required, and the number, if any, who have been already appointed to the Line in consequence of the transfer of Line officers to the Special Reserve; the number of subaltern officers at present required to make up the establishment of the Special Infantry Reserve. (3.) The number of Infantry Special Reserve Officers who have joined as recruit officers since the transfer of the Militia battalions to the Special Reserve; and the number of these officers who are at present candidates for commissions in the Regular Army, and the number who are not candidates for commissions in the Regular Army. (4.) The number of men now in the Special Infantry Reserve who on completion of their drill on enlistment have been rejected on application to join the Regular Army on account of not being up to Army standard as regards physical development, and who have returned to civil life, and are now completing their service in the Special Infantry Reserve. (5.) The number of non-commissioned officers and men of the Special Reserve Infantry whose term of service expires on or before March 31, 1910. (6.) The number of officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of the Infantry of the Territorial Army who were absent without leave from the annual training of 1908, and the number who absented themselves without leave whilst the annual training of 1908 was in progress, and if any action has been taken in reference to such absentees. (7.) The number of officers, non-commissioned officers and men who have left the Territorial Infantry since its formation up to the present date. (8.)

<p>*<member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, with regard to the first question, there are four different categories under which commissions can be obtained in the Regular Army. I have the figures of all the examinations from 1905 to the present date. They cover several sheets. Perhaps the noble Duke will be satisfied if I give the totals in each category.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member>: <membercontribution>I shall be quite satisfied with the totals.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>First of all, there is the ordinary way of entering the Army&#x2014;namely, by Woolwich or by Sandhurst. Seven examinations have been held since November, 1905, at which altogether 2,102 candidates entered; 308 have passed into Woolwich and 1,154 have passed into Sandhurst. Then there is the method of getting in through the Universities, and there the commissions that have been given and the number of applications for commissions have fallen considerably short of the number of commissions open. Until July, 1907, there were always forty-two commissions offered to the Universities, and during those examinations there were in the first year only eight, in the second year six at the May examination and eight at the November examination, in the third year fourteen candidates who applied for and obtained commissions. After that there was a slight improvement, and in January, 1908, the number of commissions was increased to forty-nine, because from that time onwards the Colonial Universities were included. The numbers show a slight increase, the total commissioned being ninety-seven out of 315 commissions offered. The next means of entry is through the Militia, the Special Reserve, and the Territorial Forces. The number of candidates who presented themselves between September, 1905, and October, 1908, was 738; 544 commissions were offered, and the number commissioned was 458. Finally, there are the candidates from the Colonial Forces, and these included the Colonial Universities until the end of 1907, when they came in as University candidates, as I have already explained. Up to 1907 each year there were twenty-six commissions offered; nine presented themselves in the first year and six were commissioned, two presented themselves in
<col>362</col>
1906 and one was commissioned, and six presented themselves in 1907 and all six were commissioned. Since then there have been no candidates.<lb/>
In answer to the second question, the total number of Regular officers, including quartermasters due to be transferred to the Special Reserve Battalions Infantry in time of peace and on mobilisation in accordance with the Army Order of December 23, 1907, is altogether 772. The additional number of officers required on mobilisation who will be found from the Regular Reserves or half-pay list is 150. The total number of officers who have been transferred, including those who were at the dep&#x00F4;ts and were with Militia Battalions, is 610, and of these 107 were transferred from the Line. It is the intention to fill the places vacated in their regiments by extra officers appointed to the Line, but we have hitherto only been taking for this purpose officers from those regiments who have got officers supplementary to their establishment. The number of extra officers required altogether was 223. The number who have been brought into Line Battalions in consequence of the transfer of Line officers to Special Reserve Battalions was 107. The total number of subaltern officers at present required to make up the establishment of the Special Infantry Reserve is 1,360.<lb/>
The answer to the first part of the third Question is fifty, and the number of those who have not drawn outfit allowance and are therefore presumably candidates for the Regular Army is thirty-two. That leaves eighteen who apparently intend to remain in the Special Reserve. The fourth Question has been redrafted since the Notice was placed on the Paper, and we have not been able to get the information in time. It would mean a reference to all the recruiting centres. As to the fifth Question, the number of non-commissioned officers and men of the Special Reserve Infantry whose term of service will expire on or before March 31, 1910, is 5,032. In reply to the sixth Question, the total number of men of the Infantry of the Territorial Army absent without leave from the annual training of 1908 was&#x2014;four officers, twenty-five non-commissioned officers, and 1,224 rank and file; but I am sorry to say our returns do not discriminate between those who were absent from the whole
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0206"/>
<col>363</col>
training and those absent from part of the training without leave. I have given the inclusive figures for both. Our returns, I am afraid, do not show what action was taken against those who absented themselves without leave, but they do show that 104 men have been struck off for desertion or absence up to February 25, and in all probability the majority were struck off because they were absent without leave from camp.<lb/>
In reply to the seventh Question, the number of men who have taken their discharge or been struck off for desertion up to February 25 is 1,522, exclusive of 186 who have died, 3,509 who have joined the Regular Army, and 439 who have been transferred to other arms of the Territorial Force. As to the eighth Question, we recruit for the Army Service Corps and the Army Medical Corps under the two different categories, known as category (<i>a</i>) (ordinary Special Reserve) and category (<i>b</i>) (men whom we recruit from the Territorial Army). Of the Army Service Corps under category (<i>a</i>) the establishment is 1,000, and the strength obtained so far is fifty; under category (<i>b</i>), the establishment is 2,500, and the strength, five; but recruiting for both these classes has only just been thrown open, category (<i>a</i>) last November, and, so far as category (<i>b</i>) is concerned, we expect these men to do one training with the Territorial Force before they join category (<i>b</i>). Therefore, as regards the number of men who can join category (<i>b</i>), you may practically say that the thing is not yet in working order. Then, with regard to the Army Medical Corps, in category (<i>a</i>) the establishment is 1,000, and the strength 657; and in category (<i>b</i>) the establishment is 3,000, and the strength, 183. The establishment of the Special Reserve Army Medical Corps has been revised because it has been decided to throw open to a certain number of men of the Regular Reserve of the Infantry an opportunity of becoming Reservists for the Army Medical Corps. We have a very large Reserve at the present time for the Infantry, and advantage has been taken of that to ask 1,000 men of the Infantry Regular Reserve whether they will go through a medical training course at Aldershot and undertake the duties of Army Medical Corps on mobilisation. That course has not begun yet, so we do not know what number of men will join. In reply to the last Question, we shall be very glad to lay on

<title>SMALL ARMS IN THE NAVY.</title>
<p><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member> <membercontribution>rose to ask the Government whether, considering that the crews of Russian and Japanese destroyers came to hand-to-hand conflict during the Russo-Japanese war, wrestling with one another, and using their fists, and that some of our destroyers carry seventy officers and men, of whom twelve are armed with rifle and sword-bayonet, twenty with cutlass and pistol, leaving thirty-eight men unarmed, they will take into consideration the desirability of appointing an Admiralty Committee for the purpose of inquiring and advising them as to whether all officers and men in small vessels should not carry arms of some description, and as to what pattern of pistol, sword, hunting-knife, or other weapons are the most suitable for close conflict in the confined spaces to be found on board destroyers, picket boats, torpedo boats, or submarines, bearing in mind that an enemy might attempt to cut such vessels out while under repair at a temporary base; and, secondly, the desirability of not renewing those sections of the Geneva Conventions which restrict the shape and materials of bullets used in short range firearms, such as pistols, the Committee to have power to make public or confidential reports to the Admiralty as it thought fit.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Lord said</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, during the Russo-Japanese War on at least two occasions the Japanese captured Russian destroyers by boarding them. On March 9, 1904, when outside Port Arthur, the "Sazanami," said to be a thirty-knot boat, raced up alongside a slower Russian destroyer, the "Steregutchi." A Japanese sprang on board of her and knocked her captain overboard before he could use his cutlass. In spite of a gallant defence the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0207"/>
<col>365</col>
Russians were overpowered and their vessel captured. The "Steregutchi" was, however, so badly damaged that her captors were unable to bring her into harbour. On the night of the 11th August the Russian destroyer "Ryshitilini" was boarded by Japanese while at anchor at Chefoo. The Russians had unfortunately no arms, but they made the best resistance they could, throwing some of their adversaries into the water. The Japanese, however, soon overcame their defenceless opponents, and made off with their prize.<lb/>
I understand that some of our destroyers, such as the "Derwent," carry seventy officers and men, of whom twelve are armed with rifle and sword-bayonet and twenty with cutlasses and pistols, leaving thirty-eight men unarmed. In some of our torpedo boats eight out of twenty-one men are unarmed. The fifteen officers and men in a submarine carry no arms whatever. Of course, if attacked while ready for action, she might dive and leave her assailants swimming about on the surface of the water; but if she was not ready to dive, or was under repair at a temporary base, her crew would be unable to offer the slightest resistance. Some form of dirk or hunting-knife might be supplied to men on board the smaller class of vessels, as they would seldom have room to use a cutlass. I was once present at a fight between half-a-dozen seamen, armed with cutlasses, and a mad dog of considerable size. It was in the night. We were at sea under sail, and there were no lights in the engine-room to which the dog had retreated. The officer in command of the party carried a lantern, which he dropped on the dog springing at him. The rest of the battle was carried on with no light but that of the sparks of the cutlasses as they struck the iron in the engine-room. The shouts of the men who were afraid of wounding one another, the clash of the cutlasses and the howls of the dog made up a scene to which it would not be easy to find a parallel. This episode had the effect of impressing upon me the extreme inconvenience of having to use weapons of too great a length in a confined space.<lb/>
If a committee is appointed, I think that among other matters it might take into consideration the patterns of the weapons used by the ancients, and inquire as to whether the short swords used by the
<col>366</col>
Greeks and Romans are not better suited for use in the small craft of the present day than the naval cutlass actually issued to our seamen. The ancients had far more experience of hand-to-hand conflicts than we have. Battles in their time were chiefly decided by them. Long range fire-arms have decreased the number of occasions when swords actually cross. But though such opportunities are few and far between that is no reason why we should not be fully prepared for them when they arise. Some of the invisible or internal parts of pistols might, I think, be nickel-plated. They are constantly being rusted by salt and spray, by the damp arising from the engine-room, and by the much-breathed air in the men's sleeping places. I can quite understand that during peace time the crews of small vessels would prefer not to have in addition to their other duties the trouble of keeping weapons in order. This work, however, might be lessened if the nickel plating of parts that would not attract the attention of an enemy was adopted. I also think that a four-inch barrel might be substituted for the six-inch pistol barrel, which would render it much lighter and handier without interfering with the accuracy of the shooting at short ranges, but I should not recommend a bore of less than 450, which is the present size. Our own experience in China, New Zealand, in other campaigns, and miners' fights in the Western States of America, have shown the inutility of small bore pistols. I think that when the Geneva Conventions are renewed an exception should be made permitting the use of expanding bullets in pistols, for the reason that it is useless to inflict a wound on your adversary when at close quarters unless it is one that disables him. His dying next day is not the slightest use to you if he has previously run you through the body. A wounded enemy might take three or four lives at close quarters, whereas if injured by a rifle at a distance say of 1,000 yards, he would probably be quiet enough for the rest of the day. Even if he was very combative, his wound would handicap his shooting at long ranges, but when within reach of cold steel a slight wound would have little effect on his revolver practice. I beg to put the Question standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the noble Lord has given us a very interesting dissertation on different forms of weapons, and has told us that on two
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0208"/>
<col>367</col>
occasions boarding took place during the Russo-Japanese war. I do not think the noble Lord is correct in that. The only authentic case known to the Admiralty of a hand-to-hand encounter taking place between Japanese and Russian destroyers during the Russo-Japanese war was at Chefoo during the night of August 11, 1904, when after the Russian boat "Ryshitilini" had been disarmed by the Chinese the Japanese boarded and took possession of her. The late war, therefore, supplies no evidence against the views held by the Admiralty as to the extent of small arm armament necessary for destroyers and torpedo boats in war time. The main armament of destroyers is ample to deal with all cases of normal attack. Picket boats are supplied by their parent ships with such armament as may be considered necessary for the service on which they may be employed. The Admiralty cannot perceive under what conceivable conditions small arms would be of any use to submarines. As regards the Geneva Convention, the Admiralty have no intention of not renewing the particular clause with regard to the use of the hollow-nosed bullets; and I am sure that if any Government made the suggestion that they should be used, even in short-range fire arms, the whole of Europe would be up in arms against them.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HORSE BREEDING.</title>
<p><member>LORD WYNFORD</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture whether His Majesty's Government intend to carry out the scheme for the encouragement of horse-breeding which was outlined in this House on July 6 last, and, if so, whether he can give any approximate date when the scheme may be expected to be put into operation.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member>: <membercontribution>Before the noble Earl replies, I would like to suggest that the Government should consider whether the money at present given for premiums on thoroughbred stallions could not be spent in a more advantageous manner. This afternoon I had the pleasure of participating to some slight extent in the money so given, but, in spite of that, I suggest to the noble Lord that the money might be spent in a different manner. I am quite sure that His Majesty's Government are fully alive to the necessity of doing something as speedily as possible to
<col>368</col>
prevent mares going out of the country at the present very alarming rate. We have here the finest country in the world for breeding horses, and we have produced, and are producing, the finest breed of horses in the world. If the &#x00A3;4,000 given by way of premiums on thoroughbred hunter sires were spent by the Government in buying a certain number of mares and stallions each year, in a certain number of years you would have the nucleus of a considerable breeding establishment. It has been objected to this that supposing you had bought a certain number of mares you would not know what to do with them or who would take charge of them. In the part of the country I come from we have started a system which, I believe, will be very successful, and which is no doubt highly acceptable to the farmers. It is that when a hunter mare has to be disposed of, either through being incurably lame or being too old to hunt, that mare is then leased to a tenant farmer at a nominal rent of 5s. a year or something of that sort, the owner retaining to himself the right to inspect the animal whenever he thinks proper, and to take her back if she is not being properly done by. A further condition I have made with regard to many mares I have treated in this way is that the mare shall be mated with a thoroughbred hunter sire or premium horse every year and shown with the produce at a local show. I also have a call on the three-year-old, the four-year-old, and the five-year-old, whichever I think proper, at a certain price, but not an excessive price, the farmer having the right to dispose of the foal, the yearling, or the two-year-old if he is able and willing to do so. This system I recommend with very great respect to the consideration of the noble Earl. If the Government were to start something of the kind, I feel sure it would be very acceptable in hunting districts.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I hope the House will forgive me if I do not go into the question raised by Lord Willoughby de Broke. We had a long debate on the subject in July last on the Motion of Lord Donoughmore, and I then tried to explain the scheme we had in view on this subject. The scheme has been approved of and passed by the Army Council, but if the noble Lord will be kind enough to allow me to talk over the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0209"/>
<col>369</col>
matter with him possibly we might amplify the scheme by the adoption of some practical suggestions from him. Perhaps I may be permitted to say exactly how the matter stands at the present moment. The Board of Agriculture are trying to get a census of all horses in the agricultural districts; we can do nothing in the towns, having no machinery. We sent out 300,000 forms early this year, and for the first time, I believe, we shall be able to have a reliable estimate of the number and classes of horses in the country. Acting on the suggestion of Lord Ribblesdale, we have columns in the new return for hunters and other horses in private stables. We have also sent out 300,000 pamphlets with pictures of the different kinds of horses requisite for the various branches of the service. Mr. Haldane, in his speech in another place last week, said there were enough horses in the country to mobilise the Army at the present time. That is so; but it is not so much the present as the future that we have to look to; and I can assure the House that we have no intention of shirking that duty. In conjunction with the Secretary of State for War I hope it may be possible soon to launch
<col>370</col>
our scheme to promote the improvement of horse-breeding, not only for military, but for agricultural purposes. But, of course, we are handicapped in the matter of money. We can only move when our financial position admits of it. I can assure the House that nothing on my part will be left undone to try and bring the matter to some satisfactory conclusion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD WYNFORD</member>: <membercontribution>Am I to understand that nothing will be done to encourage the breeding of horses? The noble Earl has told your Lordships about taking a census, but that will do little or nothing in the direction of encouraging horse-breeding. Are we to understand that there is no hope of the scheme as outlined by the noble Earl being carried out this year?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member>: <membercontribution>It is a matter entirely for the Treasury. We have everything ready, and the moment the money is voted the scheme will be put in hand.</membercontribution></p>

<title>TRENT RAILWAY AND BRIDGE BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p>Report of the Board of Trade on the said Bill: Ordered to be laid before the House (<i>The Lord Hamilton of Dalzell</i>).</p>
</section>
<section>
<title>OXFORD STREET CHURCH OF ENGLAND SCHOOL, SWANSEA.</title>
<p>*<member>EARL CAWDOR</member> <membercontribution>rose to call attention to the action of the Board of Education with respect to the Oxford Street Church of England School, Swansea; and to move for Papers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Earl said </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, in raising the question that I wish to bring under your Lordships' notice this afternoon, the words of which stand upon the Paper, it will, I am afraid, be necessary for me to detain your Lordships at some length, because, in order to make clear the issue, it is necessary that I should tell the story to some extent of what has occurred for some years past with respect to this school. Ever since the passing of the Act of 1902 there has been a dispute between the local education authority of Swansea and the managers of this school, and that dispute, I think, may be divided under three heads&#x2014;first, with respect to the provision of accommodation in the school; secondly, with regard to the differentiation between the salaries of teachers in that school and the salaries of teachers in Council schools; and, thirdly, with the refusal of the authority to maintain the school at all.<lb/>
As to the first point, the provision of accommodation, I propose only to say this, that during these years under great pressure the local education authority and the Board of Education have compelled the managers of this school to increase the accommodation very largely, at a cost, I think, of something over &#x00A3;16,000. In doing that the local education authority has insisted upon playground accommodation considerably in excess in regard to the amount of square feet demanded for each child of that which they have got for themselves in their own Council schools. I note that as a matter which appears to be not quite just. With the differentiation of salaries I must deal later, for that really is one of the main points that I wish to bring to your Lordships'
<col>372</col>
notice this evening. The third point, the refusal of the local authority to maintain, reached a very acute stage. The local education authority at one time declined to pay salaries to the teachers in this school except at a considerably lower rate than that which they found necessary in the provided schools in order to maintain their efficiency. Between July, 1907, and January, 1908, the local education authority in this district actually refused to pay to teachers in this school any salaries at all. When they took this action the Board of Education at once wrote to say that they were taking an absolutely illegal position, that they were bound to maintain the school and pay the salaries; but, in spite of their knowledge that the local education authority were acting illegally, in spite of their having told them they were acting illegally, the Board declined to take any steps whatever either to support the managers or to relieve the school.<lb/>
For three months the managers paid the teachers' salaries out of their own pockets. They then gave notice that they were not going to continue to pay the salaries any longer, and for, I think, two months the teachers in this school went without any salaries at all. This shows the animus which I am afraid we shall find page by page through what I think is rather a disgraceful story. The question with respect to salaries took no less than three years to decide, although, as your Lordships are well aware, the Board of Education had ample powers to deal with it had they chosen to do so. In the end the Board of Education took action only when forced under the definite threat of a <i>mandamus</i> by the managers of the school&#x2014;not a very dignified position for the Board of Education, upon whom is placed the duty and the obligation of maintaining the efficiency of elementary schools all over the country.<lb/>
After this threat of a <i>mandamus</i> a public Inquiry was ordered by the Board of Education in July, 1908, the discussion upon the question of salaries having begun as early as, I think, the early days of 1905, the appointed day, so far as I remember, in that school area having been somewhere about the month of September, 1904. The public Inquiry was ordered in July, 1908, and was conducted by a very distinguished lawyer, Mr. Hamilton,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0211"/>
<col>373</col>
well known, I think, to many of your Lordships who are acquainted with the legal profession, and a gentleman who has since been promoted to the position of a Judge. He held the Inquiry on July 31 and August 1, the Report was made to the Board on September 30, and the decision of the Board was not given until December 17. Strangely enough&#x2014;I suppose it was entirely an accident&#x2014;that decision was not made known until Parliament was just rising, too late for any notice to be taken of it in your Lordships' House or elsewhere, and it was not published until the President of the Board of Education had started abroad on his holidays. I have no doubt, as I say, that it was entirely an accident, but I venture to think it was a very unfortunate one. It may have been, as my noble friend beside me suggests, almost a coincidence.<lb/>
I must read to your Lordships a few paragraphs from the very able Report that Mr. Hamilton made to the Board of Education. I crave your Lordships' indulgence if I read some of these paragraphs at length, but it is absolutely necessary for the case that I have to state. I ought to mention that what was being tried and tested at this Inquiry was whether the local education authority had or had not properly maintained this school. That was the whole burden of the Report which Mr. Hamilton was asked to make. I ought, perhaps, to preface the reading of the paragraphs by asking your Lordships' attention to the Notice of the Public Inquiry that appears in the beginning of the Parliamentary Paper which the noble Viscount was good enough to lay on the Table the other day. The Notice runs&#x2014;
<quote>"And whereas representations have been made to the Board of Education to the effect that the local education authority have failed to fulfil their duty under the Education Acts, 1870 to 1907, with respect to the staff of the said school;</quote>
<quote>"And whereas the Board of Education have determined to hold a Public Inquiry under section 73 of the Elementary Act, 1870, and section 23 (10) of the Education Act, 1902, with a view to satisfying themselves as to the said allegation and representations;</quote>
<quote>"Now therefore the Board of Education give notice that John Andrew Hamilton, Esquire, one of His Majesty's Counsel, will attend at the Guildhall, Swansea, on Friday, the 31st day of July, 1908, at 10 o'clock in the forenoon, for the purpose of holding the said Inquiry, and will then and there, or at any adjournment of the Inquiry, hear, receive, and examine any evidence and information offered, and
<col>374</col>
hear and inquire into any objections or representations made respecting the subject of the Inquiry."</quote><lb/>
The Inquiry was duly held, and in his Report [p. 8] Mr. Hamilton says&#x2014;
<quote>"Evidence was given before me that, in the opinion of the witnesses called on behalf of the managers, the refusal to pay to the teachers in the Oxford Street School the same rates of remuneration as were paid to teachers of the same qualifications in provided schools prejudices and imperils the efficiency of the school. There has been a general rise in teachers' salaries throughout the country. The local education authorities throughout the country pay teachers on a regular scale, and, except in the cases of the Boroughs of Halifax and Swansea, they do not discriminate between teachers in provided and teachers in non-provided schools as such. The discrimination against the teachers in the Oxford Street School&#x2014;</quote>
and I ask your Lordship's attention to these words particularly&#x2014;
<quote>"unsettles the teachers, leads them to seek other posts with better pay and less uncertain prospects, harasses them in their work, and deprives the school of the benefit of length of service and growth of experience in its teaching staff. The matter did not rest in opinion only, for evidence was given before me of the actual feeling of the teachers, and it was proved that, while there was a waiting list of applicants for posts in the provided schools so that vacanies were filled without advertisement, vacancies in the Oxford Street Schools were filled, if at all, only with difficulty and delay. Advertisements inviting applications, otherwise than on the basis of the provided schools' scale, met with no response, and were actually refused insertion in an influential newspaper, the organ of the National Union of Teachers. Such are the facts as I collect them from the correspondence put in and the statements of the witnesses."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Hamilton</member> <membercontribution>proceeds&#x2014;
<quote>"I have to report as to the facts as follows:&#x2014;The Oxford Street School has regularly earned the grant and to that extent has been maintained and kept efficient, but this has been done, not by the authority alone, but only by the combination of funds provided by the authority and of funds collected by the managers 'other than expenditure for which,' under the Education Act, 1902, 'provision is to be made by the managers.' But for these sums provided by the managers, in my opinion the school would before now have ceased to be efficient in any sense. As it is, though it continues in a state of efficiency by earning the grant, its efficiency is, owing to the course taken by the authority, precarious. It is further jeopardised by the departure of experienced teachers and by the dissatisfaction and unrest created among those who remain. In paying the salaries for which the teachers pressed, the managers have neither played into the teachers' hands nor acted improvidently. They would have kept up the efficiency of the school without paying more than the authority fixed, if they could, but it was not practicable to keep the staff together, or to obtain a staff capable of keeping the school efficient unless they paid higher salaries than those which the authority fixed."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0212"/>
<col>375</col>
In a paragraph a little further on Mr. Hamilton says&#x2014;
<quote>"No circumstances appeared before me which would warrant any special distinction being made in regard to salaries between the provided schools and the Oxford Street School;"</quote>
and at the bottom of p. 9 your Lordships will find this statement&#x2014;
<quote>"The statutory requirement is not satisfied by the mere fact that the school has been maintained and has been kept efficient; it must be maintained and kept efficient by the local education authority. The Oxford Street School has not been maintained and kept efficient by the local education authority, but in so far as it has been maintained and kept efficient, this is due to the combined acts and outlays of the authority and of the managers. Evidence that the managers, in paying salaries in excess of those fixed by the authority, had acted unreasonably and without necessity, would have been very material, but no such evidence was given. The witnesses for the managers stated that they had had no wish to spend more than was necessary, and would have been willing to engage teachers at the authority's scale of pay, if it had been possible to do so without imperilling the efficiency of the school, and I accept their statements."</quote><lb/>
I now ask your Lordships to turn to p. 12 at the conclusion of the Report. In paragraph 21 Mr. Hamilton says&#x2014;
<quote>"I have to report that the Borough Council of Swansea, the local education authority within whose area the Oxford Street (Church of England) School is, have committed a 'default in the performance of their duties as respects' that school, and have 'failed to fulfil' part of their duties under the Elementary Education Acts, 1870 to 1900, and the Education Act, 1902, namely, their duty under section 7 of the last-named Act, to 'maintain and keep efficient' the Oxford Street (Church of England) School, being a public elementary school within their area."</quote>
That is the conclusion of an extremely able Report, a Report which anyone who wishes to really understand the bearings of this question should read, mark, and understand. After this Report nearly three months elapsed, and then we get the letter conveying the decision of the Board of Education. Looking to the story as told by the impartial and able Commissioner whom the Board of Education themselves had employed to go into this question, I can only say that I think the letter of the Board containing their decision is an astounding document. In order to carry out the Act, in order to enable the Board of Education to come to a decision in this matter, they were bound to hold a public Inquiry. They selected a man whose ability and fitness for the post no one will deny for a moment, and, having
<col>376</col>
had their Inquiry, having had the whole of the evidence sifted with the utmost care by this distinguished lawyer, what do they say? They say&#x2014;
<quote>"The Board have carefully considered Mr. Hamilton's Report, together with the evidence tendered before Mr. Hamilton at the Inquiry&#x2014;</quote>
I should like to study that evidence myself. There are many who would. I asked the noble Viscount last week if he would lay the evidence on the Table, but he said he was unable to do so, because it was very voluminous. If it is the basis of the Board's decision that they do not concur in Mr. Hamilton's reading of the evidence given at the Inquiry, I think we are entitled to have that evidence laid on the Table. I return to the letter of the Board of Education conveying their decision. They say&#x2014;
<quote>"The Board have carefully considered Mr. Hamilton's Report, together with the evidence tendered before Mr. Hamilton at the Inquiry, and have taken legal advice thereon."</quote>
It would, too, be rather interesting to know what the legal advice asked for was. The Board's letter proceeds&#x2014;
<quote>"The true question at issue between the authority and the managers is one of fact, namely, whether competent teachers can be procured for the Oxford Street Church of England School at the scale of salaries to which the local education authority consented in their letter of April 18, 1907; if they can, it appears to the Board that the sums paid by the local education authority are adequate for the purpose of maintaining the school and keeping it efficient; if not, then the local education authority have failed in their statutory duty."</quote>
I will not repeat the words of Mr. Hamilton on that point. Your Lordships have them before you, and will bear them, I think, clearly in mind. The letter continues&#x2014;
<quote>"The Board are of opinion that no sufficient evidence has been adduced to prove that the authority have so failed, and they see no substantial grounds for supposing that the task of the managers in procuring teachers at the scale of salaries to which the local education authority consented in their letter of 18th April, 1907, was an impossible one, or that they could not have filled any such vacancies as occurred or might occur at that scale if they had determined so to do."</quote>
That is the very point dealt with by the able lawyer whom they themselves appointed to sift and determine the facts. He heard the evidence and determined the facts, but his Report is waived aside without a word of argument. The Board continue&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0213"/>
<col>377</col>
<quote>"It is suggested that the future efficiency of the school would be imperilled by the employment of teachers at the lower rate of pay, but this is a somewhat remote speculation."</quote>
I think I remember another statement by another President of the Board of Education in the same Government, who held a very different view of that position. In 1906 Mr. Birrell, dealing with the same salaries, at the same rate, and in the same school, wrote a letter to the local education authority in which he criticised severely what was taking place. He said that what was being done with respect to these salaries in his view&#x2014;that was in 1906&#x2014;gravely imperilled the efficiency of the school. What has happened since 1906 to make salaries which were then insufficient and were imperilling gravely at that moment the efficiency of the school, not in the opinion of the managers but in the opinion of the President of the Board of Education of that day, with all the legal advice behind him&#x2014;What has happened to make those salaries adequate now? During the last few years salaries have gone up by leaps and bounds in Council schools. Yet we are now told by the President of the Board of Education that it is a somewhat remote speculation that the efficiency of this school will be imperilled by the employment of teachers at the lower rate of pay. It really is playing with the question to deal with it in such a manner as this. The Board conclude&#x2014;
<quote>"The crucial question is whether their proposed expenditure is adequate for the performance of their statutory obligation."</quote>
Yes, that is the issue, the issue that has been tried by the man who heard the evidence. The Board go on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"The Board do not find upon the evidence that the money provided by the authority for the salaries of the teachers has been shown to be inadequate for this purpose, and they decide accordingly that the authority have not failed in their duty to maintain and keep efficient the Oxford Street School."</quote><lb/>
Was it ever intended by Parliament that the holding of these public Inquiries, made necessary by Statute before the Board could come to their decision, should be gone into in this solemn way by the most skilled men you can find, and then waived aside as perfectly worthless for the purpose for which they were intended. It is turning into ridicule the main part of the Statute so far as this question is concerned. It would have been perfectly easy for the
<col>378</col>
local education authority to have answered the evidence of the managers as to the difficulty of obtaining the proper staff for the school at the salaries that were proposed; but, in the exercise of their discretion, advised as they were by eminent and able counsel, they declined to produce any evidence at all. I have no doubt they were very wise in their generation, but it shows that they had no case. Therefore, all the more do I claim that we are entitled to have this evidence laid on the Table.<lb/>
It may be said that the local education authority were doing their best and were really trying to get this school into a proper state of efficiency. I am afraid that is an argument that will hardly hold water. There was a discussion some little time ago&#x2014;it was quoted in your Lordships' House by the right rev. Prelate the Bishop of St. Davids last year&#x2014;in the Town Council of Swansea, not acting as the local education authority but as the town council. They had been asked by the Board of Education what they had to say against this charge brought against them by the managers that they were failing to keep the school efficient. A discussion took place upon that subject, and the bent of mind of at all events a large majority of the Town Council of Swansea was clearly shown in the resolution put forward and, I believe, declared to have been carried by the Mayor, but whether it was placed upon the records of the council I very much doubt. What was it? This is the proposed answer to an application from the Board of Education for an explanation of the improper non-maintenance of the school. The resolution ran&#x2014;
<quote>"That the Board of Education be informed that the explanation of the Swansea Local Educational Authority for differentiating between the teachers of the provided and the non-provided schools is that the majority of the members being out of sympathy with the Voluntary schools desire to make the maintenance of the latter as difficult as possible."</quote>
Does not that show the bent of mind of the local education authority in dealing with a matter of this kind?<lb/>
There is one other matter as to which I must say a word. In December last, two days before the decision given by the President of the Board of Education, he is reported in a local newspaper, an organ of his own party, the <i>South Wales Daily News</i>, to have had an interview with a
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0214"/>
<col>379</col>
representative of that newspaper, and to have said that he was dissatisfied with Mr. Hamilton's Report and that he "did not mean to give the Swansea people away." That statement also appeared in <i>The Times</i>, in a letter written by the right rev. Prelate the Bishop of St. Davids in December last; but it has never been contradicted. It is certainly to my mind a statement that throws a very lurid light upon the operations of the Board of Education in this matter. It is a very serious allegation indeed, and one that I think it will be well to clear up if any clearing up is possible.<lb/>
I pass on for a moment to ask your Lordships to consider what has been up to the present time recognised as the law upon this question of differentiation of salaries. I shall read two or three quotations from the statements of persons in a position to give authoritative decisions. Sir William Anson, in the House of Commons in 1903, in answer to a question, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The standard of efficiency at which all public elementary schools are maintained must be alike, unless special educational reasons can be shown for a distinction."</quote>
Sir John Lawson, when Attorney-General, arguing for the Board of Education in the West Riding case before the House of Lords, stated very clearly what the law was. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"In this position of affairs the Education Act of 1902 was passed, the intention being, for the purpose of maintenance, to throw the two classes of school into one category, and to give to the non-provided schools the advantages which up to that time the provided schools only had enjoyed. In other words, the object was to provide out of public funds for the maintenance of non-provided schools on exactly the same footing and in the same way as the provided schools had been maintained prior to 1902."</quote>
I now come down to 1906. Mr. Birrell was then President of the Board of Education, and in July, 1906, in the present Swansea case, Mr. Birrell wrote as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"The Board of Education are not aware of any circumstances which would justify a differentiation in the salaries paid to teachers in Voluntary and Council schools. They feel that the present uncertainty is unjust to the teachers, and is gravely imperilling the efficiency of the schools. They trust, therefore, to learn at an early date that the authority will give their consent to the agreements prepared. In view of the provisions of Article 15 of the Code, the Board do not feel able to sanction payment of the grants for the National and York Place Schools until they are assured that this matter has been satisfactorily arranged."</quote>
<col>380</col>
Therefore, we have Mr. Birrell's statement of what he considered at that time to be the law. The noble Earl, Lord Crewe, said on March 23, 1908, in your Lordships' House&#x2014;
<quote>"There is no change whatever in the view of the Board that, speaking generally, it is a desirable thing that the same salaries should be paid in the Voluntary schools as are paid in the Council schools. The right rev. Prelate quoted a letter written in July, 1906, when Mr. Birrell was at the Board of Education, in which it was stated that the Board are not aware of any circumstances which would justify a differentiation in the salaries paid to teachers in Voluntary and Council schools. So far, then, that is common ground."</quote>
I think that entirely destroys the allegation in the decision at which the Board of Education have just arrived. Of course, I may be told, "Lord Crewe merely said that generally speaking it was desirable." Yes, generally speaking "unless exceptional educational conditions are found to exist." That was Mr. Birrell's view adopted last year by Lord Crewe; and what is the fact as regards the present state of things in the Swansea school? We have the definite and clear statement by Mr. Hamilton himself that he had not been able to hear or find out any exceptional circumstances in the course of his enquiry which would justify any differentiation in the salaries paid in the school. I think that really disposes of that part of the story.<lb/>
Then one naturally asks oneself what is the duty of a Government Department charged with <i>quasi</i> judicial functions. I shall venture to quote the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, who, in giving judgment recently in a case before the House of Lords with reference to the duties of licensing magistrates, whose position as an administrative body exercising <i>quasi</i> judicial powers is analogous to that of the Board of Education in the present case, said that&#x2014;
<quote>"They must, of course, act honestly and endeavour to carry out the spirit and purpose of the statute."</quote>
I will not attempt to say a word upon that. It bears the impress of the noble and learned Lord on its face. I quote one more authority, that of Mr. Justice Channell. Mr. Justice Channell, in the recent Garforth case, in which the action of the Board of Education was challenged, laid down the obvious principle of law that&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0215"/>
<col>381</col>
<quote>"Neither the local education authority nor the Board of Education had any right to say that because they did not like a law they would give directions that would frustrate its objects."</quote>
I rest my case as to what should be the duty of an authority, whether it be the local authority or a Government Department, exercising <i>quasi</i> judicial functions, on the words of those two learned Judges. So far as I can judge, there has been all through this matter a distinct and intentional evasion of the spirit if not of the letter of the law. I will give your Lordships a few reasons why I say that. I say it has been distinct, it has been intentional, and I am afraid I ought to add also it has been long continued. There has been a very continued attack upon education carried on, as your Lordships are aware, in Wales. There has been what has been commonly known as the Welsh revolt, but the Welsh revolt when it is in the hands of Ministers, when advocated by Ministers, is a far more serious thing for the State and the country than when it is advocated by outsiders and persons of no responsibility. Therefore, I ask your indulgence while I trace what has been done in this matter.<lb/>
In March, 1903, speaking at a meeting of the Free Church Council at Brighton, Mr. Lloyd George moved a resolution urging the principle that local authorities should refuse to apply rates to Voluntary schools. The burden of his speech was that the object of the Act of 1902 was to be evaded in practice, especially by a method of delay, <i>i.e</i>., the Welsh local authorities were to adjourn complaints from managers or from Whitehall from meeting to meeting. Ultimately, he said, the local authority attacked by the Board of Education under the Conservative Government, might decline to hold meetings and so render futile any attempt on the part of the Board of Education to <i>mandamus</i> it to maintain a Church School properly. He ridiculed the machinery of the Education Act of 1902 as quite useless for the purpose of enforcing its aim and object, and ended with these significant words:&#x2014;
<quote>"The Education Act was a great Act. It was a hopeless Act, and if the County Councils of England did what the County Councils of Wales meant to do, it would be a dead letter."</quote><lb/>
That was in 1903. I think that is a clear attack upon the spirit of the Act, not, however, by a Minister of the Crown.
<col>382</col>
But I will go on. In a further speech made by Mr. Lloyd George to a general conference of representatives of Welsh local authorities at Cardiff on October 6, 1904, the principle upon which Welsh local authorities were to construe an Act of Parliament was clearly laid down. Mr. Lloyd George expressly referred to the arguments of his opponents that local authorities must carry out the spirit of an Act of Parliament, and derided the contention. He proceeded&#x2014;
<quote>"They say, 'You administer only the letter of the law.' Yes, we administer the letter that killeth. They say we evade the spirit of the law Have you ever heard of a <i>mandamus</i> to compel a man to carry out the spirit of the law? Who are these gentlemen who say you must carry out the law in the spirit, and not the letter?"</quote>
That was in 1904. I now come to 1906. Mr. Lloyd George was then a Cabinet Minister and President of the Board of Trade. Just at the time when the President of the Board of Education was insisting on the local authority of Swansea doing its duty, the President of the Board of Trade went down to Cardiff and presided over a gathering at which the position of Swansea, as between the local education authority and the Board of Education, was discussed. A resolution was proposed urging the local authority to keep up its rebellion against the Board of Education. The President of the Board of Trade said he did not think he could quite second the motion, but, as chairman, he put it as against his colleague in the Cabinet. Those are strong measures and strong words from a Cabinet Minister. But I have another quotation from the same source.<lb/>
Just before Christmas at Liverpool, Mr. Lloyd George, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, advocated the same principles in the most open manner in an attack upon the House of Lords for not allowing Mr. Birrell's Bill of 1906 to go through. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"We have already made their Act of 1902 a burden to them in their own country, and we shall continue to do so until we get redress. And you may depend upon it that if the people there find they cannot get redress by constitutional means they will be driven into making these institutions intolerable."</quote>
And he concluded&#x2014;
<quote>"And we can do it by keeping within the law."</quote>
If that is not a defiance, in plain terms, by a Minister of the Crown of the spirit of an
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0216"/>
<col>383</col>
Act of Parliament, I should like to know what is. There is, as your Lordships will observe, no statement of any legal point in the decision of the Board. They lay down distinctly that the true question at issue between the authority and the managers is one of fact, but I am told that there is some question of law to be raised in your Lordships' House as an answer to all this. We should be curious to know what it is, and I hope, if the noble Viscount is going to raise a point of law, he will make it perfectly clear and definite, so that we may know what that point of law is. We are entitled to think there may be something in this, because, speaking upon the Address in another place, the Prime Minister used these words upon this subject. Alluding to the state of things in connection with the Swansea school, Mr. Asquith said&#x2014;
<quote>"Is it a state of things which does not exist now under the law as passed and amended by the right hon. gentleman? Will anyone tell me that there is a legal obligation, under the right hon. gentleman's Act or any other, upon the local authorities of the County to make the salaries in all the schools under their control the same and identical? I am not speaking in favour of starving salaries; I am speaking of the law. The hon. gentleman is a lawyer, and he knows very well that this is purely a legal question."</quote>
It is not made a legal question in the decision of the Board of Education, but it is said to be a purely legal question by the Prime Minister. Mr. Asquith continued&#x2014;
<quote>"The Board of Education was simply invoked as a Court of Appeal. My right hon. friend did as he was bound to do. He took the highest advice he could get on the point at issue. The principal Law Officer of the Crown dealt with the legal question&#x2014;</quote>
I ask, what was the legal question put to the Law Officer of the Crown?&#x2014;
<quote>"and my right hon. friend, as anyone in his position was bound to do, followed the advice of his legal adviser and gave his award accordingly. That is the whole story."</quote>
That is the justification for the anticipation that some legal point is to be raised, and that we are not to be told to rely entirely upon facts. I trust it will be made perfectly clear; and if it is a legal question, I hope it may be decided by a Court of law. I would remind the noble Viscount that in another case bearing upon the Education Acts, in which a point of law was raised&#x2014;the West Riding case&#x2014;the Board of Education then said they did not propose to raise any technical point as to their right absolutely to decide this
<col>384</col>
question under Section 7, Subsection (3) of the Act of 1902; but that they would raise no obstacle whatever to the case being taken to a Court of Appeal and being heard there. If a serious question of law does arise, I think we can put it to the noble Lord that in all fairness this case should be dealt with in the same way. All through this matter, all through these speeches which I have had to quote to your Lordships, what has been openly advocated and avowed is the intention to violate the spirit of the law. There can be no doubt of that. This is no mere local question. It is not, believe me, a question that can be brushed aside as a little squabble between a local authority and the managers of this school. Graver interests are concerned. It is a very serious case of neglect of duty by a Department of the State, and a Department entrusted with <i>quasi</i> judicial functions. It is a neglect of duty that must shake the confidence of the country in the impartiality and justice of public Departments; and it must tend to make us feel that we shall be much safer in the hands of a Court of law. That is a very sad conclusion to come to, but there can be no other conclusion unless the Departments of the State are to be purged from the unfairness which distinguishes the conduct of the whole of this matter. As I have said, this is not a small matter, or one of local interest alone. In my belief it goes to the root of our present method of dealing with local questions and matters of fact in Acts of Parliament by leaving them for <i>quasi</i> judicial decision by Departments of the State. That is the reason I have ventured to bring this case to your Lordships' notice.<lb/>

<p>*<member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, before I attempt to reply on the subject-matter of the noble Earl's speech, I must at once deal with what I think the noble Earl will regret&#x2014;namely, the charge he made regarding the conduct of the President of the Board of Education. I agree that if the conduct of the Minister had been such as the noble Earl described it would have been deserving of severe censure, but having known Mr. Runciman for many
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0217"/>
<col>385</col>
years I felt instinctively that it was impossible that the statement made could have any foundation in fact. My right hon. friend happened to be on the steps of the Throne while the noble Earl was speaking, and he has sent me an absolute categorical denial of every word of that accusation. His words are&#x2014;
<quote>"To the statement attributed to me by a newspaper quoted by Earl Cawdor I give the most unqualified denial."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>EARL CAWDOR </member>: <membercontribution>Of course, I accept the denial of the President of the Board of Education, and any statement I made which he says is not accurate I withdraw at once. But I wish to point out to the noble Viscount that the statement was repeated in a letter published in <i>The Times</i> in December last, and not until now have we heard one syllable of contradiction. As I say, I accept the contradiction of the President of the Board, but I do think it is to be regretted that the contradiction has been deferred for three months.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON </member>: <membercontribution>I am a very sedulous newspaper reader myself, but I never saw the accusation or heard of the statement until the noble Earl brought it forward to-night.<lb/>
A great deal of what the noble Earl said was contained in the speeches made twelve months ago, when the subject was discussed at great length in your Lordships' House. On that occasion my noble friend the Leader of the House, who I am sorry to say is unavoidably prevented from being in his place to-night, made the following observations in his speech:&#x2014;
<quote>"I am not concerned with the administration of the Department. From my view of it" [the Swansea case] "the whole matter has been a very unfortunate squabble between the managers on the one side and the local education authority on the other, with occasional references, of course, from both to the Board of Education, conducted with extreme ingenuity and skill on both sides. But the skill has not always, I think, been employed to serve the best interests of education, and there has been an occasional loss of temper on both sides which did not reflect entire credit upon either party;"</quote>
and, standing in the place which the noble Earl would have occupied if he had been here to-night, I fully endorse that statement. It has been a squabble, and there has been a great deal said upon both sides which is I think to be regretted.
<col>386</col>
The noble Earl opposite went into the history of the case, but he did not mention that many of the questions that arose between the local education authority and the board of managers have been settled to the satisfaction of all parties. The Government have not been indifferent to the merits of the question raised by the noble Earl. In the first place, I ask your Lordships to accept as the basis of my argument that the fixing of the amounts of salaries rests solely and exclusively with the education authority. That is their absolute duty, and in regard to that I may refer to the proceedings in the House of Commons when Clause 7 of the Act of 1902 was under discussion. There were several discussions in the House of Commons as to the exact amount of responsibility and financial power which should be vested in the local education authority, and Mr. Bryce, in order evidently to have it perfectly clear, said he would ask one question with regard to the salary of the teachers, which would be the most important element of expenditure. Mr. Bryce proceeded&#x2014;
<quote>"Did they understand that whenever a teacher had to be appointed the managers would have to go to the local authority and obtain sanction to fix that salary at a certain figure, or would the managers be able, before they consulted the local authority, to advertise for a teacher at a certain salary?"</quote>
Mr. Balfour answered that question in these words&#x2014;
<quote>"He had indeed spoken in vain if he had not made it quite clear to the Committee on the many occasions on which he had addressed it that, according to his view, the staffing of the schools and the payment of the teachers' salaries were all matters within the determination of the local authority. When he had talked in the House and in the country of secular education being under popular control, he had always meant what he said. It appeared to him that the determination of the staff and the salaries of the teachers in the various schools were perhaps the most important subject with which the education authority would have to deal."</quote>
Therefore I venture to say, with all deference, that the legal position of this matter is that whereas the Voluntary or non-provided schools were to be supported by the local authority, the local authority themselves were to be the uncontrolled judges&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ASHBOURNE </member>: <membercontribution>Subject to maintaining the schools and maintaining them efficiently.</membercontribution></p>

<col>387</col>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON </member>: <membercontribution>I am coming to that. I will endeavour to make myself as clear as the noble Lord desires. I could give a large number of quotations to show that the one principle which was not impugned was that the local authority were to control the expenditure of the money. That is my first point.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ASHBOURNE </member>: <membercontribution>Subject always&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON </member>: <membercontribution>I shall be glad if the noble and learned Lord will allow me to make my own speech in my own way. Along with the local authority's control of the money is the duty to maintain and keep efficient all the public elementary schools within their area. There is no dispute between us on that point. The authority have control of the money, but it is their duty to keep and maintain the schools efficiently. The section specified the expenditure which would devolve upon the managers of the school&#x2014;namely, expenditure other than expenditure for which provision was to be made by the local authority. The managers were required to provide the school house, keep the school in repair, make good certain damage, and so on "out of funds provided by them." A difference of opinion arose between the managers and the local education authority. I will not go into the various statements because the noble Earl's quotations were quite accurate as to that, though I do not think the point at issue was touched upon until just at the close of the noble Earl's speech. I will read the exact clause (Section 7, Subsection (1) of the Act of 1902)&#x2014;
<quote>"The local education authority shall maintain and keep efficient all public elementary schools within their area which are necessary, and have the control of all expenditure required for that purpose, other than expenditure for which, under this Act, provision is to be made by the managers."</quote>
Then I come to Subsection (3)&#x2014;
<quote>"If any question arises under this section between the local education authority and the managers of a school not provided by the authority, that question shall be determined by the Board of Education."</quote>
There is no arbitration there; it is the final decision; and whatever that decision is I do not think it is fair or just to attribute to the Board of Education improper motives. The noble Earl has quoted what he says the local education authority of
<col>388</col>
Swansea did, but that is not the Board of Education.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CAWDOR </member>: <membercontribution>But what the Board knew the authority were doing.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON </member>: <membercontribution>Under Section 23, subsection (10) the Board of Education may, if they think fit, hold a public Inquiry for the purpose of the exercise of any of their powers or the performance of any of their duties under the Act. Under that clause, therefore, the Board of Education determined to hold this public Inquiry on the question which had arisen between the two contending parties. The Board selected, as the noble Earl has said with perfect truth, an extremely able man, who has since been appointed to the Judicial Bench, to conduct the Inquiry, but he did not go down there as a Judge to try the case; he went there to report on the facts of the case to the Board of Education. The noble Earl seemed to think it had passed out of the hands of the Board, and that they had delegated their powers to Mr. Hamilton.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CAWDOR </member>: <membercontribution>I did not say that.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON </member>: <membercontribution>But the noble Earl's argument was based on that. The Board did nothing of the sort. Mr. Hamilton was in precisely the same position as an inspector of the Local Government Board sent out to hold a public inquiry. Hundreds of inquiries are held in this country every year by regular and special inspectors of the Local Government Board. Do the Local Government Board accept the decision of their inspectors in every case? No. They are not bound to accept a decision; the inspector's duty is discharged when he has made his report.<lb/>
We then come to what the noble Earl has laid such stress upon, and what he calls the facts of the case. Mr. Hamilton's argument is a subtle one. He states the facts very clearly and wipes out completely a great many of the allegations made against the local authority by the managers. His case is that, whereas the school is to be maintained and kept efficient, the non-sanction of the salaries of the teachers which had been fixed would end ultimately in making the school non-efficient and not properly maintained. Mr. Hamilton states clearly what his view is on that point. In paragraph 15 of his Report he says&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0219"/>
<col>389</col>
<quote>"Evidence was given before me that, in the opinion of the witnesses called on behalf of the managers, the refusal to pay to the teachers in the Oxford Street School the same rates of remuneration as were paid to teachers of the same qualifications in provided schools prejudices and imperils the efficiency of the school."</quote>
He stated that it had been said that it did. But in the next paragraph Mr. Hamilton says&#x2014;
<quote>"I have to report as to the facts as follows: The Oxford Street School has regularly earned the grant and to that extent has been maintained and kept efficient, but this has been done, not by the authority alone, but only by the combination of funds provided by the authority and of funds collected by the managers."</quote>
The scale of salaries fixed was the scale in force when the local education authority came into power. The question really arose upon increasing the salaries.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CAWDOR </member>: <membercontribution>As the other salaries were increased.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON </member>: <membercontribution>Yes, they were increased under pressure. Advertisements had been refused insertion because the National Union of Teachers had been offended. It really was to a great extent a trade union dispute. In the next sentence of his report Mr. Hamilton says&#x2014;
<quote>"But for these sums provided by the managers, in my opinion the school would before now have ceased to be efficient in any sense. As it is, though it continues in a state of efficiency by earning the grant, its efficiency is, owing to the course taken by the authority, precarious. It is further jeopardised by the departure of experienced teachers and by the dissatisfaction and unrest created among those who remain."</quote>
There is no necessity to dispute that. We will admit that the school has been jeopardised; we will admit that it is being jeopardised; the point is,&#x2014;is it now efficient? If the managers had allowed it to become inefficient, then the power of the Board of Education would come in. There is no conspiracy, as the noble Earl seems to think, on the part of the Board of Education to do what is unjust and unfair. The Board took the opinion of the principal Law Officer of the Crown as to their position, and the Attorney-General was perfectly definite on the point that you could not act upon a contingency which might happen and which might not happen, and he advised that the President of the Board could not apply for a <i>mandamus.</i> That is the whole secret of this great
<col>390</col>
<quote>"conspiracy." There is, as I have said, no conspiracy whatever. The Board of Education is an impartial body; its Presidents, I presume, are not bound to follow exactly the policy of their predecessors.</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>EARL CAWDOR </member>: <membercontribution>I did not suggest that there was a conspiracy on the part of the Board of Education. I traced a conspiracy through other hands, beginning with those who were not in office and proceeding until they held the office of Minister of the Crown. By that I said there was a conspiracy to defeat the spirit of the Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON </member>: <membercontribution>But now you are dealing with the Board of Education of which Mr. Runciman is the President, and I was sorry to see the statement made by a member of the other House that Mr. Runciman's action in this matter disentitled him to any consideration. The most rev. Primate knows as well as I do that no one has worked in a more conciliatory or fair manner than Mr. Runciman. The Government are willing to lay the Minutes of Evidence taken before Mr. Hamilton. The position of the Government is this. If the actual event which Mr. Hamilton expects does happen, and if what is a contingency becomes a fact, then the Board of Education will proceed accordingly; but at present they are advised that they have no power to obtain a <i>mandamus</i>. That is the answer to the case which the noble Earl has made. I can only say, in conclusion, that I deplore a good deal of the feeling that has been generated, and I hope, in the interests of education, for a settlement; but the two principles to be maintained are that the school must be kept efficient and that the education authority must be supreme in reference to the expenditure of the money they raise.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I cannot help thinking that the noble Viscount has somewhat minimised the importance of this case. It seems to me that the question is very much deeper than that of merely a squabble in Swansea. In the first place, I should like very much to know what the noble Viscount regards as the duty of the local education authority, and, secondly, what he thinks is the duty of the Board of Education. It is perfectly
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0220"/>
<col>391</col>
true that the Board of Education is the final authority. If it were not, I suppose recourse might be had to a Court of Law; but it is the final authority, and my noble friend behind me is arraigning the conduct of the Board of Education. Does the noble Viscount suggest that the Board of Education claims the right to give different salaries to the Church of England school because it is a Church of England school? Does he claim that right? He does not answer my question, and, therefore, until I hear the contrary, I shall assume that he does.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON </member>: <membercontribution>I said it would be most unjust.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY </member>: <membercontribution>I understand the noble Viscount does not claim that right on behalf of the Board of Education. What, then, is the question raised in this case? If it is a question of fact&#x2014;whether or not differentiation has been made&#x2014;that has been decided by Mr. Hamilton's finding, and the Education Board, having told us it is a question of fact, take their own view when the fact is found against their view and set aside the finding. That is the state of facts, and it seems to me to reduce it to this, that the Board of Education do claim that which the noble Viscount has disavowed. They do claim the right to affirm the conduct of the education authority in Swansea which is to differentiate between the salaries of the two classes of teachers. That has been found as a fact. Mr. Hamilton has also found as a fact that there is no educational distinction which could make the difference between the two sets of salaries. I really am unable to understand what the answer is. It comes to this&#x2014;that because under the Statute the Board of Education is made the final Court of Appeal they are able to disobey the law, which is that there should be equality of treatment unless there is something to differentiate between the two. It is found as a fact by their own Commissioner sent down for the purpose of ascertaining the facts that there is no distinction which justifies differentiation. The only defence, it seems to me, which the noble Viscount could in fact make would be that the school was kept efficient. But how? Because although the education authority in Swansea neglected their duty other people who care more for education of the young have, out of their own pockets, provided
<col>392</col>
the funds which it was the duty of the education authority to provide. That is their default. Mr. Hamilton says so in terms. I will read his words&#x2014;
<quote>"I have to report that the Borough Council of Swansea, the local education authority within whose area the Oxford Street (Church of England) School is, have committed a 'default in the performance of their duties as respects' that school, and 'have failed to fulfil' part of their duties under the Elementary Education Acts, 1870 to 1900, and the Education Act, 1902, namely, their duty under Section 7 of the last-named Act, to 'maintain and keep efficient' the Oxford Street (Church of England) School, being a public elementary school within their area."</quote>
It is a mere juggling of words to say that the school has been kept efficient. That the school has been kept efficient is true, but it has been done, not by the education authority; yet the duty of keeping it efficient rests with the education authority. It is not the whole duty that the school has been kept efficient. The whole duty is that the school should be kept efficient by the local education authority. That has obviously been neglected, and&#x2014;can anyone doubt after what my noble friend behind me has said?&#x2014;because it is a Church of England school, and because the members of the Swansea Borough Council are not, as it is said, in sympathy with the Education Act of 1902. It appears to me a mere delusion to say that because the school has been in fact kept efficient by somebody else that is a performance of their duty by the local education authority. I must say, not perhaps for the first time, that this substitution of Ministerial directions for the requirements of a Statute is a very serious symptom. Noble Lords opposite forget, I think, that it is not absolutely certain that they will always be in office. Has it not occurred to them that they are establishing precedents which may be extremely inconvenient hereafter&#x2014;precedents which I hope those with whom I usually act will not follow? But a very serious precedent is established when a Minister of the Crown, whose duty it is to impartially administer the law, disobeys an Act of Parliament because he is not in sympathy with it. What would be said of a Judge who did that? It has been suggested against Judges before now, but I am afraid it has not increased their reputation when the imputation has been successful that they have allowed themselves to be swayed in the administration of justice by the views they held on the particular topic
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0221"/>
<col>393</col>
which was under discussion. But there is here, it seems to me, an outrageous violation of a distinct obligation created by Parliament, made all the more serious because of a deliberate overruling upon a question of fact found by a man of the eminence of Mr. Hamilton. I say it is a disobedience of the law not to provide funds which they are required by law to provide simply because somebody else has aided by contributing to prevent the school becoming inefficient. I say that that is a deliberate defiance of the law, and one which I hope this House at all events will condemn.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD STANLEY OF ALDERLEY </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I wish, first of all, emphatically to affirm that the noble and learned Earl who has just spoken has introduced into the Act of 1902, not once but three or four times, a word, which is not to be found in it. The noble and learned Earl has repeatedly declared that the Act of 1902 imposed upon local authorities the obligation of equality of treatment. I say that is absolutely incorrect. The only obligation which that Act imposed upon local authorities was the obligation to maintain and keep efficient. Efficiency is a perfectly well understood thing in the language of elementary schools. It is that which satisfies the requirements of the Code, and which the Government, through their inspectors, accept. But after you have come up to that standard of efficiency there is no obligation to give to every school the same full measure of efficiency that the local authority may choose to give to some schools.<lb/>
A local authority may provide special subjects, such as French, mathematics, woodwork and cookery instruction, in its own schools; but the Board of Education possess no power whatever to require the local authority to provide those things for the aided schools. The aided schools are entitled under the Act to have that which the Code requires to satisfy the test of efficiency. A council school may be staffed throughout with certificated teachers, but an aided school has no right to demand that it shall be staffed entirely with certificated teachers. The only obligation, as I have said, is to maintain efficient. I am not now on the second point of the noble and learned Earl&#x2014;that there was failure to maintain efficiency because that efficiency was secured by contributions from others;
<col>394</col>
I am now dealing with his point that there was an obligation to maintain equal efficiency, and I deny that that is part of the law.<lb/>
I now come to the question of the school being maintained efficient and the question of the subsidy. I have not the slightest doubt that the managers, in order to retain their staff, might, from their own point of view, be well advised in making up to those teachers the extra salary necessary to put them on the same footing with the teachers in the provided schools. It would have been inconvenient to them, no doubt, if any of their teachers had resigned and they had been compelled to get other teachers who did not know the school. But the whole argument of Mr. Hamilton is hypothetical. It is contended that if the Oxford Street School had not been subsidised it must have become inefficient. I will tell your Lordships a fact that has not been mentioned in this discussion.<lb/>
There are in Swansea no fewer than eight non-provided schools; three of them are in joint management, with Mr. Eden as the active secretary. The fight has nominally been on the Oxford Street School, but I have no doubt that those fighting for that school were fighting indirectly for the two other schools, and I am informed that some of the salaries in the two other schools under their management have been supplemented. Therefore I agree that, as to these three schools out of the eight, efficiency has been maintained partly by the contributions of the managers. But it is a very great step from that to infer that efficiency would not have been maintained without those contributions. The Town Council of Swansea have determined to maintain the old salaries in all the aided schools, and it is only in those for which Mr. Eden acts that the matter has gone so far that the salaries have been augmented by the managers. The other non-provided schools have had no supplementary aid; but in all efficiency has been maintained to the satisfaction of the Board of Education. It is not right, therefore, to infer that the Oxford Street School must have failed had such aid not been given.<lb/>
The question before us to-day is one of law. If the people of Swansea acted within their legal rights it is useless to express resentment because your view does not coincide with theirs. A great many sen-

<col>395</col>
tences have been read out to-night from the speeches of various persons, and some of those expressions have increased my desire to be cautious against what are known as <i>obiter dicta</i>. One of the speakers quoted has written book on that subject, and I think he recognises by now how unfortunate for a man his <i>obiter dicta</i> are. The noble Viscount who spoke for the Government quoted the clear words of Mr. Arthur Balfour&#x2014;that in this question of salaries the responsibility of determination rests with the local authority, and that so long as the school is efficient no one can go into the question of salaries. The constant practice of the Board of Education since the passing of the Act was stated by Sir W. Anson, in reply to a question in the other House on August 4, 1903, in these terms&#x2014;
<quote>"The local authority has, under Section 7 of the Education Act, the control of all expenditure required for the purpose of maintaining and keeping efficient the public elementary schools within its area. The matter of teachers' salaries is not one in which the Board of Education would intervene unless it could be shown that the reduction of salaries amounted to a failure of a local authority in its duty to maintain and keep efficient a public elementary school."</quote>
Everyone will agree that if the local authority told the managers they would not sanction more than a certain scale of salaries and the managers could not get teachers at those salaries a case of inefficiency would have arisen and the Board of Education would be bound to interfere. But you cannot act upon the hypothetical argument, especially when you have the evidence that in many of the eight non-provided schools in Swansea the scale of salaries denounced as inadequate has not led to inefficiency.<lb/>
The noble Earl read the resolution carried by the vote of the Mayor in the Swansea Town Council as showing the real purpose and design of the local authority in their action, but I fancy the noble Earl knows the history of that resolution. It was carried by a snatch vote seized by the Conservatives in order to annoy their opponents, and I am informed that at a meeting called immediately afterwards the resolution was rescinded. We have heard a great deal of virtuous indignation against Ministers who act politically when they ought to act judicially. I agree; but you must not confound administrative with judicial action. The Board of Education have been notorious for its gross
<col>396</col>
partiality to Voluntary schools and for its unfairness to Council schools.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY </member>: <membercontribution>Will the noble Lord give cases?</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD STANLEY OF ALDERLEY </member>: <membercontribution>Yes. In October, 1902, on the eve of the passing of the Education Act of that year, by which Voluntary school managers would be screwed up a bit and compelled to make their buildings more suitable, the noble Marquess, who was then President of the Board of Education, addressed a conference of the chief inspectors under the Board, and, according to a report officially communicated to <i>The Times,</i> deprecated a too rigid application of the rules as to buildings and playgrounds, especially in the case of village schools. The noble Marquess said that many village schools which did not possess the best lighting and heating were yet giving the best education. I have been looking through the reports of our medical inspectors in the county of Anglesea, and I notice that they call attention to the serious condition of the sight of the children in village schools and dwell on the fact that in some cases the bad structure and bad lighting of the schools are responsible. Surely children in the country as well as in towns are entitled not to freeze in winter, and not to have their eyesight ruined by bad lighting. My point is that when we have this virtuous denunciation from noble Lords opposite of what Liberal Ministers are doing, they should look at home a little and see what a Conservative Minister for Education did on the eve of an Act becoming law, and by whose action an attempt was made to minimise the one great security that we had in return for giving public support with private management.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, my noble friend behind me so completely stated the case of the Swansea school that it would be a waste of your Lordships' time for me to go over that ground again; but I venture to say that my noble friend has received no answer. With regard to what has been said by the noble Lord who has just sat down, I submit that the Act of 1902 did impose on local authorities the obligation of maintaining the efficiency of all schools; and I think the statements of the noble Viscount the Lord President and of Lord Stanley have been more in the direction of trying to
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0223"/>
<col>397</col>
drag a red herring across the course than of defending the line that has been taken.<lb/>
I do not deny for one moment that the local authority are able to say that this particular school is efficient, but it is efficient not on account of the support of the local education authority but in consequence of the generosity of the managers, who are determined to support the school at all costs to themselves. I entirely dissent from the view of the local education authority in this case that the school is efficient, and can be kept efficient, even if they pay the teachers in the non-provided schools lower salaries than are paid to the teachers in the provided schools. If that were so, either the Council school teachers are receiving too high salaries or the teachers in the other schools are being under paid. The whole system of education is precisely the same in the two classes of schools. Why, therefore, should one set of teachers be paid on a higher scale?<lb/>
The noble Lord opposite quoted the reply of Sir William Anson, for which I, as Minister for Education, was entirely responsible. What Sir William Anson said was this&#x2014;
<quote>"The matter of teachers' salaries is not one in which the Board of Education would intervene unless it should be shown that the reduction of salaries amounted to a failure of the local education authority in its duty to maintain and keep efficient a public elementary school."</quote>
I submit that in the case of the Swansea school the reduction of salaries has been shown to be a failure within the meaning of the Act by the Board of Education's own Commissioner. The Board of Education, in the letter conveying their decision, say&#x2014;
<quote>"It is suggested that the future efficiency of the school would be imperilled by the employment of teachers at the lower rate of pay, but this is a somewhat remote speculation."</quote>
How can this be said to be a remote speculation when it is admitted that the National Union of Teachers have advised their members not to accept service on the lower scale of salaries? It is not a speculation but more or less a certainty that this school cannot be maintained efficient unless something is done.<lb/>
I had not intended to speak at any length on this question, because it is more of a legal nature. But I cannot pass unnoticed the criticisms made upon myself
<col>398</col>
by the noble Lord who has just sat down. I regret the partial attitude which has been adopted by the Board of Education, in whose whole action during the last three years I see an endeavour to squeeze out and destroy denominational schools and to injure denominational teachers. I do not say for one moment that that policy is antagonistic to the feelings of a great many supporters of the present Government, but this I do say&#x2014;that a great Department like the Board of Education should hold the scales fairly between all parties. The partial attitude of the Board in this matter is doing grievous injury to departmental administration. I have never made any secret of my belief in, and support of, Church of England schools, of which I have given practical proof in the district in which I live; but I have never allowed my own bias or prejudice to lead me even to think of doing an injustice to the schools of any other denomination when I was at the Board of Education; and I defy Lord Stanley of Alderley or any other noble Lord to bring against my administration of the Education Acts a single case in which I have shown the slightest partiality or done the slightest injustice.<lb/>
The noble Lord laid great stress on the fact that on assuming office I had invited the inspectors of the Board from all parts of England to meet me. I did so advisedly. I wanted to learn, and I thought those inspectors could teach me. I heard their views and gave them mine. I certainly did tell them I laid great stress on children having physical exercise to develop their chests and I also spoke of the importance of outdoor exercise; but I said I thought that in rural districts playgrounds were not so necessary as in crowded towns, because the children came to school across fields and got exercise in that way. I also told them that they ought to induce the teachers to initiate the children into all the interests of the districts in which they lived, in order that they might be induced to remain in those districts when they grew up. If the same situation occurred again I should certainly do the same thing. In conclusion, I would express the hope that the Board of Education will not continue the partial attitude which it has displayed during the past three years. The President of the Board of Education, shortly after taking office, said he would be no party to vindictive ad-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0224"/>
<col>399</col>
ministration but would endeavour to do justice to all parties. He has an opportunity now, for I do not think any impartial man will contradict me when I say that justice has not been done in this case.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE LORD BISHOP OF SOUTHWARK </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the noble Lord who spoke from the back Bench, Lord Stanley of Alderley&#x2014;whom I feel almost inclined on this occasion to call the noble and gallant Lord, for I think his defence of a very difficult position showed some gallantry&#x2014;offered, as I understand, apologies for the action of the Government which they have not offered for themselves. It seems to me that our great interest at the present moment, whatever view we take on the education question, is that we should preserve as far as possible a high tone in dealing with the matter, and that whatever is done we should act from different sides in a way perfectly respectful to one another's position. Now, what was the noble Lord's contention? He has contended that it would be within the power of a local authority to treat quite differently, so long only as technical efficiency is maintained, two classes of schools within its area, and he illustrated that by what was a perfectly inadequate illustration. He said the authority may think it right to give in certain selected schools classes in woodcarving, cookery, and so on, which it would be unreasonable to require should be given in all schools. That certainly is very far from justifying the conclusion that, either legally or morally, a local authority, working under the present Education Acts, is entitled to differentiate, according to its own will, between two classes of schools. Therefore I am very glad that defence has not been put forward by His Majesty's Government. Again, the noble Lord went perilously near, I thought, to laying down that when a great public Department has got to act in its administrative character it cannot be expected to be too judicial. Now, that is the very thing that we most want to maintain, that when a public Department is charged with functions of this kind it should be as judicial as possible in the administration of them. Therefore I am glad again that it was the noble Lord who offered that defence and not the spokesman of the Government. But what was the defence offered by the noble Viscount the Lord President of the Council, who, I could not help feeling, seemed to labour under a sense that he had rather a heavy case to
<col>400</col>
maintain? If I understood the noble Viscount rightly, the defence was that the President of the Board of Education had received legal advice which he was practically bound to follow. If that is so, we are in one sense very grateful for the explanation, because I think I shall not be saying anything improper when I say that, after all that has taken place recently with regard to the education question, the reputation of the present President of the Board of Education is an asset which is valuable to all parties; and, if it be true that, having to act in this difficult case, he was obliged to consult the Law Officers and having consulted them was bound to follow their advice, it may well be that we who are jealous of his reputation may feel that we have found some other party on whom to throw what seems to me the very onerous blame in this case. The advice given to the President of the Board of Education seems to be that the impossibility of maintaining a school efficiently can only be ascertained by letting it become inefficient. I put it to the House whether that is really a maintainable doctrine. Mr. Hamilton said&#x2014;
<quote>"The matter did not rest in opinion only, for evidence was given before me of the actual feeling of the teachers, and it was proved that, while there was a waiting list of applicants for posts in the provided schools so that vacancies were filled without advertisement, vacancies in the Oxford Street Schools were filled, if at all, only with difficulty and delay."</quote>
Therefore they went to the very edge of actual proof. Suppose the managers had let down the school. What would have happened? Has the management of the Swansea case been so remarkable for promptitude that we could be sure that within even three months the thing would, have been set straight? What would have been meanwhile the condition of the children for whom the noble Lord (Lord Stanley) is generally so honourably jealous? The reputation of the present President of the Board of Education is, as I have said, an asset which is valuable to all parties. If he had taken courage and set aside the opinion of his legal advisers he would have saved the Board from this unhappy result, that at a moment when the education question had entered upon a more peaceful phase we should seem to have a more irrefragable instance of how the administrative pressure which has been freely talked of had been applied by a decision which was substantially unfair.</membercontribution></p>

<col>401</col>
<p><member>LORD ASHBOURNE </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the decision of His Majesty's Government, as stated in the letter of the Board of Education, is intelligible and plain, but I dissent from it. But I do not understand the position taken up by the noble Viscount the Lord President; it is not the same thing. The noble Viscount has not said a word of approval of what has been done, for reasons which I readily appreciate; but he has taken this extraordinary position that, because, under the pressure of necessity, the managers had out of their own pockets raised the teachers' salaries and thus prevented the destruction of their school, they had put themselves out of Court; but that if they had done nothing, if they had allowed their school to go to rack and ruin and to be smashed, then the Board of Education could have gone for their power of <i>mandamus.</i> That is the case that is presented by the noble Viscount.<lb/>
I am informed that Mr. McKenna, the predecessor of the able gentleman who is at the head of the Board of Education at this moment, at an interview with the managers, stated that the payment by the managers of part of the salaries would not be used in the slightest degree to prejudice the case of the managers. If that promise was made, surely, in the name of fairness, commonsense, and common justice, it should be carried out. I do not care a farthing about the technicalities, but surely the managers should not be compelled to have their school destroyed; and if the Minister for Education told them that their school would not suffer because of their generosity, that is an overwhelming reason why the matter should not be pressed in this way. I have said that the speech of the noble Viscount, for whom I have every respect, did not deal at all with the official answer that must have been written after a consultation with the officers and which must have expressed the final view of the Government. He did not touch that. What is their case?<lb/>
The true question at issue between the authority and the managers is one of fact, whether competent teachers can be procured for the Oxford Street Church of England School at the scale of salaries to which the local educational authority consented. If not, then the local education authority have failed in their statutory duty. Have they not failed? Surely you cannot throw aside every page of Mr. Hamilton's Report.
<col>402</col>
Over and over again he affirms that the teachers could not be obtained without the increase. I take my stand upon the official answer of the Board of Education communicating their decision to the parties, by which they are judged, and there is not one solitary syllable to be said in defence of it. The Lord President has not suggested that he can throw over Mr. Hamilton's Report on all its findings. He has not suggested that; it would be an insult to Mr. Hamilton's high character to suggest it. Over and over again Mr. Hamilton indicates that the unraised salaries, which were the only salaries sanctioned by the local authority, made it impossible to run the school, to use a common expression. It was impossible to get the teachers, and the school would have to be closed if that standard were not raised.<lb/>
Surely in dealing with this question we claim to be sensible men. I make no charge against the character and the integrity of the gentlemen who are administering this Act, but I say there has been a grave miscarriage of justice and fair play. I am not going to be dragged into an argument on points of law. For the purposes of argument I am willing to admit what has been said. The responsibility of judgment on Mr. Hamilton's Report when they received it and read it rested with the Board of Education. That is put for the purposes of argument and I accept it for the purposes of argument, though there might be qualifications to be attached. I have read their decision, not that announced by the Lord President of the Council but their decision on the question of whether it was proved that competent teachers could or could not be obtained without an addition to the low salaries sanctioned. Can any human being say that a judgment the contrary of Mr. Hamilton's clear finding can be sustained? Take it that it came before any Court of Law, no matter how humble. Would any Court hesitate? I pass by Courts and I will take any fair man. Take, as a typical fair man, the Lord President of the Council. If he had to read the Report of Mr. Hamilton and to form a decision upon it, would he, or could he, hesitate for a minute in saying, "Let right be done at last by these managers." They have been put off week after week, month after month, and year after year. The school has been in deadly peril with all the anguish of uncertainty, and now your

<col>403</col>
last word apparently is this&#x2014;"You are so good that you put yourselves out of Court. But if you condescend to be ungenerous, make your teachers discontented, make your school inefficient, then come to us," although a former Minister for Education said that such a monstrous consequence was not to follow.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY (LORD FITZMAURICE)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have become almost persuaded during the last two or three minutes in listening to the impassioned oration of the noble and learned Lord who has just sat down that I am not here with other members of His Majesty's Government to explain the conduct of the Board of Education, but that we are members of the Swansea education authority summoned before a committee of noble Lords opposite to answer for our grave crimes and misdemeanours. Because, throughout the speech of the noble and learned Lord, and to a certain extent in the speeches of other noble Lords, there appeared a distinct tendency to assume that we were here to represent the whole case of the Swansea education authority and to support it, not only in principle, but in every detail.<lb/>
My noble friend the Lord President pointed out that the conduct of the Swansea education authority, whether in principle or in detail in this controversy, which has extended over several years, is not the question before the House. The question before the House is whether or not it was the duty of the Board of Education in London to take certain steps in consequence of alleged defaults on the part of the Swansea education authority. That, and that only, is the question before your Lordships this evening. My noble friend pointed out quite distinctly that we have been advised that a case where any intervention on the part of the Board of Education could take place&#x2014;whatever view may be taken, whether favourable or unfavourable, does not signify, of the conduct of the Swansea education authority&#x2014;has not arisen, because the preliminary to any such intervention is, as was stated by the noble and learned Lord himself in perfectly clear language in quoting my noble friend the Lord President, that the school should have fallen into a state of inefficiency.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord does not, I think, dispute that as a legal argument.
<col>404</col>
Nor did I gather from him that, as a lawyer, he questioned it. But what he said was that it was very hard upon this denominational school that, by its own good conduct, as he put it, it should not be able to invoke the assistance of the Board of Education, the reason why the school, according to him, has not fallen into a state of inefficiency being simply and solely because certain voluntary subscriptions were raised and brought into common account with the Government and Borough Council grants. That may be so. But there is an old saying that hard cases may be considered to bring about bad law. The noble and learned Lord opposite may think that the position created in this case is one of some hardship. But with all those opinions I really, on behalf of the Government, feel hardly concerned, because we are not responsible for the conduct of the Swansea education authority throughout a controversy which has gone on for, I think, two or three years. The position of the Swansea education authority is that of every local education authority in England. And here I must say that I do altogether demur&#x2014;I do so, of course, with the greatest respect&#x2014;to the statement of another great legal authority upon the Front Bench opposite. The noble and learned Earl who occupied the Woolsack in the days of the late Government laid down the proposition that there was an actual duty placed by Act of Parliament upon the local authority to observe absolutely equal treatment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY </member>: <membercontribution>I never said by Act of Parliament. That was one of the obligations that arose from the fact of their being obliged to maintain all the schools, and what I said was that there was the obligation of equal treatment. I never said equal salaries.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD FITZMAURICE </member>: <membercontribution>I quoted the noble and learned Earl quite correctly. I did not quote him as having used the expression "Equality of salaries." I said, on the contrary, "equal treatment," or I will put it, if he prefers it, "equality of treatment." I deny, with all respect to the noble and learned Earl, that you can extract out of the well-known clause&#x2014;I think it is Section 7&#x2014;any direction as to equality either of salaries or of treatment; and for a good reason. If any words had been inserted in the Act out of which the construction could have been drawn, it would have placed every local authority throughout
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0227"/>
<col>405</col>
the country in a position of extraordinary difficulty. There are numerous cases where certain inequality of treatment arises out of the actual circumstances of the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY </member>: <membercontribution>I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord again. I pointed out that the only distinction was that where there were educational differentiations that then there might be inequality of treatment.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD FITZMAURICE </member>: <membercontribution>That is where I venture, with great respect, to join issue with the noble and learned Earl. There are a great many cases where, if you take the circumstances connected with large groups of schools together, you will find very great differences which, for example, would justify a local education authority in not giving absolute equality of salaries in every case. I do not wish to take up the time of the House by quoting details, but if the noble and learned Earl would enquire into the history of the administration of this Act since 1902 he would find that, especially in the early days of the Act, there was the greatest inequality, not only of treatment but of salaries, in many counties and in many boroughs of England. I can quote one illustration from my own experience. I remember perfectly well that when the county council of which at that time I was chairman and am now a member, decided to give equality of salaries in all schools, there was a strong body of opinion, not of Church opinion I grant, but consisting entirely of the political friends of noble Lords opposite, opposed to this decision, from the point of view of economy, and it was said, "Why not leave things as you find them? If the salaries were good enough in the Voluntary schools, which greatly predominated, before 1902, why raise them now?" If the county council had said, "We are willing to take that view in order not to increase the county rate and will leave the existing salaries as they stand," there were very strong arguments to be used in favour of that view. Although they were not arguments which commended themselves to my mind, I admit they were arguments legitimately used and used by persons for whom I have the greatest respect.<lb/>
I know also that in several adjacent counties, with the affairs of which I am acquainted, it was, on grounds of economy,
<col>406</col>
a considerable time before a uniform scale was set up from one end of the county to the other, because of the immense increase in the education rate foreseen as likely, and in connection with which, I am sorry to say, the worst fears of those who made those criticisms have been entirely justified. I have found during the last few days a very remarkable illustration of what I mean. A school may be said to begin with the teachers and to end with the school cleaners, and a county council is just as much responsible for the salaries of the school cleaners as it is for the salaries of its headmasters. Only the other day I observed&#x2014;it was in the month of February in the year in which we are meeting and discussing this question here&#x2014;that the education committee of the London County Council submitted a recommendation to apply the existing rate of pay of school-keepers in Council schools to those in non-Council schools, and it was pointed out that the increased expenditure would amount to &#x00A3;10,900 a year. Therefore for seven years, since 1902, there has been absolute inequality of treatment and of salaries between the school cleaners in the aided schools and those in the provided schools. Supposing the view of the noble and learned Earl were a correct one, either legally or administratively&#x2014;that it was the duty of every local authority to put these schools on an absolutely equal footing&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY </member>: <membercontribution>I have never so contended.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD FITZMAURICE </member>: <membercontribution>And that there should be perfectly equal treatment between the provided and the non-provided schools, then according to that view the London denominational schools have all these years been suffering enormous injustice. I believe myself that if you were to deprive by any administrative action, let alone legal decision, the local authorities of the great responsibility and at the same time the great liberty which the late Government so wisely gave them, you would raise a far greater storm than any that will arise from this, as I hope, temporary quarrel between the managers of the Church schools in Swansea and the local education authority. Anybody who reads Mr. Hamilton's report can see that this is really simply the remains, probably the smouldering remains, of the larger controversy which I touched upon a moment ago as to whether or not
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0228"/>
<col>407</col>
there was to be equality of treatment. It has been settled throughout the great boroughs and counties of England and Wales, but the controversy lingers on here and there. I think we may trust, with time and patience, that this, as I venture to think, rather unhappy dispute will find a peaceful solution, and I am inclined to think that probably the less it is discussed and accentuated by speeches in Parliament the greater is the hope of a happy solution.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I apologise for intruding at this period of the debate because I had hoped to see it concluded before now; but I cannot, after the speech we have just listened to, refrain from saying a few words. I do not think I shall be accused by the noble Viscount the Lord President or by the noble Lord who has just spoken of being one who tries to embitter a controversy of this kind. I have avoided throughout the use of any word in connection, directly or indirectly, with this particular dispute which could accentuate rather than allay strife. I own that I waited for the speech of the noble Lord who has just sat down in the hope that we should have had some kind of answer to what seems to me to be the deplorable result to which we have been brought by the grounds given for the decision that has been ultimately arrived at. If I understand rightly&#x2014;and I hope I may be corrected if I am wrong, for the matter is one of supreme and far reaching public importance&#x2014;the argument of the Government is this. If you are being subjected to really unfair treatment on a great scale by a local authority which is differentiating, on religious grounds, in the manner that has been so palpably shown in this case, your only course is to first ruin your school and come to us afterwards; you must ruin the school, break up the whole system of education, scatter the teachers hither and thither, and then come to us. Is it realised what that actually means? What has happened to-night may in some parts of England be taken by partisan authorities as an incentive to act in a particular way. Are we really told that the law, as interpreted now, is that there can be no remedy for that very gross injustice until the school has been reduced to absolute inefficiency, with the certainty that a long time must then elapse before an ultimate settlement can be arrived at? If that is so, it is well that the country should know that that is the
<col>408</col>
interpretation put upon it. But I cannot honestly believe that that paradox, that intolerable conclusion, is virtually the counsel now offered to the authorities of this school in Swansea. If that is the interpretation of the law, it is an interpretation, as I understand it, that has been arrived at on the <i>ipse dixit</i> of a Prominent lawyer who holds high office under His Majesty's Government; but it must obviously be seen, from to-night's debate, that it is not the universally accepted opinion of those who are authorities on points of law. Is it then impossible that this question, if that be the paradox to which we are reduced, can be dealt with by His Majesty's Government by offering facilities to bring the issues to trial in a Court of Law? Do His Majesty's Government say&#x2014;We rest on the conclusion arrived at by one of our Law Officers? Do they intend to hold to this position, which I venture to call a most paradoxical one? If facilities could be given for bringing the question to issue in a Court of Law it would show us at all events whether this is the final pitiable position to which we are to be driven. I hope I have not said anything unfair or unreasonable, but I do think we are entitled to know whether we are to rest with this as the final word and whether what we have heard is to be the counsel to be given to those thus affected.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>EARL CAWDOR </member>: <membercontribution>I do not propose to say anything in reply to the debate which has taken place. I am perfectly content to leave the matter where it stands, so far as we on this side of the House are concerned. I understood from the noble Viscount that he was ready to give the notes of evidence which we asked for the other day.<lb/>

<title>INDIAN COUNCILS BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p>Order of the Day for the Third Reading read.</p>
<p><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACK-BURN):</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I will not trespass on your indulgence for more than a few minutes in moving the Third Reading of this Bill. This Motion brings us, not I daresay to the last, but certainly to a decisive stage in this legislation. The importance of this legislation has been much dwelt upon by noble Lords opposite, and I hope they will believe that no one recognises more fully than I do the responsibility that we all take in passing this Bill. I accept, not the anticipations of noble Lords opposite, but I accept their view that the operations which may follow the passing of this law will be, in one direction
<col>410</col>
or another, of a serious character, well deserving of our fullest attention.<lb/>
I must say that, with one exception, I have no complaint to offer of the tone and scope of the criticisms which noble Lords opposite who are so competent to speak on Indian affairs bestowed upon our proposals. They were, I think, open to a perfect answer; but the true answer, after all, will be found in the events that follow the working of the Act. We, for our part&#x2014;and when I say we I hope I may be allowed to include not only His Majesty's Government here but the Government of India&#x2014;anticipate from this Act the most beneficent results. If things should take an untoward turn the responsibility would not lie alone with us. I think the fact that noble Lords opposite did not divide against the Second Reading&#x2014;with which I have not the slightest intention of taunting them&#x2014;shows, I think, that they feel that the responsibility of rejecting our proposals would be a very grave and serious responsibility from which in the legitimate discharge of their public and patriotic duty they naturally shrink.<lb/>
I said there was one exception to my absence of complaint. I am not going to travel again at length over the ground of my complaint as to the rejection of the third clause of the Bill. The other day I said that authorities in India had telegraphed to me that they regarded that rejection as an unfortunate incident. I see in some prints that I ought to have mentioned who those authorities were, and there was an implication that they were authorities of no particular account. The authority&#x2014;I do not know why I should not mention it&#x2014;was the Viceroy. The Viceroy's judgment the day after the rejection of the clause took place was that the rejection of the clause was unfortunate, and I have since seen language used by a very important person that it was disastrous.<lb/>
I have been blamed for bringing again before your Lordships the third clause two or three days after it had been thrown out. I am assured that it was an unusual course in your Lordships' House; but I thought it my duty in fairness to the House that, after they had thrown out the clause, they should know and be guided by the knowledge and, as I hoped, the impression of the result of that proceeding in India.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0230"/>
<col>411</col>
It was through no pertinacity or stubbornness, however, to force my own proposal upon the House, because I have felt all through the proceedings since the debate began that this is not the case of an ordinary party Bill, and noble Lords opposite have not treated it in that spirit. I cordially admit that. Of course, Lord Curzon reminded your Lordships and His Majesty's Government that the resources of civilisation are not entirely exhausted by the rejection of the clause in your Lordships' House, and it may be, as Lord Curzon hinted, that another opportunity at a not considerably later date may be given to this House to examine the arguments for that clause and the position in which that proposal stands.<lb/>
I turn for a moment with great reluctance to a sort of semi-personal point. Language is used in public prints, and I hear something of it even in private conversation, that there has been some mystification on my part, and random and schoolboy innuendoes are thrown out, almost lurid descriptions are sometimes drawn, as to the origin and source of this Bill. I must apologise for taking up your Lordships' time with a matter of this kind, but still it is best, in an important proceeding of this sort, that all who take an interest in this subject&#x2014;and there must be, I hope, many thousands of people who do take an interest&#x2014;should know how this matter has proceeded.<lb/>
What do people mean when they say that reforms were wrung from the Secretary of State by an Indian political leader&#x2014;a certain Indian political leader well known to some of your Lordships? I ask the House, was it not the business of a Secretary of State or a Viceroy when undertaking a great scheme for improving local government in India, was it not the business of those two responsible Ministers to gather opinion upon proper details of such a scheme from every source, official and unofficial? If you are going to try to improve the administration of a country, is a Minister, whether at Whitehall or at Simla, to shut his eyes and ears to opinion from every source and to the very persons who may be most concerned by the right or wrong, the expediency or inexpediency, the sense or folly of his measures? Is there a single Member of your Lordships' House, however he may doubt the policy of this Bill, who will deny for a moment that the
<col>412</col>
business of a Minister or a Viceroy was to hear opinion on every side?<lb/>
Now, Mr. Gokhale, who is well known as a prominent and responsible spokesman of a very highly important section or branch of Indian opinion, came to see me at the India Office before the Despatch of the Government of India of October last reached this country. I wound up our conversation with a request, which I have made to other people, that he would be so good as to write on sheet of notepaper his views as to the reforms which he and his friends desired, and he did so. Did I stop there? The very self-same process I went through with a spokesman of the Mahomedans. He visited me. I made to him the same request, and he complied in the same way. I do not call that wringing a measure from a Minister; and, if it is worth mentioning, I may say that I never had any communication whatever after that&#x2014;which, I think, was on some day in September&#x2014;with Mr. Gokhale until the day before he left this country&#x2014;after my Despatch had gone&#x2014;when he called to say good-bye.<lb/>
What did I do with those two notes? I followed in every proceeding connected with this policy, and especially with this Bill, the ordinary regular official course with one exception, which I will mention in a moment. No proceeding was ever more strictly in order, was ever more above board, no transaction ever went through the not very exhilarating precincts of Whitehall more strictly in accord with ordinary rule and procedure. What happened? Those two notes and a great quantity of other material were laid before a committee. Here was the exception that I made to the ordinary procedure. Before the Indian Despatch arrived I received a summary of its contents from the Government of India, and I appointed a committee from the Council of India, and I was able to invite to that committee as <i>amicus curi&#x0153;</i> the noble Lord who sits behind me. They had these communications before them. [LORD MACDONNELL indicated dissent.] I was not present. I was away. Then came the Despatch of the Government of India, and that was discussed in the most strict conformity with the ordinary procedure of the India Office. It was referred to the appropriate Committee. Two or three members from the Council were added to the Committee,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0231"/>
<col>413</col>
and they threshed out the Despatch, and came to the conclusions which ultimately formed the basis of my Despatch of November last. That is the whole story. I only regret that I did not see a great many more Indians. I saw all that I could; I wish I could have seen more. So much for that.<lb/>
Then we are charged with not paying attention enough to the Government of India. I will not go into the constitutional and statutory relations between the Secretary of State and the Government of India. They are well known. They are beyond cavil and dispute. This is no occasion for opening that subject, and I hope for my own part that no such occasion will ever arise, because there are <i>arcana Imperii</i> which it is not expedient, I think, to make matter of debate in Parliament. The case of the relative rights and duties of the Secretary of State and the Viceroy does not arise, because I doubt if ever there was in the history of discussion between two Ministers, heads of powerful Departments, a discussion such as the Government of India and we have carried on for a great many months, but closely and constantly during the last two months, carried on with a more complete absence of the spirit of contention. I say that&#x2014;and my words will be open to public scrutiny or the scrutiny of those who know all the secrets, such secrets as there are&#x2014;without any misgiving or hesitation of the spirit in which we have worked together. The only thing I am going at this moment to read was in my Despatch of November to the Government of India, replying to their Despatch, in which I applauded, recognised, and thanked them for their industry, patience, thought, and candour. And then I say&#x2014;
<quote>"It is a sincere satisfaction to me to find myself able to accept the substantial part of your Excellency's scheme, with such modifications as would naturally occur to different minds"&#x2014;the Governor-General in Council and the Secretary of State in Council&#x2014;"handling problems of remarkable difficulty in themselves and reasonably open to a wide variety of interpretation."</quote>
That spirit, which animated both myself in Council and the Governor-General in Council, has gone on unabated and unimpaired, and if there are points that we have pressed that they would not of themselves have proposed, there has been no serious demur. If there had been serious demur to such a proposal as, for example, that of the official
<col>414</col>
majorities or the proposal to take power to appoint Executive Councils in the great Provinces, I should have been shaken. Therefore I hope that the House will believe that these. I will not say arguments, but these innuendoes&#x2014;I am not accusing the noble Marquess of stooping to that&#x2014;of which I hear so much are really random, undeserved, and complete moonshine.<lb/>
I have no more to say about the Bill except this. It has been admitted all through&#x2014;the noble Marquess has not denied it, and Lord Curzon expressly admitted it&#x2014;that we had reason to congratulate ourselves so far on the fact that the introduction of the Bill and the announcement of the policy which it was my fortune to make in your Lordships' House in December have produced a remarkable abatement in the tension which was formerly a source of difficulty and embarrassment to Lord Minto's Government. Without making a boast&#x2014;it is too early yet&#x2014;as to the effect of the Bill, I think the House will be interested to know of the account I received on March 6. I cannot reproduce the text, but I hope your Lordships will allow me to convey to you the substance of it. It bears on the Bill and on the public mind in this country in judging the Bill.<lb/>
"The insinuation that Indian political leaders are still unwilling to denounce outrages is not the case. So I am assured. Immediately after the murder of the counsel [the hateful murder the other day of the prosecuting counsel in the case] an influential native meeting was held in the Town Hall of Calcutta to protest against the outrage. The Moderates are quite genuine in their wish to assist in putting down anarchy. India is not [so I am assured and readily believe, and all the evidence points in the same way] in a state of insurrection. That is not to say that we may not expect further isolated attempts at outrage. The Government of India do not believe them to be instigated by any political party of the least importance. Any further outrages which may probably occur at intervals would in no way indicate widespread sedition or justify a belief in the disloyalty of the political leaders. The position now is really one for police watchfulness. Isolated outrages will not in any way justify [I commend this to any of your Lordships who doubt the policy of the Bill or have misgivings in connection
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0232"/>
<col>415</col>
with it] the assumption that the general state of the country is dangerous."<lb/>
I hope the House will think that that is a very satisfactory state of things. Language of that sort could not have been used six months ago. I am not taking credit for that improved state of things entirely to the Bill, but I am very earnest in pressing on your Lordships, as I have done all through the stages of the Bill, this fact&#x2014;that any interruption or whittling away or retardation of this Bill will do something to impair what is satisfactory in the account I have just had the honour of communicating to your Lordships. I beg to move that this Bill be read a third time.<lb/>
Moved, That the Bill be now read 3<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Morley of Blackburn</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I am sure we all listened with pleasure to the concluding part of the noble Viscount's observations, in which he was able to give us, on the whole, a reassuring account of the condition of India, and I think the noble Viscount is entitled to take credit to himself and to his colleagues for the fact that the introduction of this Bill did, no doubt, very considerably serve to relieve the position, which was becoming acute, in that country.<lb/>
I do not propose to take up your Lordships' time with any discussion of the relations of the noble Viscount with Mr. Gokhale, on which he dwelt at some length. I will say this, at any rate, that we all of us must admit that he had not only the right but that it was his duty to gather valuable information from any source where valuable information could be gathered, and personally I have no complaint to make of him for having elicited what information he could from Mr. Gokhale. Mr. Gokhale's complaint, I understand&#x2014;this I only gather from what I read in the newspapers&#x2014;is that in those massive Bluebooks that were presented to us there was included an early memorandum, written by Mr. Gokhale at least three years ago, which does not represent Mr. Gokhale's present opinions. Mr. Gokhale, as we understand, has since put in other memoranda which express very different opinions, and naturally enough a good many people would be curious to see what those amended opinions of Mr. Gokhale are like.
<col>416</col>
His Majesty's Ministers are rather unlucky in these matters. Whenever they do something very novel or original, if they do such a thing in Ireland or if they do such a thing in India, they are immediately told that they have appropriated somebody else's ideas and that their proposals are merely plagiarisms. I am sure the noble Viscount recollects a passage in Boswell in which it is related that at one time Dr. Johnson was in the habit, I think on Sunday evenings, of visiting the house of a certain Dr. John Campbell. But after a time he came to the conclusion that it was better for him no longer to frequent the doctor's society because he said he was convinced that the shoals of Scotsmen to be found there would, whenever "he did anything well," immediately remark, "Aye, aye! he must have learned that from 'Cawmell.'" I leave the noble Viscount opposite to apply the moral which I seem to detect in that little story.<lb/>
I am glad to have an opportunity of vindicating, if such a thing is necessary, the conduct of your Lordships' House in dealing with this Bill. We have, on one or two occasions, had to ask the noble Viscount not to hurry us too much in the consideration of it. After all, the Bill has been introduced and has come to the Third Reading in less than three weeks. That is not a very long time. The Bill represents the result of a process of consideration which, the noble Viscount told us the other evening, has lasted for three years. We are parting with the Bill after a study of three weeks. I do not think that is an unreasonable allowance. But we quite understand and realise the force of the noble Viscount's argument when he told us it was not desirable that this matter should remain too long in suspense, and, for that reason, although a great many of us would gladly have wished for further time in which to consider these proposals, we did, in deference to the noble Viscount's wishes, accelerate the different stages of the Bill in a somewhat unusual manner.<lb/>
I think we may also claim that our treatment of the Bill has not been devoid of forbearance for this reason. We are still almost entirely without information, either from the Bill itself or from the speeches which have been made from the other side of the House, as to several points of cardinal importance. We do not know
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0233"/>
<col>417</col>
what is to be the process of election which is to be resorted to under this Bill. All that we do know is that the Government of India proposed one kind of procedure and the noble Viscount proposed another. I hope that the noble Viscount, when he tells us that he is in close agreement with the Governor-General in Council, will be able to base his proposal as to election upon the very wise words which I find in the Despatch of the Government of India in 1907: they run as follows:&#x2014;
<quote>"No scheme of constitutional reform would meet the real requirements of the present time which did not make adequate provision for representing the landed aristocracy of India, the mercantile and industrial classes, and the great body of moderate men who, under the existing conditions, have no sufficient inducement to enter political life, and find but little scope for the exercise of their legitimate influence."</quote><lb/>
Another matter as to which we are still quite in the dark is the question of disqualification. We do not know, for example, whether a person who has been deported from India for participation in seditious practices is or is not to be disqualified. Finally, we are left in great uncertainty as to the procedure to be adopted and the principles to be followed in the selection of Indian members of the Executive Councils. Until&#x2014;to use my noble friend's expression&#x2014;the blank cheque has been filled up it is impossible for us to know how the new policy will work in certain particulars. But of this we may be perfectly well assured, that the new departure is one of a most serious kind, and that it will mark an epoch in the history of India. Indeed, I think the noble Viscount himself said words admitting very nearly as much when he spoke to the House a few moments ago. We are, I know, told that this Bill is a kind of natural development of the Act of 1892. I must protest against any statement of the kind. The group of measures which is comprised in this Bill and in the steps which will be taken to give effect to it go very far indeed beyond anything you can find in the Bill of 1892. If I may so put it, this Bill is not merely a step forward, it is a plunge forward, and a plunge which will lead us we cannot yet tell where. The noble Earl who leads the House rather took exception to some remarks of ours the other evening, because he said we ought to be satisfied to be guided by the man on the spot. I have already ventured to suggest, and I do so again,
<col>418</col>
that the proposals of the noble Viscount are widely different from the proposals which were made to him by the Government of India. To-night he told us, with that frankness which he observes, that there had been points which had been pressed upon the Government of India which they would not themselves have proposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN:</member> <membercontribution>Suggested rather than pressed.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE:</member> <membercontribution>The word he used was "pressed." Well, that is certainly the case. This Bill goes beyond the proposals laid before the Secretary of State last autumn in several most important respects. For example, if I may particularise, the proposal of the Government of India dealt with the Legislative Councils only. It dealt, in the second place, with the Legislative Councils in a very much more cautious spirit than the proposals of the noble Viscount. The official majority was retained, the question of the franchise treated in a wholly different spirit, the right of discussion was much more closely limited. But that is not all. The proposals of the Government of India for, so to speak, liberalising the Legislative Councils had alongside them as a counterpoise other proposals for setting up councils of different kinds&#x2014;councils of the ruling chiefs, mixed councils, advisory councils. The noble Viscount is going to tell me that some of them were dropped. But some of them remained to the last, and are still to be found in the Despatch of August last. My point is this, that those proposals which have now disappeared were the counterpoise of the proposals to be found in the Bill upon the Table.<lb/>
I would almost venture to put it in this way. The scheme of the Government of India was a scheme which had two limbs to it. There was one limb dealing with the Legislative Councils&#x2014;a mildly democratic limb; there was another limb dealing with these advisory councils, which were institutions of a distinctly conservative character. Look what happens! In the scheme which is now going forward the conservative limb has been lopped off altogether and has disappeared. The mildly democratic limb has become a great deal more democratic, and to the whole scheme have been added new proposals not put forward by the Government of India, for dealing in what I venture to call an
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0234"/>
<col>419</col>
almost revolutionary spirit with the question of the Executive Councils. I say that this House has shown much forbearance because in spite of all this your Lordships' House has given a very temperate and indulgent consideration to the Bill.<lb/>
We have, indeed, insisted upon one Amendment, and one Amendment only. I am not going to take up the time of the House by repeating the arguments in favour of the Amendment which we carried, but I do wish to say one word in reference to a remark which fell from the noble Viscount just now when he told us that he had ascertained that the Viceroy and his Council were entirely in favour of the proposals to be found in Clause 3. That was not our point at all. Our point was that the Viceroy himself in his Despatch had explained as clearly as possible that in his opinion it was necessary that there should be in the first place experience of the new Legislative Councils, and that after that there should be full consultation, not with his own Council, but with those high authorities who were best able to advise him. Our case is that that experience has not been had, and that consultation has not taken place.<lb/>
I am bound to say that the serious misgivings with which I have regarded this Bill from the first have not been removed by anything which has been said in this House. And I venture to say that those misgivings are very widely shared. I do not think they are entertained only by persons whom the noble Viscount would probably regard as bureaucrats of a rather hidebound description. I believe that if the noble Viscount and I could compose a kind of Indian panel, consisting of, let us say, fifty or 100 Indian experts&#x2014;men who are now in high position in India, men who have held high position in India during the last twenty years&#x2014;I believe if you referred these proposals to them you would get from a very large majority a verdict that the proposals, taken as a whole, are of a kind calculated to weaken the hands and impair the authority of the Government of India, to embarrass very seriously the Indian Civil Service, and, I am afraid, to sacrifice the interests of those millions of people for whom we are trustees to the demands of a relatively small minority&#x2014;I certainly would not say a negligible minority&#x2014;but a minority of which a very large section desires these
<col>420</col>
radical changes in the Indian Constitution because they regard them as the first step to undermining and eventually overthrowing our authority in that country. These are the considerations which I venture to lay before your Lordships, and I could not part company with this Bill without telling the House exactly my feelings with regard to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF RIPON:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I hope your Lordships will allow me to address some remarks to you at this time, because I have hitherto been unable, through illness, to be present, either in Committee or on the Report stage, and I did not see that I was in any way called upon to intervene in the important debate which took place on the Second Reading. I confess that I have been greatly struck by the difference of tone in the speech of the representative of noble Lords opposite from that which was displayed on the Second Reading of the Bill. On the Second Reading your Lordships appeared to be under the glamour, if I may be permitted to say so, of the great speech of my noble friend behind me; and I do not think I have often witnessed in this House a greater success than that was. To-night that spirit has disappeared, and we have heard criticisms of a different kind and offered in a different spirit.<lb/>
I should be the last one to accuse my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition of desiring to introduce party spirit here or elsewhere into the consideration of this measure. I cannot conceive anything more disadvantageous than the dragging in of a spirit of that kind into these Indian discussions; and it is on that ground for one, that I deprecate constant legislation in Parliament upon Indian questions, because I earnestly wish that the people of India should know that, when we come to consider their affairs, we desire to deal with them solely in their interests. I should be sorry to say that noble Lords opposite approach this Bill in any other spirit.<lb/>
My noble friend who has just sat down alluded to the Bill of 1892. I remember that Bill very well, and I gave it such support as I could, approving, in my own mind, if not in speech, the course then adopted, which in the circumstances of the time in India and England required all the courage shown by my noble
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0235"/>
<col>421</col>
friend Lord Cross in introducing that Bill. But neither Lord Cross nor myself supposed that Bill was going to be regarded as a law of the Medes and Persians which never could be changed, and I venture to claim that in the further advance which my noble friend behind me has now made, he has been acting in the spirit of the Act of 1892. I do not intend at this moment to discuss the details of this measure, neither am I physically able to do so; but I do desire to give my most complete assent to the proposals of my noble friend behind me, who, dealing with circumstances of great difficulty, has adopted, as it seems to me, the truest policy in such cases, on the one hand firmly putting down every attempt at sedition or outrage, and on the other hand bringing forward this measure, which in his view is calculated to lead to necessary reforms.<lb/>
The position of my noble friend opposite is different; he is filled with a dread of these reforms and he thinks the proposals made in this Bill go a great deal too far. I confess that if I entertained the opinion which I understand my noble friend opposite to entertain of the possible results of this legislation, I should have been not less but more inclined to resist it; but surely my noble friend knows enough of India&#x2014;he knows a great deal more of India than I do, for he was there for a longer time and had very full experience of it&#x2014;surely he knows enough of India to know that there is not really a dangerous condition of affairs there. It is a condition of affairs showing, on the one hand, a spirit of outrage and conspiracy and violent hostility to the Government which I believe to be without parallel hitherto in that country, but showing, on the other hand, a desire for moderate improvement and moderate advance which I also think has only of late years grown up. The legislation which my noble friend has offered to Parliament on this occasion is framed for the purpose of opening to the people of India a larger share than they have hitherto had in the administration of their own affairs. I believe that to be a reasonable and a proper object. I believe that it will tend to satisfy the ambitions and desires of reasonable men, and that it will tend more than anything else that the Government could have done to place British rule in India on a novel footing, no doubt, but a firmer and more certain foot-

When I was in India I was greatly struck by the strange state of things, as it seemed to me, which had been created by our system of education contrasted with the means of public employment which were open to the natives we were educating. Something was said on the question of education on the Second Reading, but I do not think we have heard of it since then. It is a question of the greatest possible importance. I am not going to discuss it now, and I should be very sorry if my allusion to it were to be supposed to imply any desire for the abandonment of the sound and just, principles laid down in Lord Macaulay's policy; but at the same time it cannot be denied that it is a difficult and, I think, a false position to be turning out year by year hundreds of young men with the highest education of European University without opening to the ambitions which such a training must raise up in them any means of legitimate satisfaction. It is because the proposals in this Bill tend to a certain extent to meet that difficulty that they will receive from me such support as it is in my power to give.<lb/>
I rejoice that your Lordships are about, as I understand, to pass this Bill without further opposition. I think it was the noble Viscount opposite who said what seemed to me a very wise thing in his speech on the Second Reading. He said, as I understood him, that we must recollect in dealing with this Bill that we are not in the position of persons who were constructing an Indian Bill <i>ab initio</i>, but that we had to deal with a scheme already in existence; and it is, therefore, exceedingly desirable that Parliament should be very careful in all that it says and does upon this matter. Parliamentary proceedings are probably a dark enigma to most of the natives of India&#x2014;they are not, indeed, always very intelligible to ourselves&#x2014;and I am quite sure that if it should once be thought that this House or the other House had anything in view except what was best for our children in India&#x2014;if I may use the word&#x2014;they would become confirmed in the doubt and hesitation as to the nature of our rule with which some of them appear to be beset, and would abandon the belief, confirmed by the statement of my noble friend, that they may look to this country in these
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0236"/>
<col>423</col>
days to afford to them a means of taking a part in that kind of political administration which most countries are now enjoying.<lb/>
The late Sir Robert Peel, after the passing of the Reform Bill, once in the House of Commons alluded to the difficulty of carrying on government under an ancient monarchy, a proud aristocracy, and a reformed House of Commons. I venture to say that the difficulty of carrying on government in India in face of the democratic movement to-day is at least as great, and that the dangers connected with it are at least as serious; and it is because I believe that my noble friend has done something to meet these difficulties and to avert those dangers that I give to this Bill my heartiest support.<lb/>
I must say one word about Clause 3. I am not going to re-open that question. I merely wish to say that I much regret what happened in Committee. If I may be excused for saying so, I think your Lordships were wrong in rejecting that clause. The question is not a new one. It has been discussed many times for many years, and it has been discussed on the one side and on the other by some of the ablest men who have been connected with India. Opinions may differ upon it; it is just the sort of question upon which men, according to their idiosyncrasies, would be likely to differ. Had your Lordships been asked to create Executive Councils in all the Provinces at once without regard to their differences, I could have understood hesitation; but you were only asked to give power to the Government of India to do so in any Province it thought fit for the purpose, and that you should have refused that power I think is a mistake.<lb/>
As I read the speech in Committee of my noble friend opposite, he appears to think that nothing would be easier than some years hence to bring in another Bill to confer this sort of constitution upon any of these Councils that we might think fit. I am one of those who recognise with the greatest satisfaction that the constitution of India rests upon Statute, that it does not rest upon Indian legislation, that it does not rest upon the will of the Indian Government, but that it rests upon a British Statute. But when I say that I do not mean that I have any desire that the question of Indian legislation
<col>424</col>
should be constantly before Parliament. There is nothing I believe which would be more injurious to the interests of India than that. I believe rather that you should have given the power asked for, which you know perfectly well would have been exercised carefully and judiciously, and I trust that when the Bill comes back from the other House, if that clause should be replaced in it, as I hope it may, your Lordships will see fit to no longer insist on your Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, with your indulgence I should like to offer a few remarks at this stage of the debate. As the noble Viscount the Secretary of State has told you, he did me the great honour of inviting me to assist the labours of the special committee formed out of his Council for considering the proposals of administrative reform in India. I was very willing and indeed glad to respond to that invitation, because, as many of your Lordships know, the greater part of my life has been spent in India and I owe to India the deepest debt of gratitude. I was therefore only too ready to fall in with the request of the Secretary of State. I think the noble Viscount will bear me out when I say that in nearly all the proposals which had been placed before us I was certainly not the least forward in making liberal recommendations. I associate myself with the proposals to increase the Executive Councils of Madras and Bombay. I associate myself with the proposals to increase the Legislative Councils, both Imperial and Provincial. I associate myself with the proposal to withdraw the official majority&#x2014;indeed I think that was my own proposal.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORL OF BLACKBURN:</member> <membercontribution>No </membercontribution>.</p>
<p>*<member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD:</member> <membercontribution>I also associate myself with other proposals, which have not appeared in the Bill, in connection with the internal administration of India. I think I may say that, with the exception of the proposals to which I have not agreed in this House, I was in general harmony with the feeling of the committee, and that the recommendations were not unacceptable to the Secretary of State. It has been to me a source of great regret that I have, through circumstances with which your Lordships are familiar, found myself in conflict upon any
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0237"/>
<col>425</col>
point with the noble Viscount. It will always be to me a subject of great regret, but I felt that I had a duty to discharge to your Lordships' House and to the country, and therefore I took strong exception to the proposal to appoint a native member to the Viceroy's Executive Council and to the proposal to create Executive Councils in Provinces administered by Lieutenant-Governors. My feeling was that the change on the latter head was far too momentous to be taken without previous experience and trial, and it was my hope that the addition of natives to the Councils of Madras and Bombay would give that experience and enable you later on to take a step forward if that was necessary. I went a step further, and, in my desire to remove what I felt was a source, and a persistent source, of discontent in Bengal, I ventured to suggest that if any way could be seen of bringing the whole of the Bengali-speaking people again under one administration I should be prepared even to give a Council there. In reading the debates which took place in 1868&#x2014;or rather the discussions between the members of the Viceroy's Council in that year&#x2014;I was struck by a remark made by one of the members that it would be a safe and useful thing to try an Executive Council in Bengal Proper, though not elsewhere. The Executive Councils under discussion then were entirely different from the Councils under this Bill. The Council which at that time it was proposed to create in Bengal was a Council on the Madras and Bombay model&#x2014;a Governor assisted by two members, experienced officers chosen from the Civil Service of the Crown in India. That is an entirely different thing from the proposal now made, which is not only to have a Lieutenant-Governor with two official members but also two non-official members. who need necessarily have no experience of administration. It seemed to me that that was taking a very serious step, as to the results of which we had no experience, and I thought it would be better to proceed slowly to see what would be the effect of the enlarged Legislative Councils in Madras and 'Bombay, what would be the effect of the greatly extended power of interpellation, and what would be the effect of the criticism of the Budget now being granted in extended form. Notwithstanding all I have heard, I still adhere to the view that it is wiser to go slowly, and if we find that the great powers which are now being conferred are wisely
<col>426</col>
exercised then I am sure nobody will be more ready than your Lordships to go forward in the same way. In my experience of India I have never drawn any distinction between the interests of the British Government and the interests of the people. I have always felt, and always shall feel, that whatever is injurious to the interests of the British Government must necessarily be injurious to the mass of the people, and therefore when any great question comes up, I look, not merely at the reasons, often specious and plausible, which are put forward from the popular side, but I also ask myself will there be any weakening at the centre or at the extremities in that control which, if it cannot be effectively exercised by the British Government in India, will certainly lead to great suffering and numberless embarrassments to millions of people.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, an appeal was addressed to us a few moments ago by the noble Marquess, whose reappearance in debate I am sure was extremely gratifying to members on both sides of the House, that we should not, if possible, allow this Bill to leave your Lordships' House accompanied by any spirit of discord. That appeal was in the same tone as one addressed to us at the outset by the noble Viscount the Secretary of State, and I should like to say that we on this side are by no means insensible to the force of that appeal. Indeed, I think that, although it has been our misfortune to differ in some respects from the noble Viscount, we have shown throughout a desire as far as we can to come into line with his proposals.<lb/>
The noble Marquess concluded his speech with a suggestion that this Bill will probably be returned from another place with the clause reinstated to which exception has been taken, and to which objection the noble Lord who has just sat down has added the force of his authority. If we are asked for a consensus we must at the same time be supplied with the material for a consensus. Throughout the speech of the noble Marquess there was the idea that the Secretary of State and the Viceroy acting together had placed certain proposals before us, and that those proposals had met with objection here. The noble Marquess's speech breathed on this occasion that broad spirit of toleration and trust in the people for which
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0238"/>
<col>427</col>
he has always been distinguished; but we must not therefore be asked to assume that, that spirit being equally in the minds of others, their conclusions have been the same.<lb/>
The Memorandum which accompanied Lord Minto's Despatch of last year contemplated a certain increase in the Legislative Councils; it contemplated discussions on the Budgets; it contemplated also rules with regard to the position of the presidents of the Councils. All the points of difference have come into the Bill since. Not merely has there been a great increase in the power of discussion in the Legislative Councils, but we have had the proposal to introduce into the inner sanctum, into the Executive Council, members whom the Viceroy has urged us to leave out until, by the process of time, we may see whether the working of the Legislative Councils justifies it. What we have urged on the noble Viscount throughout has been that he should give us material for coming to terms with him in a consensus of opinion&#x2014;that he should give us the opinions of those in India in whom we may have confidence. At the present moment we are in this position, that, owing to the necessity of meeting a serious agitation and of recognising the great progress of education, we are asked to make one by one various concessions. Each concession taken alone does not seem so serious, but the whole of them taken together have a cumulative effect which we have never been able to get the noble Viscount to deal with from the point of view of their cumulative effect. When we approach that question the noble Viscount draws us off, without explaining how the misuse of those powers which may result is to be met by those in authority in India.<lb/>
I cannot but hope that we may appeal to the noble Viscount not to raise the question of the Executive Councils again, and not to bring this House into collision with the other House of Parliament, unless he can at some time provide us, from those who have experience in the provincial Executive Councils, with some measure of support for the proposal that he presses upon us. I do not think that is an unreasonable demand. We have on this side five or six noble Lords who are entitled to speak upon, and who have spoken unanimously against, this
<col>428</col>
particular provision of the Bill. There are on the other side, I think, three noble Lords who have held somewhat similar positions in India, and two of them have spoken in the same sense. Before the Bill comes up again I hope the noble Viscount will make his contribution to the unanimity which we all desire. We appreciate the appeal of the noble Marquess, knowing as we do the effect in India of divisions on this subject in Parliament, and knowing also that those divisions will be taken advantage of, and that after a proposal has been made by the Secretary of State the rejection of that proposal may be sometimes almost more dangerous than the passing of it, though the passing of it may be against conviction and experience.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD AMPTHILL:</member> <membercontribution>Will your Lordships allow me to make a correction? I did not like to interrupt the noble Viscount when he was speaking, but he claimed unanimous support on this side for the elimination of Clause 3. If I count at all, that was not strictly correct, for I voted with the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India, and I owe it to the noble Viscount to say that I am still entirely with him on that subject as I am in regard to the rest of his reforms. Nothing that I have heard in this debate has shaken my faith in the wisdom, the necessity, and the prudence of that which he is proposing. My prejudices would, perhaps, naturally be another way, but my convictions and my opinions are with the noble Viscount the Secretary of State.<lb/>

<p>*<member>EARL FORTESCUE</member> <membercontribution>rose to ask whether the attention of His Majesty's Government had been called to the serious damage lately caused to a main road in Devonshire by the laying of an underground telegraph line and by excessive traffic in connection with work carried out on behalf of the Postmaster-General; whether they were aware that heavy charges had been thereby imposed on the ratepayers of the county; to enquire what steps the Government proposed to take by way of compensation; and to move for Papers. 
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0239"/>
<col>429</col>
The noble Earl said: My Lords, a little more than eighteen months ago the Post Office made a contract for delivery of cable at certain points on roads in Devonshire, and we very soon had occasion to find that serious damage was being done both by those employed by the Post Office and by the contractor. So far as the latter is concerned, the county is suing him now for the damage done by him, and I shall not say any more on that subject except to express the hope that the noble Earl who will reply for the Post Office will be able to give an assurance that the contractor will not be allowed to plead the privilege of the Crown in extenuation of the charge we shall bring against him of extraordinary traffic.<lb/>
Dealing with the damage done by those who were acting for the Post Office, I have to state that within a month or less of their commencing operations the district surveyors were reporting that some of the drains under the roads had been altered so as to prevent the proper flow of water, that the trenches in which the cable was laid had been overfilled and were six inches higher than the proper surface at many points of the road. Two months later the trenches were still reported to be very bad in several places. It was also reported that county bridges had been seriously damaged by the ends of arch stones being broken off, that the cable pipes were not fully laid in concrete as they should have been, and that some culverts had been partially blocked up, the cable being taken under them in a manner which interfered with the flow of the water. The superintendent engineer, on behalf of the Post Office, wrote, in July of last year, on the question of a contribution being made by the Department towards the repairs, admitting thereby that his Department were at fault.<lb/>
Nearly a year after the work had been completed our county surveyor, on the suggestion that the damage done had been made good in a satisfactory manner, reported that the filled in trenches were still left too high, and that an obstruction had been created on one of the county bridges by the placing of the cable against a parapet and casing it in with concrete in such a manner that it projected eighteen inches or thereabouts. The correctness of these complaints was substantially admitted at the end of last year in a letter from the
<col>430</col>
Department, in which proposals were made in regard to the bridges and the manner in which they had been repaired. There are two or three points in which I think the proceedings of the Post Office are legitimately subject to complaint and criticism. My noble friend has been good enough to supply me with a copy of the contract made with Messrs. Siemen for the delivery of the cable, and I observe that, although there were in the contract provisions to secure the taxpayer from anything that might be done to his detriment in the way of the quality of the goods supplied or the like, no consideration whatever was given to the interests of the taxpayers who are also ratepayers in the localities affected. There was no suggestion of inquiry being made of the county authority as to when the work could most conveniently be done, and the manner in which what was necessary could be carried out with the least damage to public property; and there was nothing in the contract to compel the contractors to use the railway rather than the road where possible, even though it might be a little more expensive. The Department is very much to blame in that respect, for, to effect a saving of a few pounds on the contract, they have allowed damage to the extent of hundreds of pounds to be done to the roads, liability for which they have hitherto repudiated.<lb/>
I shall no doubt be told that there would have been nothing to complain of had our roads been up to the mark; but the roads are good enough for the ordinary traffic, and I am not aware that it is any part of the duty of a local authority to maintain their roads in a condition good enough to carry the excessive weight of a cable, which is put down perhaps once in a generation. Unless I am very much mistaken, the War Office have admitted that principle in their dealings with local authorities, inasmuch as they have on various occasions given contributions in aid in respect of serious damage caused by heavy traction in connection with man&#x0153;uvres and the like. The Department in this case have not recognised the obligations imposed upon them by 26 and 27 Vict., cap. 112, in which it is laid down that a company&#x2014;and, I presume, a Government&#x2014;which opens or breaks up a public road shall, with all convenient speed, complete the work, fill in the ground, make good the surface, generally restore the road to as good a condition as it was in before, and carry away all the rubbish.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0240"/>
<col>431</col>
They are also bound to pay all expenses for keeping the road in good repair for six months, so far as such expenses may be increased by the opening or breaking up of the roads. The line taken, I believe, by the Department is that our allegations with regard to the damage done to the roads are exaggerated, if not untrue, but they have had to admit the truth of these allegations in regard to the damage done to the bridges, culverts, and drains, and I think it is rather too much to assume that our district surveyors and highways committee are conspiring to make false statements on one point although their statements on others have been admitted by the Department to be correct.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, before the noble Earl replies, I should like to ask whether he can give us any idea as to the saving made by the Post Office upon this contract as compared with the cost if the railway had been used where-ever possible. In many cases this cable was carried for thirty or forty miles along the road when it might just as well have been conveyed to various points on the railway and brought from there. The saving of a few pounds in this way on the contract has entailed upon the local authority an expenditure of many hundreds to put the roads right. It would have been very much cheaper, not only in this case but in others, for the local authority to have paid the difference between the two prices than to have to repair the damage done by this heavy traffic along roads which it was never contemplated would be used for this purpose, and which, without an enormous expense, are absolutely unsuited to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, this matter has been in dispute with the county council for the last eighteen months. We have been constructing a cable direct from London through Devonshire in connection with the Western Cable Company. We invited tenders in the usual way, and that of Messrs. Siemen and Company was accepted. This firm contracted to supply us with cables at different points throughout the route. The contract was made in the usual terms of all Post Office contracts. There was no specification requiring the cable to be taken by rail or road. The noble Earl mentioned that the roads in question were unsuited to this heavy traffic, and there can be no doubt that at a time of the year when the weather is wet
<col>432</col>
the harm done to the roads by this abnormal traffic is certainly great. As regards the liability of the Post Office, I do not think it would be fair that they should accept responsibility for the actual work done by the contractor, who, I am legally informed, is entirely responsible for any damage he has done, and if proceedings are taken against him in the usual way he will be liable for that damage. The noble Earl stated that a great deal of damage had been occasioned by the actual laying of the cable, irrespective of that occasioned by the contractor. As far as that is concerned, we have sent down engineers on many occasions and done our best to meet the county council in the matter. I have in my hand a report received from the two superintendent engineers of the southern district and also from Mr. Stubbs, assistant engineer in chief, who was specially sent down in December last, to go into the matter. Mr. Stubbs reports that the whole of the roads of the council have been carefully inspected, and that, speaking generally, the pipe track is in excellent order, except where in a few places it has been torn up by carriages going down hill with locked wheels. He says there is no justification for the Post Office being called upon to carry out any further work, except to smooth down the trenches in the few places where they have lately been disturbed by the traffic, and adds that the other complaints made by the county council as to the weakening of the structure of their bridges by these operations are without foundation. As far as the Postmaster-General is concerned, he is willing to make good anything that is wrong with the surface of the road; in fact, only the other day I asked my noble friend whether it would be any use sending down another engineer to view the road, and he wrote to the chief clerk at Exeter, who replied that the road was now in proper order again and there was no necessity for sending the engineer down. I am informed that the roads of Dartmoor are not up to the usual standard. I may mention that we have run a cable from London to Edinburgh without any similar trouble arising, and it is only in this small section of road in Devonshire where difficulties have occurred. As to the question put to me by Lord Clifford, the point is rather a large one and I am not in a position to give him an answer at the moment; but, if he wishes it, I shall be glad to apply at the office to-morrow and to furnish him with
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0241"/>
<col>433</col>
the actual details. I have nothing further to add except to say that, so far as the Post Office are concerned, they are perfectly willing to make good any damage which they may do to roads or bridges, but as regards damage done by contractors, it is expected that the county council will take action against them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, the grievance 
felt by local authorities is not confined to the Post Office but extends to other Departments, more particularly to the War Office. The noble Earl who raised this question said that, so far as he was aware, there was always a readiness in the case of the War Office to meet extraordinary expenditure caused by extraordinary traffic; but I am afraid that is not the experience which obtains in other counties. I happen to live within a short distance of Aldershot. Very large building operations are from time to time conducted in that neighbourhood on behalf of and under contract with the War Office, with the result that the roads are very seriously damaged indeed, and the County Council of Surrey have been trying for some years to get redress from the War Office, without that measure of success which I think they were entitled to expect. The noble Earl who represents the Post Office says that liability rests entirely with the contractor, and that the remedy of the County Council of Devonshire is to proceed against him. That is not what the War Office say. They apparently think that the contractor is absolved under Section 12 of the Locomotives Act, 1898; at any rate, those who execute contracts under the War Office put forward the words of that section, which provides that the liability rests upon&#x2014;
<quote>"the party by or in consequence of whose orders the extraordinary traffic has taken place."</quote><lb/>
It cannot be denied that that party is not the contractor but the person under whose orders the contractor acts. Therefore it is the Government Department which is liable; but your Lordships are well aware that there can be no legal liability upon a Government Department because it can always plead privilege of the Crown. I do not for a moment say that any of the Departments of the Government would endeavour entirely to escape from their just obligations on such a plea as that, still less do I say it of the War Office. In the case
<col>434</col>
I have in mind the War Office sent down and made inquiries into the amount of damage done to the roads, and were advised by their own surveyor that in this particular case there was damage done to the extent of &#x00A3;700, the amount necessary to restore the roads to the condition in which they previously were, and that an expenditure of &#x00A3;656 would be required to strengthen the roads for such traffic as was likely to be put upon them in consequence of the new buildings which the War Office had erected. The Department expressed their willingness to pay the amount necessary for restoration, not under legal liability but because they recognised that they had a moral obligation towards the county council, but said they must go to arbitration on the question of the amount necessary for the strengthening of the roads. I do not know whether that arbitration has been conducted or when it is going to take place; but what I do say is that when a Government Department admits that an expenditure of this kind is necessitated, and in respect of which they have a moral obligation, the sum ought to be paid to the county council. The Government Department ought to stand the racket of the arbitration, and, if the arbitration goes against them, so much the worse for them. But there is the expense incurred, and I think the Government Department ought to make it good to the county council. Therefore I hope that when the Government go into this matter they will consider it as a whole, not in connection with the Post Office alone, and that they will not seek to shift expenditure from the lightly-burdened taxpayer on to the shoulders of the overburdened ratepayer.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF BATH:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I am certain that if there is one member of your Lordships' House who will thoroughly sympathise with all that has fallen from Earl Fortescue it is my noble friend opposite (Lord Fitzmaurice), who has in past days done such service to his own county in negotiations with the Government of the day on the road question generally. I wish my noble friend Earl Fortescue joy if he adopts the advice given to him by the noble Earl who replied for the Post Office and begins to go for the contractors. We have ourselves tried to do it in our county on more than one occasion, and I do not think I have ever come across more slippery customers to deal with in regard to the damage they do to the roads. I would
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0242"/>
<col>435</col>
urge that this question deserves most serious consideration at the hands of the Government, especially with regard to the large concentration camps, whether at Aldershot or on Salisbury Plain. When a Government contractor in carrying out work for the benefit of the country at large, does considerable damage to the roads, it is extremely unfair on the local ratepayer that practically the whole of that burden should be thrown on his shoulders. I submit that it should be a national charge. I may be told that we get a contribution in lieu of rates, but in the county to which I belong we have just had an example of the manner in which that works. In this case the War Office suddenly came down on a district council with a request to take over a number of roads which were really private roads, and when they demurred the answer they got from the military authorities was&#x2014;
<quote>"Very well, we will withhold our contribution in lieu of rates."</quote>
So that although we are told that we receive contributions in lieu of rates, as a matter of fact the weapon is always held over us and we are bound to do exactly what we are told and to comply with any demand made, on the threat that if we do not do so we shall get no contribution. This is not only a Devonshire and a Wiltshire matter; other counties are affected as well; and the time has come when the question of Government contributions should be taken into consideration and when the local ratepayers should no longer be charged for what are, after all, works for the national benefit.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAU-CHAMP):</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise only to refer, in the absence of my noble friend the Under Secretary of State for War, who has been obliged to go to Edinburgh on business connected with his Department, to the special matter mentioned by the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees. Not having received any notice of the special instances referred to by the noble Marquess who has just sat down, I am afraid I cannot offer him any explanation as to the roads in Wiltshire to which he referred. But with regard to the question of the roads in Surrey, I am afraid that,
<col>436</col>
on behalf of the War. Office, I can hardly accept the interpretation of the Locomotives Act as applied to this matter which was given by the noble Earl. The War Office insert a clause in all their contracts by which they throw upon the contractor the liability for damage caused by extraordinary traffic. It was on the strength of that clause that the War Office repudiated any liability, and agreed finally to take the matter up with the contractors themselves. That matter is now being raised; the proceedings are being taken by way of petition of right, which is brought by the largest firm of contractors for the payment of the balance due on the contract. There is a sum of money due to them from the Crown which we are withholding pending the result of these proceedings. Meanwhile the point at issue has been referred to arbitration. I was sorry that the noble Earl was not pleased with the action of the War Office in referring this matter to arbitration. These questions have also arisen in the case of five or six other local authorities, but there has been no objection on their part to accept arbitration as a means of solving the difficulty, and I am sorry that the noble Earl the Lord Chairman, on behalf of Surrey, should not see his way also to regard arbitration as a very suitable solution of any controverted question of this kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW:</member> <membercontribution>I should like to explain that I took no exception to arbitration. My point was that I thought the War Office ought to pay what their own valuer admitted was the damage done, and then rely upon recovery by arbitration from the contractor.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP:</member> <membercontribution>Has the Surrey County Council asked for that?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW:</member> <membercontribution> Yes.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SOUTH EASTERN AND LONDON, CHATHAM AND DOVER RAILWAYS BILL. [H. L]</title>
<p>Order of the Day for the Second Reading, read.</p>
<p>Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>&#x2014;(<i>Lord Harris.</i>)</p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I desire to move the Amendment which stands in my name&#x2014;namely, that this Bill be read a second time this day three months; and I do so in order to call attention to the affairs of these companies, and more particularly to what I consider the extremely unsatisfactory facilities for travelling which they offer to the public. I do not take this action as a discontented shareholder and certainly not as part of a general attack on the railway system of this kingdom. I do so merely as an unfortunate member of the public who for five or six years past has had to travel fairly regularly on the lines worked by these companies, and who feels that, apart from the civility of the officials, as to which there is very rarely, indeed, complaint to be made on any British railway, the service offered to the public by the South Eastern and London, Chatham and Dover Railway Companies falls very far short of what the public has a right to expect.<lb/>
The Bill itself is concerned with a number of small matters, to some of which nobody would take any exception. It deals with the widening of a bridge, with the extension of Dover Harbour Station&#x2014;I hope that means an improvement of Dover Harbour Station, as I can imagine
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0244"/>
<col>439</col>
that in such weather as we have been experiencing during the last few days, landing at Dover must be a particularly uncomfortable thing&#x2014;and, further, with the widening of Charing Cross Bridge, again a provision to which nobody, I think, would take any exception, though I feel bound to point out that powers for widening Charing Cross Bridge have been confided to these companies for, I think, over ten years. There has, however, never been any attempt to exercise them; and it has been announced in a speech by the chairman of one of these companies that there is no intention now of using these powers immediately. I am not at all sure that it is desirable that Parliament should confer powers upon companies which those companies do not intend to make use of in the immediate future. If there is no necessity for the powers at the moment, it is time enough to come for them when they are actually wanted. This is a matter of private Bill procedure with which I do not feel qualified to finally deal myself, but we should be glad to have the opinion of the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees upon the point or that of some other Member of your Lordships' House more conversant with Committee Room work upstairs than I am.<lb/>
But what chiefly catches my eye in this Bill and moves me to raise a discussion upon the Second Reading are Clauses 11 and 13, but more particularly Clause 11, which deals with what is known as the Managing Committee, and which, therefore, really raises the whole question of the government and management of the two companies. May I, in three or four sentences, remind your Lordships of the history of this matter? Up to 1899 these two companies were rival companies, and I think it is not really unfair to say that they were almost the laughing stock of the railway world. They were competing companies, although their joint mileage made up what was really a very small railway system. At that time the two companies worked a system of about 640 miles, which, of course, is very small compared with the large systems of the Great Northern, with 1,151 miles; the London and North Western, with 1,911 miles; and the Great Western, with 2,599 miles; and it was obvious, therefore, that there was a great waste of effort in keeping them as rival companies. Therefore they came to Parliament. Their original intention
<col>440</col>
was to amalgamate, but difficulties intervened, and instead of amalgamating the two companies they amalgamated their names and a certain amount of the management, but kept the two companies as distinct and separate entities. In respect of the extent that they did amalgamate, they set up what is known as the Joint Managing Committee, which has worked the properties of the two companies for the past ten years, the receipts being divided in certain agreed proportions. But it is noteworthy that it was made quite clear at the time that the setting up of this managing committee was merely a first step, and was not intended to be the final solution of the difficulties in which the two companies found themselves. I notice that in the witness chair in the Committee Room of the House of Commons, before the Committee of which my noble friend Lord Derby was Chairman, Mr. Forbes, the late chairman of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway Company, said categorically, in the course of cross-examination&#x2014;
<quote>"This working union was the first step towards amalgamation undoubtedly."</quote>
Parliament accepted this pledge. I have never heard that there has been any hesitation in anybody's mind in accepting a pledge given by the late Mr. Forbes, and undoubtedly Parliament was influenced by this pledge in granting the companies the facilities that they obtained under the Act of 1899.<lb/>
But times have now changed. It is quite clear that the companies do not intend to carry out that pledge now. That is evident from the mere reading of Clause 11 of the Bill, and I do feel that we ought to have some explanation as to why it is not intended now to carry out this pledge and to thoroughly amalgamate the companies as was originally intended. It is obvious, I think, still that the working of the two companies does result in tremendous overlapping and confusion. These companies, although the system is such a small one, find it necessary to maintain no fewer than seven stations in London alone, apart altogether from suburban stations; these are led up to by a network of lines, all crossing and re-crossing each other in hopeless confusion, and all this to feed a mileage about one-third of the size of a big system such as we know it in the North and West of England. The public long ago came to
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0245"/>
<col>441</col>
the conclusion that drastic measures were necessary if they were to be properly served, and amalgamation was to be one of the first of them; but we now know that even this preliminary remedy is not to be carried out.<lb/>
After all, we must remember that it is the public who suffer. The public do not receive the facilities for travelling which they expect and to which they are entitled. You will find this if you look into the question from almost any point of view. Take their rolling-stock. Do the public travel on these lines in equal comfort with that to which they are accustomed in other parts of the country? We are accustomed to comfortable express trains, corridor carriages, and all sorts of modern conveniences. Even the Continental traffic, of which I shall have a word to say later, cannot be claimed to be up to date as compared with the comfort in which people travel on other lines, whether in England or on the Continent. Are the South Eastern and Chatham and Dover trains celebrated for their punctuality? Undoubtedly there has been great improvement in the punctuality of trains throughout the whole of England. During the last few weeks I have been coming up regularly by the Great Western Railway from Exeter. I have travelled by a number of express trains, all of which make a non-stop run, doing the journey of 173 miles in three hours; and I have no hesitation in saying that you could set your watch by the arrival of those trains. Even the much-abused London and South Western Railway has vastly improved as regards punctuality of late years. I remember two years ago in one of the Committee Rooms upstairs, Sir Charles Owens, the general manager, laid it down as a principle that it was quite exceptional for a London and South Western train to be late. I always thought it was very creditable to the five Members of your Lordships' House who formed the Committee before whom that statement was made that none of them smiled; however, this statement was not shaken in cross-examination. On the other hand, it cannot be maintained that any one short of a maniac would set his watch by the arrival of a particular train at Charing Cross. Again, one can only speak of one's own experience.<lb/>
For the last five or six years I have had occasion very often to come up to Charing Cross from the Hastings line, and at one
<col>442</col>
time I used innocently to stay in the train till I got to Charing Cross, going round from London Bridge to Cannon Street and thence to Charing Cross. But I have since found that there is a much faster way of getting home. If you leave the train at London Bridge and take a hansom cab, passing Charing Cross on the way, I venture to say that you will get home much quicker than if you stay in the train till you reach Charing Cross. Certainly that has been my experience. These things are, after all, only founded upon personal experience, and therefore the matter is open to argument. It may be claimed that it is merely a matter of opinion, and I daresay some noble Lord who takes a brighter view of the doings of these companies may get up and say, with perfect truth, that, in his opinion, the trains are punctual and everything is satisfactory. But there are ways of testing the facilities that these companies give. We can test them from their own timetables, and I would ask your Lordships' permission before I sit down to quote a few figures that I have taken from their own time-tables as to the number of trains they provide the public with, and the speed at which those trains travel. I have taken places at random, but I think they very well illustrate my argument.<lb/>
There is an important town on the South Eastern system known as Tunbridge Wells. It is thirty-three miles from London, and has a population of 33,000; therefore, it is an important place. The South Eastern Railway Company consider that they serve it adequately by giving it seven trains on Sundays, twenty-four on ordinary weekdays, and twenty-five on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Compare that with two other lines. Reading is a town about the same distance from London as Tunbridge Wells, but the Great Western Railway Company run to Reading fourteen trains on Sundays, thirty-four on weekdays, and thirty-five on Saturdays. The much-abused London and South Western Railway Company run to Woking, which is about the same distance from London as Tunbridge Wells but with a smaller population, nineteen trains on Sundays, forty-eight on Mondays, and forty-nine on other weekdays except Saturday, when they run fifty. Twice as many trains are run by the London and South Western Railway Company to Woking as the South Eastern Company consider necessary to Tunbridge
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0246"/>
<col>443</col>
Wells. Obviously, therefore, the facilities given by the South Eastern Company are not equal to what the public are led to expect from other companies.<lb/>
Now I come to the last point to which I wish to draw attention&#x2014;the question of speed; and really the speed of the trains on the South Eastern and Chatham lines is scandalous compared with that of other companies. Again I have taken instances at random from the A.B.C. time-table, from Bradshaw, and from the companies' own time-tables. I take four important towns. I notice from Bradshaw that these companies do not call their trains "express" trains, but "fast" trains; I presume in order to avoid comparison with what goes on on other lines. I have taken four towns that are served by express trains by other companies. Your Lordships will notice that they are towns very much further away from London than the longest run the South Eastern have to make, and, therefore, one would expect a lower average perhaps to be kept in reaching them.<lb/>
The run to Plymouth from Paddington is 226&#x00BD; miles. The four best trains in the day go down at forty-five, forty-six and three-quarters, fifty, and fifty-five miles per hour. Again, the Great Western Railway run to Swansea is a perfectly fair comparison with the South Eastern, because whereas the South Eastern have a monopoly of the express traffic to the towns in the South-east of England, so far as London to Swansea is concerned the Great Western Railway Company in their turn have a monopoly of that traffic. The Great Western Company run four trains in the day to Swansea, one at forty-three, one at forty-six, and two at forty-nine and a half miles per hour. The London and North Western give four trains to Carlisle (299&#x00BD; miles) at speeds of fifty-one and a half, fifty, forty-seven, and forty-eight and a half miles per hour. The Great Northern give four trains to York (188&#x00BD; miles) at speeds of fifty-one, fifty-one, fifty-two and a half, and fifty-four miles per hour. Therefore, of the sixteen express trains that I have quoted there is one only which does the Journey under forty-five miles an hour, eight out of the sixteen travelling at or over fifty miles an hour, and all for very long distances.<lb/>
Now what happens in connection with the South Eastern and Chatham and
<col>444</col>
Dover? The fastest train in the day from London to Dover (seventy-eight miles) goes down at 42 16 miles per hour, slower than the slowest train of the sixteen expresses that I have quoted. The next best train &#x2014;the five o'clock from Victoria&#x2014;goes down at thirty-nine miles per hour; the next best at thirty-six; and the next best at thirty-four and two-third miles per hour. Those are the four best trains to Dover. The four fastest trains to Hastings (sixty-two miles) go down at these average speeds&#x2014;two at 33 8, one at thirty-three and a quarter, and one at thirty-one miles per hour. The four fastest trains to Ramsgate (seventy-nine miles) go down at a speed of forty-three, thirty-eight and a half, thirty-four, and thirty-two miles per hour. That is the best service that the South Eastern and Chatham can provide for the public as far as express trains are concerned, and I submit that these speeds are really ridiculous when compared with the average speeds, including stops, maintained by express trains on other lines.<lb/>
In regard to the Continental traffic, the comparison is equally unfavourable. There are four routes to the Continent with which the South Eastern and Chatham Railways are concerned. My figures are all taken from the companies' own time-tables, and the distances which have enabled me to calculate my average are taken from their time-tables as well. First, as regards Dover to Ostend, the 9 a.m. from Charing Cross goes down to Dover at forty-three and a half miles per hour, and the train in connection with it goes on from Ostend to Brussels at forty-five and a half miles per hour. Secondly, the 8.35 p.m. from Victoria to Queenborough goes down at thirty-five and a half miles per hour, and the connecting train goes on from Flushing to Rotterdam at thirty-six and one-third miles per hour. Therefore, as far as the Dutch and Belgian State railways go, the South Eastern is not very much worse. But when the Paris service is considered, the difference is really enormous. The 8.25 from Paris to Boulogne goes north at 45 9 miles per hour, but the connecting train from Folkestone to Charing Cross comes up at thirty-six miles per hour. The 2.20 from Charing Cross to Folkestone goes down at forty-three miles per hour, and the connecting train from Boulogne to Paris goes on at fifty-three miles per hour. The nine o'clock from Charing Cross to Dover goes down at forty-three and a half;
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0247"/>
<col>445</col>
the connecting train from Calais to Paris goes on at fifty-two and a half miles per hour. The eleven o'clock from Victoria goes down to Dover at forty-two and a half miles per hour, and the connecting train from Calais to Paris goes on at fifty miles per hour; and, lastly, the 9.50 from Paris to Calais goes up at fifty-two and a half, and the connecting train from Dover comes up to London at forty-two and a half miles per hour. Therefore, as far as speed is concerned, the comparison is ludicrously against the South Eastern and Chatham. We ought, I claim, to have some explanation. Again, as regards accommodation, the French train is exceedingly comfortable; it is a corridor train, well heated, and connected with a dining and refreshment car. As to the English train, I do not remember ever coming across one that was a corridor train; the heating is very bad if there is any at all, and the companies' idea of refreshments is to offer you a dirty-looking tea basket on the pier at Dover, one glance at which to a moderately-fastidious man is almost as dangerous as a rough crossing.<lb/>
Therefore, if I may sum up, this is the position in which we find ourselves. We have had ten years experience of this "working union," which has given these companies a very great chance of coming into line with modern progress of railway science. These ten years, for all I know, may have been very advantageous to the shareholders or they may not. I do not know; but they certainly have not been advantageous to the public. The public do not, I claim, receive the facilities they have a right to expect. I am not moving the rejection of this Bill as an advocate of nationalisation. I fully believe that private enterprise is necessary and infinitely better from all points of view. I even go so far, though in these days, perhaps, it is not fashionable to say so, as to admit that the shareholders have the first claim on the activities of the directors; but I do submit that if Parliament grants facilities for their business to these great railway companies, we have a right to claim in return that the management to which these facilities are given must keep pace with the requirements of the times and with the facilities offered by other companies as the result of the progress of railway science. This the South Eastern and Chatham Companies have not done, and I suggest to your Lordships that no further legislative facilities
<col>446</col>
should be given to them while they neglect the public's claims upon them.<lb/>
Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"To leave out the word 'now' and to add at the end of the Motion the words 'this day three months.'" &#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Donoughmore.</i>)</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I do not rise to take up the time of the House in regard to the misfortunes of travellers on the South Eastern and Chatham Railways. Those misfortunes have been very vividly described by the noble Earl who has just sat down. I wish to refer to what the noble Earl said in the earlier part of his speech with regard to the amalgamation of the two companies. I think he made an important point when he quoted the statement of the late Mr. Forbes, who was the General Manager of the Chatham line, and in which Mr. Forbes said that the Act of 1899 was the first step in the direction of the amalgamation of the two companies. This Bill is only a step towards the amalgamation of rather more of the property of the two companies, and what I should like to know is this. Can the noble Lord who moved the Second Reading of the Bill tell us whether there is any immediate prospect of the amalgamation of the two companies taking place? When this Bill was deposited in your Lordships' House the Lord Chairman wrote to the promoters saying&#x2014;
<quote>"I hope this is a prelude to what is most important, the absolute amalgamation of the two companies."</quote>
In this connection it is with regret that one reads the statement made by Mr. Bonsor at the meeting of the company with regard to this Bill. Mr. Bonsor said &#x2014;
<quote>"On more than one occcasion he had stated that the amalgamation of the two companies was quite impossible at the present moment. He only knew of two sets of machinery by which such amalgamation could be brought about&#x2014;namely, by one company buying the other's undertaking, or by a new company buying both undertakings. But the stamp duty which would have to be paid in either instance was prohibitory. Therefore, the actual amalgamation must be deferred for some time."</quote>
I do not understand from this report whether the chairman of the company means that the amalgamation is postponed for the moment, or whether it is postponed until such time as the stamp duty ceases to be prohibitory. I wonder when the stamp duty will cease to be pro-

hibitory. Other railway companies have succeeded in amalgamating and in paying the stamp duty. I ask the noble Lord in charge of the Bill whether he can give us any information on this point. There is a difference between the amalgamation of the capital of the companies and the amalgamation of the administration of the companies. My point is that, according to the evidence of the late Mr. Forbes, it was the intention of Parliament that the two companies should be amalgamated not only in respect to their administration, but also in respect to their capital. I cannot but feel&#x2014;I do not say this in any sense of hostility to the directors of these companies &#x2014;that it must be more satisfactory for an undertaking to have a united direction, and I think it is desirable that the amalgamation of these companies should take place at as early a date as possible in order that they may be put under one administration, and not; as at present, have two boards of directors and one committee of management.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HARRIS</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am in a peculiarly difficult position. Late last night I was asked by the General Manager&#x2014;Mr. Vincent Hill &#x2014;to be good enough to move the Second Reading of this Bill. I am not on the board of either company, although I once was on the board of the London, Chatham and Dover, and was on the joint committee at its initiation; and, obviously, I am not in a position to reply with any authority to the criticisms of either noble Lord. I would hope, however, that the noble Earl, having had an opportunity of offering these criticisms to your Lordships, which criticisms, I imagine, will attract the attention of the Committee to which I hope this Bill may presently go, will be content to let the Bill have a Second Reading. There would then be an opportunity of calling the attention of the managing body to the observations of the noble Earl, to the criticisms which he has advanced, and to the want of facilities which he thinks exists in the services of these companies; and then would be the opportunity, I submit, of obtaining, if possible, some guarantees from the companies that those facilities would be improved. I trust, therefore, that the noble Earl will not press his Amendment to a Division; but, if he should be so inclined, I hope your Lordships will follow your usual practice by giving the Bill a Second Reading and
<col>448</col>
allowing the details which the noble Earl has raised to be discussed by a Committee upstairs.<lb/>
So far as I can offer a remark or two, I would venture to say this, that I have no doubt Mr. Forbes did hope eventually to see the amalgamation of the two companies, but I cannot recollect that I ever heard him say that he expected it to come about in the immediate future. The object at the time was undoubtedly to get rid of the antagonism that existed between the two boards, and if possible, and if funds permitted, to improve the service. As a constant user of the line I should say that the public has decidedly benefited by the existence of the joint managing committee. As to the trains on which I travel&#x2014;and I am on the line very nearly every day of my life&#x2014;their punctuality is certainly not complained of by those who travel at the same time as I do. The rolling stock has certainly been improved; I do not mean to say that it is up to that of some of the other lines, but its improvement is one of the results of the amalgamation of management. The London, Chatham and Dover Company was not in a sufficiently good financial position to give large orders for rolling stock at the time of the formation of the joint committee, but with the assistance of its colleague it has certainly improved the rolling stock enormously.<lb/>
I do not think I can agree with the noble Earl that the existence of seven termini in London is a disadvantage to the travelling public. Surely in a huge place like London it is a convenience to the public that they should have these termini, and certainly as a constant traveller on the line I have no reason to complain that there are termini east and west. It is rather for the management to say whether they find the crossing of lines leads to confusion, but the junction of the two lines&#x2014;for instance, at Chislehurst, where both up and down trains have now been enabled to pass to either line&#x2014;has been an immense convenience. The other day when His Majesty was travelling down there was an unfortunate accident at Tonbridge, just in front of His Majesty's train, but owing to the crossing of lines the company was able to send His Majesty's train down by quite a different route with only a short loss of time. I should most unhesitatingly say that, with regard to that point also, the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0249"/>
<col>449</col>
public has distinctly gained in the addition of those junction lines to which I referred.<lb/>
I often heard Mr. Forbes speak about the comparative pace of the best trains on the London, Chatham and Dover&#x2014;at that time the amalgamation had not taken place&#x2014;and that of those on the big lines. I understood that the difficulty the Chatham had was in getting out of London, because the suburban district of London is so much thicker through for their lines than for any other line except the Great Eastern; and I have heard him say that the "little Chatham," as he used to call it, carried as many passengers per train mile on its suburban area as any line in the kingdom, showing the large number of trains running on the suburban lines, and, to a certain extent, impeding the pace of the fast trains. I do not know whether it is fair to compare a run of eighty miles with one of 240 miles, as the noble Earl did. I submit that your Lordships are not in a position to judge on a point of that kind. It is a matter that can be better judged by the Committee. I am sorry that the noble Earl was not satisfied with the refreshments offered him on Dover pier. That is, I admit, within the power of the company to arrange for when they let their contract for refreshments; but, so far as the pier and the discomfort there are concerned, that is not a matter concerning the company. The pier belongs to the Harbour Board, and the Harbour Board have been continually pressed to make improvements. I believe an agreement has been signed between the company and the Harbour Board for the making of a large station by means of reclamation at the end of the harbour, which when completed will, I should imagine, enormously improve the service there.<lb/>
As regards the amalgamation of the two companies' stock I never heard Mr. Forbes say anything definite about that. The noble Earl stated to-night that the companies&#x2014;
<quote>"did not intend to carry out Mr. Forbes' pledge."</quote>
I have not had an opportunity of seeing what Mr. Forbes actually said, but I should have thought it foreign to his usual caution if he had given a pledge that the two companies would be amalgamated within any given time. I have, however, no doubt that the chairmen of the two companies will have their attention directed to what
<col>450</col>
the noble Earl has said, and I daresay will be able to give some reply upon it in Committee. With two such very large capitals as are concerned and the price of the shares in the market, it would be an extremely difficult matter to provide satisfactorily for the absorption of one into the other, or for the purchase of the two by a new company. I have never myself heard that there is any extreme pressure by the shareholders for an amalgamation of stock, and it is obvious that the objection which Mr. Bonsor raised, as regards the cost owing to the stamp duty which would fall on the shareholders, is a very serious one. I am sure the remarks which have been made to-day will receive attention from the Committee, and, in these circumstances, I hope your Lordships will be induced to give a Second Reading to the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD AVEBURY</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am not a director of either of the companies promoting this Bill, but for more than fifty years I have been a constant traveller on these lines, and as one of the public I should like to say a word or two in support of what has fallen from the noble Lord who has just sat down. I was rather surprised to hear the noble Earl who moved the Amendment, and the noble Lord who followed him, speak so strongly in favour of the amalgamation of the companies. I have very grave doubts whether the amalgamation would be for the public interest.<lb/>
Generally speaking, Parliament has looked with a somewhat jealous eye upon the amalgamation of companies. Until the joint committee of management was founded there was a certain amount of competition between the London, Chatham and Dover and the South Eastern, and although no doubt that has been very much diminished by the joint arrangement, still there are the two interests; and, as one who is resident in Kent and a constant traveller on the line, I am rather disposed to doubt whether the public would be better served by the amalgamation. I do not think there is any evidence whatever that Parliament has at any time expressed a wish for the amalgamation of these two companies. At any rate, the absence of proposals for absolute amalgamation can surely be no sufficient reason for rejecting this Bill. My noble friend Lord Harris has just stated that the shareholders have expressed no such wish, and, living in the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0250"/>
<col>451</col>
district and constantly using the line, I can say that there has been no desire on the part of the public that there should be amalgamation. <lb/>
I am not altogether sorry that my noble friend Lord Donoughmore has brought up this matter, because we do feel that there is room for improvement. At the same time, I must say that any comparison of the speed upon our Kentish lines with that upon those, for instance, of the Great Western is somewhat misleading and hardly fair, I think, to the Kentish companies. In the first place, the distances are very much shorter; in the second place, they have to go through a considerable district of the metropolis, which necessarily involves going slowly; and, in the third place, the gradients in Kent are very heavy and our lines, unfortunately, are somewhat winding. I think nobody who has travelled much through Rochester and Chatham would wish to see trains go much faster there than they do. At the same time there is, as I have said, room for improvement. I hope the House will take the advice of my noble friend Lord Harris and allow the Bill to be read a second time and go to a Committee, where I have no doubt the suggestions made by Lord Donoughmore and Lord Monk Bretton, many of which were very much to the purpose, will be thoroughly considered; but I feel that no sufficient reason has been shown why the House should throw out the Bill on Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, as representing the Board of Trade, I have only a very few observations to make on this subject. In the first place, I should like to thank the noble Earl who has moved the rejection of this Bill for his kindness in communicating with me on the matter. I think, from what he has said, that he does not really find much in the Bill itself to which he takes exception, but that his objection is based on more general grounds. The only clause in the Bill which I think is of at all an unusual character is Clause 11, which touches, but only touches lightly, on a subject which has been mentioned this afternoon&#x2014;the subject of railway amalgamation. Your Lordships have heard what the position of these two companies is. Amalgamation has not taken place. They are still separate companies; but something in the nature of a marriage has taken place between them, and the
<col>452</col>
object of this clause is to bring certain property into settlement which was not included in the original marriage settlement. That property consists, I think, of hotels and refreshment rooms, and, as far as the Board of Trade can see, there does not seem to be any objection to the proposed course, and I hope it may result in the superior management of those departments, which may remove the difficulties with regard to refreshments to which the noble Earl alluded. I understand that what the noble Earl really wishes is not so much to call attention to anything in this Bill as to suggest that we should reject the Bill as a protest against the management of these two companies. That is rather a drastic course to pursue, and I hope your Lordships will not follow it. I, of course, hold no brief either for or against these particular companies, and I am quite ready to admit that, in regard to accommodation and train service, they do not reach the high standard which is reached by many of the companies in this country. That is a matter of general knowledge. I will also admit that the pooling arrangement has not been so fruitful in good results, either to the shareholders or to the travelling public, as was hoped at the time it came before Parliament; but, at the same time, there has been considerable improvement. I would especially allude to the very extensive widening of the line which has taken place and which has undoubtedly resulted in very greatly increased punctuality. There are further improvements in contemplation shortly at Dover Harbour, and the Board of Trade hope that, when these improvements have been carried out, a still further amelioration of the conditions of travelling on these lines may be found. I hope, therefore, the noble Earl will be content with the discussion which has taken place, and will not ask your Lordships to pursue the very drastic course he has suggested.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF ONSLOW)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, perhaps I ought to add a word upon this discussion. The noble Earl who moved the rejection of the Bill pointed out, at the commencement of his remarks, that the Bill embodied a great many provisions, some of which he described as of a small nature, but which I am informed are matters to which the Company itself attaches considerable importance. I venture to think, therefore, that your Lordships
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0251"/>
<col>453</col>
would do well to allow the Bill to go to a Second Reading, because if you throw it out, it is quite obvious that you;will thereby destroy all the provisions as well as any particular one to which the noble Earl takes exception.<lb/>
The noble Lord below the gangway (Lord Monk Bretton) referred to a remark I made when I expressed the hope that the time was approaching when these two companies would be amalgamated. The noble Lord opposite, who spoke on behalf of the Board of Trade, described the union between these two companies as something in the nature of a marriage. I would venture to say that they have entered into a marriage contract, but that the marriage contract has not yet been fulfilled; but I rather differ from my noble friend behind me, Lord Avebury, that it would not be in the interests of the public that this amalgamation should take place. Competition is, of course, always good for the public; but it must be borne in mind that these two companies now work harmoniously together through the managing committee. What happens, however, is that expenses are duplicated, and consequently money which might be put into the improvement of the line has to be expended on the maintenance of the companies as two separate undertakings. Clause 11, to which the noble Lord referred, is a clause which provides for the pooling of the landed property, hotels, and so forth of the two companies, and I venture to hope that that may be a prelude towards the amalgamation which Parliament was given to understand would be the ultimate result of the Bill they passed in 1899.<lb/>
The noble Earl who moved the rejection of this Bill had no other course to pursue if he desired to call your Lordships' attention to the facilities given by these companies as compared with other companies. I am afraid he would not have been given a <i>locus standi </i> before the Committee, and therefore the only opportunity the noble Earl had was to bring the matter before your Lordships in the manner he has done. But I venture to hope that he will be satisfied with the discussion, which I am quite sure will be brought to the notice of the chairman and directors of the South Eastern and Chatham Companies, who, I have no doubt, will do what they can to meet the views of the noble Earl. I can say, for myself, that sometimes when I
<col>454</col>
arrive from the Continent the glow of pride which I feel at again setting foot on my native soil is somewhat chastened by the comparison between the railway accommodation given me between Paris and Boulogne and the accommodation provided between Folkestone and London. I hope that that is a reproach which before long may be removed. In any case I venture to express the hope that, having initiated this discussion, the noble Earl will allow the Bill to go to a Committee, where the remarks he has made will receive consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the noble Earl the Lord Chairman has correctly interpreted my motive in initiating this debate. I was anxious that a Bill of this kind should not go through without some discussion and some protest. I am quite satisfied with the admissions I have obtained that these companies have great opportunities of improving their services, and I hope we may see some earnest attempt at improving those services in the course of the next year or two. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, complained of the comparison of speeds which I had ventured to make and described them as unfair. He said that the gradients and curves on these lines militated against fast speeds. I do not think the noble Lord can maintain that argument as against the London and North Western run to Carlisle, this journey including the crossing of Shap Fell, a far more serious feat than anything the South Eastern or Chatham have to face. Moreover, if their gradients are bad and their curves considerable, that is entirely their own fault, and I should have thought it was a matter that they might have endeavoured to improve.<lb/>

<title>AERIAL NAVIGATION.</title>
<p>*<member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to ask whether His Majesty's Government are aware of the progress which foreign Governments are making in aerial navigation for military purposes; and to move for a Return showing the amount spent upon such operations by the great Powers during last year. I first of all have to express regret that the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War is not in his place this afternoon to reply to the Question, as I know he takes great interest in this subject; but I have no doubt that the noble Lord who will reply for His Majesty's Government will be equally able to deal with this somewhat technical subject.<lb/>
I bring this matter forward from the point of view of its being of national importance. I know that there is a school at the War Office which holds, in common, I believe, with certain other War Departments abroad, that nothing practical so far has been evolved out of the various trials of military airships and aeroplanes, and that there is plenty of time before we need take any serious cognisance of the progress of aviation. But I think I can show, in a few words, that military aviation has already attained such a stage that it is absolutely imperative for this country to give it more attention and to devote more money to it than it is at present receiving. Great progress has been made by foreign countries, especially by France and Germany, in the direction of fitting up dirigible balloons and aeroplanes for war purposes. There is quite a natural dislike in Government offices to anything new. We all know that when torpedoes, smokeless powder, breech-loading rifles, and other improvements in the art of war came in, it took some time before the War Offices were inclined to look at the inventions; and, as a rule, it has been found that private individuals have to work out the early stages of these inventions before Governments will look at them.<lb/>
I quite admit that the War Office would be perfectly right in not devoting too much attention and money to the subject of
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0253"/>
<col>457</col>
military aviation until something had been proved; but something has been proved&#x2014;a great deal has been proved. I daresay the noble Lord who will reply will be able to say that the military advisers of the Crown have an eye on the situation and are doing what they can. If I am rightly informed, some, at any rate, of the military advisers of the Crown do not believe in the utility of this science for war purposes. They pooh-pooh the whole business. That was brought to my notice very forcibly last summer when I was asked to write an article for an excellent magazine called the <i>Flag,</i> which was published for the benefit of the Union Jack Club. The editor told me that the story was an excellent one and would do very well, but that the War Office did not like it. I asked why, and he said that the authorities thought it would be quite impossible for any bombs ever to be dropped on the War Office. Besides, he added, you have killed the Secretary of State for War. I expressed my willingness to restore the Secretary of State to life and to be content with the Under-Secretary as a mangled corpse, but said I could not remodel the story to such an extent as to deny the possibility of the dropping of bombs from an airship.<lb/>
As far as I can see, the practical steps taken by the War Office are very meagre indeed. Last year, if I am correctly informed, only about &#x00A3;13,000 was voted for the balloon section of the Royal Engineers, including all establishment charges and other expenditure which had nothing whatever to do with experiments in aviation; and, from personal knowledge, I can state that the arrangements at Aldershot, though the officer in charge, Colonel Capper, and his assistants extract from them the utmost value of which they are capable, are altogether inadequate. It is too much to expect an aeroplane to achieve any satisfactory results which has to start from a very rough field with tree stumps and under every possible disadvantage. I saw Mr. Wright fly in France last autumn, and I can say that he had placed at his disposal a most excellent piece of ground and was assisted in every way by the French military authorities. He had troops to keep inconvenient crowds off, and, altogether, the whole atmosphere in which he worked was that of cordial cooperation. Our military aviators, on the other hand, labour in an atmosphere of discouragement, and the work they can do
<col>458</col>
is of a limited kind. The best work, in fact, in this country has up to now been done by private clubs and associations supported by private funds, and they have been able to achieve a good deal.<lb/>
It may be argued that, after all, flying is not yet within the range of practical politics. There I entirely differ. Nobody who has seen Mr. Wright fly, or who has seen the performance of any of those who have absolutely flown over distances of upwards of five or ten miles, will for a moment dare to say that flying is not now possible for any human being with moderate intelligence, an a&#x00EB;roplane at his disposal, and money with which to conduct experiments. The House of Commons, I remember, laughed at me some ten years ago when I ventured to prophesy that the day would come when there would be perhaps more motor cars in Palace Yard than cabs. So also I tell your Lordships frankly to-day, though the War Office authorities and even some of your Lordships may, to a certain extent, discount the idea of a&#x00EB;roplanes being within the range of practical politics, that within three or four years flying will be a common thing, and I hope to come down to your Lordships' House before very long in an aeroplane myself.<lb/>
What is the position to-day? I will go very briefly into the scientific history, which will show how far we have gone. Something like twenty years ago Sir Hiram Maxim was able, by means of a steam engine, to raise what we should now call an aeroplane from the ground with considerable success. His propelling machinery, which was the best that could be got at the time, averaged about ten and a half pounds per horse-power produced. But owing to the development of the internal combustion engine, which we owe largely to the motor car, we have now got the weight down to less than three and a half pounds per horsepower. To give your Lordships an idea how important this is, I may mention that the pigeon only produces one horse-power for every forty-two pounds of weight, and that the goose only produces one horsepower for every 144 pounds of weight; so that mankind has gone ahead of nature in a remarkable way. We produce more than ten times the power per weight that the pigeon does, and when you consider how fast the pigeon flies the fact will be brought home to you that we have capabilities of speed and that all we lack is a little
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0254"/>
<col>459</col>
more experience. As a country we ought not to leave this to private enterprise, but ought to take an active part from the point of view of science, let alone the question of the safety of these realms.<lb/>
I may be asked by my critics, Can airships or aeroplanes become dangerous to this country? Why need we take any notice of the question from the military point of view? I am one of those who believe that within a year or two Germany and France will have a considerable fleet of speedy dirigible balloons. Already these balloons have gone at the rate of thirty miles an hour, and in future will be able to go much faster. They will be capable of carrying six or eight men, or the equivalent in weight of explosives. One does not want to be an expert to know that high explosives of the weight only of six men or weighing 900 lbs. may do very serious damage; and when it is remembered that the balloon can be arrested in its flight and remain stationary over a given point while the explosive is dropped on that site&#x2014;be it a Government office, railway bridge, bank, or dockyard &#x2014;it is obvious that airships may be very dangerous instruments indeed. Only last week the new Zeppelin airship flew thirty-five miles an hour, and, though it went up in a considerable wind, it man&#x00153;uvred with ease and satisfied the very critical authorities on the spot.<lb/>
I should like to tell the House how near as the crow, or as the dirigible, flies this country is to important points on the Continent. London is only 320 miles from Emden; or, to put it in another way, in ten hours a fleet of dirigible balloons could come from Emden and be over London. That, surely, must make us think. Sheerness is 295 miles from Emden, and the distance from Dover to Metz is only 260 miles. Take France. The distance from London to Boulogne is ninety miles, from Sheerness to Boulogne sixty miles, from Dover to Calais twenty-one miles, and from Portsmouth to Cherbourg ninety miles. All these distances are so short compared with what airships have already accomplished that I say, without hesitation, that to-day the insularity of this country is not what it was, and I feel quite certain that when the War Office and His Majesty's Government realise the progress that has been made abroad they will see the necessity of devoting attention to this important question.
<col>460</col>
To give an instance of how the coming of airships may revolutionise our ideas, I would point out that most of our fortifications are protected in the main against horizontal attack; very few are protected against overhead attack, and our dockyards are not so protected at all. It seems to me, as one of the first things that ought to be done, that at any rate the great arsenals of this country should be so constructed that bombs dropped upon them should not explode the quantities of powder held in reserve. Again, even if we took no active steps for using a&#x00EB;roplanes as regards attack, it should be the duty of the Government to get, as soon as possible, a gun that is capable of firing at a high angle. There has been a howitzer constructed lately at Barrow which has shown good results, but a fixed gun is of no use against an aerial enemy. In my opinion the gun of the future which will be useful against a&#x00EB;roplanes or dirigible balloons is one capable of being rapidly moved, so as to follow airships and harass and destroy them.<lb/>
What have the Germans done in this matter? Only three days ago I received from a friend of mine in Berlin details and a photograph of a new Krupp gun which can be fired at practically any angle overhead, and can also be attached to a motor-wagon and moved rapidly over the country. I am told that Germany has ordered a great number of these guns, and that they are to be placed all along the western frontier. I am also informed that in this country we have no such gun in contemplation. I bring this forward in no party spirit, but I think the War Office and the Admiralty should realise that the nations on the Continent are most feverishly working at this problem and devoting large sums of money and energy to it. In Germany the national interest in the Zeppelin airship was such that when the Count's airship was destroyed the German people raised &#x00A3;275,000 by public subscription, to which the Government added &#x00A3;25,000. When other nations are doing so much, it seems to me that a grant of &#x00A3;13,000 last year to cover the whole of our experiments in this direction, and a grant, as stated by Mr. Haldane in another place, of &#x00A3;19,000 this year is absolutely inadequate and unworthy of this country.<lb/>
I will quote a few figures to give your Lordships an idea of how serious the position has become of late. As regards dirigible
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0255"/>
<col>461</col>
balloons, the German "Zeppelin" has flown 270 miles, from Friedrichshafen to Lucerne and back, and in August of last year covered 360 miles, or a considerably longer distance than that from the nearest point of Germany to this country. In speed the "Zeppelin," 1908 type, covered twenty-six miles per hour, whilst the 1909 type covered from thirty to thirty-five miles an hour, and in some cases an even higher speed was attained. The question of altitude is also an important consideration. The 1908 type of Zeppelin reached an altitude of 2,600 feet, whilst the latest type has reached 5,643 feet. I do not know whether your Lordships have endeavoured to shoot at anything at a good height, but I can assure you that the chance of hitting a balloon 1,000 feet up in the air is very small indeed. Here you have airships capable of an altitude of nearly 6,000 feet. This shows how dangerous they can become. As regards France, the "Patrie" covered 160 miles from Paris to Verdun at thirty miles an hour, whilst another balloon, the "Republique," has attained an altitude of over 4,500 feet. Mr, Wright has already flown seventy-seven miles in two hours and twenty minutes, which is the longest time recorded; and only the other day, at Le Mans, he flew fifty miles in one hour and nine minutes with one passenger and at an altitude of 360 feet, and he told me himself that he could easily have risen to an altitude of a mile, and, if necessary, higher.<lb/>
I beg your Lordships' pardon for having detained the House some time, but I think I have put enough facts before you to show that in this matter we must display as a nation more energy than we have been doing. No one who considers the rapid march of the science of aviation nowadays can help to a certain extent, blaming the permanent officials and the Army Council for their slackness in the past. It has been the traditional attitude to wait until private inventors or foreign nations have perfected their arrangements and then to come in with a rush. But shall we be able in this matter to come in with a rush? This question, in my opinion, cannot be deferred, and with all sincerity I ask His Majesty's Government to give it their most careful attention.<lb/>

<p>*<member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I must apologise for replying in the place of my noble friend the Under-Secretary of State for War, who is absent through indisposition, although, in a sense, perhaps, as the matter is one which does not concern one Department but the defence of the whole country, it is appropriate that a member of the Cabinet should reply to the noble Lord's Question. No one, I am sure, can complain of the noble Lord for having brought this subject forward, and his apology for taking up the time of the House was entirely unnecessary. We know that he is a real expert in all these matters, and we are grateful for his advice and welcome the information he has been able to give.<lb/>
The noble Lord seemed to imply that there was a tendency on the part of Government offices, if not to treat these matters lightly, at any rate to be unwilling to look closely into them, on the ground that all Government offices dislike anything new. It is, however, the fact that the Committee of Defence have turned their attention very seriously to this subject. As my right hon. friend the Secretary of State told the House of Commons, the matter has been referred to experts with a view of seeing what further steps ought to be taken, and, so far as the Army is concerned, more money is being spent than was spent last year. The noble Lord compared the sum of &#x00A3;13,000 spent last year with the &#x00A3;19,000 down for this year, but I think his comparison is not correct. The actual sum really spent for this purpose last year was only about &#x00A3;5,000, and therefore the increase to &#x00A3;19,000 this year marks a very considerable advance.<lb/>
It is perfectly true that there is an indisposition, not, I think, on the part of public Offices generally, but of the Treasury, to expend large sums in experiments of this kind. That is one of the disadvantages, if you will have it so, under which we labour from the form of Parliamentary government under which we live, and, I hope, prosper. Other countries where the Estimates are not so closely scrutinised as they are here, find it easier, perhaps, to spend large sums on matters of this kind; but I do assure the noble Lord that he is
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0256"/>
<col>463</col>
not right in saying that this very important question is pooh-poohed by the War Office in this country. He must have been, I think, led astray by some <i>obiter dicta</i> or casual remarks of some particular individual which may have been repeated to him, and which may, perhaps, have misled him as to the general attitude of the Department.<lb/>
The noble Lord asks for a Return of the expenditure of foreign Governments on these matters. I do not know whether the noble Lord desires to have the figures circulated, but I shall be very happy to read them now so far as I possess them. In the year 1908, in France the ordinary expenditure was &#x00A3;7,000, the extraordinary expenditure &#x00A3;12,000, and for the upkeep of ballooning units &#x00A3;28,500, being a total of &#x00A3;47,500. In Germany the Home Office Vote for the Zeppelin airship was &#x00A3;107,500; no figure is given for upkeep of balloon material, but the annual expenditure on balloon battalions was &#x00A3; 26,231, making a total of &#x00A3;133,731. It is also true, as the noble Lord mentioned, that a large sum was raised by private subscription after the great national enthusiasm excited by Count Zeppelin's voyage down the Rhine. In Austria-Hungary the ordinary expenditure was &#x00A3;3,000, and the extraordinary &#x00A3;2,500. That represents the annual instalment of a sum of &#x00A3;50,000 which was voted for this purpose.<lb/>
The policy of the War Office and the Admiralty, but, in particular, as regards this one matter the War Office, has been to enlist private enterprise as far as possible in learning more about this exceedingly important subject. I think it would be simpler, although I believe it is not strictly in order, if I were to quote the words of the Secretary of State in another place. My right hon. friend said&#x2014;
<quote>"We think that probably we have reached a stage when progress will be more rapidly made by dealing with private inventors than if we confined ourselves to the work of our own very capable officials, who have not the facilities which many private inventors have."</quote><lb/>
My right hon. friend was there speaking only of a&#x00EB;roplanes and not of dirigible balloons, in which experiments are being carried out both by the War Office and by the Admiralty. There is no doubt that
<col>464</col>
this in the future may be a question of great gravity for this country. It is impossible to dispute that. I do not attempt to enter into the forecasts made by the noble Lord opposite, but it is quite evident that the conditions of warfare may be, at any rate, to a very considerable extent, almost revolutionised by these inventions, and therefore we are obliged to keep a close watch upon what is going on in other countries.<lb/>
I think the noble Lord rather underestimated the fact that we do, at any rate so far as the possibilities of the future are concerned, gain something from the experience of other countries. Other countries have gained experience from us, for instance in the case of submarine boats. Although not the pioneers, we have gone very far ahead in submarine boats, but as we continue to improve our submarines I have no doubt foreign countries will be able to improve theirs in proportion. Therefore, it is hardly fair to argue as though the experience of foreign countries might not, at any rate to a certain extent&#x2014;I do not say entirely&#x2014;be applied to our own future operations. But, as I said, it is a very serious matter. Anything which tends to diminish the advantage that we have enjoyed through so many hundred years of history from our insular position is, of course, of the greatest possible concern; and I only desire once more to assure the noble Lord that he need not be afraid that any of the Departments concerned will ignore this matter or allow it to slip. I can assure him also that if increased expenditure is found to be necessary in the future for this purpose, the money will be forthcoming. I can only say, in conclusion, that I shall look forward to seeing the noble Lord arrive at your Lordships' House in his a&#x00EB;roplane; and, if the House is to be besieged, as it sometimes has been lately, by those who desire to take part in sending Members to another place, we shall all be glad to join the noble Lord in that method of approach.<lb/>

<title>GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY (STEAM VESSELS) BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p>Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p>Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Churchill</i>.)</p>
<p><member>LORD INVERCLYDE</member> <membercontribution>rose to move that the Bill be read a second time this day six months. The noble Lord said: My Lords, I rise to oppose this Bill for the purpose of drawing attention to the increased powers which railway companies are seeking to own steamers. It seems to me that the length railway companies are now going in the direction of steamboat-owning has reached a point when it is a matter of public policy to consider whether the line should not be now laid down and they should not be allowed to go any further.<lb/>
Certain Scottish railway companies have powers to own steamers, and, in consequence, have practically run all private steamboat enterprise off the Clyde. Only the other day one of the Clyde companies had to go into liquidation as a result. Having done this and lost their shareholders' money in doing so, the railway companies have now entered into a combination among themselves and are withdrawing a certain number of their steamers and arranging to pool the receipts and raise the fares; and this, I maintain, is to the disadvantage of the public. Railway companies, of necessity, have a monopoly more or less on land. That monopoly is now spreading, and railway companies are also obtaining a monopoly of the Channel and coasting trade to a very great extent. Yet I make bold to say that there is not a single steamer owned by a railway company which is run at
<col>466</col>
a profit. I must admit that I am unable to prove that by figures, because the accounts of railway companies are so made up as to render that impossible; but I do not think anyone connected with a railway company will contradict my statement.<lb/>
It is exceedingly hard that <i>bon&#x00E2; fide</i> shipowners who run steamers for their livelihood should be subjected to such competition as is now met with from railway companies. The companies, of course, maintain that, although the steamers make a loss, there is a profit to them on the through journey. I do not think that is fair competition, and, as things are going just now, I do not know where it will stop. Under Clause 4 of this Bill the railway companies seek an extension of the steamboat powers they already possess. I object to this clause altogether. I object to the indefinite powers sought under the clause to run steamers to all ports on the coast of France between St. Malo and Nantes. Under the Merchant Shipping Act the coasting trade is confined to ports between Brest and Hamburg. In this Bill the Company are seeking powers to run steamers to ports in the Bay of Biscay. If they are given power to run to the Bay of Biscay, why should they not run to the Cape and to New York? I do not know where it will end. Under that clause also the railway company could enter the British coasting trade between the British ports named in the clause, but I understand that it is not the intention of the company to do so.<lb/>
Under Clause 5 the railway company may subscribe to the funds of any steamship company running traffic between the ports named in the Bill. The power sought is a very wide one indeed, and the railway company, if they do not run their own steamers, merely have to run another company's, and would be entitled to subscribe money to that company for running steamers between the authorised ports, and, having subscribed to that company, there is nothing to prevent these steamers running to any other ports. In fact, it would only be a separate company in name; and under that clause there is no condition that the steamers should sail under the British flag.<lb/>
I know I shall be told that other railway companies possess similar powers. I admit that; but I have felt bound to draw
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0258"/>
<col>467</col>
attention to this matter because the shipping trade is getting alarmed at the increased powers which railway companies are procuring in this direction. If your Lordships decide to give this Bill a Second Reading, I shall make this appeal to the noble Lord who represents the Board of Trade, that in the public interest they will protect us when the Bill goes before Committee. Shipowners have not a sufficient margin of profit to go to the heavy expense of fighting these Bills before Committees upstairs, and I think this is a case where the Board of Trade ought to look after our interests.</membercontribution></p>
<p>Amendment moved&#x2014;</p>
<quote>"To leave out the word 'now' and to add at the end of the Motion the words 'this day six months.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Inverclyde</i>.)</quote>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT CHURCHILL </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the noble Lord said he believed he would be answered by the statement that other companies had the same powers as we are seeking to obtain under this Bill. That, I think, is a very effective reply to any objection that can be taken to the Second Reading of this Bill. Under the Bill we seek for no further powers than are already possessed by other companies. This Bill, in fact, is framed on the last precedent passed by Parliament&#x2014;namely, the North Eastern Railway Bill of 1905, which contains exactly similar provisions to those in Clauses 4 and 5&#x2014;the clauses to which, I understand, the noble Lord objects; the only difference is that the powers described are confined to vessels registered in a British port. The Great Western Railway Company have already drawn up an Amendment dealing with this subject. The powers sought under this Bill are infinitely more limited than those granted to other companies in recent years, and I really do not know that it is necessary, for the purpose of asking your Lordships to read the Bill a second time, that I should detain the House by going into the details of those powers. The noble Lord remarked that the coasting trade was limited between Brest and Hamburg. Many of your Lordships know that there are companies possessing powers to run steamers to the whole of the Baltic ports, and also to intermediate places along the coast from Dunkirk. The North Eastern Company, in the Act of 1905, have exactly the same powers as we are seeking for in Clause 5. We are, however, perfectly willing to limit that clause to arrange-
<col>468</col>
ments for working purposes only, and not to subscribe to the capital of other companies&#x2014;in other words, not to subsidise them. A petition has been lodged by Messrs. Hutchison, who are shipowners, which raises practically all the questions touched upon by the noble Lord with regard to both clauses, which will, of course, be heard and fully discussed before a Committee. I understand, also, that my noble friend who represents the Board of Trade in this House is quite satisfied that the Great Western Railway Company are prepared to meet any of the points which the Department would like slightly amended. Under these circumstances, I hope your Lordships will see fit to give the Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, on behalf of the Board of Trade I would say that the Department are always very unwilling t o interfere in any way with these questions. This matter has been given a most careful consideration, and the opinion of the Department is that it is one which may quite well be left to the decision of a Committee of your Lordships' House. Therefore, on behalf of the Government I do not oppose the Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF ONSLOW)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, perhaps I ought to say a word. The position of this Bill differs somewhat from that of the Bill which your Lordships were considering last night. The questions raised yesterday by the noble Earl, Lord Donoughmore, were of a general character which could not well be discussed before a Select Committee, because they would not arise out of any of the petitions; but, as the noble Viscount who moved the Second Reading of this Bill has just stated, a petition has been presented against this Bill by certain shipowners in Glasgow, who, in all probability, will be allowed a <i>locus standi</i>. They raise the objections which have been put before the House to-night by the noble Lord who opposed the Second Reading, and, therefore, they will come within the cognisance of the Committee to whom the Bill will be referred. In those circumstances, I could not advise your Lordships to refuse to give the Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD INVERCLYDE </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, in view of the assurance which the noble Viscount has given me in regard to Clause 5, I shall not trouble the House to divide.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0259"/>

Your Lordships may recollect that last session I moved for and obtained the correspondence which had taken place between Lady Cathcart and the Scottish Office with regard to raid upon Vatersay, and that afterwards there was a discussion in this House on the subject. Since July last there have been further correspondence and further negotiations between Lady Cathcart and the Scottish Office, which have terminated in the purchase of Vatersay. Therefore, of course, there are further documents which I think it would be of interest to your Lordships&#x2014;it certainly would be of interest to me&#x2014;to be possessed of officially.

<title>A CROFTER RAID.</title>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> <membercontribution>rose to call attention to a recent raid by crofters upon the farm of Glendale in South Uist, and to ask what action the Government took with regard thereto; also to ask whether any negotiations with reference to the division of Glendale into small holdings took place between the Congested Districts Board and Lady Cathcart from November 1906 (when Glendale was returned to Lady Cathcart as unsuitable for small holdings) to March 1, 1909; and to move for Papers.<lb/>
The noble Earl said: My Lords, I have now to direct your Lordships' attention to a raid which recently took place in South Uist on the farm of Glendale; and perhaps, as the Government have hitherto acted on the principle that a raid is not a criminal act, it may be as well that I should explain to your Lordships what I mean by a raid and what I do not mean. I do not call a raid a case in which persons take possession of land which they assert legal claim to; nor a case in which they do not interfere with persons who are occupying the land; nor, again, do I call a raid a case which is simply one of dispute between landlord and tenant. What I mean by a raid is where persons who have nothing to do with the land themselves, who do not lay any claim to it, who do not allege that there is any dispute, enter upon land occupied by other persons and violently and forcibly continue to occupy it in defiance of the law and of the ordinary customs of society.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0260"/>
<col>471</col>
In order that your Lordships may be able to understand all the circumstances and the present position, I must ask your indulgence while I very shortly recount what has happened in regard to this farm of Glendale since the year 1904. In September, 1904, I think it was, the then Secretary for Scotland&#x2014;I think it right to remind your Lordships that Lord Pentland was not Secretary for Scotland until the beginning of the year 1906&#x2014;submitted to Lady Cathcart a report he had received on the state of society in South Uist, accompanied, I think, by a memorandum by the Under-Secretary. It mentioned that there were about 197 cases of persons who were desirous of getting land, and in the Under-Secretary's memorandum it was stated that if about one-fourth of these could be accommodated he thought the situation could be sufficiently dealt with.<lb/>
Lady Cathcart, on receiving this, acted in the way which she always has acted. She was most desirous of assisting the Government and the island in every way she could, and she readily gave up two farms&#x2014;one named Kilbride and the other Gerinish&#x2014;and handed them over to the Congested Districts Board for the purpose of making small holdings. The occurrence I have just mentioned took place in September and in the following weeks; but on December 12 the late Sir David Brand, who was chairman of the Crofters Commission, with another of his colleagues, and, I think, the secretary, saw Lady Cathcart's Edinburgh agent on the subject, and it was Sir David Brand who suggested that the farm of Glendale should also be given up for the purpose of creating small holdings. Lady Cathcart's agent stated that he had very grave doubts as to whether this farm was really suited for the purpose, but Sir David Brand and his colleague did not agree with him and requested him to lay the matter before her Ladyship. He did so, and Lady Cathcart, although she said she entertained grave doubts whether this farm was suited for small holdings, did not feel herself able to withstand the strong appeal made to her. She thereupon agreed to give in to their petition, and to see whether she could obtain the farm for them by inducing the tenant to give up his lease. She succeeded, and in the year 1906 at Whitsunday, the tenant, one Simon Mackenzie by name, quitted his holding, and it was handed over to her Ladyship,
<col>472</col>
who requested the Congested Districts Board to inspect it for the purpose of establishing small holdings and report upon it. That was in May; and on July 18 the Crofters Commission sent a small committee to report upon it.<lb/>
Perhaps I ought to describe briefly this farm of Glendale. It consists of, in round figures, 4,400 acres, of which 1,100 are situated in North Glendale and the remaining 3,000 odd in South Glendale. They found that on both farms there was very little arable land. In North Glendale they said they might constitute six small holdings, which they put at a rental of &#x00A3;3 a piece; but, with regard to South Glendale, they reported that unless they were to take the shepherd's house, thereby, of course, .making the farm useless as a sheep farm, it was impossible to establish any small holdings there, and they recommended that South Glendale should be let as a whole either to the neighbouring crofters or as a separate holding. This report was sent to Lady Cathcart, and her local factor proceeded to advertise publicly for tenants. The result was that he obtained offers for the six holdings in North Glendale, but the six holders were unwilling to have anything to do with South Glendale, and he could not induce either the neighbouring townships or any private tenant to have anything to do with South Glendale as a separate holding. That report was handed to the Congested Districts Board on November 14. They examined it, and on November 19 wrote as follows:&#x2014;
<quote>"The Congested Districts Board have at once accepted the opinion of the estate management that Glendale cannot be provided for the crofters with advantage. It would be foolish to destroy the usefulness of the southern part by breaking up the northern part into six holdings, and the Board therefore agree that Glendale must be left out of the scheme for small holdings."</quote><lb/>
The meaning of that, of course, is that the Board, having occupied this holding for some few months, found that Lady Cathcart had been perfectly right, that they had made an entire mistake, and that the farm was not adapted for small holdings and, in justice to Lady Cathcart, I must say this, that when this land was given up she then, of her own free will, broke up two further farms and gave them to the Congested Districts Board in lieu of the Glendale farm. The result has been that she has provided at least seventy-five
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0261"/>
<col>473</col>
holdings, whereas it had been suggested to her that she should provide fifty. That, then, takes us to the end of 1906.<lb/>
In November, 1906, the farm is thrown back upon Lady Cathcart's hands. From that time to the year 1908 she could not get a tenant. For two years she had to occupy the farm, of course at very considerable loss to herself; and finally, at Whitsunday, 1908, the same Simon Mackenzie retook the farm, but at a loss of over &#x00A3;30 a year in rent to Lady Cathcart. His rent had been &#x00A3;97, but the new rent which he promised to pay was &#x00A3;65. Therefore, what was the net result of the whole transaction up to the year 1908? The Congested Districts Board had confessed that they had made a great mistake; they did not put any small holders upon Glendale; they involved Lady Cathcart in a permanent loss of &#x00A3;30 a year rent, and they turned out her tenant. With regard to Lady Cathcart's loss, last year the Scottish Office or the Congested Districts Board&#x2014;it is the same thing&#x2014;paid her a sum of &#x00A3;350. Her agent computed her loss on the farm in each year as at least &#x00A3;125 and the local factor said it was much more; therefore, the result to her was this, that she received &#x00A3;100 as compensation for the loss of &#x00A3;30 a year rent. From that date forward there have been no negotiations between Lady Cathcart and the Congested Districts Board with regard to this farm. There has only been one communication, and that was in March of last year, when Sir Henry Cook called upon her agent in Edinburgh and asked whether he thought her ladyship would let North Glendale. Sir Henry Cook merely had to be reminded of the circumstances; that was sufficient for him and he went away, and nothing more was ever said on the subject.<lb/>
That brings us to the month of February this year. On February 5 last North Glendale was raided. The tenant, of course, applied to Lady Cathcart's factor, who found that seven men were collecting stones for building houses and were spreading seaweed for cultivation. He pointed out to them that they were doing great wrong. They said that they should remain and that they considered they had a perfectly good claim to have holdings there. He went away and applied to the police for protection. What the result of that may have been I do not know; and I want
<col>474</col>
to know. A Mr. Ferguson, a local merchant, had been very active in this matter, and it is generally believed that either the Scottish Office or the Congested Districts Board wrote him a very severe letter. If they did, I must congratulate the noble Lord on at last beginning to see that the Government have some duty towards property.<lb/>
The general belief is that the noble Lord wrote a letter, and that on receipt of this letter these raiders retired. Now, I have to ask the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland whether he will be so good as to read that letter to the House when he speaks later. I am very anxious to know what was in it. I will tell your Lordships why. I want to know whether there was anything in the nature of a promise to these men that if they would go away they would receive small holdings. It was on February 18 that they left, and on March 1 Sir John Dewar, the Member for Inverness, asked the Lord Advocate in the other House&#x2014;
<quote>"whether he was aware that the negotiations between Lady Gordon Cathcart and the Congested Districts Board for Scotland to divide up the farm of Glendale in South Uist among the cottars and fishermen in the district had not been completed, and that in view of the approach of the sowing and planting season, there was anxiety and dissatisfaction among the population of that district; whether he could state the cause of the delay, and if he would take steps to impress upon the Congested Districts Board the necessity for having this matter completed with the least possible delay."</quote>
What is the meaning of that question? The plain meaning is that negotiations had been and were in progress, and that they must very soon be completed. So far as Lady Cathcart's agent knows, there were no negotiations whatever. Assuming that to be correct, the natural and proper answer to have given to that question was that there were no negotiations. But that was not the answer given. The Lord Advocate, in reply, said&#x2014;
<quote>"It was found impossible in 1906, when certain farms were sub-divided by Lady Cathcart in South Uist, to make use of Glendale as a crofter settlement&#x2026;. As my hon. friend is aware, these cotter fishermen applied for holdings in the north part of Glendale in January, 1908, but the estate would not entertain this proposal, as it would have left South Glendale unlettable and useless. I am aware that some of the cottar fishermen of the district are anxious to obtain holdings at Glendale, but my hon. friend will realise that the difficulties which have so far been fatal to any scheme still exist. But the Secretary for Scotland will again
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0262"/>
<col>475</col>
look into the matter now in the hope of finding some method of convincing them."</quote>
Taking that question and that answer, what, naturally, would the cottars suppose? They would suppose, as anybody else would suppose, that negotiations were going on, whereas nothing whatever had been done. This occurred on March 1. It is rather curious that on March 4 Sir Henry Cook officially called on Lady Cathcart's agent and asked whether Lady Cathcart was prepared to consider the formation of six or seven holdings on North Glendale, on the understanding that the Board would make loans for buildings, etc. Poor Sir Henry Cook! He is a man of well-known common sense, of great ability, and familiar with land transactions, and he was the very man who had, only two years before, written to Lady Cathcart's agents to say that the Congested Districts Board found they had made a mistake and that this farm was not suited for small holdings. This same gentleman now found himself compelled to ask whether her ladyship would let a part of the farm separately&#x2014;a thing he had said himself would be foolish to do.<lb/>
The noble Lord was Secretary for Scotland in 1906 and chairman of the Board, and must have been cognisant of the proceedings that took place. What I want to know is&#x2014;Why has he changed his mind? I do hope he will tell us. I wonder whether he has formed any opinion at all in his own mind as to what is to be done with this farm. What is to be done with South Glendale? How does he propose to let it? It has more than once been in the market and no tenant could be found. That is by far the larger portion of the farm. If these small holdings are taken off the North, what is to become of the South? There is another question. This Government pretend to have a great love for occupiers. Are they going to evict this unfortunate Simon Mackenzie for a second time in order, most probably, to again find that they have made a great mistake? Then we come to Lady Cathcart. What is to happen to her? She has already lost thirty per cent. of rent by the transactions of the Congested Districts Board. Is she to bear the brunt of this? I do hope the noble Lord will not repeat in this case, at all events, what he did in the case of Vatersay. I hope he will not say to Lady Cathcart, as he did on that occasion, that the plan of which she had
<col>476</col>
not only disapproved but had opposed to the best of her judgment was her plan, and that she was responsible for the compensation of the tenant who was turned out. If Lady Cathcart has one grain of sense, all I can say is she will not consent to let North Glendale.<lb/>
If the noble Lord wishes to let North Glendale separately, let him buy the farm and stand the inevitable loss on South Glendale. Does he expect any rent, I wonder? Let me remind him of what has been going on. In Barra there were several of these small crofter tenants who had nominally bought land which they were to pay for by instalments, but who have not fulfilled one of their obligations. The noble Lord found himself obliged to obtain an interdict against them for non-payment of rent. But the noble Lord has done nothing whatever from the time of obtaining the interdict to enforce it. About that he and the Treasury had better settle. But if he thinks he is going to obtain rent from the smallholders in North Glendale his experience will be somewhat different from what it has been in other cases. This case of Glendale is not an isolated instance. I very much wish it were. It is one of a number of raids which, I regret to say, are becoming far from uncommon in the Hebrides. The noble Lord has not heard the last yet of Vatersay. The noble Lord is aware that at the present moment there is a raid on the farm or Eoligary, which, fortunately for herself, Lady Cathcart sold some years ago, though I am sorry for the purchaser. That farm has been raided, and, so far as I know, the men are still in possession.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH </member>: <membercontribution>That is not so.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN </member>: <membercontribution>That suggests at once the question&#x2014;Did the noble Lord write a letter in regard to Eoligary? Will he tell us the position?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH </member>: <membercontribution>I shall be very glad to answer the noble Earl about Eoligary when that subject is under discussion. The noble Earl asks me if I wrote a letter. To whom?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN </member>: <membercontribution>That is not for me to say. I understood the noble Lord to interrupt me and to say that the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0263"/>
<col>477</col>
raiders were not now on Eoligary. I asked him if he would kindly tell us what he had done in regard to Eoligary.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH </member>: <membercontribution>I did not wish to interrupt the noble Earl but simply to give him the information which I thought he was seeking&#x2014;namely, that at the present moment, so far as I am aware, there is nobody in illegal possession of land at Eoligary.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN </member>: <membercontribution>At all events, the noble Lord will not deny that there were raiders on Eoligary.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH </member>: <membercontribution>There have been from time to time, as the noble Earl knows, raids such as he has described, and attempted raids.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN </member>: <membercontribution>And there was a very recent attempt?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH </member>: <membercontribution>Yes, quite recent. I have no wish to conceal information, but the facts are not in my possession to give to the noble Earl. Therefore I am sorry I interrupted him. If he will ask me for the facts to-morrow I will give them to him.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN </member>: <membercontribution>I regret that the noble Lord did not go a little farther. He says there is nobody at present in illegal possession of land at Eoligary. Will he deny that within the last three weeks persons have raided Eoligary?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH </member>: <membercontribution>That is so. If the noble Earl will allow me, I am anxious to state exactly the facts. Raiding, as the noble Earl knows, is a very wide term. Raiding sometimes means collecting stones and leaving them upon a holding; in other cases it means placing seaweed on the holding; and in other cases it means taking materials for building houses. All those acts come under the general term of raiding, and I do not wish the House to be led to think that a raid is necessarily of a serious character. It is quite true that there have been threats to seize land in Eoligary.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN </member>: <membercontribution>Such information as I have is that, not only did they use seaweed and stones, but that they remained on the land against the wish of
<col>478</col>
the owner. How came these men to leave? I believe they, too, received a letter, whether from the noble Lord or from the Congested Districts Board I do not know; but I should like to know whether any promise was made to them that if they would remove they should be considered in some manner either with regard to obtaining land or anything of that kind. I now leave the case of Eoligary. There is another farm, the farm of Milton, a large grazing farm. The noble Lord may or may not know that a public declaration has been made that that farm is to be raided because the lease falls out in the course of next year, the raiders being determined to anticipate the termination of the lease. But there are other cases I could mention.<lb/>
Does the noble Lord call this a satisfactory state of things? Will he tell your Lordships that at the present time law and order is satisfactorily observed in the Western Hebrides? And if this is not so, to what are these raids due? I regret to say that, in my opinion, they are due, in the first place, to that unfortunate declaration of the Government that it was no part of the duty of Government to protect private property, and that if any property were attacked or seized the only remedy was for the private owner to go to Court. I attribute them, in the next place, I regret to be obliged to say, very greatly to the noble Lord's vacillation. How many times has he changed his mind in these matters? Take the case of Glendale. In 1906 he said it was not suited for holdings and threw it back on Lady Cathcart's hands. Now, in the beginning of 1909, he is writing to ask her to give him a part of the farm. But most of all, I think, is it due to a conviction which exists in the minds of the crofters that the Government are on their side. This is not a statement of my own. It is the statement of the Sheriff of Inverness, whom the Government sent to inquire into matters at Vatersay. He said he found that there was a firm conviction in the minds of the raiders that the Government would not allow them to suffer. It is that conviction which has been manifest in everything that the Government have done and everything that they have not done. The state of the Western Islands is at the present time serious and is becoming from month to month more serious, and, unless the noble Lord changes his ways and his methods, he will find himself face to face with some
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0264"/>
<col>479</col>
thing which will approach an armed revolution. I beg to ask the Question of which I have given notice, and to move for any Papers that there are in connection with this matter.<lb/>
<i>Moved</i>, That there be laid before the House Papers respecting a recent raid by crofters upon the farm of Glendale in South Uist.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Camperdown</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I hope I may be able to give the noble Earl the information he desires, and I trust I may secure your Lordships' indulgent attention in addressing you for the first time. I have no quarrel whatever to make with the narrative given by the noble Earl of these proceedings. It is true that in 1904 Lord Balfour of Burleigh requested the Crofters Commission to report upon the condition of North and South Uist.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH </member>: <membercontribution>I beg the noble Lord's pardon&#x2014;not in 1904. I left the Scottish Office in 1903.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH </member>: <membercontribution>The Report was made in 1904, but it was in 1903 that the directions were given by the noble Lord. The Report is addressed to the noble Lord's successor Mr. Graham Murray (now Lord Dunedin). My object in mentioning that Report is to draw the attention of the House to the fact that it disclosed a serious state of overcrowding in the island of South Uist. The Report was sent, as the noble Earl stated, with a memorandum from the Scottish Office, to Lady Gordon Cathcart, and her reply was that she proposed to divide up the two farms of Kilbride and Gerinish, and subsequently the farm of Glendale was added. I have done my best to ascertain the source from which the suggestion came that the farm of Glendale should be added to the land to be subdivided, but I am not quite clear from whom the suggestion came. I only mention that so that I may not be taken as agreeing with the noble Earl. It may have been Sir David Brand, but I am not sure that it was.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN </member>: <membercontribution>Lady Cathcart's agent, to whom Sir David Brand spoke, said it was.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH </member>: <membercontribution>I know that is the view held. Ultimately this farm of Glendale was added to the land
<col>480</col>
which it was proposed to give over to the occupation of crofters. I ought to say, at this point, that when the Government of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman took office at the end of 1905 this transaction was practically on its legs. The Government were committed to the transaction, and it was no part of my duty as Secretary for Scotland to go back upon the policy of my predecessor. The Government, as I say, were committed to the transaction, and it was then in the executive hands of the Congested Districts Board to carry out. I may say that the whole narrative is contained in the Eighth and Ninth Reports of the Congested Districts Board which have been laid before Parliament [Cd. 2946 and Cd. 3471]. There the information is given that because South Glendale could not be utilised the whole farm was taken out of the scheme of settlement and handed back to Lady Cathcart. It is to be noted that for the six holdings which were to be laid out on the north portion of the farm of Glendale there were no fewer than twenty-three offerers, so that obviously there was considerable local disappointment when those holdings were withdrawn from the number to be added to the crofters holdings of the island, but there seemed no other possible solution. The Congested Districts Board cannot afford to have land which is in no occupation at all, and the transaction of handing back this farm to Lady Cathcart, which I do not think the noble Earl made as clear as I should like, was a perfectly amicable arrangement. The compensation asked for by Lady Cathcart's agents was named at &#x00A3;350, and the Congested Districts Board, through their solicitor, agreed to that sum without demur. It w is a perfectly amicable arrangement.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN </member>: <membercontribution>I should like to supplement that. The offer was made by Lady Cathcart early. She subsequently discovered that she had suffered a much larger loss, but, having mentioned that sum, her agent did not ask for more.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH </member>: <membercontribution>I did not mean in the least to suggest that the Congested Districts Board had anything to complain of in this matter on the part of Lady Cathcart.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN </member>: <membercontribution>I should think not.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0265"/>
<col>481</col>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH </member>: <membercontribution>On the other hand, I take the position that Lady Cathcart has nothing to complain of in the attitude of the Congested Districts Board. I wish to make that point clear. I now come to the most recent transactions which stand first in the noble Earl's Question. The facts are simply these. On February 12 I received a letter from Mr. Donald Ferguson, dated February 9. I may say that Mr. Ferguson is personally known to me and is a highly respected and trustworthy member of the community there. He is a native of the island, and has risen to his present position by his own exertions. Mr. Ferguson informed me that seven cottars at South Lochboisdale had seized a piece of land at Glendale farm in his own neighbourhood, tenanted by Simon Mackenzie, of Lochboisdale. I had no official information on the subject. I replied on the same day, and, as the noble Earl has asked for the letter, perhaps I may be allowed to read it in full&#x2014;

<quote>"I am greatly obliged by your letter which has reached me this morning, and your kindness in acquainting me of what has taken place. I appreciate warmly your purpose in so doing, but I regret extremely that these men, by taking this serious step, have so greatly prejudiced, if not thrown away altogether, any opportunities which I might have of helping them in their difficulties. With the earlier transactions between the Congested Districts Board and the proprietor I am, of course, acquainted; but, so far as I remember, it is new to me that any application was made by them, as you mention, two years ago to the factor and refused. Your influence with them and your desire to be their friend must, I am sure, be recognised by them. You know how impossible it is for me to do otherwise than disapprove in the strongest manner the lawless action which they have taken. My advice is that you should go to them and exert your utmost influence to persuade them to withdraw at once from their illegal occupation of this land. If you can inform me that this step has been taken by them, and if you will then, on their behalf and your own, ask me to look into the circumstances of the case, I shall be glad to do so with the least possible delay."</quote>
Those are the terms of the letter which I addressed to Mr. Ferguson.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD SALTOUN </member>: <membercontribution>Will the noble Lord give the date of that letter?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH </member>: <membercontribution>February 12. On February 17 I was informed that these men had relinquished their illegal occupation of the land, and a report was received by me on February 19 to the same effect from the Chief Constable of the county. In passing, I may say, on my
<col>482</col>
own behalf, that I do not think any possible interpretation of that letter can be construed as a promise of small holdings to these men. I will proceed with the narrative in order to make clear to your Lordships what action I have since taken in this matter. On February 18 I sent this information to the chairman of the Small Holdings Committee of the Congested Districts Board, and on the 25th I asked him to communicate with the proprietor's agents. On March 4 an interview took place between members of the Congested Districts Board or their solicitor and the proprietor's agents, and the matter now rests with them. I have not been informed of any final conclusion reached by the parties who are conferring on this subject, and I suggest, with great respect to your Lordships, that in a matter of this kind, which is one of some difficulty &#x2014;difficulty which has had to be faced not only by this Government but by previous Governments&#x2014;it is very desirable to allow the negotiations to proceed without anything being said from one side or the other which might prejudice the chances of success. For that reason, and for that reason alone, I hope your Lordships will excuse me from expressing any definite opinion at this stage. I shall be perfectly ready to answer for any responsibility which falls upon me in the matter when the transaction has been concluded. I hope I have now answered the first portion of the noble Earl's Question on the Paper.<lb/>
The noble Earl next asks whether any negotiations with reference to the division of Glendale into small holdings took place between the Congested Districts Board and Lady Cathcart from November, 1906, to March 1, 1909. The only application of which I am aware was on January 18, 1908, when six cottars who had been applicants for the holdings at North Glendale in 1906 wrote to Sir John Dewar, the member for the county, asking him to help them to obtain these holdings. That letter was forwarded to me by Sir John Dewar, and I sent it to the Congested Districts Board who laid it before the estate management. Lady Cathcart's representatives declined to entertain the matter, and a reply was sent by me to Sir John Dewar informing him that the farm was not now included in the scheme of settlement, and that any further applications must go, therefore, not to the Congested Districts Board, but to the proprietor. That, so far as I am aware, is the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0266"/>
<col>483</col>
only negotiation which falls within the head of the second portion of the noble Earl's Question.<lb/>
As to the third head&#x2014;the request for Papers&#x2014;I have given the House all the information I have on the subject. There are no further Papers which I can think the noble Earl wishes to have. Possibly his chief desire was to have the letter that I wrote to Mr. Ferguson, and as I have now given it in extenso to the House perhaps his desire for Papers may have been satisfied. Reference has been made to Eoligary, and it may be well, as I was partly responsible by an untoward interruption for having drawn the noble Earl into discussing that question, that I should give your Lordships all the information I have on that subject. While the very prolonged negotiations with regard to the placing of Vatersay under settlement by small tenants were going on, some of the cottars and crofters at the other end of the island of Vatersay made requests, which subsequently developed into threats to seize land. After examining the growth of the cottar population in the island of Barra, I came to the conclusion that it was my duty to endeavour to ascertain whether any further land could be made available for occupation, but I stated that the Government could do nothing in this respect until the Vatersay negotiations were completed. Those negotiations were only completed, I think, at the end of December last&#x2014;I speak from memory&#x2014;and it has therefore not been possible for me since then to redeem the undertaking I gave, or, at any rate, to bring that undertaking to any definite point, in respect of making further land available in the island of Barra where the farm of Eoligary is situated, but I am engaged, on behalf of the Government, in endeavouring to obtain and to make available further land if that is found to be possible. In these circumstances, whilst there is, I have no doubt, impatience on the part of men who are in great difficulties and who have this hope before them, I trust there may be self-restraint and self-control sufficient to prevent any further difficulties of the nature described. The noble Earl attributed the difficulties in the Western Islands in the first place to my vacillation in respect to the farm of Glendale.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN </member>: <membercontribution>Your vacillation generally, not only in respect of Glendale.</membercontribution></p>
<col>484</col>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH </member>: <membercontribution>The noble Earl quoted an instance of vacillation in regard to Glendale. When he is able to quote another instance, I shall endeavour to answer it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN </member>: <membercontribution>Vatersay. But you will hear more of that.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH </member>: <membercontribution>We shall have an opportunity, I gather, of discussing that matter, and your Lordships will be able to judge when the Papers are laid before you. Meanwhile, I hope I may be allowed to say that I hardly think the difficulties in the Western Islands can reasonably be attributed to so small a cause as the fact stated by the noble Earl&#x2014;namely, that the Congested Districts Board did some time ago intend to include Glendale in the scheme of settlement in the South Uist and subsequently found it impossible and withdrew it from the scheme. I admit, however, that the withdrawal of the farm of Glendale must have caused some disappointment amongst applicants for holdings, and, <i>pro tanto</i>, that strengthens their claims to consideration. So far as the remainder of the case is concerned, I am content to leave it to the judgment of your Lordships. It is not, I think, a very large matter of itself, though I quite agree that the subject of which it forms a part is a most important and difficult one. But, so far as this transaction of itself is concerned, I hope I have succeeded in making plain that the Government have done their best in good faith to discharge the responsibilities left to them by their predecessors.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD SALTOUN </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, it appears to me that the object of the Government, so far, has been to make one of the best landowners in the whole of Scotland a sort of scapegoat, both in the island of Vatersay and at Glendale. The noble Earl who called attention to this matter fully described what has taken place, and the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland acknowledged the correctness of the narrative. The noble Lord also read the letter he addressed to Mr. Ferguson, but the one thing that struck me was that in that letter he almost said, "You have raided this place; if you go away I will do my best to give you the land in some other way." That appears to me to be the persuasion which the noble Lord used in order to get the raiders to leave the land.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0267"/>
<col>485</col>
Then the noble Lord told us that the first notice he had of the raid was on February 12, in a letter from a gentleman on the island, and that he did not hear from the Chief Constable until the 19th. I should like to ask the noble Lord whether it is the fact that he received no official report of the raid until the 19th.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH </member>: <membercontribution>I had official reports, but I did not think it necessary to refer to them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD SALTOUN </member>: <membercontribution>The noble Lord told us that the first official report he received was from the Chief Constable on February 19.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH </member>: <membercontribution>No. That was the final report informing me that there was no longer any vestige of illegal occupation. There were reports in the interval.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD SALTOUN </member>: <membercontribution>The dealings of the Government in reference to this land constitute a really serious state of things. In 1906 the transaction, for taking Glendale for the purpose of placing crofters upon the land ceased, the Congested Districts Board agreeing that it was useless because they could not let the southern half of the farm. They now again propose to take this farm. I think it is only right to emphasise the fact that the tenant who was paying &#x00A3;97 a year gave up the farm in 1906 and that in 1908 it was relet to him at a rental of &#x00A3;65. If you take the farm now, how do you propose to compensate Lady Cathcart? Do you propose to take it on trial and then throw it back on her hands as you did before? If the rental of land is let down in this district it is impossible to get it up again, and it is only right that a proper and fair bargain should be made with Lady Cathcart if any such thing is going to be done. The present rent is down by thirty per cent., and if you take the farm and are unable to occupy it fully, is it to be thrown back on Lady Cathcart's hands again? I should have been very glad if the noble Lord had answered the latter part of the question more fully than he has done.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the discussion to which we have listened forms a very interesting sequel to a similar discussion which took place in this House last year. The particular
<col>486</col>
episode which we then debated was, it is true, not the episode we are debating tonight, but I remember quite well that the case of Glendale did come up at the time, and I recollect dwelling upon the fact that Lady Gordon Cathcart had in connection with Glendale, burnt her fingers, and was, therefore, naturally rather cautious in her subsequent dealings with the Crofters Commission and the Scottish Office. My noble friend has told us pretty fully the extent to which Lady Gordon Cathcart did burn her fingers, and I can quite understand that that long-suffering lady should not desire to repeat the process.<lb/>
One thing I think comes out very strongly in this affair&#x2014;that if ever there was anyone who did not deserve to be made the subject of what I can only call the kind of clumsy persecution to which Lady Gordon Cathcart has been subjected, it is that lady herself. Her record is an unimpeachable record. We know that it was owing to her desire to provide crofts for these poor people that the Island of Barra was covered with small holdings; we know that in 1904, the moment she became aware that there was a desire to obtain more crofts in this particular neighbourhood, she at once offered two farms of her own for subdivision, and it was, I believe, not of her own accord, but more or less because she was pressed to do so, that she offered the farm of Glendale, and she offered it with a warning at the same time that owing to local circumstances, of which she and her advisers were obviously the best judges, that particular farm was not a suitable subject for division into small holdings. Her warnings were neglected, the tenants on these three farms were compelled to give up their holdings, and the work of subdivision was then proceeded with. It very soon appeared that, after all, Lady Gordon Cathcart was perfectly right in her contention with regard to the farm of Glendale, because we have it in evidence that two members of the Crofters Commission put in a report in which they expressly said that, while it might be possible to plot out half a dozen miserable little crofts on the northern part of the farm, the southern part was entirely unsuited for any such purpose.<lb/>
What was the result? There were, no doubt, inquiries for small holdings on the northern part of the farm, but the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0268"/>
<col>487</col>
southern portion, as was anticipated, proved to be quite unlettable. At that moment the spirit of reasonableness seems to have come over the mind of the Crofters Commission and the Scottish Office, and it was admitted that as it had been shown that the southern portion of Glendale was incapable of being worked as a separate holding, it was better to drop the Glendale transaction altogether. The facts were too strong for them, and Glendale ceased to be a subject of discussion. Meanwhile, Lady Gordon Cathcart continued her efforts to provide small holdings, and actually succeeded in providing a total number of about eighty small holdings as against the fifty mentioned by the Crofters Commission at the outset as being a reasonable provision for the needs of the locality.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH </member>: <membercontribution>I think, in view of discussion on this subject, it is just as well that I should not allow any wrong information to have more effect than it need have. The Crofters Commission expressed no opinion on this subject. The opinion that congestion in South Uist would be sufficiently relieved by the provision of a quarter of 200 small holdings was a personal opinion, and, of course, it could not commit either the Government or the successors even of those who expressed that opinion. The total number of holdings provided was seventy-two, fourteen of which were occupied by crofters other than South Uist crofters.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>Lady Gordon Cathcart, in spite of all the trouble and anxiety she had been occasioned with regard to Glendale, certainly did go out of her way to provide as many small holdings as possible. Meanwhile the unfortunate proprietrix was left with the farm of Glendale, the tenant having been got rid of, on her hands, and we know that to hold and stock a derelict farm is neither a very agreeable nor a very economical operation. She held the farm, I understand, for a couple of years, and at the end of that time found herself obliged to let it to the old tenant at a very considerably reduced rent. The whole transaction bore very hardly indeed on the proprietrix, and I find it a little difficult to agree with the noble Lord opposite when he tells us that, in his opinion, so far as the money aspect of the transaction was concerned, Lady Gordon Cathcart had nothing to complain of.
<col>488</col>
That is the end of what you may call the first chapter of the story.<lb/>
I confess that most people, after reading the correspondence, would have thought that the word <i>Finis</i> would have been written there, and that, as far as Glendale was concerned, nothing more would be heard. Then we come to more recent developments. In the first place, there is the raid which took place last month, followed no doubt, by the retirement of the raiders under the circumstances described, and subject to the advice tendered to them by the noble Lord opposite. But no sooner had this raid taken place than there reappears a proposal for reviving the old .condemned scheme for splitting up Glendale farm. It comes back to my mind that in the Vatersay case, which we discussed last year, and which we may, perhaps, have to discuss again, Lady Gordon Cathcart was pressed very strongly to surrender at discretion to the raiders with the object of what was called "easing the situation." Now is it the case that another "situation" has arisen, and that again Lady Cathcart is to be called upon to ease the situation by submitting to an arrangement such as that which has been described? I must say I think nothing could be harder than to press any proprietor to make a sacrifice such as that which Lady Cathcart is apparently expected to make. All I can say is this. If, in spite of the advice which you have already received on this point, you are really going to recur to the condemned project of splitting the farm of Glendale, then I say, like honest men, buy the whole farm from Lady Cathcart and have done with it.<lb/>
There are two other points I desire to notice. I wish we had had a more explicit statement from the noble Lord as to the policy of His Majesty's Government with regard to these raids. Not for the first time did I notice in the Ministerial utterance to-night that ambiguity of tone in which occurrences of this kind are not infrequently referred to. The noble Lord, it is true, in the letter which he read, expressed his strong disapproval of these lawless actions; but in another part of his speech he was at great pains to explain that, after all, all that these people had done was to put down a few stones, spread a little seaweed, and mark out a few small plots of ground, and he added that these were not very serious matters. To my mind, when one person invades the property

<col>489</col>
of another and commits acts of ownership on that property, whatever the acts may be, that is a very serious matter indeed, and I hope we are not coming to the time when, in any part of the United Kingdom, we shall be told that such unlawful acts are of a venial or not very serious nature.<lb/>
The other point on which I wish to say a word is this. I am sure your Lordships must have been struck by the fact that, when it was proposed to parcel out North Glendale into small holdings, those holdings were to be rented at &#x00A3;3 each. I should like very much to know what kind of holdings you are going to set up, at the public expense, remember! at &#x00A3;3 rent. The noble Earl who leads the House, and who will, perhaps, follow me, knows that this question of uneconomic holdings is engaging a great deal of attention in another part of the United Kingdom. In Ireland it has been laid down by a Royal Commission, on which the Government to a great extent depend for their advice, that the limit of an economic holding is &#x00A3;10. Is it not the case that you are going to create in these islands, at the public expense, a number of holdings which, <i>ab initio</i>, will be uneconomic and which must continue to be uneconomic holdings? The noble Lord will, perhaps, tell me whether there are any buildings ready to hand with which these crofters can be accommodated? There are none. Very well, then you have on each of these &#x00A3;3 holdings to build some kind of a homestead. At whose expense? At the expense of the tax-payers or the rate-payers. I believe that to be a very serious question indeed. The agriculture of a great part of Scotland was 150 or 200 years ago every bit as miserable, and the condition of the people every bit as squalid, as has been the case in Ireland in the very worst periods of the history of that country; and if Scotland has emerged from that state of things it has been because insensibly these smaller and more miserable holdings have disappeared from the face of the land. Their disappearance may have been accompanied by hardship. I daresay that may be the case. But the Government of this country ought to think a great many times before they set up deliberately in any considerable part of the country these wretched uneconomic holdings, upon which I do not believe that any occupiers, whether crofters or not, can live, except in the most squalid and miserable circumstances. That is really, to my mind, 
<col>490</col>
the most serious moral to be gathered from the facts which have been laid before us by my noble friend&#x2014;facts the accuracy of which has not been challenged by the noble Lord who spoke from the Front Bench opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have really very little to say in reply to the noble Marquess, but I wish to draw attention to one or two of his observations. I have no technical knowledge of the circumstances of the case, and, therefore, I do not propose to go into the points that were dealt with by my noble friend behind me. The noble Marquess who has just sat down made some remarks on the subject of economic holdings, and pointed out that it seemed an imprudent act, when attempting to reorganise the agricultural industry of a district, to set up any such things as &#x00A3;3 holdings; and he referred, with great truth, to the fact that in the congested districts in Ireland no holding of less than &#x00A3;10 is considered economic. But the noble Marquess does not think that when&#x2014;if that ever happened&#x2014;all the holdings in the West of Ireland were made economic, there never would be any holding of less than &#x00A3;10? There will always be smaller holdings held in conjunction with some other industry. There are a number of holdings in the Western Islands held by fishermen, which are a very useful adjunct to their trade, but which are worth a great deal less than &#x00A3;10; and I see no reason why, in the reorganisation of agriculture, those holdings should be interfered with, any more than the allotments of small value held by labourers in addition to their ordinary work. My noble friend the Secretary for Scotland tells me that these &#x00A3;3 holdings were all designed for fishermen.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN </member>: <membercontribution>No, no.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE EARL OF CREWE </member>: <membercontribution>My noble friend tells me that the particular &#x00A3;3 holdings in question were designed for fishermen, and that of the seventy-two holdings provided by Lady Cathcart for the benefit of these islanders twenty-nine are of the value of &#x00A3;2 and under. I confess the fact does seem to me startling, because it is evident nobody can attempt to live on a holding of that kind; but, apparently, the small holdings in some of the Western Islands
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0270"/>
<col>491</col>
are of that character, and I can only assume that they are held by people who act either as day labourers or as fishermen. On the general question, the noble Marquess complained that my noble friend seemed to speak with a somewhat uncertain voice as regards the transactions known as raids. I am perfectly certain that my noble friend&#x2014;and I think he showed it in the very good letter which he promptly wrote in reply to the gentleman who gave him the information&#x2014;has no intention of doing anything but expressing the strongest disapproval and indicating both the folly and the wrong-doing of acts of this kind.<lb/>
But there are two observations I should like to make in respect of this. Those actions are in my opinion also both wrong and foolish, but it is the fact that if similar action were taken on any of your Lordships' estates in any part of the three Kingdoms you have nothing but a civil remedy. If a man comes and squats on your land the police will not move him, still less will the military forces of the Crown move him; and therefore it is not out of place to point out that there is only a civil remedy in the case of mere occupation, of course unaccompanied by violence of any kind. I do not say this in order to condone these acts, which, as I have said, I consider both wrong and foolish, but we may as well be clear on the facts of the case. Noble Lords opposite have complained of us, but I think we in turn might complain of them. They go deeply into this subject, informed, of course, only on one side of the case, informed by the parties concerned with the ownership
<col>492</col>
of the land, but not a single word falls from any one of the noble Lords opposite to indicate that there is any such thing as a land question or any land difficulty at all in these islands. I think it would be only fair, in stating their case, if they would admit that this demand for land among these rather wild people represents a very real administrative difficulty, one which my noble friend, I am sure, is anxious to deal with as best he can, preserving law and order and at the same time attempting to face the economic difficulty which undoubtedly is involved.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY </member>: <membercontribution>I should not have intervened but for one observation of the noble Earl who has just sat down. He seemed to suggest that there was only a civil remedy in such a case. Has he never heard of the offence of forcible entry? That offence is subject to indictment, and those guilty of it are liable to imprisonment.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE EARL OF CREWE </member>: <membercontribution>I am not going to enter into a legal argument with the noble and learned Earl. But if a man comes and squats on a field, I am under the impression that you have only a civil remedy against him. I am prepared to be corrected by the noble and learned Earl if that is not so.<lb/>

<p>Read 3<sup>a</sup> (according to order), and <i>passed,</i> and sent to the Commons.</p>
</section>
<section>
<title>ELECTRIC LIGHTING ACTS (AMENDMENT) BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<section>
<title>[SECOND READING.]</title>
<p>Order of the Day for the Second Reacting read.</p>
<p><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the object of this Bill is to effect certain amendments in the Electric Lighting Acts. The original Electric Lighting Act was passed in the year 1882, and an amending Act was passed six years later. The question of amendment was again considered in 1888, when a Joint Committee of both Houses was appointed to consider the question on the motion of the then Lord Chairman of Committees, the late Lord Morley. Certain questions with regard to the amendment of these Acts were submitted to the Joint Committee, and they reported in every case in favour of amendment of the law. No legislation, however, was brought forward until the year 1904, when a Bill was introduced into this House by the noble Lord who then represented the Board of Trade, Lord Wolverton. That Bill went before a Select Committee and was given very careful consideration, and I suppose that it was on account of the very lengthy deliberations of that Committee that the Bill did not pass this House until within two or three days of the close of the session, with the result that it was not found possible to pass it through the other House of Parliament in the period of the session which remained. Your Lordships will thus see that legislation on this subject is certainly due, if it may not be said to be overdue.<lb/>
The principal provisions of this Bill are to enable promoters of electric light and power undertakings to proceed by Provisional Order in almost all cases, instead of having to follow the more expensive and more cumbrous method of proceeding by private Bill. I say that this may be done in almost all cases, because in Clause 3 it will be seen that there is a limitation in regard to that. In the case of undertakings
<col>494</col>
for the supply of electricity in bulk, the Board of Trade may order that the promoters shall proceed by means of private Bill if they are of opinion that the nature and size of the undertaking are such as to render that course desirable. I think your Lordships will appreciate the reason for that, which is that in the case of unopposed Bills or Bills to which there is very little opposition the Provisional Order procedure offers certain advantages, because the opposition is ordinarily met in the course of the preliminary Inquiry by the Board of Trade and the confirming Bill goes forward as an unopposed measure, whereas in the case of larger undertakings and undertakings to which there is considerable opposition that preliminary Inquiry really only adds another stage to the fight which afterwards takes place in the Committee Rooms of the two Houses of Parliament. That is the principal provision of the Bill, and your Lordships will see, from the Memorandum attached to the Bill, that of the twenty-two operative clauses twelve are practically copied from the Bill which has already passed through your Lordships' House, the remaining ten dealing with small matters of a highly technical character which have arisen since the Bill of 1904 was introduced. I do not propose to trouble your Lordships by going into details on any of these matters; but, of course, I shall be perfectly prepared to deal with them, if necessary, in Committee.<lb/>
The main portion of the Bill, the question of principle, has, as I have said, already been agreed to by the House and has been given careful consideration by a Select Committee. We therefore propose, with your Lordships' consent, to refer this Bill to a Committee of the Whole House and not to a Select Committee, and I believe that the noble Earl the Lord Chairman agrees to that course. Your Lordships will recollect that when the legislation on electric lighting was first introduced the practical application of electricity was in its infancy, and when we remember that during the last twenty years an enormous number of electric light and electric power installations have been established all over the country, and that during that period the science of electricity has made enormous strides, I think we may be surprised that the amendments now found necessary should be contained within so very narrow limits. I think that that fact is a very eloquent testimony to the care and fore
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0272"/>
<col>495</col>
sight which were bestowed upon these matters when they were originally before Parliament. I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time.<lb/>
Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Hamilton of Dalzell.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF ONSLOW)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, it is not my intention to offer any opposition to the proposal of the noble Lord. The main points in the Bill have been under the consideration of a Select Committee and, as far as I can see, there is nothing in the new clauses that was not considered by that Committee which will necessitate asking your Lordships to appoint a Select Committee to go further into the question. I therefore entirely concur with the noble Lord that the Bill is one which may be proceeded with in the ordinary course. I would, however, ask the noble Lord to allow a little time to elapse between this and the next stage of the Bill, in order that I may have an opportunity of consulting with him and with the advisers of the Board of Trade. There are a few points in the Bill which I think require a little consideration, but, on the whole, I am disposed to think that the measure is a step in the right direction. For some years past Parliament has been inclined to divest itself of those powers of private legislation which can be entrusted in the first instance to a Government Department, but which ultimately have to receive the sanction of Parliament in the shape of the confirmation of a Provisional Order; and the only criticism which I may have to offer on the Bill later is whether the control of Parliament by confirmation of a Provisional Order is quite sufficiently safeguarded by the Bill. With that reservation, I give my most cordial support to the Motion for the Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CATTLE DRIVES IN IRELAND.</title>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE rose</member> <membercontribution>to move for a Return of the number and localities of the cattle-drives in Ireland
<col>496</col>
which had been reported by the police during the years 1906, 1907, and 1908, showing the residence and occupation of the persons who had been convicted or bound over to keep the peace, and the quantity and Poor-law valuation of the land held by any such persons.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Earl said </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have put down the Motion which stands in my name, not with the object of raising a discussion or continuing the debate that took place in your Lordships' House a fortnight ago, but merely with the object of obtaining information. There is considerable disagreement as to fact between the noble Lords opposite and those of us who sit on this side of the House and who come from Ireland. Your Lordships will remember that in the course of the debate on the Address, in which the subject of agitation in Ireland was dealt with at length, that point came out very prominently. I do not wish to misrepresent them, but I think the Government maintain that the Act of 1903 is very largely responsible for the present agitation. The noble Lord who represents the Irish Office, Lord Denman, whose absence to-day I regret and also the cause, drew a sharply-delineated picture of the state of affairs in the West of Ireland in which he illustrated his belief that the Act of 1903 was responsible for the agitation. He referred to people "living on poor holdings of mountain land" as the people who were at the back of cattle-driving, and he explained their action by their disappointment that they were not getting the benefits of the Act which their richer neighbours were obtaining. That statement, made, I am sure, in all good faith, is absolutely contrary to all the evidence that we have from Ireland. We believe that this agitation is not being run by the poor man who wants land, but by the rich man who is greedy. If the Government have proof of their point of view, let us have it. We claim that we should have some assistance from the Government in proving our point of view, from which statement after statement has been made and not contradicted. Many of your Lordships have seen the declaration made by Mr. Clarke, one of the victims in the Craughwell case, in which he says that those attacking him are rich men. I quite admit that the return for which I move would not prove the case up to the hilt either way. In order to do that it would be necessary to have particulars as to the occupation and
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0273"/>
<col>497</col>
standing of every man taking part in cattle-driving, and that, of course, His Majesty's Government cannot supply, as they have not taken notice of any but a small percent-tage of the cattle-drives. Still, this Return would considerably help us, and I maintain that we have a right to it in view of the difference as to fact which exists between those of us who come from Ireland and have first-hand knowledge and His Majesty's Government. I beg to move.<lb/>
Moved, That there be laid before the House a Return of the number and localities of the cattle-drives in Ireland which have been reported by the police during the years 1906, 1907, and 1908, showing the residence and occupation of the persons who have been convicted or bound over to keep the peace, and the quantity and Poor-law valuation of the land held by any such persons.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Donoughmore.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD STEWARD(EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, in the absence, through illness, of my friend who represents the Irish Office in this House, it falls to me to reply. The Motion of the noble Earl divides itself into three parts. He asks, in the first place, for a Return of the number and localities of the cattle-drives in Ireland which had been reported by the police during the years 1906, 1907, and 1908. There were no cattle-drives in the year 1906. They did not begin until April 25, I believe, in 1907. Men, in the second place, the noble Earl asks for the residence and occupation of the persons who had been convicted or bound over to keep the peace, and, in the third place, the quantity and Poor-law valuation of the land held by any such persons. Part of that Return His Majesty's Government are ready to supply to the noble Earl, and if he will accept what we are prepared to give we shall not oppose the Motion. We shall be glad to supply the information for 1907 and 1908 asked for in the first and second parts of the Motion; but to obtain the statistics mentioned in the third part would involve personal inquiries into more than 1,000 cases and reference to the rate-books, which are not in the possession of the police, and it is not thought that the labour and expense involved would be justified by the results. Moreover, the counties in which cattle-drives have taken place are those in which it has been found necessary to provide extra police, and therefore the police are already fully occupied
<col>498</col>
with their ordinary duties. I am sure the noble Earl would not ask that they should be withdrawn from their ordinary duties in order to make these inquiries. Such a complicated Return could only be prepared by the combined efforts of the police and the local authorities, and His Majesty's Government are not prepared to call upon either the police or the local authorities to furnish the information. The latest figures relating to cattle-driving show a considerable diminution. The numbers of cases during the last six months, compared with the corresponding months of the previous year were as follow:&#x2014;September, 1907, thirty-four; September, 1908, forty-two; October, 1907, fifty-eight; October, 1908, forty-four; November, 1907, 108; November, 1908, seventy-five; December, 1907, eighty-one; December, 1908, forty-seven; January, 1908, thirty-five; January, 1909, twenty-nine; February, 1908, thirty-one; February, 1909, nineteen. The figures for this month only extend to the end of the first week, and during that week there were no cases of cattle-driving reported at all. In these circumstances I think the Government are justified in hoping that the steps which they have taken are sufficient and are deterring law-breakers from engaging in these unfortunate excursions.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ATKINSON </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the form in which the Government are willing to grant the Return would be absolutely useless for the purpose for which it is asked. The idea which noble Lords from Ireland entertain is that these cattle-drives are carried on by landless men with the object of getting land, and that the Bill which was introduced in the House of Commons last year was brought in at their dictation to give land to landless men. Many of us entertain a very strong opinion indeed that that is a vital and injurious policy, and the information is asked for in order to ascertain whether the people who have set on foot and are keeping up this agitation are landless men, or small holders, or rich men. Therefore a Return which does not state whether the persons bound over to keep the peace for having engaged in cattle-driving are holders of land or landless men will be perfectly useless.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, we are very anxious to supply
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0274"/>
<col>499</col>
this information so far as possible to the noble Earl. It obviously must be to our advantage just as much as to the advantage of noble Lords opposite that the exact facts should be known. There is no doubt a dispute as to the character and standing of the persons who engage in these cattle-drives. I do not suppose that noble Lords opposite, and certainly not ourselves, would say that all the drives have been carried out by people of one class. All that can be said is that mainly it is one class which has been involved. There is, no doubt, a conflict, not between noble Lords opposite and ourselves, because obviously we on these Benches can have no first-hand information on the subject, but between the view held by noble Lords opposite and the view held by the Constabulary authorities in Ireland, who are the people who supply us with our information. Their view is that the cattle-drives are, in the main, carried out by the possessors of uneconomic holdings, and no doubt also by the sons of those people, and I am not quite certain to which class noble Lords opposite would allocate the sons of men who have uneconomic holdings.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ATKINSON </member>: <membercontribution>Landless men, undoubtedly.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE EARL OF CREWE </member>: <membercontribution>Yes; but the argument, as I understand, that has been used as a rule is that these cattle-drives are carried out by the sons of well-to-do farmers, and not by the sons of these small peasants. The conflict of opinion has always been, as I understand, between those who held that this agitation has been mainly caused by persons who either possess or are connected with uneconomic holdings, and those, on the other hand, who held that it was mainly caused by the well-to-do sons of large and well-to-do farmers. I should have thought that the information which the Constabulary say they are able to supply would have enabled noble Lords opposite, with, I admit, a certain degree of closer study and with local information which they are in a position in some way to collect, to determine which, in the main, of those two theories is the right one; and I must say I do not see my way to pressing my right hon. friend the Chief Secretary for Ireland to give the extremely elaborate Return by Poor-law valuation for which the noble Earl has asked.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am sure my noble friend does
<col>500</col>
not desire to impose upon the police inquiries of a tedious and difficult character. The police have already enough to do. But surely it should not be beyond the power of the Irish Office to supply my noble friend, at any rate in substance, with the kind of information sought. Some such information must be in the possession of the Irish Office, because the noble Earl who leads the House has just told us that His Majesty's Government have formed a very decided impression as to the class to which these convicted cattle-drivers belong. How was that impression formed by His Majesty's Government unless they have some materials of an accessible kind? I take it that, whenever a person is convicted of an offence of this kind there is somewhere or other an entry showing who he is and what his profession is, and it should be possible to distinguish between those who are and those who are not tenant farmers. The noble Earl spoke of the difficulty of obtaining access to the rate-book, but it is the simplest thing in the world. You have merely to look a man up, and you find that he is entered in the rate-book as the occupier of such and such a number of acres at such and such a Poor-law valuation. But even if His Majesty's Government cannot give my noble friend the information he wants exactly in the shape in which he seeks it, I would really appeal to the noble Earl to consider the matter further and to inquire whether at any rate some Return could not be furnished which really would give the substance of that information upon which His Majesty's Government themselves rely, and upon which they have again and again based their arguments. If the noble Earl would kindly consider that, I would suggest to my noble friend that it is not worth dividing the House on the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE EARL OF CREWE </member>: <membercontribution>I shall, of course, have pleasure in consulting my right hon. friend and in seeing what can be done. The noble Marquess will realise that the difficulty of a return of profession or occupation consists in the fact that in Ireland a man is called a farmer or a farmer's son when he certainly would not be so described in any other country. As the noble Marquess knows very well, the holder of any small patch of land, no matter how small, describes himself and is described as a farmer; and therefore I am afraid the mere description of a man's
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0275"/>
<col>501</col>
occupation, which, of course, we are prepared to give, does not meet the point as to the means possessed by the people who engage in these cattle-drives. But I shall, as I have said, have pleasure in consulting the Irish Office and seeing what they can do; and I thank the noble Marquess for saying that he does not wish to impose a very elaborate and troublesome inquiry on the police, and in that I am sure noble Lords opposite all concur.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS 0F LONDONDERRY </member>: <membercontribution>Is it not the case that when the police report people who take part in cattle-driving they declare who those people are? I really cannot see the difficulty.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member>: <membercontribution>My point was that a man would be described as a farmer's son and you would not be very much wiser as to his actual position in life.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY </member>: <membercontribution>But the police would state what his occupation was in reporting him.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: <membercontribution>Although the Irish Office are unable to give the noble Earl the information for which he has asked, they have given the House information that was not asked for. I was unable to follow the noble Earl through all the figures he gave relating to cattle-driving, but I gather that the average number of cattle drives exceeded thirty in each month. Only one cattle-drive <i>per diem!</i> Dear me! And that is the condition in which, under
<col>502</col>
the present Administration, Ireland is described as becoming a reformed and prosperous country. I can only say that to ordinary persons the noble Earl's self-gratulation seems rather misplaced.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member>: <membercontribution>The matter has depended to some extent on the prospect of the Indian Councils Bill returning to this House before Easter.

<title>BOYCOTTING.</title>
<p><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member> <membercontribution>rose to call the attention of His Majesty's Government to the proceedings of the Clonguish Branch of the United Irish League (at which several persons were condemned by name, and the public was warned to have no dealings with them) published in the <i>Langford Leader</i> of February 27; and to ask whether the Law Officers of the Crown proposed to take any action in the matter.<lb/>
The noble Lord said: My Lords, I feel that I need not apologise to your Lordships for asking the Question which stands in my name, for I think that noble Lords on the Opposition Benches will agree with me that the administration of Mr. Birrell in Ireland cannot be too closely watched or criticised, and I feel that I am at the same time giving noble Lords on the Front Ministerial Bench an opportunity to defend his policy and once again to apologise for its invariable want of success. On various occasions I have ventured to call your Lordships' attention to what I think is the greatest blot on the administration of the present Chief Secretary&#x2014;the exercise of dispensing power; and to-day I should like to call attention to another blot&#x2014;the throwing of dust in the eyes of the public with the view of making them believe that measures are being taken to enforce the law in Ireland and that the state of that country is not so bad as it is represented to be. I am not quite sure whether that is Parliamentary language to use about a Minister of the Crown, and as I should certainly not like to say anything personally discourteous to Mr. Birrell perhaps I had better modify it by saying that his action has the effect of throwing dust in the eyes of the public.<lb/>
Your Lordships will remember that last November the state of Ireland was attracting a good deal of attention in this country. Long nights, which are so favourable to those who wish to indulge in agrarian outrage, were just beginning, and the number of cattle-drives even
<col>506</col>
exceeded the number of one <i>per diem</i> which my noble friend the Lord Steward boasted of with such pride last week. Not only Unionists but also a certain number of Radicals who desired law and order to be enforced thought that action should be taken to protect life and property in the Sister Isle, and Mr. Birrell found himself obliged, whether he liked it or not, to take some steps against his friends in that country. He refurbished an old and favourite weapon&#x2014;the Statute of Edward III&#x2014;and caused certain notices to be sent to the proprietors and editors of various Nationalist newspapers. In this connection I will, with your Lordships' permission, read a question asked by Mr. Redmond in the other House together with Mr. Birrell's reply. Mr. Redmond asked&#x2014;
<quote>"whether cautionary notices had been served by the Irish Government on the proprietors of certain newspapers in Ireland practically threatening them with penal consequences if they did not exclude from their journals certain items of news."</quote><lb/>
To this Mr. Birrell replied&#x2014;
<quote>"The attention of the police having been called to the publication in certain newspapers of notices purporting to be reports of meetings at which individuals, designated by name, or by a description so accurate as to be equivalent to naming, were threatened with boycotting and other forms of intimidation, the police, by direction of Government, have given an oral warning to the proprietors and editors of these newspapers that the publication of such notices is illegal, and, if persisted in, will necessitate the taking of legal proceedings."</quote><lb/>
Mr. Birrell added&#x2014;
<quote>"I entirely approve of the action of the police in this matter."</quote><lb/>
He further stated that these were friendly warnings&#x2014;
<quote>"the most friendly notices in the world."</quote><lb/>
Your Lordships will be surprised to hear that these friendly notices were not received by Mr. Birrell's friends in a very friendly spirit. The Nationalist newspapers were full of abusive remarks about them. I will not trouble your Lordships by quotations; but there is one which so delightfully lets the cat out of the bag that I think I may be allowed to refer to it. The <i>Midland Reporter</i> of November 5 said&#x2014;
<quote>"The United Irish League branches are powerless if they cannot get their meetings reported in the public Press. If publication of reports is stopped, the League dies."</quote><lb/>
This makes it absolutely clear what the object of publication is. They find that
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0278"/>
<col>507</col>
it is only through the dissemination of the news that they are enabled to enforce the edicts of the League concerning boycotting and intimidation. This newspaper went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"Mr. Birrell and his threats are politely told to make themselves to the region of Hong Kong."</quote><lb/>
Amongst the newspapers which disregarded these most friendly warnings was the <i>Longford Leader,</i> with the result that Mr. Farrell, the editor of that paper and a Member of the House of Commons, was arraigned before the Court of King's Bench on December 21 on a charge of publishing alleged boycotting and intimidatory notices. I may mention that this gentleman had already been convicted of this offence in November, 1902. The Attorney-General, who prosecuted Mr. Farrell in December last, stated that for some time past the <i>Longford Leader</i> had been publishing boycotting and intimidatory notices emanating from local branches of the United Irish League referring to individuals by name, and had also been publishing editorial articles of a similar tendency. The Lord Chief Baron said they had to determine two matters of fact&#x2014;first, did it reasonably appear to them that Mr. Farrell had incited, either by act or language, to a violation of law and of right; and, secondly, if so, was there reasonable ground to believe that the delinquent was likely to persevere in that course. The result was that Mr. Farrell was convicted, the judgment given being that he was to find sureties, himself in &#x00A3;200 and two other approved sureties of &#x00A3;100, to be of good behaviour, or in default to go to prison for six months without hard labour. The accused refused to give any undertaking and was committed to prison. In March, however, he was released on the ground of ill-health, and the newspapers say he has gone abroad; and, for all I know, he may be in sunny Spain indulging in indifferent golf, if an Irish Nationalist would indulge in so essentially British a game, with the latest convert to Home Rule.<lb/>
What the public in this country is concerned with is not whether Mr. Farrell is punished or not but whether the law is vindicated, and whether when the editor of a newspaper has been committed to prison, or ordered to find sureties not to publish intimidatory or threatening notices these notices cease to be published. The
<col>508</col>
question is&#x2014;Which is triumphant, the law of the land or the law of the League? Are these poor people who have been threatened by the <i>Longford Leader</i> now able to go about and pursue their ordinary avocations in peace; or, in the words of the Nationalist newspaper which I have quoted, might Mr. Birrell, so far as the administration of Ireland is concerned, as well be in the neighbourhood of Hong Kong as at Westminster? I think the answer is to be found in a quotation from the <i>Longford Leader</i> of February 27 last, on which my Question is based, and which, with your Lordships' permission, I will read to the House. It is as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"CLONGUISH BRANCH, UNITED IRISH LEAGUE.&#x2014;A full and representative meeting of the above branch was held in the League rooms, Newtownforbes, on Sunday last. Mr. Patrick Newman presided. Many matters of importance as well as routine business were transacted. Messrs. Michael Prunty and Patrick McGowan came before the meeting to thresh out the case against Prunty for associating himself with a landlord's man. Mr. Prunty was exonerated by his stating he would not be guilty of any such thing if he knew the man was warning for rent. A respectable lady also came before the meeting and apologised for talking to one of the grabbers, and she stated she could not get away from her at any consideration. It is so long since she had a talk with a decent person she imposed on her.&#x2014;</quote><lb/>
and this is the portion I wish to call particular attention to&#x2014;
<quote>"The action of William Beatty was again condemned, and all parties warned not to have any dealings with him as he is a dog-boy of the very worst type. A man named Savage was also considered deserving similar treatment."</quote><lb/>
I think this extract speaks for itself, and it is unnecessary to enlarge upon it.<lb/>
I hope the noble Lord who will reply for His Majesty's Government will tell us that proceedings are to be immediately taken against this newspaper. If not, I ask whether it is not throwing dust in the eyes of the public to lead them to believe that these prosecutions are instituted to protect these unfortunate people whose sufferings it is so difficult to realise in this happier country. I am afraid this is not the only instance of this kind, for I am credibly informed that the same is the case with many of the cattle-drivers who have been convicted and bound over to keep the peace. These men subsequently take part in cattle-drives, and no action is taken against them by the Government nor is their bail estreated. I hope my noble friend will be able to assure me

<image src="S5LV0001P0I0279"/>
<col>509</col>
that the Government propose to take action in this matter, but, from my experience of what has been done in the past, I am very doubtful if that will be his reply. A brave man struggling with difficulties is a spectacle for the gods, and assuredly the noble Lord will be struggling with very great difficulties if he attempts to defend what is absolutely indefensible. I beg to ask the Question standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAU-CHAMP)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, my noble friend who represents the Irish Office (Lord Denman) has only just been able to return to the House and has asked me, as he has been unable to go through the Papers, to reply to the noble Lord's Question. The noble Lord will not expect me, I hope, to go into the broader question as to whether the Chief Secretary for Ireland should spend his time in Hong Kong or not. I trust he will excuse me if I confine myself to the actual Question he has asked and the specific instance therein given. The attention of the Irish Office has only recently been called to the publication referred to by the noble Lord. They have ordered inquiries to be made through the police as to the circumstances of the various persons alleged to be boycotted, and when these reports have been received the case will be considered on its merits and a decision come to as to what action, if any, should be taken in the interests of justice. I am sure the noble Lord will see that, in view of the fact that proceedings are not impossible, it would be very undesirable to discuss the circumstances of the case in your Lordships' House this afternoon. But, if further proceedings are taken, I should like to consult the convenience of the noble Lord as to whether he would rather have information conveyed to him privately or prefer to ask another question in your Lordships' House as to the decision of His Majesty's Government. With regard to the cases referred to of persons who, in spite of having been bound over, have taken part in subsequent cattle-drives, I venture to hope that the noble Lord will give His Majesty's Government all the information at his disposal so that steps may be taken to see that the law is obeyed.<lb/>
THE MARQUESS or LONDONDERRY: My Lords, I had hoped that some other
<col>510</col>
member of your Lordships' House would have risen to support my noble friend Lord Oranmore. I am afraid that a great many of your Lordships, and the people of England generally, do not realise the discomfort brought to bear on the law-abiding people in Ireland by publications such as those to which my noble friend has alluded, and which are allowed by the responsible Government to go unpunished. The newspapers in question are very powerful in the districts in which they circulate, and the publication of these notices results in great misery to the unfortunate people against whom the ukase of the League is issued. Were it not for such publication the ukase would not be so widely known; and it is because it is essential that the ukase should not be generally published that at the last moment Mr. Birrell, as my noble friend told the House, instructed the police to inform the proprietors and editors of these newspapers that he could not look any longer with absolute equanimity on these matters. I venture to think that this is a very mild view for the Minister responsible for the peace and wellbeing of Ireland, on which the comfort and happiness of the inhabitants depend.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Farrell,</member> <membercontribution>of the <i>Longford Leader;</i> Mr. Keane, of the <i>Kilkenny People;</i> and Mr. Murphy, of the <i>Clonmell Nationalist,</i> have all been arrested for publishing in their newspapers resolutions of the United Irish League calculated to be injurious to the welfare of the inhabitants of those districts; and I should like to ask the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack&#x2014;for I venture to think that we should have answers more frequently than we do from Cabinet Ministers in regard to Irish questions raised in your Lordships' House&#x2014;why, if, as I suppose, all three cases were equally criminal, only that of Mr. Farrell was brought before the Court of King's Bench. Mr. Keane was brought up at Assizes and Mr. Murphy at a Petty Sessional Court, and it seems to me incomprehensible why, when the crime is apparently the same, the offenders should be arraigned before different Courts. I hope we shall have some explanation of this extraordinary procedure.<lb/>
I will not enter into the case of Mr. Murphy, because that is <i>sub judice;</i> but, with regard to the case of Mr. Keane, the Petty Sessional Court which tried that
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0280"/>
<col>511</col>
case was crowded with a number of gentlemen who sympathised with the lawbreakers in that part of the country, and if the noble and learned Lord will read the account in the local paper of what took place at this Court I do not think he will consider the Bench one of which he would be proud. I will not go further into that case now, though I think any one reading the proceedings impartially would come to the conclusion that it must have been a packed Bench that acquitted Mr. Keane. As my noble friend has informed the House, Mr. Farrell was prosecuted for publishing in his newspaper, the <i>Longford Leader</i>, United Irish League resolutions of an intimidatory character. What happened to Mr. Farrell? He was virtually bound over to keep the peace; he could have gone out on bail, but refused to do so. He went to gaol where he remained as a first-class misdemeanant, but while there the paper of which he is proprietor continued to publish similar resolutions of the League. I ask the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack what his view would be of such a state of things were it to take place in England. I have heard it rumoured&#x2014;I do not vouch for the accuracy of the rumour&#x2014;that while in gaol Mr. Farrell was supplied with paper, pen and ink, and actually wrote further intimidatory articles for his newspaper. Is it possible that such a state of affairs could exist anywhere outside Ireland? I hope I shall have an answer on this point from the noble and learned Lord.<lb/>
The publication of these intimidatory resolutions is by no means a new offence. It existed in 1887, when I had the honour of representing the Sovereign as Viceroy in Ireland; but we realised the danger of publication and took the proper means to put an end to it. We prosecuted those responsible, and in that way stopped the publication of the notices, with the result that boycotting ceased in those districts and they assumed their ordinary law-abiding character. In 1902 the same state of things again occurred, and this very gentleman, Mr. Farrell, who seems to have had a very happy time in gaol and has been discharged on the ground of health, was prosecuted under the Grimes Act&#x2014;now, I contend, a part of the ordinary law&#x2014;and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with hard labour. The notices at once ceased. They will not cease now. I am told that while in gaol this year</membercontribution></p>
<col>512</col>
<p><member>Mr. Farrell</member> <membercontribution>continued writing these articles for his newspaper. Is not this a burlesque of the law? He certainly could not have done that under the Government with which I was associated.<lb/>
What does all this show? It shows to my mind beyond all dispute the absolute contempt with which the law is regarded by the law-breakers in certain parts of Ireland. What are His Majesty's Government going to do? Are they going to prosecute Mr. Farrell again or not? If they do not do so, then I say they are bringing the law into even greater disrepute than that in which it is held at the present moment. Why did the Government allow the publication of these resolutions to continue? I ask the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, Would this be tolerated in England? And if it would not be tolerated in England, why is it allowed to continue in Ireland? To this inaction on the part of the Government is due the entire demoralisation of the country. Juries are demoralised, as is shown by the action of the Government in practically giving up trying cases by juries; witnesses are intimidated, and will not give evidence in consequence; and the whole system of administration at present in Ireland is so demoralised as to be a disgrace to a civilised country.<lb/>
It has been said that it is very difficult to restore law and order under present circumstances in Ireland because it is impossible to get witnesses to give evidence. In the course of the debate on the Address the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack made a statement with regard to the Limerick Assizes which was not accurate and which was repudiated afterwards in the House of Commons. I did not like to contradict the noble and learned Lord at the time, but I was convinced that he was absolutely wrong when he said that the juries had not been challenged. But I mention this merely in parentheses. In his speech in concluding the debate on the Address on February 18 last, the Lord Chancellor said&#x2014;
<quote>"But what have the Government done? Prosecutions have been undertaken in every case where evidence could be procured. It is true that evidence in many cases could not be procured, and that any one acquainted with Irish history will know is not uncommon. That, in fact, is our great difficulty. There have been few cases in which evidence could be procured."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0281"/>
<col>513</col>
Why cannot evidence be procured under the administration of the present Government when we were able to procure it during the time that Mr. Balfour and I were responsible for the government of Ireland&#x2014;a more critical time, as we have been told by the noble Earl the Leader of the House, than the present? Evidence was available in our time because witnesses knew that the Government meant business and were determined to maintain law and order. It was also known that the Judges, magistrates, police, and witnesses had the Government behind them in this matter. Can that be said at the present moment? I do not think it can.<lb/>
People in Ireland, like other people, wish to be on the winning side, and if they know that the Government are determined to maintain law and order evidence will always be forthcoming. It is, however, generally believed in these parts of Ireland tat the Government do not mean business, that they do not care to prosecute properly as they could do if they revived the Act to which I have referred. These people ask themselves what is the use of coming forward and giving evidence when the prisoners whom they have seen commit the offences are certain to be set free and to be made small gods of in the village, while they, the witnesses, will be boycotted. I call attention to this matter to-day because, living in Ireland and loving Ireland, I deeply regret to see the present Government prostituting the law of the land and playing into the hands of the lawless inhabitants. Holding the view that it is necessary that the people of England should fully realise the contempt in which the law of the land is held in Ireland, I am glad that my noble friend has brought the question again before the House and I give him my hearty support.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should be wanting in respect to the noble Marquess if I did not address your Lordships for a few minutes seeing that he has appealed to me in a pointed way. In the first place, let me say that the noble Marquess is quite right in his criticism of one thing I said in the debate on the Address. I then stated that it was a matter for sincere congratulation to us that at the Limerick Assizes there had been no challenging of the juries. I need hardly say that in making that statement I believed that to
<col>514</col>
be the case, but I was under a misapprehension. The noble Marquess is right when he says there were challenges at the Limerick Assizes, and I fully admit that that circumstance takes away some part of the ground for satisfaction that I expressed at the result of the trial on that occasion. It does not, however, wholly remove it, because there is no doubt that, I think without any suspicion of unfairness, convictions were obtained in all the cases in which, according to the opinion of the Judge, convictions ought to have been obtained. Though my statement to the extent referred to&#x2014;through no fault of my own, but through a misunderstanding&#x2014;was inaccurate, I think in other respects my statement was correct.<lb/>
As to the cases of the three newspaper owners to whom the noble Marquess has referred, I wish he had given me some notice. Perhaps he had not the opportunity. At all events, I have heard of the cases for the first time to-night. I cannot, therefore, say why one was brought before the Court of King's Bench, the second brought up at Assizes, and the third at a Petty Sessional Court; but if the information is desired I will make an inquiry on the subject. As to the inability or unwillingness of juries in Ireland to do their duty and the reluctance of persons to give evidence, the noble Marquess made an unfavourable contrast between Ireland and England, to the disadvantage of Ireland, and asked me what I would think of such a state of things if it prevailed in England. I should regret it most deeply, as I do in Ireland. But these are no new troubles, as your Lordships are perfectly aware. In England the people are on the side of the law, and give evidence for the purpose of supporting the law. In England jurymen have moral courage, are independent, and friendly to the just administration of the law. In Ireland I fear they have been alienated by tradition and by other causes to which I need not refer. I should regret deeply if England in those respects was in the same condition as Ireland, and my most anxious wish is to see Ireland placed in the same condition as we happily are here.<lb/>
But what is the cause? I shall not inflict upon your Lordships an historical speech, for I am speaking to men who have heard this subject discussed and have thought it out for themselves time after time. I do not know that we shall alto-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0282"/>
<col>515</col>
gether agree, but I do not think we shall altogether differ. The law has not always been the friend of Ireland, and there has been a considerable period of time during which dislike of the law coming from this country, or supposed to come from this country, has been burnt into the Irish people. That, I think, is really common ground. I do not wish to go further into that aspect of the case. I leave it for reflection. The only other thing I wish to say is this. The noble Marquess suggested no remedy except the one which has constantly been put forward&#x2014;namely, resort to the powers possessed under the Crimes Act. I noticed that the noble Marquess described the Crimes Act as now a part of the ordinary law.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member>: <membercontribution>Hear, hear</membercontribution>.</p>
<p><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR:</member> <membercontribution>I have not had an opportunity of looking the matter up, but my impression is that when, in the year 1887, the Government of the day, consisting of the friends of the noble Marquess, introduced that Act, they did not introduce it as a part of the ordinary
<col>516</col>
law but as a weapon which was only to be drawn upon in case of necessity, rather than having time after time to pass a succession of Coercion Acts for limited periods. It was then said that, once it had been placed on the Statute Book as a permanent enactment, the time would come when it would be treated as the ordinary law of the land. Some of us anticipated that, and now it is verified by the statement of the noble Marquess himself. I believe that had we made use of the Crimes Act, so far from having a betterment, we should have had a worsement of the condition of Ireland. It is not for me to speak of alternative remedies, but I believe myself that the adoption of the remedy suggested by the noble Marquess would have exasperated public opinion and made evidence more difficult to get and juries more reluctant to convict. If your Lordships ask me whether, in my opinion, Ireland is in a satisfactory state, my reply is that I do not think Ireland has been in a satisfactory state for the last twenty-five years.</membercontribution></p>

<title>INDIANS IN THE TRANSVAAL.</title>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member> <membercontribution>rose to ask the Secretary of State for the Colonies&#x2014;(1) Whether it is a fact that the Transvaal Government have arranged with the Portuguese Government that the authorities at Delagoa Bay should forcibly detain and deport to India British Indians who are placed over the border for offences under the Registration Law. (2) If so, whether His Majesty's Government have either approved or disapproved of this action on the part of the Colonial Government. (3) Whether there is any precedent for handing over British subjects to a foreign Government to be punished for offences committed in British territory; and to move for Papers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Lord said </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the Questions which I desire to put to the noble Earl the Secretary of State for the Colonies are questions as to fact, and I hope that they are sufficiently clear. With your Lordships' permission I propose to reserve anything I have to say in regard to the Motion for Papers until I have such information as the noble Earl may be pleased to give to the House. I trust that it may not be necessary to press the Motion, and that I have been misinformed in regard to circumstances which, if they have been correctly reported, seem to me to be extremely unusual and exceedingly grave.</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE):</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, the noble Lord's Question, as he says, is very largely one of fact. He asks us whether it is a fact that the Transvaal Government have arranged with the Portuguese Government that the authorities at Delagoa Bay should forcibly detain and deport to India British Indians who are placed over the border for offences under the Registration Law. In the first place, I think it is desirable to state what the general position is. The Transvaal Government have decided that the most reasonable course to take and the best in the interests of the Indians themselves is that where they have broken the Registration Law they should be returned to their country of domicile.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Lord </member><membercontribution>will, I am sure, agree that, in reply to this Question, there is no
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0284"/>
<col>519</col>
need to enter into the general question as to the rights, moral or otherwise, which the Transvaal Government may have to remove Indians from their own Colony. That is a question in which I know the noble Lord takes a keen interest, but it really does not arise on this particular point. We assume, for the purposes of the reply to this Question, that the Transvaal Government have a right to remove certain British Indians over their borders. No British Indian domiciled in Africa has been deported from Africa, and that statement will, I think, remove a misapprehension under which, I do not say the noble Lord, but some of the noble Lord's friends have been labouring.<lb/>
The ordinary course would undoubtedly be for the Transvaal Government to conduct the Indians whom they desired to remove to their borders and pass them into the neighbouring territory, whether that territory be Natal or Portuguese East Africa. But the Transvaal Government, having taken pains to ascertain the domicile of a number of these Indians, find that India is their native country. They have, therefore, arranged, in a manner which I have no doubt they conceive to be, as I said, the best in the interests of the Indians as well as their own, to return those Indians to India. In order to do this the Indians have to pass through either Portuguese or Natal territory, and the arrangement, as I understand, is that they are passed through either Natal or Portuguese East Africa and that necessarily an arrangement is made with either Government for their transport across those respective territories. It is perfectly obvious that, under the Natal law, the further process of placing them on board ship and conveying them to India is a legal process. They are <i>ex hypothesi</i> not Natal Indians, and therefore they become subject to the law in Natal. I am not absolutely certain as to what the law in Portuguese East Africa is, but I am making inquiry on that point, and, indeed, into the matter generally. I think, however, that one must assume that these Indians, who are also <i>ex hypothesi</i> not Mozambique Indians, must fall under the Portuguese law which renders it possible to place them on board ship.<lb/>
It may be, and I am sure is, from the point of view of the noble Lord opposite a regrettable thing that these Indians should be deported at all; but, assuming that the
<col>520</col>
Transvaal Government have a right in their discretion as a self-governing Colony to deport them, I do not think that any hardship is involved in that particular method of deportation to which the noble Lord in this Question draws attention. On the contrary, this method is designed so as to cause the least practical inconvenience to those who are subjected to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I think your Lordships will perceive that I have received no very explicit answer from the noble Earl. I gather from his statement that some arrangement has been made with the Portuguese Government for the deportation to India of British subjects. The noble Earl went on to say that it was necessary that some arrangement should be made with the foreign Government, but he made a further remark which seems to me one of the most extraordinary I have ever heard. He premised, as I understood his interpretation of the law, that the power of the Transvaal Government ceases once they have conveyed those Indians over the border; that they cannot continue the assault once the Indians are across the frontier. That, I believe, is quite correct as a general principle of constitutional law. But then the noble Earl suggested that, once they are over the border, they somehow or other&#x2014;I cannot remember his exact language&#x2014;fall under a Portuguese law which enables them to be deported. Without pretending to any expert knowledge of constitutional law, I venture to assert that there is absolutely no sanction or precedent of any kind for action of this sort, and that it is an entirely new departure for any Government to entrust the punishment of its political offenders to a foreign Government.<lb/>
The law of all nations requires that criminals even should be punished in the country in which they have offended, and in accordance with the laws which they have transgressed. I would even venture, with all deference, to appeal to the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack and ask, in my ignorance, whether or not that is a correct statement of the ordinary law of civilised nations. But this suggestion that the Indians are made subject to the laws of the Portuguese Government and that it is in that manner that the deportation is justified seems to me to be absolutely new and unprecedented. Imagine, to take
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0285"/>
<col>521</col>
an extreme case, that the Portuguese Government, or, say, the Chinese Government, had a law which enacted that anybody who disobeyed a policeman should be subjected to the penalty of decapitation. What should we do if a British citizen by disobeying a Chinese or Portuguese policeman made himself amenable to that penalty? Should we not interfere? And yet it appears, from what the noble Earl has told us, that there is no idea or question of interfering with the Portuguese Government when they take it upon themselves to punish men whose offence&#x2014;if offence it is&#x2014;has been committed in a British Colony.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Earl</member> <membercontribution>began by anticipating what he imagined to be a possible contention of mine by telling me that no Indian domiciled in South Africa had been so deported. I should be extremely glad to think that this was the case, but I am not quite sure that the noble Earl has been correctly informed on that point. I have heard that one of the chief objections is that these men are being deported to countries to which they do not belong, and that, surely, does not come within the power of any Government of any nation? I am told that some of them have come from Natal and are being deported to India. Others do not belong to India at all, in that they have been born and are domiciled in the Transvaal. As I said just now, these Indians are not criminals. At the worst they are passive resisters, and they are passive resisters in circumstances of the utmost provocation. Surely this does not justify the Colonial Government in treating them as outlaws, and in depriving them of any rights they may possess as British citizens&#x2014;for instance, the right of appeal for relief to their own Courts?<lb/>
What is their offence? Their offence is that they have protested by the only means open to them not against a law, but against the manner of carrying out a law. They have protested against what they believe to be a breach of faith on the part of the Transvaal Government. That they have not protested against the law which obliges them to be registered is surely manifest from the fact that they have twice voluntarily submitted to registration. It may be denied that they have cause to protest against a breach of faith, but if there was no promise on the part 
<col>522</col>
of the Transvaal Government certainly there was a promise on the part of the late High Commissioner, speaking in the name of the Imperial Government. Lord Milner, as High Commissioner, in 1903 told the British Indians in the Transvaal that if once they registered they would not be required to register again. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Registration gives you a right to be here and a right to come and go."</quote>
Acting on that absolutely explicit assurance and pledge, the Indians voluntarily registered themselves again.<lb/>
Then came the new order of things, and the Transvaal Government, in spite of this undertaking, insisted that there should be registration once more. The attitude of the Indians was&#x2014;If you think it necessary, if it is convenient to you, we will register again, but we will do so voluntarily; what we do not like is to be compelled and to be compelled in the manner in which you intend to put pressure upon us. Your Lordships remember the story. The Indians successfully resisted compulsion, and at the beginning of last year, as the result of what is known as the compromise, they voluntarily registered themselves for a second time almost to a man. The reason that they pocketed their pride and gave way was that they believed, wrongly we are told, that the Registration Act of 1907&#x2014;the Act which they regarded as humiliating and offensive and unnecessary&#x2014;would be repealed. Whether or not there was such a promise we shall probably never know, and it is not to my purpose to discuss the question here. Anyhow, that was the belief and the understanding on which the Indians for the second time, in spite of a second breach of faith, voluntarily registered themselves again.<lb/>
It is absolutely idle to say that the protest of these Indians is simply sentimental, that it has no solid foundation or reason, and that it is quite uncalled for, as is sometimes urged. Men do not suffer as these men have suffered without very good reason. Do your Lordships know that over 2,000 of these Indians have suffered imprisonment, mostly with hard labour? Do your Lordships know that every one of them has suffered great pecuniary loss, and a considerable number of them absolute financial ruin? And what about the leader, the man who is represented as a mere
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0286"/>
<col>523</col>
agitator, and who, for the third time, is undergoing imprisonment with hard labour for the sake of his opinions and because he is defending what he regards as the honour of his community? Mr Gandhi, I think your Lordships will be interested to hear, is the son of an Indian gentleman of good birth and high position who was a former Prime Minister of the State of Kathiawar. He is a barrister by profession, but, in spite of his birth and his professional ties and obligations, he served during the war in the dangerous capacity of a stretcher-bearer with the British troops. Again, during the recent Natal rebellion he undertook the same perilous duty with the British force. He is a man who devotes all his means and most of his time and energy to public service and to the purest philanthropy. This is the man who is leading this movement, and with him there are several hundreds of others who, I can assure your Lordships from the knowledge I possess, will persist to the bitter end, whatever be the extremity of ruin or misery it brings upon them. In these circumstances it is simply fatuous to say that they have no good reason for undergoing sufferings of this kind.<lb/>
I have always maintained, and I still maintain, that a little good-will would at each successive stage have solved this question. I am extremely sorry that my noble friend Lord Curzon is not here today, for I am quite certain that, as the result of his recent visit to South Africa and of his intercourse with the men on the spot, he would bear me out in my opinion that this is the case. But somewhere&#x2014;not everywhere but somewhere &#x2014;among the authorities concerned there is a lack of that good-will which is necessary. Has not the Secretary of State, by virtue of his office and by virtue of that personality which attracts and charms us all, sufficient persuasive power to overcome that false pride which forms the obstacle to a final settlement of this deplorable dispute? The Secretary of State, through his mouthpiece in the House of Commons, has told us that he has been making constant friendly representations to the Government of the Transvaal and to the High Commissioner. Why have those friendly representations borne no fruit? We shall hear, I hope, within a few days, as the Secretary of State has been good enough to inform me that he
<col>524</col>
proposes to publish Papers in regard to those friendly representations.<lb/>
But I should like to ask the noble Earl now, Has he not explained&#x2014;surely he has explained&#x2014;the vital necessity of avoiding offence to the people of India at this present time when we are doing everything in our power in this country to assure them that our good-will is greater than ever, and that we are prepared to treat them with greater trust and confidence than before? Has he not suggested that it would be well to remove this one blot on the fair prospect of South African unity in which we all rejoice at the present time? All classes in South Africa, as we learn from communications in the Press, and particularly from the eloquent and interesting letter from my noble friend Lord Curzon which was published the other day, are forgetting their old hatreds, hatreds of that extreme kind which result from national hostility&#x2014;they are forgetting them in order to unite for mutual self-interest in the future. Only the Indians, their fellow subjects and our fellow subjects, are left out in the cold.<lb/>
Have the Indians done nothing for South Africa? Have they no right at all to share in the goodly heritage of the future? No man who has even an elementary acquaintance with the history of South Africa can deny that they have a full right to share in that heritage. And I say that, even if they were in the wrong in this dispute, which I for one cannot for an instant admit, now would be the time above all others to condone their faults and to treat them with generosity. I cannot understand why it has been impossible for so long to make such a concession as would put an end to this miserable dispute. How can those on the spot, who have all authority and all power, suffer in pride in any way by making a concession to those who are dependent and powerless? So little is required. As I have said on previous occasions, it is merely a matter of repealing a law which has served its purpose, which is absolutely useless now if that purpose was honestly and fairly stated at the outset, and which has been pronounced by the Courts of the Colony to be absolutely unworkable. That is all that is required&#x2014;that and a small concession in the shape of altered legislation which would not give away one atom of principle that the Colony sets its heart on, but yet would meet the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0287"/>
<col>525</col>
views of the Indians in regard to the point of honour.<lb/>
I venture once more to appeal to the noble Earl to renew, with all his might, those friendly representations which he has been making during the past year; and I base my appeal, not only on those considerations which I have just advanced, but on a far higher ground&#x2014;I base it on the solemn pledge which was contained in the Proclamation of Queer. Victoria in 1858, a pledge which is still binding on the servants of the Crown. Your Lordships will forgive me if I quote that oft-quoted pledge once more. It is&#x2014;
<quote>"We hold Ourselves bound to the natives of Our Indian Territories by the same obligations of duty which bind Us to all Our ether subjects, and these obligations, by the blessing of Almighty God, We shall faithfully and conscientiously fulfil."</quote>
I hope that the noble Earl can promise to lay on the Table the correspondence which has passed on the subject of these negotiations with the Portuguese Government so that it may not be necessary for me to press my Motion for Papers. I think, in a matter of this gravity and of this extremely unusual character, it is right and necessary that Parliament should be exactly informed as to what has been arranged, how it has come to pass, and what part His Majesty's Government have played in the negotiations.</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have no right to speak again, but perhaps, by the indulgence of the House, I might say one word. In spite of the noble Lord's very kindly reference to myself, I am sure he will forgive me if I do not enter at this moment on the broad and general question. Nobody could complain of him for touching upon it once more, because we all know that his feelings are most deeply involved in it; but I think it will be better to wait until the Papers are laid in regard to the whole registration question before we attempt to discuss that again.<lb/>
But, as regards the particular subject-matter of the noble Lord's Question, assuming that the Transvaal Government have a right to remove from their borders an Indian or any person who has broken the law, the simple course is to conduct that person to the frontier, in which case he becomes undoubtedly subject to the laws of the country into which he is conducted. They may be milder or they 
<col>526</col>
may be more severe than the laws of the country from which he has be removed. The noble Lord mentioned a hypothetical case of a man, guilty of some small and possibly technical offence against the law, being conveyed over the frontier into a country where the penalty for another small offence might be decapitation. Supposing that analogy to hold, that is a very good reason for not simply turning people over the frontier, but for making arrangement by which they can be conducted in a train through the neighbouring country, placed on board ship, and taken in comfort to their own homes, It seems to me that the noble Lord's argument was, in its essence, directed against the alternative course of simply putting people over the frontier and tended to support the course that has been taken&#x2014;that is to say, of merely carrying people through the neighbouring country in a train and placing them on board ship at the harbour of the country.<lb/>
These deported Indians, in the belief of the Transvaal Government&#x2014;and it must be remembered that these people have all been tried&#x2014;are, so far as it is possible to ascertain, Indians domiciled in India; and I repeat that, leaving out all the other aspects of this unhappy business, it does seem to me the most rational and convenient course to place them on board ship with a view to their return to their country of origin rather than simply to turn them over the frontier, which by, general consent and the common practice of nations, they would be entitled to do. I firmly believe that this particular provision of which the noble Lord complains as unprecedented has really been framed with a view of securing to the utmost degree the comfort of the Indians whom the Transvaal Government, for reasons of their own, are not prepared to admit as citizens of their country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL:</member> <membercontribution>May I ask the noble Earl whether he is going to include the Papers among those he is about to present?</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE:</member> <membercontribution>As I told the noble Lord, I am inquiring how the technical point as to placing these people on board ship at Delagoa Bay, supposing such had taken place, was covered by the existing Portuguese law. We know the other case of their being embarked at

Durban is covered by the Natal law. On that point I am making inquiries, but no communications have passed on the subject so far, except the bare statement of what has occurred from the Transvaal Government.</membercontribution></p>

What I desire to know is whether this correspondence will be included in the Papers on the general question which the noble Earl is going to present very shortly.</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE:</member> <membercontribution>I do not think it will be possible to include it in the particular Blue-book to which the noble Lord refers and which is practically ready.

As the noble Earl knows, it is contrary to the custom of the House to put back a Motion on the Paper to an earlier day than that appointed, but I do not know whether the difficulty could be overcome by the present Notice being taken off the Paper and another in slightly different terms being substituted.

<title>STANDING COMMITTEES.</title>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> <membercontribution>rose to move that a Committee be appointed to consider and report upon the Standing Orders relating to Standing Committees.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Earl</member> <membercontribution>said: My Lords, I do not think your Lordships will be at all surprised at this Motion, because frequent reference has been made to this Standing Order in past sessions of Parliament and to the way in which it has been applied. The Standing Order itself provides that all Bills are to be committed to a Standing Committee after passing through Committee of the Whole House unless the House shall otherwise direct. The obvious intention of the Standing Order was that the reference of these Bills to the Standing Committee should be the rule, and that any different order should be the exception; but, as a matter of fact, in practice the exception has become the rule, and, as your Lordships know, it is now almost invariably the case that when a Bill has passed through Committee of the Whole House the Motion is made that the Standing Committee be negatived.<lb/>
Perhaps I may, in justification of my Motion, remind your Lordships very briefly of the history of this matter. The Standing Committee was appointed in pursuance
<col>530</col>
of the Report of a Committee moved for by Lord Cadogan when Lord Privy Seal in 1888, and on that Committee the late Lord Herschell proposed the establishment of one or more Standing Committees for considering such Bills as might be referred to them. In his Motion he alluded more especially to Bills which were not of first-rate importance, and he considered that very good work might be done in the way of reviewing and revising these Bills, with the aid, as he said, of an experienced draftsman; but he had not in his mind, apparently, any idea that the Standing Committee would be empowered to make Amendments of substance. He expressed the opinion that a Standing Committee would be able to put legislation in better shape and prevent the inconsistencies and blemishes which were often found greatly to mar measures.<lb/>
Curiously enough, the Standing Committee contemplated by Lord Herschell very much corresponded to what this House would be under the proposals which I think I have seen advocated by persons even so distinguished as the noble Earl who leads the House. Lord Herschell intended this Committee to be a reviewing and revising and drafting body, but not to have any powers of its own. That Report was considered, and the principle of Standing Committees was adopted in March, 1889, and in 1890 two Standing Committees were appointed, one of which was to look after law Bills and the other general Bills. When, however, these Standing Committees began to do their work they took quite a different view of their functions from that which had been taken by Lord Herschell. and, I believe, the House. They proceeded to act very much as a Grand Committee of the House of Commons acts at the present time. They went very carefully into the Bills and introduced Amendments of substance, and I remember that very frequently the sitting of the Standing Committee would occupy a couple of hours and even more. The result was that the Standing Committee, coming first, really usurped the power of the House, and when Bills came back to the House and were taken in Committee a number of noble Lords not members of the Standing Committee&#x2014;I remember very distinctly the late Lord Beauchamp was one of them&#x2014;took exception to this, and contended that the Standing Committee was taking away the powers of the House, and, moreover,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0290"/>
<col>531</col>
that the Standing Committee was not even properly reported.<lb/>
There was a great deal of substance, of course, in those complaints, and in 1891, in consequence of them, Lord Cadogan moved for another Committee to inquire into the Standing Orders, and it was in the debate which preceded the appointment of that Committee that the late Lord Salisbury said that for his part he thought the complaint might be met by making the stage of Committee of the Whole House precede, instead of follow, the Standing Committee. To cut a long story short, the Committee appointed on the Motion of Lord Cadogan adopted that view, and their Report was finally agreed to by the House. From that moment the Standing Committee began to decline in importance. The Committee was no longer able to make Amendments of substance, and the result was that noble Lords no longer attended, and the proceedings of the Standing Committee degenerated until they have come to what they are at the present time.<lb/>
Your Lordships know perfectly well that during the last two or three sessions almost every noble Lord in charge of a Bill has proceeded to move that the Standing Committee be negatived. That form has been gone through on nearly every occasion, and the Motion to negative the Standing Committee has never been opposed in any practical manner and has now become as regular a part of the proceedings as the Motion for the House to resolve itself into Committee. Therefore, it seems to me quite worth your Lordships' while to appoint a Committee to inquire into Standing Orders and consider whether it is really desirable to have a Committee for this purpose, and, if so, what Bills should be referred to such Committee and under what regulations and orders. There is one other point of some importance. If the Standing Committee be not negatived in connection with a Bill coming forward on a Wednesday or Thursday, the Bill has to wait for nearly a week because the Standing Committee only meets on Tuesday. Your Lordships are well aware of the manner in which business is done in this House in the last five or six weeks of the session, and if the Standing Committee stage were really enforced the result would be to make almost intolerable the defects
<col>532</col>
of which we at the present time often loudly complain. I beg to move.<lb/>
Moved, That a Select Committee be appointed to consider and report upon the Standing Orders relating to Standing Committes.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Camperdown.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF ONSLOW):</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I am glad that the noble Earl has altered the terms of his Motion. As it first appeared on the Paper, the proposal was to abolish the Standing Committee <i>la mort sans phrase;</i> but since then the noble Lord has amended the Motion and now asks your Lordships to appoint a Select Committee to consider the whole matter. I think that anyone looking at the Standing Orders of your Lordships' House will see that those who moved originally for the Standing Committee expected it to do a great deal of work which it never has done, and I am not at all sure that it might not still fulfil some of the functions originally intended by those who set up the Standing Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Earl</member> <membercontribution>spoke just now of the review and revision of legislation. That is one of the functions which this House has always specially claimed for itself, and I do think that a Committee appointed to consider this matter might with great advantage look into the question of whether the Standing Committee might not devote itself more closely to such work as that, and also as to whether it might not meet at more frequent intervals when there is great pressure of work before your Lordships' House. I quite agree with the noble Earl that the work which the Committee at present does is extremely slight, and that, as far as the Amendments which are moved and carried in it are concerned, they might just as well, and perhaps rather better, be done in Committee of the Whole House. In fact, I do not remember now for many years past any Amendment inserted in Standing Committee which might not perfectly well, and, I think, with greater advantage, have been discussed in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I have a Motion on the Paper, which I put down every year, that a Standing Committee be appointed, and that a certain number of noble Lords he appointed to select the Standing Committee. I purposely placed it down with no day named,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0291"/>
<col>533</col>
because I knew the noble Earl intended raising this question, and, of course, I shall not persevere with my Motion if his proposal for the appointment of a Select Committee is carried. If the Select Committee is appointed, I hope the result will be that we shall be able to devise some better work for the Standing Committee than has been put before it in recent years.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the noble Earl who has moved this Motion has given a very clear, complete, and, I think, correct account of the history of the Standing Committee. It is undoubtedly true that when the late Lord Herschell made the original proposition that the reference to Lord Cadogan's Committee should include the consideration of the appointment of such a Committee, he did contemplate that its powers should be those of revising and reviewing&#x2014;by no means contemptible powers, as I am sure the noble Earl will agree, although he seemed to think that they covered but a small field of political activity. It is also, of course, perfectly true that the Standing Committee did become either an anticipation or a repetition of what went on in the House itself. The noble Lords who attended the Standing Committee and took an active part in its deliberations were always the same noble Lords as those who took part in the particular measure in Committee of the Whole House.<lb/>
At the same time, I think all of us who remember the Standing Committee in its brighter days will agree that some excellent work was done there; and although it is, of course, possible that the Committee which I hope your Lordships will agree to appoint may arrive at the conclusion that such a body is no longer needed, yet I am glad, like my noble friend who has just sat down, that the whole matter should be considered by a Committee. To use a famous phrase, a Committee sat by the cradle of the Standing Committee, and, if it is to perish, it is right that a Committee should follow its hearse.<lb/>
I think there are other reasons why the work of the Standing Committee has, as the noble Earl said, tended to diminish in value and in importance. I believe that in many cases closer interest is shown in
<col>534</col>
Committee of the Whole House than used to be taken some twenty years ago. That, I think, is all to the good and to the credit of your Lordships' House. Then, on the other hand&#x2014;and this, I think, applies to the time when either party is in power&#x2014;far fewer Bills which are not Government Bills come up from another place. It has become the custom in another place to occupy the greater part of the session with Government business, and it is undoubtedly the case that for the consideration of first-class Bills the Standing Committee has never been particularly suited. On the other hand, there are Government Bills of a more or less non-controversial character which in past times I have seen very usefully considered there. That being so, I am very glad that the noble Earl did change the form of his Motion, and that instead of proposing to abolish the Standing Committee straight off he has moved for the appointment of a Committee to consider the whole question, to which I hope your Lordships will agree.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I think that on this side of the House there is no disposition to disagree with the Motion of my noble friend. We must all of us feel that the Standing Committee as we now know it is rather of the nature of a solemn farce. Again and again when a Bill comes before your Lordships' House a Motion is made, almost <i>pro form&#x00E2;,</i> that the Standing Committee be negatived; and in these circumstances, there is an atmosphere of unreality about the proceedings which we must all deprecate. I think my noble friend has shown that the Standing Committee as it was contemplated by those responsible for its invention was a different piece of Parliamentary machinery from the Standing Committee as it has existed since the great alteration was effected which made the Standing Committee stage later than the stage of Committee of the whole House. I am glad that the Standing Committee is not to be summarily got rid of, and I cannot help hoping that the inquiry proposed by my noble friend may enable your Lordships to frame some proposal which shall conduce to the efficient discharge of our business.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I respectfully venture to agree with what fell from the noble Earl the Leader of the House. I think his distinction between Bills which are Government Bills, and,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0292"/>

therefore, on the whole presumably, I hope may say for both sides, more carefully considered and drafted, and private Bills was very sound. It has occurred to me to suggest that, if the Standing Committee is not to be abolished, it would be much better if, instead of having always the Motion to negative the Standing Committee, the presumption were that unless specially ordered no Bill should go to the Standing Committee. In this way the Standing Committee could still be retained, and if any Bill came up which the House thought it desirable should be examined by the Standing Committee, then a Motion to refer it to that Committee could be moved before or after the stage of Committee of the Whole House. I admit, however, that this is rather a suggestion for the Committee which it is proposed to appoint.</membercontribution></p>

In those circumstances, considering the great personal interest which Lord Cawdor takes in the subject to which he intended to refer, and his exceptional knowledge of it, we felt that the discussion might well be postponed until a future period.

<title>A WAR OFFICE RETURN.</title>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War a Question of which I have given him private notice. It will be in the recollection of some of your Lordships that a little more than three months ago a Return was ordered as to the state of the Army, the Special Reserve, and the Territorial Forces on January 1. Your Lordships were encouraged to hope that the Return would be available on the reassembling of Parliament, but we are still without the Return. We are now within two days of the adjournment for the Easter holidays, and I hope that the noble Lord will do his best to circulate the Return tomorrow at the latest, in order that it may be possible to place a Notice on the Order Paper before your Lordships adjourn.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS):</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I regret that there has been this delay in presenting the Return which was asked for at the end of last session. The Motion was placed on the Order Paper on one day and taken the next day. I did not get an opportunity of consulting my military advisers on the question until later, and I now regret to say that I was unaware of the fact that it had never been the practice&#x2014;the noble Viscount himself constantly refused to supply them&#x2014;to give mobilisation figures when they were asked for. I unwittingly agreed to give the Return, which includes certain mobilisation figures; but I now fear that it is not in the public
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0295"/>
<col>541</col>
interest to give those figures. I shall be glad, however, to supply the figures confidentially to the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, who moved for the Return, and also to the noble Viscount. But I am extremely sorry to have to tell the House at this late date that it is not possible for the mobilisation figures to be publicly given. All the other figures asked for are ready to be printed at once, and I trust the noble Lords will have them in their possession before the Easter recess.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON:</member> <membercontribution>I do not for a moment press the noble Lord for any figures which the Government consider it undesirable to give, but I think we might have been informed some weeks ago that there was a difficulty in presenting the figures asked for. I have ventured to press the noble Lord and the Secretary of State privately to let us have the Return, and this is the first I have heard of there being any difficulty on the ground of public interest in giving it. The other figures we should have been glad to have had some time ago.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ERROLL:</member> <membercontribution>Having asked for this Return in the first instance, I have mentioned the matter to the noble Lord two or three times, and he has always informed me that the Return would be ready in a week or two. This is the first I have heard of there being any difficulty in presenting the mobilisation figures. Like the noble Viscount I do not wish to have published any information which it is undesirable in the public interest should be given, but I would be very glad if the

<title>DUNOON BURGH BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p><member>LORD AVEBURY:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to move that it be an Instruction to the Committee to which this Bill is referred to leave out Clauses 5 and 8 to 12. The question to which I desire to call your Lordships' attention may seem at first sight a small one, but it really raises a very large problem. Clause 5 of this Bill provides that&#x2014;
"The Town Council may and they are hereby authorised to carry on and continue the cartage undertaking presently carried on by them for the conveyance and delivery of goods wares merchandise parcels and personal luggage of every kind whatsoever within and beyond the burgh."
<col>544</col>
This, therefore, gives them the power of carrying on an immense cartage business, not only in the burgh of Dunoon, but, as far as I can see, anywhere in Scotland, or, indeed, throughout the world. Clause 8 provides that&#x2014;
"Subject to the provisions of this Act the Town Council may build purchase hire provide charter employ and maintain steam and other vessels of every or any description and may navigate work and use the same and may therein and thereby convey and carry passengers animals goods merchandise and things of every description between the Burgh and Port of Dunoon and all ports and places on the River and Firth of Clyde and all waters and lochs within a line drawn from the Mull of Kintyre to the Heads of Ayr and may do all acts and things and may employ and hire all such officers and other persons as may be necessary to enable them to carry fully into effect the purposes aforesaid."
The other clauses referred to in my Motion are subsidiary to these two. This really raises the whole question of municipal trading, and is one more step in the direction of Socialism. Although it may be in itself a small one, yet if it is agreed to by your Lordships' House, it is difficult to see how the same powers can be denied to other municipalities. At the annual conference of the Social Democratic Federation, held at Burnley, a resolution was passed supporting all forms of municipal enterprise on the ground that it tended to substitute socialisation for private enterprise. This is another step in that direction.<lb/>
I submit that municipal trading is undesirable on several grounds. First, the legitimate functions of municipalities are quite sufficient to occupy all their time and attention without going into matters of business; secondly, what has already been done has occasioned an enormous addition to our municipal debt; thirdly, this trading involves municipalities in labour disputes; fourthly, as there will not be in these operations the same stimulus to economy as in private enterprise there will be a great probability, if not a certainty, that one of two things will happen&#x2014;either there will be a loss which the ratepayers will have to make good, or the service will cost more to the ratepayers; and, lastly, municipal trading is a serious check to progress. I do not think I need occupy your Lordships' time in enlarging upon the great and complicated duties which municipalities have already to perform, nor need I trouble you with any statistics as to the enormous increase in the municipal debt.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0297"/>
<col>545</col>
As regards the question of labour disputes, the report of the conference of municipal employ&#x00E9;s associations for 1906 contains a very interesting speech by Mr. Keir Hardie, in which he said&#x2014;
"As a Socialist he was naturally strongly in favour of organisation amongst municipal employ&#x00E9;s, and he was pleased to see the marvellous progress that had been made. In this country there were already over two million municipal employ&#x00E9;s, and as the total wage-earners numbered fourteen millions, this was very interesting. He also found that in 1903, when there was a reduction in wages all round, the wages of municipal employ&#x00E9;s had alone increased; indeed, they had doubled."
As regards loss in municipal trading, a great number of illustrations could be given. In fact, I believe these bodies never make a profit, except where they have a monopoly. I do not know what line His Majesty's Government may be disposed to take on this question. The late Lord Farrer&#x2014;and no one had greater experience in all these questions&#x2014;began life strongly in favour of municipal enterprise as against private enterprise, but in later years his experience led him to the opposite conclusion, and in his work on the State and its relation to trade he speaks of the great danger involved in municipal trading. This is another step in that fatal direction. Mr. Meyer, Professor of Political Economy, of Chicago, in his work on municipal ownership, has given interesting statistics showing the effect upon the employment of labour of what has been done in regard to the telephone service, electric lighting, and tramways in the United States as compared with England. He shows that, in consequence of the freedom which was left in the United States, there were 115,000 more persons employed in those three industries there than here.<lb/>
I submit that municipal trading is very much in opposition to the interests of working-men, and that the tendency of legislation such as that comprised in Clauses 5 and 8 of this Bill is in the direction of increasing unemployment. Why should the Town Council of Dunoon ask for power to engage in shipbuilding? The Clyde is celebrated for its shipbuilders, and surely they can supply any number of ships which Dunoon may require. As regards the running of ships, there, again, the Clyde steamship companies, which send ships all over the world, are surely able to supply the wants of Dunoon. I, therefore, fail to see the need for these
<col>546</col>
additional powers. If we constantly give powers of this kind we shall find it difficult to draw the line. The question arises whether we should pass this Instruction or leave the matter to the Committee. When it is a question between two companies, or between a company and individuals, or a question of fairness to individual rights, then no doubt the matter is best dealt with by a Committee. But this is not a question of detail. The great principle is here raised whether powers of this kind ought to be given to municipalities. I submit that this is a question which really ought to be decided by the House, and it is from that point of view that I venture to move the Instruction which stands in my name.<lb/>
<i>Moved,</i> That it be an instruction to the Committee to which the Bill is referred to leave out Clauses 5 and 8 to 12.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Avebury.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, it is impossible, so far as abstract doctrine goes, not to agree with a great deal that the noble Lord has said. I certainly agree that such a departure as this is a matter for the decision of the House itself rather than a Committee, but to enable the House to come to a final decision on the merits, and to feel that it is coming safely to such a decision, it ought to have the full facts before it. My belief is that it would be wiser to allow this Bill to go to Committee to see what evidence is presented upon the matters involved, and not to attempt to come to a decision, as this House would naturally have to come to a decision if it decided to-day to strike out the clauses, in practical ignorance of the merits of the case.<lb/>
I certainly am not going into a defence of the clauses as they stand. To do that would be to take the House into a discussion on the merits, which is exactly what I want to avoid. But there are special circumstances affecting the burgh of Dunoon, and I think it would be wiser for the House to let this Bill go upstairs, and then, upon Third Reading or a stage subsequent to the Committee, see whether any sort of case has been made out for what I frankly admit is a very large departure in private Bill legislation in the way of giving powers to a municipality. The first point I make, then, is that if we reject this Instruction the House is not parting with control; it is
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0298"/>
<col>547</col>
only suspending its judgment until we see the whole facts as they may be proved before the Committee. Dunoon is a small town upon the banks of the Clyde. In the winter it has a population of some 7,000 or 8,000, which in the summer time rises to 25,000 or 30,000, owing to the extent to which Dunoon is used by summer visitors from Glasgow and the larger places on both sides of the Clyde. For this business to be carried on, it is absolutely necessary that there should be convenient modes of communication with Dunoon. There is no possibilty of getting to Dunoon by road, there is no railway communication to it at all, and the only means of communication is by steamboat.<lb/>
The steamboat service on the Clyde is largely in the hands of two or more railway companies. They have lately, as I venture to think very wisely, combined their services for the purposes of economy. It is alleged by Dunoon that the service either has been or is likely to be unduly restricted. Dunoon burgh have the ownership of a ferry. It is questioned how far they should be allowed to exercise their rights over that ferry, and they are undoubtedly asking for power to compete with the railway companies. I should be the last person to defend that power except upon the very strongest ground, as I think it quite possible that the burgh of Dunoon, like other people, sometimes ask for more than they ought to have or more even, perhaps, than they themselves expect to get. It may be that the railway companies are reasonable or unreasonable. As to that I express no opinion; but, owing to the peculiar circumstances of the situation, the physical characteristics of the place, and the absolute necessity for the livelihood of the inhabitants that communication should be as free, as easy, and as rapid as possible, I think it would be reasonable that the people of Dunoon should have a chance of proving their allegation by means of cross-examination and witnesses before an impartial tribunal like a Committee of your Lordships' House. I do not think it would take a long time, and I believe it would be more satisfactory to all parties that the matter should be thrashed out on its merits upstairs. Your Lordships would then be able to decide with full knowledge on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES(THE EARL OF ONSLOW)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the difficulty that I always feel myself in
<col>548</col>
with regard to Motions of the kind now before the House is that it sometimes is difficult to find a way by which a member of your Lordships' House, interested in a private Bill but not about to sit upon it as one of those selected for the Committee, is able to give expression to his views and invite the sense of the House. If he does so before the Second Reading he is told that it is much better to let the Bill go to a Committee and be thrashed out there. If he takes action after the Bill has been considered by a Committee he is invariably told that the Committee has thoroughly looked into it, and that if your Lordships once decide to go behind the decision of the Committee you are creating a dangerous precedent.<lb/>
But I would point out to my noble friend that, in this case, if he allows the Bill to go to a Committee without this Instruction, his opportunities for further considering the matter will be by no means at an end. I suggest whether it would not be well for him to allow the Bill as it stands to go before the Select Committee, because in this House, at any rate, there is always an opportunity of moving the omission of Clauses on Third Reading, and my noble friend and such of your Lordships as are interested in the matter would then have had the additional advantage of studying the evidence, which, of course, will be printed, given before the Committee. With regard to Clause 5, which affects the question of cartage, that has to a limited extent, at any rate, already been sanctioned by Parliament. The burgh of Dunoon were allowed to purchase the pier undertaking, and with the pier undertaking the cartage establishment used in connection therewith.<lb/>
Then there is the larger question, namely, the powers which the burgh seek to obtain to run steamboats across the Clyde. Most of your Lordships have fresh in your minds the results of attempting to run steamboats on the River Thames, and I do not think that the success which attended that experiment is such as to lead your Lordships very readily to entrust other local authorities with similar powers; but, in the case of Dunoon, the business of communication by steamer across the Clyde is now, as my noble friend Lord Balfour has said, in the hands of certain railway companies, and it is the fear that these steamboat services may be curtailed,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0299"/>
<col>549</col>
or possibly, during the winter months, taken off altogether, which has led the burgh of Dunoon to some to Parliament with these proposals.<lb/>
If I may venture to throw out a suggestion to the Town Council of Dunoon as well as to the railway companies concerned, it seems to me that it would be very much better if an arrangement could be come to between them by which a service of steamboats should be guaranteed by the railway companies&#x2014;a minimum amount of accommodation such as the Town Council of Dunoon would be content with&#x2014;and that thereupon the burgh should leave these matters to the railway companies and not endeavour to obtain powers for themselves. I throw that out as a suggestion, and if, when the Bill comes back to your Lordships from the Select Committee, it is found that nothing of the kind has been possible, it will then be perfectly competent for the noble Lord to make a Motion similar in effect to that which he has on the Paper, and he would have the additional advantage of the full facts being before him and the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD AVEBURY:</member> <membercontribution>As I gather that we shall not be in any way committed to these Clauses if we allow them to go to the Committee for consideration, I will not put your Lordships to the trouble of dividing, but will accept the suggestion which has been made. I therefore ask leave to withdraw the Motion.<lb/>

[SECOND READING.] </title>
<p>Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p><member>*VISCOUNT HARDINGE:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, the object of this Bill, to which I ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading, is to prohibit the use of hop substitutes in the brewing and preservation of beer and the importation of hops except in bags pro

perly marked. In my advocacy of this Bill I wish to say most emphatically that I am not suggesting anything that savours of Protection; nor do I wish to introduce into this question anything which may be regarded as of a controversial party nature. My reason for introducing this Bill is that I live in the centre of the hop-growing district of Kent, and am daily brought face to face with the sad havoc and ruin which the present depression in the hop industry is making upon the once prosperous villages of the Garden of England.<lb/>
I have no wish, however, to dilate on the financial embarrassment&#x2014;in many cases absolute insolvency&#x2014;of many practical and industrious tenant-farmers and yeomen, with the consequent loss of wages and great increase of unemployment among agricultural labourers. This topic is humiliating to us who live in the hop-growing districts for this reason, that up to the present time nothing of a practical nature has been attempted in order to put an end to this deplorable state of things, although the whole of the hop industry is practically unanimous in regarding the position as one that could easily be mended if only His Majesty's Government would get to the root of the matter and recognise the causes of the depression and adopt the necessary remedies.<lb/>
Although my own personal experience is mainly derived from Kent, I know, and your Lordships are generally aware, that other hop-growing counties are suffering from the depression in the same degree. From Worcestershire, Herefordshire, Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire comes the same pitiable tale of grubbed hop gardens, unemployed labourers, and village tradesmen standing helplessly by whilst their businesses are drifting away from them. I venture to think that no one who is brought face to face with the existing condition of the hop-growing districts can fail to recognise the absolute importance of immediate steps being taken to put an end to such a depressing state of things, and prevent the destruction of what was once known as a great English industry, the maintenance of which I believe to be of vital importance to the people of this country. Of all classes, those who suffer most from the ruin of the hop industry are undoubtedly the pickers and the labourers, who are, very naturally,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0300"/>
<col>551</col>
now fast leaving the land. It will, therefore, be the labourers and the pickers who will derive the greatest benefits from the resuscitation of this industry. It is surely our duty to make it again possible for a large acreage of hops to be cultivated in this country, with the payment of a fair living wage and the realisation of a reasonable profit. If we can do this we shall have accomplished a great achievement, because it will have a considerable effect in bringing people back to the land. This is my primary object in appealing to your Lordships to give this Bill a second reading.<lb/>
The hops question was discussed in your Lordships' House in May of last year, when my noble friend Lord Addington moved the following resolution&#x2014;
"That the continued cultivation of the hop gardens of England is a matter of national concern, and that the present critical condition of the hop industry deserves the immediate attention of His Majesty's Government."
That resolution, as your Lordships remember, was unanimously agreed to. During that debate many interesting facts were brought to your Lordships' notice. The most reverend Primate, in a short speech, the eloquence and pathos of which I can assure him touched very deeply the hearts of those who are suffering so terribly from the depression in this trade, told us that&#x2014;
"having to be in touch day by day with the life of the Kentish owns and villages, he was simply aghast at the consternation which was then prevailing in the villages of Kent."
That was the position last May. If that was the position then, how much worse must it be to-day, for everything which has happened since has been of such a character as to intensify the depression, increase the ruin, and magnify the utter despondency which now hangs like a black impenetrable cloud over the whole of the hop-growing counties?<lb/>
In the course of the discussion last year Lord Eversley, who may be regarded as an expert on this question, having sat as chairman of a previous Hop Commission, told us that the hop acreage had been reduced for the last five years to 48,000 acres. I trust the noble Lord will forgive me for saying that the position then was even worse. From the official returns I find that in 1885 we cultivated in England no fewer than 71,327 acres; in 1907 the acreage was not

<col>552</col>
48,000, but 44,938. Last year's returns showed the astonishing decrease of 6,022 acres, bringing the acreage down to the ridiculously small total of 38,916, and I fear there is worse to follow. From the information constantly coming to my notice it is clear that the losses incurred by the hop growers last year were far worse than could possibly be imagined, with the result that another <i>d&#x00E9;b&#x00E1;cle</i> has taken place by means of the grubbing and destruction of hop gardens. What the acreage will prove to be from the next Government Return it would be difficult to say, but I am assured by an expert that it is not likely to exceed 30,000 acres.<lb/>
It has frequently been asserted that the depression is caused very largely by overproduction all over the world. In my humble opinion it is nothing of the kind. The truth of the matter is that we have underproduction in England and over-production elsewhere. If it were true that we had overproduction in this country, what excuse would there be for importing, by means of dumping, between. 200,000 and 300,000 cwt. of hops per year? I do not wish to pursue this point, because the Bill does not deal with dumping. This Bill is an honest attempt to assist a struggling and half-dead industry by the only means which still remain, His Majesty's Government having debarred what is generally considered to be the most certain and simple remedy&#x2014;namely, an import duty. For the same reason I wish to put aside for the time being the contentious question of an import duty, and have introduced this Bill. I believe I am right in saying that this Bill includes no principle which has not already been approved both by the Hop Commission and also by His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
When the hop deputation went before the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade last summer, Sir John Barker, who was one of the principal members of the Hop Commission, said, in introducing the deputation&#x2014;
"We want to prevent the use of hop substitutes, supplements, and preservatives; we also think that foreign hops should be marked, and we hope the Government will cause foreign hops to be distinguished the same as English hops in the future."
After discussion, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade agreed with everything that emanated from the hop deputation. I
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0301"/>
<col>553</col>
repeat that I have introduced this Bill solely with the desire to save from annihilation what I know from personal experience to be a dying industry, and one which can only be saved by the immediate application of the best remedies we have at hand to apply. Having unanimously agreed to the Motion proposed by Lord Addington in May of last year, I consider that we had a right to expect, more especially after the issue of the Report of the Hop Commission, and the promises given to the deputation which waited upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade, that a Bill would have been sent up to us dealing with this matter. As this has not been done and the only excuse given is one of time, it seems to me that we shall be doing a great service, not only to His Majesty's Government but also to the country by passing this measure, and thereby saving a great deal of precious time.<lb/>
There can be but little doubt that the country is not only ripe for legislation on this matter, but that by passing this Bill we shall be giving effect to the frequently-demonstrated will of the people. The series of meetings held last year throughout the hop-growing districts were unprecedented in the history of this country, and, as your Lordships are aware, they concluded with the absolutely unique demonstration in Trafalgar Square on what was called "Hop Saturday." I believe I am correct in asserting that that demonstration was a pattern of orderliness besides being an example of loyalty. After the resolution had been put from the different platforms and carried the massed bands played the National Anthem, and the tens of thousands of persons stood bare-headed and sang it not once but time after time. Because those people proved themselves to be an example of orderliness and loyalty are we to remain blind to their needs and deaf to their petitions? I say unquestionably, No.<lb/>
I wish to point out that this Bill is practically on the same lines as the Government Bill of last year. It differs only in one respect. This Bill is strengthened and made more practical, and, therefore, more useful. The Government Bill was undoubtedly weakened owing to its having to be introduced as an agreed Bill; and I believe it is generally understood that the
<col>554</col>
Bill as presented to the House of Commons was nothing more or less than a compromise, in which the best interests of the hop industry were sacrificed in order to save time and secure unanimity. Even then the unnecessary concessions that were made failed in their object. There were only two classes to conciliate&#x2014;first, such brewers as use hop substitutes in the brewing and preservation of beer; and, secondly, a few foreign merchants who deal in foreign hops. That these two small interests were powerful enough to prevent the House of Commons from passing the Bill was clearly proved by the fact that twenty-one Members put down Amendments of a wrecking nature, and the Bill, according to promise, was therefore withdrawn. We need not, I think, endeavour to legislate for a small minority of brewers who desire to use hop substitutes in brewing or to preserve their beer by chemicals in lieu of hops; nor should we sacrifice the interests of thousands of our own people who are indirectly interested&#x2014;there are many trades interested in the hop industry&#x2014;for those of a small handful of foreign dealers who desire to retain the advantages they at present enjoy by not being required to comply with the English marking restrictions. <lb/>
Was there ever a greater instance of injustice to the English grower? Immediately a foreigner lands on these shores he becomes amenable to our laws, and no exception is shown in his favour. I claim, therefore, that immediately a foreigner lands his hops in this country, those hops should be amenable to our laws, and no exception should be shown in their favour. If a hop grower in Sussex were to sell his produce to a brother grower in Kent, say, at Canterbury, the Canterbury grower is prevented by law from mixing the inferior Sussex hops with his own produce and selling at a good profit. But his foreign competitor, who is ruining both him and his industry, is absolutely free to mix and manipulate different grades and qualities of hops grown in different districts and very often in different countries, and is then allowed to ship them into England unmarked, undated, and absolutely free from any penalty whatever. I ask, again, is that fair, to the English growers? I consider it is a reproach to us that this preference to the foreigner has been allowed to exist so long, and, in all fairness to our English growers, the sooner it is put an end to the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0302"/>
<col>555</col>
better. That is one of the intentions of this Bill. <lb/>
The first part of the Bill deals with hop substitutes and all preservatives other than hops in the brewing and preservation of beer. The Government Bill of last year was not so clear. It did not mention preservatives, but only hop substitutes. There are, I believe, some interested people who argue that a chemical preservative is not a hop substitute. I submit that their contention is prejudiced and entirely wrong. The Hop Commission of 1890 laid down this fact, that&#x2014;
"One of the principal uses of the hop is to preserve the beer by preventing a renewal of fermentation during the time before it is fit for consumption."
Therefore I contend that anything which preserves beer other than hops must be a hop substitute. <lb/>
It has also been asserted that the use of preservatives is necessary for beer intended for export, but the fact that in Bavarian beer exported no preservative or hop substitute of any kind is permitted seems to me to contradict that assertion. It is well known that many brewers in this country at the present time make beer for export to hot climates without any preservative but hops. It is some years since chemists first began to introduce their system in some of our British breweries, and there is little doubt that at the present time they have got a great hold upon the manufacture of beer. It is also a fact that during that period there has been a gradually-diminishing consumption of hops per barrel of beer. How much it has decreased it is difficult to estimate, for there are no official returns further back than 1901; but from the official returns of that year the consumption was 2&#x00B7;02 lbs. of hops per barrel of beer, whilst in 1907 it had fallen to 1&#x00B7;85 lbs. per barrel, and I believe that during the same period the consumption of beer also declined by something like three million barrels per annum. This is a strange coincidence, and should prove a valuable object lesson to brewers. It is contended that this decrease in the use of hops has only been made possible by the use of preservatives other than hops; and the claim, of the grower, that all substitutes for hops should be prohibited, is consequently fair and just. I trust, therefore, that your Lordships will have no difficulty in accepting the clause dealing with the prohibition of preserva
<col>556</col>
tives. Such prohibition should meet with the approval of those who favour temperance, for it is surely preferable that beer-drinkers should be supplied with a pure vegetable beverage which has real value as a tonic and a food than run any risk of being drugged with a concoction of chemicals and minerals mixed up with the proper vegetable ingredients of a pure malt liquor. That these chemicals are utterly unnecessary can be proved by reference to the Bavarian beer laws.<lb/>
I now come to the clause in regard to marking. This clause simply ensures that foreign hops when landed at the different ports of the United Kingdom shall be marked with the same particulars&#x2014;no more and no less&#x2014;as are required in the case of English hops. This gives no preference to the English grower, but simply provides that the English grower and his foreign competitor shall trade in the United Kingdom on terms of absolute equality. This to my mind is treating the foreigner with the greatest generosity and liberality. To continue to give him exception in regard to marking would be grossly unfair to the English grower. Subsections 5, 6 and 7 of Clause 2 provide machinery for checking the marking of imported hops. These subsections did not appear in the Government Bill of last year, but it is generally felt that such machinery is necessary and should be provided. I would like to state that I have not had the assistance of a legal draftsman, and that if there are technical errors, as no doubt there are in the Bill, they can easily be adjusted in the Committee stage. I understand that His Majesty's Government have always fully intended to secure absolute equality in regard to marking. I therefore hope that the Government will support this Bill and provide facilities for rapidly passing it into law before it is too late.<lb/>
I am well aware that this Bill is not a complete remedy for the depression, for it will still leave a great grievance untouched; but it undoubtedly does provide a means of checking the annihilation of this industry by enforcing equal restrictions on the foreigner both with regard to marking and the mixing of hops, thus preventing the possibility of fraud. I believe it will have this other advantage, that it will increase the consumption of hops per barrel of beer. As I said
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0303"/>
<col>557</col>
just now, since 1901 the consumption of beer has decreased with the decreased use of hops. Therefore, an increased consumption of hops should result in an increased consumption of beer. Thus the brewers as well as the hop industry will benefit, and so also will the revenue. I trust that your Lordships will agree to pass this Bill, for then we shall have the gratification of knowing that we have done all that at present is in our power to save from absolute extinction what was once a great and thriving industry. Let us, therefore, not be drawn away from the object we have in view by any of those who may be interested, financially or otherwise, in maintaining the present grossly unfair conditions. Let us rather endeavour to amend the fortunes of what the President of the Board of Trade has described as a great and valuable industry, and thus give the best assistance we can to an energetic, long-suffering, and highly-deserving class of our fellow-countrymen. That is my object for asking your Lordships to give this Bill a Second Reading.<lb/>
<i>Moved,</i> That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Hardinge.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAU-CHAMP)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am sure your Lordships will endorse an expression of sympathy at the indisposition which keeps away the genial and popular President of the Board of Agriculture, in whose place I appear to state the position of His Majesty's Government in regard to this Bill. I am certain that the passages which fell from the noble Viscount with regard to the present condition of those interested in the hop industry and the depression in trade from which they are suffering will have found an echo on both sides of the House. I may, however, say that this depression does not exist in this country only. In America there is a great depression in the hop industry, and a large number of acres of hops have been grubbed up. The Consular reports show that in one of the states the acreage has been reduced by from 5,000 to 6,000 acres; in another by 2,500 acres, or some thirty or forty per cent.; and that some of the plantations in California are being rooted up this year.<lb/>
As to the history of this question, towards the end of last year a Bill dealing with the subject was introduced in another place by the Chancellor of the Exchequer;
<col>558</col>
but, owing to want of time, it was not dealt with. This year the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture speaking at Canterbury, said that the Bill was received more contentiously than he had anticipated. He added that:&#x2014;
"If no unreasonable expenditure of Parliamentary time was required, the Government would reintroduce the Bill, as they were still of opinion that the grievance was a real one and one which called urgently for redress."
Your Lordships are to-day asked to give a Second Reading to a Bill which, as the noble Viscount told the House, is substantially and practically the same as that which was introduced by His Majesty's Government last December. There are, however, one or two changes, but they are only of a Committee kind, and therefore I shall not venture to detain your Lordships by any reference to them at this moment.<lb/>
In these circumstances the noble Viscount was really preaching to those who were already converted. His Majesty's Government introduced a Bill last year, and have promised to re-introduce it in another place this year. Therefore the action of the noble Viscount, if he will allow me to say so, appears to me to be somewhat superfluous and likely to render legislation more difficult. There is an old phrase on the subject of dishing the Whigs. This seems to me an attempt on the part of the noble Viscount to obtain for those with whom he is associated some of the credit which is due to the authors of the Bill as originally introduced; and the resolutions which have been addressed to your Lordships&#x2014;I myself have received a large number&#x2014;asking you to support the Second Reading of this Bill, and holding up the noble Viscount as a saviour of the hop industry, represent an endeavour to ascribe to him merits which are due to His Majesty's Government, and to dress him in plumes borrowed from the Bill of last year.<lb/>
I am not quite sure that the full position of the hop industry, at any rate on material points, was brought before your Lordships. Like the noble Viscount I am interested in the hop industry. I am in the fortunate position, I am glad to say, of owning some farms on which hops are very largely cultivated, and I may say, in passing, that hop-growers are among the most prosperous of my farmers. I am not, therefore, quite so
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0304"/>
<col>559</col>
hopeless in regard to the future of the industry as is the noble Viscount. But there have been certain changes to which I think it is only fair to refer. The first one was only touched upon by the noble Viscount, and then in a different regard. In the first place, fewer hops are used in this country now than in times gone by. Since 1901 there has been a constant diminution in the quantity of hops used in this country, the quantity having fallen in that period from 648,000 cwt. to 571,000 cwt. That, of course, is due in a large measure to a decrease in the quantity of beer brewed; and I am sure that those members of your Lordships' House who are anxious for an increase in temperance in this country would welcome the fact of a reduction in the quantity of beer consumed if they could be assured that it meant that those who had been drinking too much drank less now.<lb/>
The introduction of cold-storage also has had a great effect upon the industry. It is a matter of common knowledge to all who are interested in the hop industry that the difference in price between one year and another is very large indeed, perhaps larger in regard to this industry than any other connected with agriculture. Cold storage has made a great deal of difference. It is possible in a year of surplus, when hops are cheap, to buy them up at a low price, keep them in cold storage, and use them the following year. In those circumstances, when there are not so many hops it is only natural that brewers should draw upon their reserve in cold storage.<lb/>
There is another interesting point to which I should like to draw attention. I refer to the quantity of hops imported into this country. There is, of course, the point that you must use a certain quantity of foreign hops because they give a special flavour which some people demand; but it is interesting to notice that the average ratio of home produce to the total supply of hops during the fifteen years 1886&#x2013;1900 was seventy-two per cent., and for the years of the current century it is exactly the same. That seems to show that the demand for the home produce is the same, and that probably there is not such great distress in the industry as the noble Viscount suggested. The quantity of hops imported is also diminishing. During the ten years 1867&#x2013;76 it averaged, in round
<col>560</col>
figures 202,000 cwt.; in the following ten years the annual average was 215,000 cwt.; in the next decennial period it fell to 194,000 cwt., and in the ten years 1897-1906 it went down to 186,000 cwt. I am really unwilling to trouble your Lordships with further figures on this subject, because obviously it is very difficult to follow complicated figures in the course of a speech in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
And, after all, there is no practical difference between the noble Viscount and myself. His Majesty's Government are willing that this Bill should be read a Second Time, but, of course, they are in the usual position of thinking that their own bantling is better than anybody else's, that their own Bill is probably better than that which any other person might introduce. In those circumstances, while the Government will offer no opposition to the Second Reading of the Bill, if it is read a Second Time the noble Viscount must not expect that the Government will take any part in passing his Bill. The position will be as it was before this Bill was introduced. The Government will reintroduce their Bill in another place, and they hope that it will meet with acceptance from both sides before the end of the session.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I have not found it quite easy to follow the arguments of the noble Earl as regards the action of His Majesty's Government in this matter. He told us that the noble Viscount had been preaching to the converted. In some branches of human teaching we believe that conversion is ordinarily followed by action. Action in this particular case, however, has not at present been forthcoming, although the noble Earl has told us that a promise had been given that under certain conditions the Government might introduce such a Bill into the House of Commons again. Is there any practical difficulty in passing the Bill which is before your Lordships and in the Government's affording it facilities in the other House? Those are, however, mysteries into which I do not wish to penetrate; but I cannot understand why it should hinder the matter that a Bill in identically the same terms should have the advantage of passing through this House.<lb/>
I always feel in a difficulty in speaking upon this subject, because three branches
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0305"/>
<col>561</col>
of knowledge are concerned in the question&#x2014;agriculture, brewing, and finance, and I know little about the first, nothing about the second, and little about the third. I cannot profess to be an expert in the slightest degree on any of the three, and therefore I find it exceedingly hard to weigh or to appraise at their proper value the conflicting statements that are made. But I do know something of Kent. The noble Viscount has recalled to the House certain words that I ventured to say last year on this subject. The only change I would make in those words would be to add that the difficulties are not only not diminishing but are certainly increasing day by day in not a few of the villages and country places throughout Kent. The condition of affairs is pressing with extreme hardship on labourers and farmers, and, presumably, to some extent upon landlords; and I confess that the words used last year by the President of the Board of Agriculture as to the matter being one of national concern and deserving immediate attention seem to me to be more imperatively true now than when the noble Earl spoke.<lb/>
I did not quite understand the noble Earl the Lord Steward to-night when he said that probably there was not so much distress in this industry as the noble Viscount opposite supposed. I cannot speak for England as a whole, but I can speak for Kent, and I may say that it is not a matter of conjecture at all but a question of stern, hard, daily fact before the eyes of every one who has anything to do with the county. I believe I am right in saying that last year 4,194 acres were grubbed in Kent, and those who are able to form an anticipation for this year estimate that 3,000 acres are likely to be grubbed. That means not merely a change of industry, but a practical cessation of employment for a large number of people and practical ruin to those who have invested their money in this branch of industry.<lb/>
To give a practical instance, I will take a certain parish of which I have intimate knowledge. There are five considerable farms in that particular parish. One of these, to the great advantage of the neighbourhood, is held and worked by a gentleman whose interest in the well-being of the people is such that, avowedly and obviously at a great loss, he continues to run this
<col>562</col>
hop farm on the ground that were he to cease to do so he would be throwing out of employment a large number of people. Not only so, but he enables one of his neighbours to do the like. The person working the next farm found it impossible to carry it on any longer, there being a steady deficit now from year to year. In connection with the next farm no rent has been paid to the landlord for the last three or four years, owing to the difficulties in making it up; and in the fifth case in this one parish the land has been grubbed, and the farm made into a fruit farm, employing a mere handful of people as compared with the large number formerly engaged. Those are tangible cases. And when we speak of those who are thus employed on the land, we cannot forget that large class who year by year are engaged in the hop-picking industry.<lb/>
We are face to face with a situation that calls for attention, and, if possible, for remedy. It is quite apparent from the facts that a great historic English industry is perishing. If we were told that that was a disaster which must happen owing to a change in our conditions and that certain people must necessarily suffer in consequence, I suppose we would have to shrug our shoulders and put up with it. But if we are told, as we have been told, that it can be remedied, without departing from any economic or industrial law, by certain enactments which are set forth in this Bill, it is obligatory on us all to endeavour to make those enactments law and thus attempt to stem, at any rate, so grave a disaster as is now imminent, if it has not actually taken place.<lb/>
As to the temperance aspect of the question, if it be said that what has recently happened has merely been that three million fewer barrels of beer have been drunk during a certain number of recent years, I am not prepared to say that I should regard that as an unmitigated disaster. But I am told that it is not that people are drinking less than they did before, but that they are transferring their attention to spirits instead of beer, and therefore the evil is a very real one. Not merely are those who produce the beer suffering, but those who are consuming the other form of liquid instead are likely also to be harmed. But when I examine into the facts I am unable to accept that explanation. I looked to-day at the speech of the Prime Minister in introducing
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0306"/>
<col>563</col>
the Budget of last year. Mr. Asquith said&#x2014;
"On the other hand, the decline in productivity of the alcoholic group of Customs duties has been maintained. Foreign spirits show a falling off of &#x00A3;80,000 compared with the receipts of the previous year, and of &#x00A3;47,000 as compared with the Budget estimate in the year just ended.&#x2026; An increase of &#x00A3;153,000 was anticipated from beer, of which only one-half has been realised. Instead of an increase of &#x00A3;110,000 from British spirits, there is a decrease of &#x00A3;90,000.&#x2026; Although beer in 1907-8 continued to improve, the total revenue from beer, wine, and spirits combined shows a decrease of &#x00A3;151,000."
That does not fit in with the argument that British spirits or foreign spirits are being consumed in lieu of the beer which is not being drunk. I do not myself lay particular stress in favour of this Bill on the argument that the necessity for it is great owing to less beer being drunk. Before I regarded that as an unmitigated disaster I should have to be shown that something else was being drunk which was more injurious. But that is by the way.<lb/>
It is quite apparent that a great historic English industry is perishing in certain parts, that the workers are reduced to the lowest ebb, and that many of them, particularly those who are advanced in years, can turn to nothing else. I again say that if we are told that this can be, if not altogether prevented, at all events diminished by legislation which seems to be absolutely fair and just and to interfere with no industrial law at all, then I do most heartily hope that we shall give effect to it. The remedies proposed by the Bill are, as I understand, first, that by dealing with what are called hop substitutes and the like we are going to ensure that the ingredients of the particular beverage consumed are beforehand known and described; that is to say, that a beverage is not being sold under one name which is something different from what the consumer believes it to be. That seems to me to correspond with our idea of what is fair and right, and if that is the result of the clauses which deal with substitutes, then I hope those clauses may come into law as speedily as possible.<lb/>
The second principle involved in the Bill seems to me also a thoroughly sound one, that we must take care that imported hops are not placed at an advantage compared with home-grown hops by being exempted from certain rules which apply to hops grown in England. If it be true that the sale of foreign hops is facilitated in this
<col>564</col>
country to the detriment of home-grown hops, that seems to me to be something which in common fairness, apart altogether from questions of tariff, ought to be prevented forthwith, and that I understand to be the aim of the second limb of the noble Viscount's Bill. If this Bill is, as it seems to me, practically identical with the Bill for which the Government have already accepted responsibility, nothing but good wishes ought to accompany its passage through this House, and I earnestly hope your Lordships will give it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>*THE LORD BISHOP OF HEREFORD:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, in response to a very earnest appeal from the hop-growers in Herefordshire and Worcestershire, I rise to support this Bill, and I desire to say with what great satisfaction I have heard that the Government and the noble Viscount who moved the Second Reading are practically at one on the subject. Therefore we have very good hope that the Bill may be placed on the Statute Book during the course of the present session. I may say that if I had understood that this Bill in any way contravened the principles of Free Trade I should have felt bound to oppose it, because I have no belief that any benefits will accrue to our working population from the doctrines of Protection; and I sincerely hope, on behalf of the agricultural population and the working classes with whom I come in contact, that we may have no fundamental changes in that respect during my lifetime. I hope, indeed, that the present arrangement may last as long as the Bench of Bishops.<lb/>
I am informed by those directly interested in the question in my part of England that this Bill, if passed, would bring very material benefits to them, and certainly the main provisions of it seem to me to be altogether reasonable. We should all agree, I think, that it is only reasonable that the foreign hop-grower should be put in the same position as the British grower of hops, and I understand that the English farmer asks for no more than to be put on terms of equality with his foreign competitor. Even if the Bill passes, however, there are many farmers who are not quite sure that they will be put on terms of absolute equality, because I am told that preferential railway rates are given to some of the imported hops over British hops. As an outsider, ignorant of the details, I
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0307"/>
<col>565</col>
cannot but feel that if this is the true position of the case then the treatment is unfair.<lb/>
As to the prohibition of the use of hop substitutes, I think we are only expressing what must be the almost universal view that what is called beer should be what the ordinary English consumer understands when he asks for beer&#x2014;namely, a drink made from malt and hops. It seems to me a perfectly reasonable proposition that if any brewers make their product from a concoction of different materials it should be made plain to the consumer what it is he is really drinking. I have, of course, no means of knowing whether it would be easy or difficult to carry out any such distinction; but I do think that when a licence is given for the sale of drink we should so far protect the consumer that he may know what it is that is sold to him under that licence. Therefore I am very glad to find that, so far as present indications go, there is good hope of this Bill passing into law.<lb/>
Whether our farmers will derive all the benefit they anticipate from the provisions of this measure I am not altogether sanguine, because, as the noble Earl the Lord Steward reminded us, there are other causes, such as the new system of cold storage, which keep down the price of hops. Personally I would not be at all sorry to see a large number of acres in the Herefordshire and Worcestershire district change from the growing of hops, say, to the breeding of Hereford cattle. My belief is that if the farmers were to gradually adopt that process of change they might find themselves in a much more prosperous condition than they have been hitherto. I am not sure also that the plea is well founded that the change would necessarily mean a lessening of labour and increase of unemployment. At any rate, if there is any danger of this kind I think the county councils might to a very considerable extent meet it by increasing the facilities for obtaining small holdings. One of the things that have surprised me of late has been the slowness of our county councils in giving facilities to thrifty and rising labourers to obtain small holdings. If our hop farms have to be grubbed, then I hope that at any rate some portion of them may be occupied by the best of the labourers now employed upon them, but occupied by them as small holders, forming
<col>566</col>
the nucleus, let us say, of a new English yeomanry. I beg to support the Bill, and to express the hope that your Lordships will give it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, in rising to address your Lordships on this question I feel that I must ask for your indulgence. But though I have no direct acquaintance, like my noble friend behind me and the most reverend Primate, with Kent, I have an indirect connection with that county which has given me an opportunity of appreciating the present serious depression in the hop district and the hardships occasioned thereby. On those grounds I venture to say a few words in support of this Bill.<lb/>
My noble friend, in the course of his speech, denied that the provisions of the Bill embodied any tendency of a Protectionist character. I support the Bill most cordially on that account. From the earliest days of the proposed reform of our fiscal system I have never held views of a Protectionist character; on the contrary, I have advanced cautiously while following the lead of Mr. Balfour, whose policy in this respect has been explained clearly and lucidly in the various speeches he has made on this subject. But on frequent occasions in various parts of the country, where my attention had been called to any individual industry being injuriously and unjustly treated by unfair competition, I have indicated that I would gladly support any legislation which would remove the injustice and the injury, provided that no injury was caused to any other industry. On this account I think that I am perfectly consistent in supporting this measure.<lb/>
This Bill is almost identical with the measure introduced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the end of the autumn session last year. The noble Earl the Lord Steward described my noble friend in charge of this Bill as preaching to the converted, but I do not think that was absolutely accurate. If he were preaching to the converted, I should like to ask a member of the Ministerial Bench on what ground the important measure introduced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer was not carried into law. It was defeated, I imagine, owing to the machinations of certain supporters of His Majesty's Government who sit on the back Benches of the other House, and who, through overwhelming it with Amendments,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0308"/>
<col>567</col>
ran the time so very fine that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I will not say he was anxious to do so, but, perhaps, not to annoy his supporters, took the opportunity of withdrawing the Bill. These opponents of the measure were in effect extreme temperance reformers and extreme Free Traders; and I would like to know what were the reasons which animated these sections of the Government's supporters in hindering the progress of the Bill on that occasion.<lb/>
I confess I am at a loss to understand why temperance reformers should wish to crush the Bill, because, however much they might advocate temperance, I should have thought they would like to know that the beer which was being consumed was perfectly pure beer and not made of hop substitutes. As to the extreme Free Traders, they probably entertained some suspicion of their leaders in bringing forward this proposal dealing with hops, and because it seemed to embody a violation of their pure fiscal theories. I am equally at a loss to understand how the question of Free Trade comes into this measure at all. The object of the Bill is to establish absolute equality of treatment in the hop industry. Since 1866 the British hop-grower has been required to mark every package of his produce with his own name, the name of the parish in which the hops were grown, the year of growth, the gross weight and serial number; while the hops imported from abroad escape such marking. If all hops were marked there could be no question of passing off hops of an inferior quality as something better than they were; and noble Lords opposite will not deny that that can be done in the present state of things. If the restrictions are necessary for hops grown in this country, why are they not necessary for hops that are imported? I should like to have an answer to that question.<lb/>
What is proposed in this Bill is analogous to the legislation passed during the past few years which has equalised the conditions with respect to foreign watches, foreign patents, and foreign ships. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, when he received a deputation on this subject, said:&#x2014;
"Whatever conditions you impose upon the British grower should be imposed also upon the foreign grower. That is not a departure from Free Trade."
He went on to say&#x2014;
<col>568</col>
"I have legislated in three Bills&#x2014;foreign watches, foreign patents, and foreign ships&#x2014;each imposing on the foreigner the same conditions as are imposed on the British trader. Therefore I am not afraid of that."
Having spoken so strongly on this subject, I ask again, Why did Mr. Lloyd-George not carry through his Bill at the end of last year? I am not going into the question of preservatives, but it is somewhat curious to contend that hop substitutes should not be allowed in the brewing of beer but should be allowed in the preservation of beer. It seems to me that if damage is done by the one process, the use of substitutes in the preserving of beer is equally damaging. But I will not dwell on that.<lb/>
I believe that what does most harm to the hop industry is the non-marking of foreign hops. The Committee which sat on the matter reported very strongly with regard to this, and also with regard to the use of hop substitutes in the brewing and preservation of beer. Therefore, if the Government are going to bring in a Bill on this subject they ought to lay great weight on the findings of the Committee regarding those points. Undoubtedly if hops are used instead of substitutes the beer produced will be a much purer article, and the health of the beer-drinking population of the country will benefit. I wish to lay stress on the danger of allowing an important industry in which a vast number of people are employed&#x2014;the chief industry of a district&#x2014;to be ruined for the want of a certain amount of legislation.<lb/>
The noble Earl the Lord Steward consoled himself by saving that the hop industry has suffered equally badly in other countries. That is no consolation whatever. No doubt all industries and all trades must be prepared for depression; but the hop industry has suffered most severely. I read a speech a short time ago delivered at Canterbury by the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture, whose absence and still more the cause we deeply regret, in which he attributed the depression in the hop industry in Kent to various causes. All these were, if I may use the expression, the fortune of war; but you can do something to prevent still further depreciation by putting British and foreign hops on an equality. When we consider the general depression in trade and the number of people now unemployed, I think the House will consider that it is the bounden
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0309"/>
<col>569</col>
duty of the Government to take every step they possibly can to prevent the evil of unemployment and trade depression becoming greater. It is because I know the feeling of terror which exists at the present moment among the large populations dependent on the hop industry that I give this Bill my cordial support.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>*LORD STANLEY OF ALDERLEY:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I hope your Lordships will allow me to say one or two words from a point of view which seems to me to have been entirely neglected&#x2014;the point of view, broadly speaking, of Free Trade. The noble Viscount who introduced this Bill told us that though this was a palliative, he would be satisfied with nothing as a real remedy except a large duty on imported hops; and there is no doubt that what is underlying the minds of those who are keeping up this agitation is the establishment of a protective duty on British hops.<lb/>
The right reverend Prelate who spoke on behalf of Herefordshire drifted along in this advocacy which has the essential point of Protectionism&#x2014;namely, the advocacy of legislation in the interests of the producer and not in the interests of the consumer. He went in the direction of what is known as the Pure Beer Bill, and proposed to strike at the root of what was the concordat between Mr. Gladstone and the brewers when he abolished the malt tax and established the free mash tub. If his argument was sincere about wishing the drinker to know what he was drinking, he ought to prohibit the use of sugar, rice, and maize in brewing. The most reverend Primate told us, first of all, that it was contended that the diminution in the consumption of beer was transferred into an increase in the consumption of spirits. Then afterwards he told us that the revenue figures showed that there had been a diminution in the consumption of spirits, whereas there had been a slight increase in the amount realised from beer. Therefore the most reverend Primate need not have said that the matter was in the region of hypothesis; he got into the region of ascertained fact from the revenue returns.<lb/>
I was glad to hear the noble Marquess opposite declare his adhesion to Free Trade, but I did not feel very much comforted when he said that he was perfectly satisfied with the Free Trade principles so lucidly expounded by his Parliamentary leader.
<col>570</col>
The service which the noble Marquess rendered with his lips to Free Trade does not give me perfect confidence as to the way in which he would apply those principles when the time should come for putting them into operation. On this Bill we have had a little too much of the Codlin and Short business from the two front Benches. Each side has been anxious to defend the hop-growers and to show that a microscope would be necessary to distinguish the difference between the noble Viscount's Bill and the Bill of the Government. I do not agree. So far as the marking of foreign hops is concerned I do not see any objection to that, although I cannot help thinking that the gain to the English producer would not be very great. In the first place, as every English pocket of hops has to be marked it is clear that any pocket which appears on the market unmarked is branded as foreign. In the second place, I suppose the people who purchase hops are almost exclusively brewers, who have competent and experienced buyers. As I have said I do not see any objection to that part of the Bill.<lb/>
To the other parts of the Bill, however, I do see serious objections, even to the part which the Government have expressed their willingness to support&#x2014;namely, the prohibition of the use of hop substitutes for the flavouring or bittering of beer. We have all received a circular from an interest which aroused a great deal of sympathy in this House last year but which has aroused no sympathy on this occasion. They state, among their reasons against the Bill, that its object is to compel them to use a great deal more hops than they use at the present time. I call that the essence of Protection. To force people to use something they would not otherwise use in order to increase the consumption of that article seems to me economically unsound. The Society issuing the circular to which I have referred state that the staple beer of the country is mild ale, and that if more than a certain proportion of hops were used the flavour would be rendered more dry and bitter, and this alteration would not suit the palates of their customers. They give other reasons, such as the fining and clearing of beer, against the large use of hops and in favour of the use of preservatives; and I cannot help regretting that no member of your Lordships' House connected with the great interest of brewing
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0310"/>
<col>571</col>
has come forward to enlighten the House in regard to any of those matters. It is all very well to express genial sympathy with a particular industry, but it is quite another thing to embark gaily upon a course of legislation, the root principle of which is, to my mind, thoroughly unsound&#x2014;namely, to interfere between the consumer and the producer in order to favour the producer.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I do not rise for the purpose of prolonging this debate, but merely to make a suggestion to the noble Earl who spoke for the Government, in answer to a remark which fell from him. The idea which appeared to be uppermost in the noble Earl's mind, so far as I could gather from his speech, was this&#x2014;Who is to have the credit of dealing with this matter? It is very unfair, he said, that Lord Hardinge should step in and take from the Government credit which properly belongs to them, they having given notice that if they have an opportunity they will at some time or another introduce a Bill in the other House. I merely wish to point out to the noble Earl that there is an obvious course by which he can obtain the credit he appears to desire, and that is by introducing the Government Bill in this House. The noble Viscount will, I suppose, have his Bill read a second time to-day; but, if the Government are in earnest, as no doubt they are, in desiring to pass a Bill on this matter, why do not they introduce their Bill in this House? It certainly cannot, as we all know, be introduced in the other House for at all events a considerable time; but in this House we are not particularly pressed for business, and I am sure that your Lordships would be perfectly ready to give the Government Bill a Second Reading and to consider it at a later stage <i>pari, passu</i> with the Bill of the noble Viscount. It seems to me that that is a very obvious course for the Government to follow if they really desire to push this matter forward.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD HINDLIP:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I should not have intervened in this debate but for the fact that I have been inundated with letters from hop-growers and others interested in the hop industry, and also that last summer when the noble Earl, Lord Carrington, was speaking on the subject he rather left me under the impression that he did not consider that the hop industry in Wor
<col>572</col>
cester was in a very depressed condition. As regards the Bill itself, I believe it will do something for the farmer, though probably not so much as some people anticipate. I do not think anything short of a 40s. duty on hops will be really sufficient to bring about the desired change; but on the principle that half a loaf is better than no bread I shall give my vote in support of my noble friend's Bill.<lb/>
Hop substitutes are not nearly so much used as is supposed. A director of one of the biggest breweries told me this morning that, so far as he was concerned, he would be very glad if hop substitutes were entirely prohibited, and I do not think the prohibition will meet with much opposition from the trade. Brewers have been accused from time immemorial of using chemicals deleterious to health, from deadly poisons downwards, in the brewing of beer, and some of your Lordships may remember that many years ago they were accused of putting strychnine in beer to make it bitter. As to preservatives, I think that is a different matter. For the export trade preservatives are, I understand, considered almost indispensable, and perhaps some amendment of the Bill in this particular may be made in Committee. If preservatives in beer are prohibited, I hope my noble friend or someone else will see that the same prohibition is applied to so-called non-intoxicating liquors such as ginger-beer, in the manufacture of which I understand preservatives are even more largely used.<lb/>
Farmers in Worcestershire are very anxious for this Bill, or some Bill like it, to be passed. In Worcestershire the hops are gathered by pickers from the Black Country, and the prosperity of the hop industry is very vital to the poor people in those districts. One gentleman who farms some eighty acres of hop-land has stated that unless some legislation is passed for the benefit of the industry he will have to abandon further cultivation. He estimates that his wages-bill will be reduced by &#x00A3;1,000 a year, in addition to some &#x00A3;600 which he pays to hop-pickers and other <i>employ&#x00E9;s.</i> In one parish in Worcestershire there are ten farms on which during the last few years hop-growing has been altogether given up, with consequent loss to the labouring class. If the farmers in Worcestershire have to give up growing hops, not only will more harm be done to an already decaying industry, but additional people in the Black

Country will be thrown out of employment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY (LORD FITZMAURICE)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, this discussion has ranged over a rather larger field than that which is contained within the four corners of the Bill before your Lordships. Of that I make no complaint, because all the topics which have been mentioned are, though not perhaps absolutely and strictly relevant to the proposals in the Bill, so nearly connected that it was not unnatural that noble Lords, especially those coming from the hop-growing districts of this country, should have dwelt upon them.<lb/>
The most reverend Primate, for example, alluded to the question of whether or not the diminution in the production of beer in this country, to which attention was so strongly called in the Report of the Committee of last year, has or has not been accompanied by a corresponding decrease, or something approaching to a corresponding decrease, in the consumption of spirits; and he pointed out that, however much we may mourn over the troubles of the producers of hops, we might at least console ourselves with the fact that it implied a diminution in the consumption of liquors generally. That is a very large question, and I do not propose to go into it in any detail; but from such figures as I have been able to obtain, I am bound to say that it does appear that there has been not only a diminution, as was pointed out by the Committee, in the barrelage of beer brewed in the United Kingdom, but also in the consumption of spirits. In regard to the barrelage of beer, I find that whereas in 1898 it was thirty-five millions, it had sunk in 1906 to just under thirty-four millions. In regard to spirits, whereas in 1898 there was a consumption of 41,700,000 gallons, in 1906 the consumption had sunk to a fraction above thirty-nine million gallons. That shows that there has been a gratifying diminution in what are generally called the drinking habits of the population; but that series of facts, highly interesting as they are, is, strictly speaking, outside the immediate purview of the Bill.<lb/>
I am more concerned to try to answer one or two of the points raised especially by the noble Marquess opposite, who asked me a few questions in regard to the position of the Government. I am bound to say that I thought some of his questions were
<col>574</col>
a little peculiar. He called upon me and my noble friends who sit by me, who are members of the Government, to explain the reasons of the opposition to the Government Bill in the House of Commons last year. It is not the business of His Majesty's Government to explain the reasons of the opposition to one of their own Bills. We are responsible for the Bill; we are not responsible for the opposition. We regret that there was opposition. We wish it had been otherwise. I am really not, strictly speaking, called upon to explain the reasons of that opposition, and I am bound to say that, if part of it arose from the temperance party, I am at a loss to understand why any member of the temperance party should object to this Bill. Having been a supporter of temperance measures the whole of my political life, it seems to me that, to a temperance advocate, as long as a man drinks beer or spirits it cannot signify whether the liquor drunk is made from foreign or home-grown hops. As temperance men naturally we would object equally; and I am bound to say that I was not aware that the opposition which did spring up, no doubt, and which was alluded to by my noble friend Lord Carrington in a speech in Kent quite early in this year, was a temperance opposition.<lb/>
No doubt some members of the House of Commons considered that the Bill was a derogation from the strict principles of Free Trade as they understood them. There it is my misfortune, and that of other members of the Government, to differ from a certain number of our political friends. It appears to me, speaking on behalf of the Government, that the essential doctrine of Free Trade is that where you have to levy, for example, a Customs duty you must levy in the case of articles which can be produced at home a corresponding Excise duty, and in that way obtain equality. I accept the doctrine laid down, that the essential idea of Free Trade in its practical application is the doctrine of equality; and provisions merely intended to secure the purity of an article or to prevent fraud cannot in any way be described as a derogation from the principles of Free Trade as hitherto understood by the great bulk of the supporters of Free Trade in this country. I am quite aware that we have been accused, in regard to legislation relative to patents, to the law relating to shipping, and to the manufacture of watches, of derogating from Free Trade:
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0312"/>
<col>575</col>
but I am quite unable to see in what way any of those measures is a derogation from Free Trade, because in all three cases you preserve absolute equality; you simply say that the law which you apply to your own home industries shall, so far as these things are applicable, be applied to the foreigner.<lb/>
Now I come to what is the principal matter before the House. In the first place, is the condition of things so serious as has been alleged? I am the last person to underrate the anxiety and in some districts&#x2014;especially, I believe, in Kent&#x2014;the suffering which certain classes of the population, especially the poorer classes who have depended upon hop-picking, have experienced and are experiencing; but, on the other hand, it must be borne in mind that in certain other districts of England the condition of things is not nearly so serious. We have heard a great deal, in the course of this discussion, of Worcestershire and Herefordshire. We have it from the Report of the Committee that in these counties a somewhat different state of things obtains. The Committee say&#x2014;
"Up to 1901 the acreage under hops had in these two counties been maintained, and the reduction in hop land had been from 11,000 odd acres in 1901 to 9,000 odd acres in 1907.&#x2026; There are more acres under hops in Herefordshire and Worcestershire than was the case thirty years ago."
That paragraph shows that in this area, which perhaps next to Kent is the most important hop area in the country, the state of things is not nearly so serious, and that in Worcestershire and Herefordshire there has been a slight increase in the total acreage under hop cultivation as compared with thirty years ago. Nevertheless, the condition of things is serious enough to make the Government wish to do whatever they can.<lb/>
We have no intention whatever of taking any step in the direction, which, I am afraid, judging from this debate, is desired by some noble Lords opposite, of putting a duty upon foreign hops. But, short of that, any reasonable proposals, such as those which arise from the Report of the Committee, the government are anxious and willing to consider; and I may remind your Lordships that the President of the Board of Agriculture, whose absence and the reason we all deplore, has actually this year given a distinct and specific pledge at a meeting at
<col>576</col>
Canterbury that the Bill will be reintroduced. His words were&#x2014;
"Last year, at the end of the session, Mr. Asquith brought in a Bill. As regarded that Bill, it certainly was more contentiously received than they anticipated, but he would say that if no unreasonable expenditure of Parliamentary time was required, the Government would reintroduce the Bill&#x2014;"
that was a specific pledge&#x2014;
"as they were still of opinion that the grievance was a real one, and one which called urgently for redress."<lb/>
The noble Lord opposite, Lord Camperdown, asked what was not at all an unnatural question. He inquired the position and intention of the Government, and why it was than the Government Bill could not be introduced in this House. I am in a position to say, that had my noble friend Lord Carrington been here this evening, he would have been able to give an undertaking that the matter was receiving the friendly consideration of the Government, and that there was every probability that he would be able to meet the wishes of my noble friend and other noble Lords by introducing the Bill in your Lordships' House. But I would prefer that your Lordships should receive that pledge from him or from my noble friend the Lord Privy Seal, who is also absent this evening. I can, however, say that the matter is receiving the attention of the Government, and I have every hope that the Lord Privy Seal will be able to give a distinct assurance to your Lordships on this subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>*THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I think my noble friend Lord Hardinge is to be congratulated upon having provoked an interesting discussion, and one which must on the whole have been extremely satisfactory to him, because in none of the speeches to which I have listened have I detected any attempt seriously to shake the position which my noble friend assumed. He was, it is true, taken to task at the outset by the noble Earl who spoke first for the Government for having, I think the expression was, arrayed himself in the plumes of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I am not sure that the simile was a particularly appropriate one, because nothing could have exceeded the modesty of my noble friend's statement. Let me venture to point out this, that if any plumes had been appropriated, the plumes are those which were furnished by the Committee, and it
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0313"/>
<col>577</col>
would be just as fair to charge the Chancellor of the Exchequer with decorating himself with the plumes of the Committee as to charge my noble friend with doing anything of the kind.<lb/>
Then my noble friend was also asked why, considering that His Majesty's Government had pledged themselves to legislate upon this subject, he had thought proper to introduce a Bill in your Lordships' House. I think it must have occurred to my noble friend's mind that the Bill of His Majesty's Government was not pressed with any very great earnestness last year, and I think it may have occurred to him that that Bill, resembling perhaps certain battleships of which we have heard a good deal during the last few days, may not have been destined to be produced exactly at the moment when we should have been most glad to see it produced. I understand that no opposition will be offered to the Second Reading of this Bill, and I do not see how, after the debate which took place in this House last year, it would be possible for us to resist the Second Reading. Upon that occasion, as the House will recollect, an overwhelming case was made out to show the piteous and deplorable condition into which the hop industry had fallen, and there was a general feeling all through the House that if anything could be done to improve matters for those interested in that industry it should be attempted.<lb/>
But last year we were told, and told with very great propriety, that His Majesty's Government had lately appointed a Committee to investigate the whole matter, and we were invited to wait for the Report of the Committee. That was a reasonable request; we have waited for the Report of the Committee, and the Bill of my noble friend is founded upon that Report. It does not attempt to deal with those controversial questions which arise in connection with proposals for the imposition of an import duty upon hops. Even if my noble friend the President of the Board of Agriculture, whose absence and its cause we all of us sincerely regret, had been present we should not have been able to-night to discuss with him whether as he suggested to us last year, an import duty on hops was or was not a tax on the food of the people. The Report of the Committee shows, what I think was evident to most of us last year, that this is by no means a very simple case, and that the present position of the
<col>578</col>
hop industry is due not to any one cause on which you can put your finger, but to a combination of causes, and that it is extremely difficult to assign to each of those causes the exact amount of importance which is due to it. There is the effect of foreign competition, there is the effect of increasing temperance, there is the effect of the more economical use of hops and of the more intensive cultivation of the hop gardens, and last, but not least&#x2014;because this really seems to me to be almost the most important cause of all&#x2014;there is the effect of the introduction of cold storage, which undoubtedly must have prevented hop-growers from reaping, as they used to reap, great advantage from an exceptionally abundant harvest of hops.<lb/>
In those circumstances we have two recommendations, and two recommendations only, before us&#x2014;the proposal to prohibit hop substitutes and the proposal to require hops to be marked. As to the use of substitutes, I am content to shelter myself behind the Report of the Committee, who seem to have gone very fully into that question. I understand them to advise that these substitutes are somewhat rarely used and not by the large brewers; but they do point out, on the other hand, that prohibition may not have the whole effect expected of it, because if substitutes are used now, it is not believed that they displace a very large quantity of hops. Up to that point I see no difficulty in accepting the advice of the Committee. But I confess that, in regard to the inclusion of preservatives&#x2014;a point on which the Bill of my noble friend differs from the Bill of His Majesty's Government&#x2014;I should like to hear a little more evidence before I commit myself to any definite view. We are told that it is believed by many that preservatives are, on the one hand, innocuous, and, on the other hand, indispensable to the manufacture of certain kinds of beer. I understand that the four principal firms of Burton all use preservatives. One question certainly will arise if we seek to prohibit the use of preservatives, which is this&#x2014;shall we be able to prohibit the use of preservatives in the manufacture of beer without going into the question of the use of preservatives in the case of other kinds of foodstuffs? There is no doubt that a large quantity of foodstuffs is at present made up with preservatives of some kind. With regard to marking, I think that, if English growers of hops are required to mark their goods, it is just and
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0314"/>
<col>579</col>
right that the importers of foreign hops should have their goods marked in a corresponding manner. It is surely desirable that a brewer who prefers to use British hops&#x2014;I am told they do not all prefer to use them&#x2014;should be able to ascertain at once from the appearance of a package whether the hops it contains are British or foreign. I say, therefore, that this Bill has my best wishes. I freely confess that I am not sanguine enough to believe that it will revolutionise the hop industry; but it may do something, and whatever we can do I think we ought to do. To my mind the most important result that has arisen from the discussion of this question is that we have elicited from the Chancellor of the Exchequer a perfectly distinct assurance upon what I conceive to be a question of policy of the very highest importance&#x2014;an assurance to the effect that any conditions now imposed upon British producers should be imposed upon foreign producers of the same commodity.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY.</title>
<p><member>LORD NEWTON</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government why the National Portrait Gallery still remains closed on Sundays during five months in the year. In connection with this Question I may explain that last year, in consequence of paying a visit to the National Gallery on a Sunday during the month of March and finding that institution closed,
<col>582</col>
I drew attention to the matter in your Lordships' House, and although I did not succeed in extracting anything very definite from the Government, the proposal to open on Sundays throughout the year was received very favourably by the trustees. They consented to try the experiment, and I am happy to think that it has been a complete success in every way. The average Sunday attendances at the National Gallery and the Tate Gallery during the winter months has been 1,478, and as these galleries are open for only about two hours that represents a considerable number of visitors. On making inquiry I find that the directors, the trustees, and everybody concerned are strongly in favour of the change and anticipate that when the fact is generally known that these galleries are open throughout the year the attendance will continue to increase. I should also like to state that this operation has been carried out at an extremely trifling cost. The cost has been only &#x00A3;84 in the case of the National Gallery and &#x00A3;42 in the case of the Tate Gallery.<lb/>
In view of the success which has attended this experiment I was rather surprised the other day upon going to the National Portrait Gallery to find that institution closed on a Sunday. As will be gathered from the terms of my Notice, this institution is closed on Sundays during five months of the year. I have communicated privately with the directors and find they are just as much in favour of opening all the year round as the directors and trustees of the other institutions, but they have been prevented from doing so by want of money. It is perfectly obvious that the amount of money required to open all the year round in the case of the National Portrait Gallery is ridiculously small; indeed, I should think it could be done for &#x00A3;30 a year. The sum involved is so small that I almost feel ashamed of myself for bringing the matter before the House at all. But the absurdity of all this business is that apparently you cannot effect these changes without calling the attention of Parliament to the matter in some form or other.<lb/>
For years past thousands of people have been going to these galleries on Sundays under the impression that they were open, and have been turned away. It so happened accidentally that I went on a
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0316"/>
<col>583</col>
Sunday myself, and being able to draw the attention of Parliament to it the matter was considered and the result has been that some of these institutions, at all events, are open all the year round. Whether or not it is a desirable thing that the question of the opening of a public institution should be settled in a haphazard manner of this kind does not much signify; but I think the noble Lord who represents the Treasury in this House will agree with me that there ought not to be much difficulty in obtaining the small sum I have mentioned in order to secure the permanent opening of the National Portrait Gallery. In view of the indisputable success which has attended the experiment of the Sunday opening of the London museums and galleries, I trust we shall receive a satisfactory assurance that it will be carried out in the case of the National Portrait Gallery.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CARLISLE </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, before the noble Lord replies for His Majesty's Government, I should like to confirm what Lord Newton has said as to the success which has attended the experiment of Sunday opening all the year round in the case of the National Gallery and the Tate Gallery. At present the fact of the opening of these galleries all the year round is not generally known, and we feel that when it becomes universally known still further advantage will be taken of it. But even as it is there have been 32,500 visitors during twenty-two Sundays to the National Gallery and the Tate Gallery. That, I think, proves that it has been well worth while to spend the small sum which this has cost, and it has been done with practically no hardship or inconvenience to any of the persons employed at those institutions. I hope, therefore, the example will be followed in the case of the National Portrait Gallery.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD DENMAN</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, it is with considerable diffidence that I rise to answer this Question, because I find myself in what is to me the entirely novel situation of being able to give a reply which will be satisfactory not only to the noble Lord opposite but also to the noble Earl on the Cross Benches. I have to state, on behalf of the Treasury, that provision has been made in the Estimates for the present financial year, beginning to-day, for opening the National Portrait Gallery on Sundays during the winter months.</membercontribution></p>

<title>WALWYN'S FREE SCHOOL.</title>
<p>*<member>THE LORD BISHOP OF HEREFORD</member> <membercontribution>rose to move that an humble Address be presented to His Majesty praying him to withhold his consent to the scheme settled by the Board of Education in the matter of the foundation known as Walwyn's Free School, in the parish of Colwall, in the county of Hereford, on the grounds set out in the petition of inhabitant ratepayers of the said parish, presented in pursuance of statutory enactment in that behalf to the said Board objecting to the said scheme, and praying that the same might be laid before Parliament.<lb/>
The right reverend Prelate said: My Lords, I have placed this Motion on the Paper on behalf of the parishioners of Colwall, an important parish in my diocese on the western slopes of the Malvern Hills, and a parish which, I am told, is likely in the not remote future to become something like a rival to Malvern. The inhabitants of this parish arc of opinion&#x2014;I think rightly&#x2014;that if they had an adequate scheme for what is known as the Walwyn Free School Trust it would be of great service to the parish and neighbourhood. The objection which the parishioners take to the scheme before your Lordships is that the Board of Education have not adequately, in this scheme, safeguarded the interests of the parishioners or given sufficient attention to the purpose for which this trust exists. The parishioners feel also that the Grocers' Company in London, who have hitherto been trustees of this endowment, are being allowed to commute their obligations&#x2014;which are, as I think I shall be able to show your Lordships, long-standing and Serious obligations&#x2014;for a very trifling sum of money.<lb/>
The case is, very briefly, this. Mr. Humphry Walwyn was a native of Colwall and a member of the Grocers' Company, and in the year 1612 he ordered that a school should be erected in his native parish for the benefit of the poor inhabitants of that parish and of Little Malvern in the neighbourhood; and, in connection with this, he left a sum of &#x00A3;600 to his executors to be handed over to the Grocers' Company for the benefit of this school. This sum the Grocers' Company were to undertake to invest in good buildings in the City of London, and they showed no unwillingness to take up this trust. They had some little difficulty in obtaining the &#x00A3;600 from
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0317"/>
<col>585</col>
the executors, and they actually, so I am informed, instituted proceedings against the executors before they secured the money. I mention this to show that the Grocers' Company were perfectly willing to undertake the trust, with all its obligations; and the &#x00A3;600 was paid over with the very distinct obligation that with the money the Grocers' Company were to purchase house property in the City of London.<lb/>
According to the records, they actually took some preliminary steps with regard to purchase, but eventually, instead of purchasing property in the city, they placed the &#x00A3;600 as a charge on some property of their own, and thenceforth they allowed &#x00A3;40 a year to this school in Colwall, &#x00A3;10 of which was absorbed by members who paid visits with a view to ensuring proper administration. Therefore, as a matter of fact, instead of fulfilling their trust the Grocers' Company simply placed the money as a charge on their own property and paid to the school something like &#x00A3;30 a year. This seems to have gone on uninterruptedly till within the last thirty or forty years. We have it on the evidence of the clerk to the Grocers' Company, given before a Commission held in Colwall, that during this period of thirty or forty years the Grocers' Company have spent upon this school, which includes an elementary school, no less a sum than &#x00A3;260 or &#x00A3;270 a year; and naturally the inhabitants of Colwall are of opinion that when a new scheme is promulgated the trust ought at least to benefit by a sum equivalent to that which the Grocers' Company have been spending hitherto. It is assumed, and I presume with a fair amount of justice, that the Grocers' Company have not been doing this out of pure benevolence, but because they recognise some obligation; and if there ever was an obligation to do it it surely took its rise in the original neglect to fulfil the fundamental conditions of the trust by purchasing, as they were instructed to do, house property in the City of London. I do not know what that property might have been worth to-day if the trust had been properly fulfilled, but the opinion is held in Colwall and the neighbourhood that it would have been of great value by this time.<lb/>
This brings me to the new scheme. The new scheme allows the Grocers' Company
<col>586</col>
to commute their obligations for the trifling payment of &#x00A3;2,000 down. It has also one or two other objectionable provisions. The scheme, as drawn by the Board of Education, seems to me a very reasonable one, except as regards the most important part of all, the financial part. The parishioners object to the scheme and hope that your Lordships will agree to my Motion on three particular grounds. First of all, the parishioners have been advised apparently that the endowment comes under the Elementary Education Act as a purely elementary endowment. In that I venture to think they have not been well advised. I find that in his will the founder of this trust expressed the desire that while it was to be a free school for the poor the better portion of the parishioners, meaning, apparently, those who were better off, might be charged fees, but should not be charged more than ten shillings a year. He further required that the master should be a learned person, which has generally been determined hitherto, I believe, in that particular instance, to be a clergyman of the Church of England, and that he should preach a certain number of sermons in the year. I venture to think that those conditions in the original document carry with them the conclusion that the school was not intended to be solely what we now call an elementary school. I do not suppose that the different types of education would be differentiated in those days as we now differentiate them, and my belief is that it was intended to be a school more of the general grammar school type. Therefore I do not press the first objection, though I may be wrong and the parishioners right.<lb/>
I now come to the two other objections to the scheme. One is to Section 13, which provides that all the tenant's fixtures on the premises being the property of the present headmaster of the school, who will necessarily retire if this scheme takes effect, shall be taken over from him by the governors at a valuation. The parishioners ask why should not the ordinary law governing tenant's fixtures take effect in such a case as this. Why should this tenant be specially protected by a clause in the scheme? What has he done, they ask, to earn this very special protection? The present headmaster has occupied this sinecure office for over thirty years. The Grocers' Company have spent a certain amount of money year by year on the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0318"/>
<col>587</col>
elementary school, and, I imagine, have spent something year by year on the repair of the premises which the headmaster has occupied. But this headmaster has himself done nothing in the elementary school, so I learn from the parish council. The elementary school has been conducted by the elementary schoolmaster, who has been paid an annual salary, partly, if not entirely, by the Grocers' Company.<lb/>
What has this headmaster who is to be compensated under Section 13 for his fixtures been doing? He has been living the whole time as a privileged person on those premises, with three or four acres of land, and conducting a successful private boarding school preparatory for such schools as Winchester. I cannot gather that it has occurred to him as part of his duty that he should do anything for the education of Colwall children. I asked the question whether any of the cleverest children in the elementary school had been taken into this gentleman's private school, and the answer I received from the chairman of the parish council was that he could not remember during all those years a single case of that having been done. I am attributing no blame, but simply endeavouring to place before your Lordships the plain facts. This gentleman has been doing nothing for the parish of Colwall or for the trust under which he is established there. The object of this section, apparently, is that when this gentleman moves out the governors, out of the moneys of the trust, shall be compelled to pay him at a valuation for any fixtures he may leave. The parishioners think that is unreasonable, and I am bound to say I entirely agree with them. I think it is a hardship on this parish that this small sum should be depleted by possibly a rather heavy payment for these not very valuable fixtures, which, it should be borne in mind, were put up entirely for his own private purposes and for his own private profit. So much for that section.<lb/>
There is another and more important provision to which exception is taken&#x2014;the Schedule which allows the Grocers' Company to slip out of all their obligations on the payment of a sum of &#x00A3;2,000. Now, what are those obligations? I suppose a company never dies, and that its legal responsibilities go on from generation to generation. Then let us go back for a moment to the origin of this
<col>588</col>
foundation. The Grocers' Company took over the &#x00A3;600 from the testator knowing full well his benevolent desire, but, instead of fulfilling the fundamental condition by investing it in house property in the City of London, they made it a charge on some property of their own and paid, until thirty or forty years ago, the paltry sum of &#x00A3;30 a year. First there is their failure to fulfil the fundamental condition of the trust. The second part of their obligation, I hold, arises out of what they have been confessedly doing for the school for the last thirty or forty years, during which time they have been spending between &#x00A3;260 and &#x00A3;270 a year; and we feel that unless some explanation can be given, the Board of Education have not sufficiently safeguarded the interests of the trust and the parish. A capital sum of &#x00A3;2,000, I suppose, represents &#x00A3;60 a year, so that the Grocers' Company will now get off with a payment of &#x00A3;60 a year instead of the &#x00A3;260 or &#x00A3;270 which they have been spending during the last thirty or forty years of their own free motion and without the slightest pressure from any quarter. I repeat that I do not think that sum has been spent out of pure benevolence, but because they considered they had an obligation to spend it. Therefore we venture to ask that some further consideration should be given to this matter before it is finally decided in this, as we think, very inequitable way.<lb/>
We appeal to your Lordships, if you are satisfied with my very inadequate description of the case, to ask for a suspension of judgment and for further inquiry, and we appeal to the Board of Education not to be too ready to acquiesce in the claim of the Grocers' Company to retire on these very easy teams, and certainly not to insert such a clause as I have referred to with regard to fixtures. I should also like, if I had the opportunity, to appeal to the Grocers' Company, who, like other great City companies, act, as a rule, very generously in educational matters. I think they would be very sorry to have it generally felt that they had acted shabbily in this particular case; yet, if this scheme goes through as it stands at present, I do not think I am using too strong language when I say that it would be a shabby proceeding. In their zeal for education the Grocers' Company have displayed much generosity in other parts of the country; and I feel sure that it would
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0319"/>
<col>589</col>
be a great satisfaction to them in time to come if they could see a really flourishing educational endowment in the important parish of Colwall as a result of action on their part and as some amends for what I cannot but think was very strange neglect on the part of their forefathers. We make this appeal very earnestly. It may seem a small matter to your Lordships, but I can assure you that to people living in a country parish like Colwall, with humble prospects and hopes, it is no small matter, but one of very real importance. Therefore we beg your favourable consideration to this Motion.<lb/>
Moved, That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty praying him to withhold his consent to the scheme settled by the Board of Education in the matter of the foundation known as Walwyn's Free School, in the parish of Colwall, in the county of Hereford, on the grounds set out in the petition of inhabitant ratepayers of the said parish, presented in pursuance of statutory enactment in that behalf to the said Board objecting to the said scheme, and praying that the same might be laid before Parliament.&#x2014;(<i>The Lord Bishop of Hereford</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the right reverend Prelate has dealt with two matters of a very different character. In the first place, there is the question as to whether the &#x00A3;2,000 is a sufficient amount, and, in the second place, there is the question of the actual scheme which has been framed by the Board of Education. Technically speaking, the point in regard to the &#x00A3;2,000 is not really before the House. It has been already dealt with as an ordinary matter of administration by the Board of Education in the Order which they made on September 11th last year, and the scheme dealing with the establishment of the new school is really the only matter comprised in the Paper to which the right reverend Prelate has called your Lordships' attention. But the right reverend Prelate has said so much on the subject of the position of the Grocers' Company in this matter that it is only right I should explain the reasons which led the Board of Education to agree to this compromise.<lb/>
The matter was first taken in hand by the Board in the year 1904. The company, who took the best advice they could get, were then told that their legal liability at the most was to provide a sum of &#x00A3;600.
<col>590</col>
I think your Lordships will agree that, supposing that to be the case or even likely to be the case, it would have been a foolish step on the part of the Board of Education to enter into a course of litigation which might have swallowed up the larger part of that &#x00A3;600. That was often done many years ago, with the result that a comparatively large amount of the moneys originally left disappeared in legal expenses. The Board of Education were anxious that that should not take place in this case, and as they found a disposition on the part of the Grocers' Company to go beyond what they had been told was their legal obligation they came to this reasonable compromise and agreed to the payment of &#x00A3;2,000; and this compromise is embodied in the Order to which I have already referred. Supposing this &#x00A3;600 had been strictly dealt with from the moment it was left by Walwyn. It must not be forgotten that the great Fire of London had a very adverse effect on the value of property in the City, and an especially bad effect on the affairs of the Grocers' Company, who were, I believe, obliged to appeal to Parliament for assistance. Certainly a Commission was held, and a release given to the company from obligations which at that moment were overpowering and too burdensome for them. So much for the question of the &#x00A3;2,000.<lb/>
Three actual grounds of complaint have been urged on behalf of the Colwall Parish Council. With one of these&#x2014;the inadequacy of the sum of &#x00A3;2,000&#x2014;I have already dealt. The second ground of complaint was that, in their opinion, the money should go to the expenses of elementary education. The right reverend Prelate himself expressed his disagreement with the parish council on that point, and therefore it is perhaps unnecessary for me to deal with it. The last remaining ground of complaint has reference to the fixtures and the special compensation to be given to Mr. Black, the headmaster. As the right reverend Prelate told your Lordships, Mr. Black has for a great many years resided in Colwall, and it is not unreasonable in those circumstances that, on the conclusion of this arrangement between him and the Grocers' Company, he should receive some compensation. I will read the words of the section, which seem to me to be not unreasonable&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided that in the case of such sale or letting all tenant's fixtures on the premises being the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0320"/>
<col>591</col>
property of the Rev. Charles Black, M.A., the present headmaster of the Free School, not previously removed by him, shall be taken over from him by the governors at a valuation in such manner as may, in case of dispute, be determined by the Board of Education."</quote>
The position of Mr. Black has, perhaps, been an anomalous one, but that is not unusual when the amount of money is so small. I think your Lordships will agree that the provision I have read is not an excessive one to insert in a scheme of this kind. In these circumstances, much as the Board of Education regret that they are unable to meet the wishes of the right reverend Prelate, they ask your Lordships to resist this Motion and to allow the scheme to go through.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I had no intention of addressing your Lordships on this question, but as I was Minister for Education very shortly previous to the year 1906 I think it only right that I should say a few words in support of the view put forward by the noble Earl the Lord Steward. I have not had an opportunity of refreshing my memory as to what occurred shortly before the late Government left office, but I remember that the dispute between the trustees of this foundation and the Grocers' Company had been going on for a great number of years. In order to conclude this long-standing dispute the Board of Education stepped in, and the sum of &#x00A3;2,000 was agreed upon. That was carried out by my successor at the Board of Education, but I have no doubt that had His Majesty's late Government continued in office, I should have recommended the adoption of the same course. Then we come to the question as to how the &#x00A3;2,000 was to be spent. I gather from the observations of the right reverend Prelate that it was desired that the money should be devoted to the establishment of a secondary school. I think &#x00A3;2,000 for the establishment of a secondary school would be of no use whatever.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE LORD BISHOP OF HEREFORD</member>: <membercontribution>No objection was made to the rest of the scheme, which is for exhibitions, I think.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member>: <membercontribution>In my opinion the Government have pursued a wise course in giving scholarships in the schools of the two capital towns of Hereford and Gloucester; and the applica-
<col>592</col>
tion of &#x00A3;600, part of the sum of &#x00A3;2,000, to the purpose of improving the elementary school of the foundation, is putting the money to a practical use. In these circumstances, I venture to endorse most cordially what has fallen from the noble Earl.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE LORD BISHOP OF HEREFORD</member>: <membercontribution>May I be permitted to put a question to the noble Earl who spoke on behalf of the Board of Education, and who said that, so far as the Grocers' Company are concerned, this is a settled question and the House has no power to intervene with regard to the amount to be paid? If I rightly understood the noble Earl to say that, I should like to ask by what authority and on what ground the Company were allowed in that manner to slip out of their obligations.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member>: <membercontribution>I am quite out of order in answering the right reverend Prelate, but I would point out that these powers are conferred on the Board of Education by Act of Parliament.

<title>CATTLE-DRIVING.</title>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government&#x2014;(l) Whether they will now consent to present to Parliament the Return with reference to proceedings in cases of cattle-driving which was moved for on 18th March last; and (2) whether they will lay before Parliament the evidence upon which they rely as showing the causes of and motives underlying cattle-driving referred to by the Lord Privy Seal on 18th March last.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD DENMAN</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am informed that it would be possible to give a Return by counties showing (1) the name of the county; (2) the number of cattle drives; (3) the number of persons convicted or bound over; and, with regard to occupations, column (4) would show who were farmers, (5) who were farmers' sons, (6) who were labourers, and (7) other occupations. But, as I think was said in a previous debate, a difficulty at once arises when it is attempted to ascertain the exact value of the holdings of the several offenders
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0321"/>
<col>593</col>
in particular cases. I am informed by the police that they have no information which would lead them to accept the view held by the noble Earl that cattle-driving is carried on, not by poor men, but by well-to-do farmers desiring to add to the extent of their already considerable farms. On the contrary, the police believe that the vast majority of those concerned are poor farmers, men who have small and uneconomic holdings and wish to have larger holdings. There is one other piece of information afforded by the police which may be of interest to the noble Earl. Of 167 persons who have been bound to the peace, a rough analysis made by the constabulary shows that 108 were farmers, thirty were farmers sons, eleven were labourers, herds, &amp;c., nine were artisans, four were shopkeepers two were journalists, and the three remaining were described as of miscellaneous occupations. I think it is obvious that the police, with the possible exception of the cattle-drivers themselves, are better able to give an opinion on this point than anybody else; and it does seem to me that we should be content to abide by the opinion they give on the question.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member>: <membercontribution>It is difficult to realise whether or not a Return in the form promised will be of any use. I will be glad to see it, however, and I thank the noble Lord for granting it. But I hope he will not have a grievance if we are subsequently discontented with what we have got. We recognise, of course, that the evidence of the police is valuable, but we must be forgiven if we think that the evidence of the people living in the districts is valuable, too, and ought not to be neglected.</membercontribution></p>

<section>
<title>THE CASE OF LIEUTENANT-COLONEL PATTERSON.</title>
<p>*<member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member> <membercontribution>rose to call attention to the case of Lieut.-Col. Patterson, D.S.O., late Game Warden in British East Africa, and to inquire as to the circumstances under which he had ceased to hold that position in the Colony.<lb/>
The noble Lord said: My Lords, in calling attention to the matter which is the subject of my Notice I do not propose to trouble your Lordships with a long statement, especially as I understand that the matter will be fully dealt with by the noble Earl the Secretary of State for the Colonies
<col>594</col>
in his reply. But perhaps I may be permitted to give a brief outline of the facts as I understand them. About the year 1907, Colonel Patterson, who is an old friend of mine and served with distinction in South Africa, being mentioned in despatches by both Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener, the latter forwarding a special despatch with regard to a gallant action in which Colonel Patterson was concerned, was appointed by the then Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Elgin, as Game Warden in British East Africa, to succeed another gentleman who previously held that office.<lb/>
In the course of 1907 he proceeded to his post to take up his duties, which included the delimitation of the northern game reserve and the survey of a certain part of the frontier. These duties necessitated a long, and, perhaps, somewhat perilous journey into the interior of the country, which, as your Lordships know, is to a great extent uncivilised. He went on his mission with what is called a safari, or escort of natives. He was accompanied also by some English friends, to whom permits were given by the Lieutenant-Governor. One of these friends unfortunately was taken ill on the journey, and instead of getting better, as everybody hoped, he got worse and died at Lersamis, about 35 miles from their destination. I believe it was a matter of comment afterwards that Colonel Patterson did not return at once with the rest of his party after this tragic event, but a very grave complication had occurred. Within an hour or two, as I understand, of this unfortunate death a serious mutiny arose among the native escort. They refused to proceed, although they were so near their journey's end. The circumstances were extremely critical, and in a position so far from civilisation it was almost literally a matter of life or death to Colonel Patterson and his party that he should assert his authority and insist up on proceeding. It will be easy for those of your Lordships who have travelled in uncivilised countries and met with serious difficulties of this sort to recognise the force of that. Had Colonel Patterson given way the probabilities are that the whole party would have run a very serious risk of being massacred. As will be seen, this did not make much difference in point of time because the journey was very nearly at an end. As soon as possible, however, the journey
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0322"/>
<col>595</col>
was completed and the expedition returned.<lb/>
On reaching Nairobi, on his return at the beginning of May, Colonel Patterson took the earliest opportunity of laying the matter before the Governor, and an inquiry was held at which he and others gave every detail relating to the unfortunate tragedy, and the whole matter was satisfactorily explained. Within a few days of this inquiry Colonel Patterson, who was now himself seriously ill having undergone many hardships in his journey, was seen by a medical board and ordered by them to leave the country on the ground of his health. He forthwith sailed for England, because it was supposed to be rather a matter of urgency for him that he should not lose time in leaving, and, through no fault of his own, he had to leave some of his papers in a somewhat unsettled state. After Colonel Patterson had left East Africa certain rumours appear to have been circulated concerning his general administration, some of them, perhaps, attributable to idle gossip, while others were of a more malevolent character. They related to the expedition which I have briefly referred to, and to other things, such as the killing of game, and so forth. It was alleged that he had exceeded his powers in killing game. I might mention that Colonel Patterson is a distinguished game hunter and in every way an eminent sportsman, and I think that fact should go far in refuting a charge of that kind. It must also be remembered that several of the natives were prejudiced against him because he had had to assert his authority very strongly, and perhaps had been obliged in self-defence to punish them.<lb/>
As your Lordships know, gossip and rumour flourish apace in uncivilised countries where there are few people about to know the truth. Be that as it may, these rumours grew to such a pitch that Colonel Patterson, who, I may mention, seemed to hear of these rumours against his former administration perhaps later than his friends, felt obliged to take steps to vindicate himself. He appealed to the Colonial Office, where he was given a very courteous hearing; and the Colonial Office, as no doubt the noble Earl the Secretary of State in his reply will show, entered very fully into his case, and were, I think, inclined to take a favourable view of the circumstances. It is in order to follow up
<col>596</col>
this procedure that I have ventured to bring this matter before your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Lord for having raised this question in your Lordships' House, because the matter is one which has given some anxiety to me as being responsible for the administration of the Colonial Office. The question of the conduct of a public servant can, of course, never be a light one, and in this particular case the circumstances are so singular that it caused us at the Colonial Office no small degree of anxiety. As the noble Lord has said, Colonel Patterson has a distinguished record of service in South Africa and elsewhere. He has been mentioned in despatches more than once, and has obtained the Distinguished Service Order. He is also, I dare say, known to some of your Lordships through the account which he wrote of the extraordinary man-eating lions at Tsavo at the time of the making of the Uganda Railway, when the operations on that line were positively stopped by reason of the terror which those animals caused until they were finally disposed of by Colonel Patterson.<lb/>
My predecessor, Lord Elgin, appointed Colonel Patterson to the post of Game Warden&#x2014;that is, superintendent of game reserves in British East Africa. Last summer Colonel Patterson returned invalided from his post, and since that time rumours of a damaging and even of a sinister character have been prevalent regarding him, not merely in East Africa, but, as I have been told, they have reached England. As Lord Zouche said, in countries like East Africa rumours grow easily. You have among the native population what our fellow countrymen in India speak of as bazaar rumours; and in a small white community there is naturally an eager interest in all that concerns each member of that community, especially any one who holds an official position; and there is also, as is usual in new countries, a somewhat irresponsible Press.<lb/>
The rumours to which I have alluded arose to a certain extent out of the unfortunate death of Mr. Blyth, the son of a respected member of your Lordships' House, who, I think, is not now in England. Colonel
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0323"/>
<col>597</col>
Patterson was going on duty with a safari of porters to the northern game reserve, and he was permitted by his superior officer to take with him Mr. Blyth and his safari also. As Lord Zouche has stated, Mr. Blyth died in the course of the expedition, died by a revolver shot wound, undoubtedly inflicted by himself, either by accident or in a fit of delirium consequent upon a severe attack of fever from which he suffered throughout the journey. It was a very painful, calamitous story, and all who were acquainted with it have felt warm sympathy for Lord Blyth and his family. Rumours concerning Colonel Patterson arose, in some cases absolutely taking the form that he was responsible for Mr. Blyth's death, owing to some disputes which were supposed to have taken place. At any rate he was accused of having shown distinct inhumanity at the time.<lb/>
Well, my Lords, I have examined all the documents relating to the case and I can assure your Lordships that for these reports there is no foundation whatever. There was no tinge of evidence&#x2014;quite the contrary indeed&#x2014;to connect Colonel Patterson in any way with Mr. Blyth's death, a charge which some, I believe, have not scrupled to make, and there was no reason to believe there was any truth in the accusations of inhumanity; but, on the contrary, Colonel Patterson throughout treated Mr. Blyth with nothing but kindness and humanity during the journey. Colonel Patterson's expedition was undertaken, as the noble Lord has said, under orders from the Government, and he carried out the delimitation of the eastern boundary of the northern reserve, though there was, I think, some misunderstanding on one side or the other as to the precise nature of the duty he was intended to perform. Yet he drew out the boundary and brought back maps of the district, and there is no definite charge of dereliction of duty to bring against him on this side of the question.<lb/>
Then, as Lord Zouche has said, there were reports circulated that Colonel Patterson had been guilty of some falsification of his accounts, and there again I was happy to be able to satisfy myself that there was no ground whatever for the rumour. Colonel Patterson did not keep his accounts in the best form, and I am not quite sure indeed that he was supplied with the means of doing so, and so far as any confusion
<col>598</col>
existed in them I was willing to ascribe it to the bad state of his health when the accounts had to be made up. As regards the charge of shooting game in the reserve, I have accepted Colonel Patterson's explanation of that charge brought against him, and have directed that the trophies, the heads and skins of animals left in East Africa, should be sent to him in England.<lb/>
In fact, speaking generally, the best proof I can give to the House that I did not consider Colonel Patterson unworthy of continuing in His Majesty's service is that I sanctioned his return to East Africa. But his health, I am afraid, is broken down to a very great extent; this has prevented his return to East Africa, and he has in consequence ceased to hold the position of Game Warden there. I am glad to have been able to make this categorical and authoritative statement of the facts of the case, because it is one which, as the House will see from those facts, is of no small importance to the man concerned.</membercontribution></p>

<title>INDIAN IMMIGRATION INTO CROWN COLONIES.</title>
<p><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to call attention to the vital statistics of Mauritius, and to ask the Secretary of
<col>604</col>
State for the Colonies whether the effect of Indian immigration on the French population will come under the consideration of Lord Sanderson's Committee; and, if so, to ask how the Committee will take evidence thereon. I hope the noble Earl will not think it presumptuous on my part if I say how glad I am that this Committee has been appointed, because it appears to be the first step to grapple with a problem which is increasing in importance every year, not only for the Colonial Office and Crown Colonies, but also for the self-governing Dominions. I would, therefore, ask the noble Earl to give us all the information he can with regard to the scope of the Committee, and the way in which they are to obtain the evidence upon which they will report.<lb/>
The Question I have placed on the Paper concerns Mauritius, which is peculiar in that it has been the meeting place of blacks, whites, and Asiatics for a longer period than, so far as I know, any other part of the world, and it is, therefore, a place where one may, in a nutshell, study the effect of the close contact of these races. I would ask noble Lords to allow me for a moment to remind them of the history of Mauritius. It was first seriously colonised in the year 1740 by the energy of a French Governor, who introduced into the island a population of the same stock as that which has produced such sturdy and prolific colonists in French Canada; and for 100 years, with the assistance of black slave labour, they were enabled to run a fairly successful colony. At the end of the 18th Century the population had risen to 65,000, and, according to the Historical Geography of Sir Charles Lucas, two-thirds of that population were blacks. The remaining third must have comprised a very considerable white population. In the year 1835, which is the turning point in the history of the island, the population had risen to 100,000 That was the year of the emancipation of the slaves, and from that time onwards Indians came in, they being more willing to work as voluntary labourers on the plantations than were the blacks. The Indians have since increased in a most extraordinary way, and to-day constitute more than 70 per cent. of the total population, 263,000 of the 375,000 inhabitants being Indians. The blacks and the whites have only increased by 12,000, whilst the Indians have become
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0327"/>
<col>605</col>
about two and a-half times as numerous as the whole of the rest of the population. I venture to think these figures are very significant.<lb/>
I should like to call the attention of the House to some of the reports made by an officer who has administered the government of Mauritius. In the Report for 1898 Sir Graham Bower tells us that a steady but absolutely sure change is taking place in the population of Mauritius, a change likely to have important social, political, and economic consequences. He tells us that the old French Creole population is being slowly but surely pushed to the wall, and he adds&#x2014;
<quote>"This is a deplorable fact, and it is to be hoped that, by improved educational and technical training, something may yet be done to save a race which has counted for so much in the history and literature of Mauritius."</quote>
In the following year Sir Graham Bower's remarks are still more significant. Speaking of the increase of Indian small-holders, he says that the land is passing from the hands of Creoles of either European or mixed blood into the hands of Indians. He adds&#x2014;
<quote>"The Creole is being gradually squeezed out, and from the social and moral point of view it means the extinction or expatriation of an ancient, cultivated and graceful people, and the substitution of Asiatic for European thought and culture. In a word, if the present movement continues, Mauritius must in a few generations become a purely Indian island, governed and administered by a few English officials some factory managers, and a military garrison."</quote>
Apparently the movement has, to a certain extent, continued, because in the last report on the Colony the same writer says that&#x2014;
<quote>"the variation of population for years past has been in the direction of an increase in the Indian and a decrease in the Creole population."</quote>
As regards wealth, the Indians are not the poorest portion of the community, whether you compare the rich Indian planters with the rich French planters or whether you take the poorer classes for your comparison.</membercontribution></p>
<p>As to Port Louis&#x2013;the capital of the island&#x2014;Sir Graham Bower tells us that thirty years ago it was, to all intents and purposes, a European town; but now the greater part of Port Louis has passed
<col>606</col>
into Asiatic hands. Of the Creole population he says, in the Report for 1900&#x2014;
<quote>"They are poor, and are becoming poorer. It can hardly be doubted that the competition of the Asiatics must be keener as time goes on, and that the Creole population, especially those of mixed blood, must find the struggle for existence press, more heavily upon them. Even among families of pure European blood there are many in very humble employment, and were it not for the strong family affection and abundant family charity, it is to be feared that many women of pure European blood and of European culture would be put to great straits to secure the barest necessaries of life."</quote></p>
<p>I have troubled your Lordships with these quotations because I think they afford confirmation of the fact that practically a revolution is taking place in Mauritius, and that from a white and black island it is becoming an Asiatic one. This may be economically sound. It is probably economically necessary. But I think, after the language used by Sir Graham Bower, the case for the whites is worthy of investigation, for the British Government had committed to them a white population which, according to the words of their Administrator, is fast disappearing. The noble Earl the Secretary of State for the Colonies will remember that Mauritius is the birth-place of the dodo. That may be an omen for the white and black population.</p>
<p>The importance of the investigation by Lord Sanderson's Committee is not confined to the narrow boundaries of Mauritius, because in that island may be studied a very much wider question. In Mauritius may be found a justification for the policy of Australia in its northern territories, and, perhaps, of some South African Governments; and in Mauritius also may be studied the advisability of introducing Indians into East Africa, as has been suggested. That is the reason why I am particularly anxious that the investigations of this Committee should be as thorough as possible. It may be said that Mauritius is an exceptional case. I do not think it is. We have it on the authority of Sir Charles Lucas that there is a tendency in other Colonies for the Indian population to develop so as to swamp the other inhabitants. I would, therefore, ask the noble Earl if he could tell us how this evidence with regard to Mauritius is going to be taken&#x2014;whether official evidence is to be relied upon, whether inhabitants of Mauritius who may happen to be in London whilst the Committee is sitting
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0328"/>
<col>607</col>
will be heard, and whether other steps will be taken to secure that all sides shall be represented. When the noble Earl wished for evidence from South Africa he sent a Commission to the Transvaal. I do not suggest that Lord Sanderson's Committee should be peripatetic; but I understand that the noble Earl has recently, with the approval of the Legislature of Mauritius, appointed a Commission to inquire into the financial condition of the island, and I would ask the noble Earl whether he could not utilise that Commission in order to obtain information on a subject which is of importance to Mauritius, and, I venture to think, of far larger importance to other provinces of the British Empire.</p>
<p>*<member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, there are two other Questions on the Paper which, although dealing with different parts of the Empire, yet are quite akin in their subject to the Question put by the noble Lord who has just sat down. Therefore, with the permission of the House, I propose to answer at the same time the noble Lord's Question and those of Lord Hindlip and Lord Stanmore.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD HINDLIP</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to ask the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether it is intended that the views of the various Crown Colonies affected shall be placed before the Committee appointed to consider the question of the immigration by Indians to the Crown Colonies; whether the Committee has power to call for evidence and to examine witnesses; and, if so, whether evidence other than official will be taken, and in what way it is intended that such evidence shall be obtained.<lb/>
My object in placing this Question on the Paper is to ascertain from the noble Earl how those living in British East Africa will be enabled to place their views on this subject before Lord Sanderson's Committee. I am somewhat afraid that rather covetous glances have been directed towards British East Africa by those in favour of the immigration of Indians into the Colonies and into Africa in particular; and I am anxious to learn from the noble Earl whether the Committee will be able to take evidence from the unofficial community in East Africa, and also whether some of the native chiefs will be asked if
<col>608</col>
they would like the country flooded with Indians. If they could have heard what my noble friend Lord. Monk Bretton has told your Lordships this afternoon on this subject, perhaps they would not be very anxious to welcome the immigration of Indians. I sincerely hope the Committee will not be content with simply examining a few officials, and possibly a few ex-officials, who happen to be in England when evidence is being taken, but that a real attempt will be made, once and for all, to ascertain the feeling of the community. If I might offer a suggestion, I think it would be of use to the Committee if the Legislative Council of the Colony, and possibly the Colony Association, would pass resolutions embodying their views on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD STANMORE</member> <membercontribution>rose to move for any correspondence which may have taken place between the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Governors of Crown Colonies relative to the appointment of the Committee to consider the subject of Indian immigration into those Colonies.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Lord said</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, as I was for some years a resident in Mauritius and am still in close touch with the Colony as Chairman of the Bank of Mauritius, I may, perhaps, be permitted to say a few words with regard to what has fallen from the noble Lord who initiated this discussion. I think that in one respect the noble Lord is somewhat mistaken. He led the House to believe that the Indian population in Mauritius is likely to outgrow not only the black and probably the coloured element, but the white element also. In that I think he is mistaken. I do not believe that the large increase of Indian inhabitants there will in any appreciable degree affect the white population or the employments in which they are concerned. I refer to the proprietors of large estates and sugar works, the leading merchants, and persons in the upper class of society. I do not think that these will be very much diminished. It is to some extent otherwise, no doubt, with the other classes of the population.<lb/>
But when you come to consider the welfare of the Colony as a whole you cannot, I think, arrive at any other conclusion than that the free Indian population has been of the greatest value to it. Without them the Colony, embarrassed as
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0329"/>
<col>609</col>
it has been for some time past, would have been in a much worse condition than it is to-day. An appreciable part of the sugar cultivation of Mauritius is carried on by these free immigrants on small patches of land which they have acquired, and it is to them largely that the increased tonnage of sugar exported from the island is to be attributed. I believe there is no class in Mauritius that is not now sensible of the great benefits which the Colony derives from the large body of settled Indians who have completed their agricultural residence, or who are the descendants of those who completed their residence long ago.<lb/>
As the noble Lord told the House, Indian immigration began in Mauritius about seventy years ago. A great many of those now living in the island as free Indians are the children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren respectively of the early immigrants, and they are quite as much inhabitants of the Colony as the black descendants of the slaves who were imported there fifty years earlier. There is no essential difference between the two. If the descendants of the black slaves who inhabited Mauritius before the Emancipation are to be considered as part of the population of the island, it is equally clear that the descendants of the free Indians are also an integral part of that population. The Indians were brought to Mauritius originally to work on the sugar estates, but fifty years ago there was no law in existence under which they could be repatriated after they had ceased to work on those estates. Consequently they remained on the island. It was for a long time considered a great object so to retain them, because it was desired to keep them at work on the estates. In fact, those who did not work on the estates were looked upon as useless to the island, and as vagabonds who ought to be forced into labour again. That state of feeling has long since ceased.<lb/>
The Indians have been recognised as an integral part of the population, and almost every one in Mauritius will agree that they have largely contributed to its prosperity, and that were they to be excluded from the island for the supposed benefit of the blacks and half-castes, it would be a calamity. Their places could not be filled, and I cannot conceive that any but the most deplorable and disastrous consequences would follow. With the permission of the House I have
<col>610</col>
ventured to make these few remarks with regard to the noble Lord's Question. My own Motion is to ask whether the noble Earl has any objection to giving us any correspondence which may have taken place between the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Governors of Crown Colonies relative to the appointment of the Committee to consider the subject of Indian immigration into those Colonies. My object in putting that Motion on the Paper was essentially the same as that which animated Lord Hindlip&#x2014;namely, to ascertain the course likely to be pursued in procuring evidence from all sources to be laid before the Committee. I beg to move.<lb/>
Moved, That there be laid before the House any correspondence which may have taken place between the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Governors of Crown Colonies relative to the appointment of the Committee to consider the subject of Indian immigration into those Colonies.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Stanmore.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am much obliged to the three noble Lords who have asked these Questions, in the first place, for having postponed their Questions for a time, and, in the second place, for putting them on the Paper for the same day. Although, as I said, they deal in some respects with apparently different subjects, yet they are all connected with the Committee which has been set up under the presidency of my noble friend Lord Sanderson to inquire into this large and important question. I can at once answer the Question asked by the noble Lord on the Cross Benches (Lord Stanmore). There is no correspondence whatever to lay as between the Governors and ourselves, because no correspondence has taken place. All that occurred was that when we decided to set up this Departmental Committee we naturally informed the Governors by telegraph, and asked them to suggest the best manner in which evidence concerning their respective Colonies and Protectorates could be brought before the Committee, and also, of course, to mention names of probable witnesses. This Committee was set up by us because we consider that the question into which it is designed to inquire is one of the very first Imperial importance. We have not in the reference to it incorporated any allusions to the self-governing Dominions of His Majesty. As regards Indian
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0330"/>
<col>611</col>
immigration into the self-governing Dominions, an entirely separate set of questions naturally arises. Those Dominions are by common consent the judges of the extent to which they will admit or forbid the immigration either of His Majesty's Indian subjects or of other persons belonging to different races. Subject, of course, to the general rules which govern the treatment and management of the King's subjects in any part of the Empire, or, indeed, of the world, we feel that the self-governing Dominions must exercise an independent discretion on the matter. There is, however, another important side to the question. There are some very enthusiastic advocates of Imperial unity who seem to me sometimes to fall into the error of considering nothing which can be done towards advancing that unity unless it concerns the self-governing Dominions. I hope I yield to nobody in desiring to draw more closely together the bonds existing between the self-governing Dominions and the Mother Country, but we must not forget in this connection the rest of the Empire. There is India with its 300 millions of population, and there are the Colonies and Protectorates, with a population of between thirty-five millions and forty millions; and when we consider the immense possibilities of development in many parts of these Colonies and Protectorates, we cannot help feeling that anything which can be done to promote healthy interchange between them and the great Indian Empire must be of advantage to the Empire as a whole. It surely is of the first importance that further knowledge and further interchange should create a substantial interest between India and those other Dominions of the Crown which are in certain respects akin to India and are in many cases governed in a similar way.<lb/>
As regards the particular question under discussion, I will detain your Lordships for a moment by a word on the present state of Indian immigration. I will say nothing about Ceylon, because Indian immigration into Ceylon stands on a somewhat different footing. There are, I think, something like 400,000 Indians on the tea plantations in Ceylon. They pass freely backwards and forwards; they are not indentured labourers, and, except for the purposes of Government, it may almost be said that they are moving backwards and forwards in their own country.
<col>612</col>
The same considerations to a great degree apply to the Straits Settlements. The Straits Settlements up to 1867 formed a part of the Indian dominion, and therefore the immigration of coolies into the Straits Settlements and the Malay States stands also on a somewhat different footing from immigration to other parts of the Empire.<lb/>
I think it is not generally realised how large the Indian population in many of the Crown Colonies is. In Fiji, out of a population of 125,000, one-fifth are Indians; in Trinidad, out of a population of 333,000, three-tenths are Indians; in British Guiana, out of a population of 300,000, four-ninths are Indians; and in Mauritius, with a population of 380,000, 70 per cent. are Indians. One sees, therefore, what an important bearing on the whole life of the Empire this question of Indian immigration has; and one of the important subjects which my noble friend Lord Sanderson and his Committee have to consider is in what circumstances and under what conditions this large influx from India may be applied, and what proportions ought to be applied, to other parts of the Empire.<lb/>
As to the question of indentured labour, speaking generally, it has been the subject of criticism in many quarters. I have never seen any difficulty myself in defending the system. For certain purposes, such, for instance, as the possession of a vote, and the taking of a direct part in the government of their country, the members of many native races are treated as though they were minors, and so in labour questions. Having regard to the fact that they cannot and do not possess that power of organisation which white labour possesses, it seems to me that they may fairly be subjected to some conditions of apprenticeship as if they were minors; and provided that those conditions are fair and reasonable I do not think they need be subjected to any very severe criticism. At the same time all will, I think, agree that all systems of indentured labour necessarily require very careful watching. There is, of course, a temptation on the part of some to exploit the indentured labourer, and to bring his condition near the border line of that servile condition which all parties in this country would equally desire to avoid for him.<lb/>
This Committee was, therefore, set up by the India Office and the Office which I have
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0331"/>
<col>613</col>
the honour to represent. We hope that it may serve the needs of India as well as the needs of the Colonies by indicating and directing the places and the methods to which and by which Indian immigration can best be carried out. The last thing we wish is to exploit in any way the labour of India or to do anything but assist in making a free outlet from the Indian Empire for those labourers who desire for reasons of their own to work elsewhere.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Hindlip, asks whether it is intended that the views of the various Crown Colonies affected shall be placed before the Committee appointed to consider the question of the immigration by Indians to the Crown Colonies; whether the Committee has power to call for evidence and to examine witnesses; and, if so, whether evidence other than official will be taken, and in what way it is intended that such evidence shall be obtained. The general answer to the noble Lord is that we certainly desire to have every point of view as far as possible placed before the Committee. It is, of course, impossible for Lord Sanderson to undertake a sort of voyage of Ulysses round the world with his Committee and examine people on the spot, but I hope it may be found possible for representatives of every interest who feel strongly on the subject to have an opportunity of coming here and stating their views. I think the noble Lord would agree that a little local trouble and organisation ought to enable representatives of every class entitled to speak for their fellows to come over and give evidence before the Committee. I do not know whether the native chiefs to whom the noble Lord referred are likely to be able to take that course; but when he mentioned them I could not help feeling that we have not always been in the habit of asking the opinions of native chiefs before occupying their countries ourselves; and although I fully admit that the point of view of the natives ought to be put before the Committee, and I have no doubt will be put by the official representatives who have to safeguard their interests, yet at the same time I feel that absolutely to demand the presence of one of these no doubt admirable representatives of the native races would be going almost beyond what my noble friend on the Cross Benches could hope to effect.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I come to the question of Mauritius, raised by Lord Monk Bretton
<col>614</col>
and also dwelt on to some extent by Lord Stanmore. As Lord Monk Bretton very truly said, Indian immigration into Mauritius followed in the first place on the abolition of slavery. The Indians have now, as Lord Stanmore said, with equal truth, become part of the established population of the island, and, so far as the figures at my disposal enable me to judge, there is no great alteration in the ratio of the different races. I have the figures for 1907, which represent pretty nearly the average of previous years. The general birth rate was 35.3 per 1,000, and the Indian birth rate was 38.8; and the general death rate was 35.2 per 1,000, and the Indian death rate 39.1. So far therefore, as births and deaths are concerned, the House will see that the Indian population is not increasing.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord spoke of the French, or, as they are more often called, the Creole population; and as regards the question of competition with them, it is a very curious fact that out of 112,000 of them only 3,600 are declared, on their own statement, to be agricultural labourers. I am not prepared to say that that small figure represents the total of those engaged in agricultural pursuits among the Creoles, but it does show, of course, that the proportion is exceedingly small. As regards the immigration figures for the last five years, if the noble Lord would look at them he would see that the number of Indians who have come in and have gone out is practically the same each year, with the exception of the year 1904, when there was a surplus of 1,500 immigrants. For the last five years the average has been about 500 entrants and 500 departures, so that it will be seen that there is no swamping of the rest of the population by Indians.<lb/>
And if I might trouble your Lordships with two more figures, they confirm in a remarkable degree what was said by the noble Lord on the Cross Benches. There were 264,000 Indians in the island, only 54,000 o whom had ever been indentured at all, and only 96,000 were employed on sugar estates; that is to say, only one-fifth of the Indians in Mauritius have ever been indentured, and only two-fifths are employed in sugar cultivation. That establishes the fact that there is a fixed industrial Indian population in Mauritius. Therefore I do not entirely understand what it is that the noble Lord complains of, because
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0332"/>
<col>615</col>
the conclusive result of the figures I have given is that the effect of Indian immigration upon the French population in the island is absolutely <i>nil</i>.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord asked whether it would not be possible for the small Commission which is going out to Mauritius to inquire into the finances and general condition of the island to make some special inquiries on this subject. So far as those inquiries will be germane to its particular reference, I have no doubt they will be made; but I think it would be unfortunate if there were any overlapping between that inquiry and the inquiry conducted by Lord Sanderson's Committee, and therefore I am not prepared so to amend the terms of reference to that Commission as to enable them to make any special inquiry into this particular branch of the subject. I am afraid I have dealt at some length with this matter, but I was anxious, as three noble Lords had called attention to it, to make a general statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD SANDERSON</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I think your Lordships will agree that my position in regard to this discussion is more properly one of an attentive and interested listener than of a participant in the debate. But, even at this early stage of the Committee, I may be able to make some remarks of interest to the noble Lords who have raised this matter to-day. In the first place, I think it would be ungracious on my part if I allowed the occasion to pass without expressing my acknowledgments, in which I am sure my colleagues on the Committee would be ready to join, of the alacrity and courtesy with which the staff at the Colonial Office have, with the sanction of the noble Earl the Secretary of State, exerted themselves to procure the attendance of witnesses and to furnish the Committee, and especially the Chairman, with documentary information in almost embarrassing profusion.<lb/>
Up to the present time the Committee have only been able, in consequence of the intervention of the Easter holidays, to hold six sittings, but they have examined seven witnesses at considerable length. The first gentleman called was a prominent owner of sugar estates in Mauritius, an ex-President of the Chamber of Agriculture, and an elected member of the Legislative Council. The second was an English manager of a sugar estate in the same Colony, previously
<col>616</col>
employed in that capacity in British Guiana. The third witness was Sir Charles Bruce, who for eight years filled the post of Lieutenant-Governor in British Guiana, was Governor of Mauritius for six years, and has made the question the study of his life. The fourth was a gentleman who was for twelve years employed in the Indian Immigration Department in Trinidad, and afterwards for eighteen years as Trinidad Emigration Agent in India. The fifth witness was Sir Daniel Morris, for ten years Imperial Commissioner of Agriculture for the West Indies, who has had exceptional opportunities of testing and observing the relative capabilities of negro and Indian labourers. The sixth was the Member for Sunderland, Mr. Summerbell, who has represented in the other House the views of the Trinidad Working Men's Association, and who was good enough to give us a very clear statement of those views, and to suggest names of witnesses who might give evidence in support of them. The seventh witness was the Governor of the Straits Settlements.<lb/>
I hope, therefore, your Lordships will think that the Committee are casting their net wide enough. They are not limiting themselves to official witnesses, and I do not anticipate any difficulty in getting the necessary evidence. If any point arose on which it was difficult to obtain complete and exhaustive evidence by examination here, I suppose it would be our duty to report to the Secretary of State and to suggest that an examination should be made by properly-qualified persons on the spot. I lay particular stress upon the words "properly - qualified "persons," because I do not think that a short visit to a Colony by any one not properly qualified to take such evidence would be of any great value.<lb/>
As regards Mauritius, it is undoubtedly true that between the years 1830 and 1907 the population was about quadrupled, and that whereas the non-Indian population only increased from about 97,000 to 112,000 the Indian population rose to 260,000. Of these 260,000 only 62,000 were actual immigrants, the rest being descendants of previous immigrants; and of the Indian population 102,000 were employed in 1907 on the sugar estates, as contrasted with 13,000 slaves in 1830, who were classed as farm labourers. In 1830 the export of
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0333"/>
<col>617</col>
sugar, which is the staple produce of the island, was about 68,000,000 1bs., worth &#x00A3;525,000; while in 1906 the export was about 380,000,000 1bs., and its value, notwithstanding the fall in the price of sugar, was estimated at &#x00A3;2,500,000. Therefore whilst the population had quadrupled, the export of sugar may be said to have quintupled. One cannot read these figures without perceiving that Indian immigration has been of enormous service is developing the resources of the island.<lb/>
There is considerable difficulty in drawing conclusions from the vital statistics, because they are so greatly affected by sudden epidemics of malaria, causing the death rate to increase from about thirty to forty or even more per 1,000. Again, the town population has a disproportionate mortality. In 1902 the death rate for the whole of Mauritius was thirty-four per 1,000, but for Port Louis the death rate was fifty-three per 1,000. Until effective measures are taken for further sanitation in the towns the town population must be subject to a disproportionate death rate; and it is the Creole population which is more addicted to employment in the towns, whilst the Indian population is more employed in the country. That fact has an important bearing on the proportions of the two populations. In recent years, however, the increase of the Indian population has slackened while that of the non-Indian inhabitants has slightly risen. From 1901 to 1907 the population only increased by about 3,300, of which the non-Indians account for 1,300. I think, therefore, that the disappearance of the non-Indian population is not quite so near at hand as Sir Graham Bower seemed to apprehend.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[SECOND READING.]</title>
<p>Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY or STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, this is one of those Bills which have to be passed before a certain date. It is necessary that this Bill should become law by the end of the present month, and
<col>618</col>
therefore as time is running rather short, we had to put down the Second Reading without giving what I think the House would consider sufficient notice. I am afraid that the putting down of the Second Reading for to-day must have been rather inconvenient to the House, and therefore I would suggest that this stage should be taken formally, and that such discussion as may be necessary should take place on the Committee stage. I would then, if the House wished, make a general statement on the proposals contained in the Bill. If your Lordships agree, I propose to take the Committee stage on Monday, thereby allowing more time for noble Lords to consider the contents of the Bill.<lb/>
Moved, That the Bill be now read2<sup>a</sup> <i>(Lord Lucas.)</i></membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS or LANSDOWNE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am glad the noble Lord who represents the War Office made an apology to the House for the shortness of the notice which has been given of the Second Reading of this Bill. I quite understand that, in the circumstances, the War Office should desire to press the Bill forward, but I have no doubt that had it been possible for longer notice to be given the attendance of Peers interested in military matters would have been a great deal larger than it is this afternoon. The Bill is by no means the formal Army (Annual) Bill to which we are used. It contains, as the noble Lord well knows, a considerable number of entirely new proposals, and although the Bill itself is in appearance a short and simple measure it is quite clear, if you look closely at it, that owing to the number of existing provisions which it repeals its effect is much more far-reaching than one would at first suppose. To understand the intricacy of the Bill you have to look at the Memorandum which the War Office has very properly laid upon the Table, in which the repealed provisions of the law are enumerated. That is a Memorandum which covers nearly sixteen pages of closely-printed matter. I am also glad that to the Bill itself is attached a short <i>resume</i> of its principal provisions. Some of them are, at first sight, rather of an alarming character. I mean, for example, the provision from which we learn that the bulk of the powers now enjoyed by the Secretary of State for War are to be transferred to the Army Council; but I understand that what is intended really is to bring the law
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0334"/>
<col>619</col>
into conformity with the practice which has arisen, and which, in fact, has prevailed ever since the Army Council came into existence, and that there is no intention of depriving the Secretary of State for War of any part of that full responsibility which now rests upon him for everything that is done at the War Office.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member>: <membercontribution>I am glad to have obtained the assent of my noble friend to that. With regard to other proposals in the Bill, I have no doubt that the suggestion of the noble Lord the Under-Secretary is one which will be for the convenience of the House, and that we had better discuss the details of the Bill when we go into Committee. There is, I notice, an important provision dealing with billeting. as to which I would only say at present that I can quite understand that, in cases of emergency such as those which the Bill contemplates, it should be necessary to provide the military authorities with powers considerably in excess of any which now belong to them. The same may be said of the clause under which power is taken to impress vehicles of all kinds. As to provisions of that sort, all I will say is that I believe the people of this country are entirely ready to submit to any sacrifice of convenience and to accept any exceptional and abnormal arrangements which may be required in the interests
<col>620</col>
of the efficiency of the military forces of the Crown, provided the circumstances are really circumstances of emergency such as those which the framers of the Bill have in contemplation. I certainly desire to raise no objection to the further progress of the Bill. I hope the noble Lord will not put down the Committee stage until the beginning of next week.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE TERRITORIAL FORCE.</title>
<p><member>THE EARL OF WEMYSS </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to ask my noble friend the Under-Secretary of State for War the Questions standing on the Paper in my name&#x2014;viz: (1) How many of the 315,000 men required to complete the Territorial, so-called, Force have been enrolled up to date; (2) how many of these now serving in the Force are
<col>622</col>
under twenty years of age; (3) what is the lowest age at which they have been, and are now accepted; (4) how many Territorials now serving have engaged for one year only.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, in reply to the first Question, the strength of the Territorial Force on the first of this month was 8,938 officers out of an establishment of 11,267, or seventy-nine per cent.; 254,524 men out of an establishment of 302,017; or a total of 263,462 out of an establishment of 313,314, which comes out at eighty-four per cent.<lb/>
In answer to the second Question I am sorry that we have not got later particulars than October 1, 1908, but on that day there were 188,785 men on the strength of the Territorial Force of whom 62,288 were under twenty. The answer to the third Question is that the limit of age for men is seventeen, and for boys fourteen. In answer to the fourth, I cannot give the noble Earl the actual number of men serving at the present time for one year, but the figures I can give will make it pretty clear. We had last year 107,857 one-year men serving in the Force&#x2014;Volunteers who had transferred for one year. On April 1 last out of these 107,857 men 56,238 had already re-engaged for one year or more. That is to say, that these men had signified their intention of re-engaging before their year was actually up. Of the rest I hear from all sides very good accounts. I have no doubt that the number of one-year men who are re-engaging is considerable, although, of course, a certain number will leave the Force.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ERROLL </member>: <membercontribution>Are any being taken on now on a yearly engagement?</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>No; the term for which any man has to enter the force now is four years?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member>: <membercontribution>I understood the noble Lord to say that the number of officers was seventy-nine per cent. of the establishment. Can he tell us whether that statement is to be taken as referring to officers on a mobilised or a peace standard?</membercontribution></p>

<p>*<member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>The peace and war standards are the same; there is only one.</membercontribution></p>

<p>*<member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>Yes; and eighty-four per cent. of the men.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ERROLL </member>: <membercontribution>I take it that the number of officers short in the Territorial Force is, roughly, 2,500?</membercontribution></p>

<title>ARMY (ANNUAL) BILL.</title>
<p>Order of the Day for the House to be put into Committee, read.</p>
<p>Moved, That the House do now resolve itself into Committee.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Lucas.</i>)</p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member>: <membercontribution>Will the noble Lord the Under-Secretary allow me, on the Motion to go into Committee, to put to him a question which I ask, not in any critical spirit, but really to elicit information? The history of the question is this. The late Government brought in a Bill to deal with the subject of transferring certain powers of the Secretary of State, the Commander-in-Chief, and the Adjutant-General to the Army Council. Last year His Majesty's Government brought in a Bill which, except in one very small detail, was practically the Bill of their predecessors. The wording of the two Bills was practically the same&#x2014;that is to say, they transferred all the powers except those falling under one very small head. This year the Army (Annual) Bill starts, so to speak, from the other end. It transfers all the powers that it mentions. I hope I make myself clear. The old Bills transferred all the powers with very small exceptions; this year's Bill transfers only the powers that are mentioned. I should like to ask the noble Lord whether the transference that we are asked to make this year is exactly the same as we would have been asked to make last year if the Bill that was then introduced in another place had been pushed through and had reached this House. I am anxious, as I say, to know whether the policy of His Majesty's Government this year is the
<col>624</col>
same as it was last year and as was the policy of their predecessors.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, it will be within the recollection of your Lordships that the Second Reading of this Bill was taken purely formally, and I undertook then that, if the House wished it, I would make a short statement explanatory of the Bill on the Motion to go into Committee. I will first of all deal with the point raised by the noble Earl, Lord Donoughmore. As far as my recollection goes, the Bill of last year provided for certain amendments, not only in the Army Act, but also in the Reserve Forces Act and in the Defence Act. We do not touch the last-named Acts in this Bill, but the amendments in the Army Act which were proposed last year are practically, if not entirely, the same as those comprised in this Bill.<lb/>
As to the provisions of this Bill, your Lordships have before you the Notes on Clauses, which set out more shortly and more explicitly than I could hope to do the contents of the Bill. I do not think I need detain your Lordships by any reference to the first three clauses. The fourth clause intimates something new. It transfers to the Army Council the bulk of the powers of the Secretary of State and all the powers of the Commander-in-Chief and the Adjutant-General under the Army Act. The intention is to bring the language of the Army Act up to date. The present language of the Act is that of the pre-Army Council days, and as a result a considerable amount of inconvenience has been caused. The changes proposed by this clause may be described as of merely an administrative nature and of comparatively minor importance, because, as a matter of fact, the Letters Patent which constituted the Army Council in 1904 really transferred, under the prerogative, to the Army Council most of the important functions which the Army Council now wield; and what is being done in this Bill is really, in the light of experience during the four years in which the Army Council have existed, smoothing over for administrative purposes what was not covered by the prerogative powers. As your Lordships will see on referring to the Notes on Clauses, we do not propose to transfer all the powers to the Army Council. The powers excepted from transfer include those where the Secretary of State acts as a channel of communica
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0337"/>
<col>625</col>
tion to and from the Sovereign, those relating to military prisons, and the powers of regulating field punishment.<lb/>
The question has been raised as to how far a precedent is created by giving the Army Council statutory powers. No precedent is created in this case, because two years ago, when your Lordships passed the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act, you gave to the Army Council statutory powers with regard to the Yeomanry, and the old Volunteers. You really did for those forces what this Bill asks you to do in certain particulars for the Regular Army. There remains the question of how far the constitutional responsibility of the Secretary of State is affected. His constitutional responsibility is not affected one jot or tittle. It remains exactly and precisely the same as it was before, and, unless you expressly alter the constitution, under no conceivable circumstances can the Army Council stand between the Secretary of State and his constitutional responsibility. If the Secretary of State differs from the other members of the Army Council, his power, after all, is supreme, and whatever steps he may take&#x2014;whether he adopts his own line, or refers the matter to the Cabinet, or takes any other course&#x2014;nothing can absolve him from complete responsibility for any act that is done.<lb/>
The object of the amendment in Clause 5, subsection (1), is to make it clear that, for the purposes of mobilisation, motor cars and locomotives intended for haulage only as well as those intended for carriage may be impressed. The amendment is confined to cases of emergency, and will not apply in the ordinary case of impressment of carriages for the purposes of a route. The second part of Clause 5 deals with the scheme which we are at present at work upon for supplying the Regular Army and the Territorial Force with horses and vehicles on mobilisation. The broad lines of the scheme were laid down by the Secretary of State in his statement to Parliament on the Army Estimates. The difficulty was to devise a scheme by which both the Regular Army and the Territorial Army could be mobilised simultaneously, the Territorial Army not having to wait until after the Regulars had been supplied. We now propose, by making use of the services of the police and of the County Associations
<col>626</col>
first of all to obtain a census of horses and vehicles suitable for military requirements in the country. Then based upon that the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in each of the big commands will state what his actual requirements are both for the Regulars and the Territorial Force, and the quota which each county will be asked to supply towards that will be given to them. The County Associations will then be asked to make the necessary arrangements, and when a general mobilisation takes place and a state of emergency is declared a requisition will be made, and the County Associations will then have to produce the number of horses and vehicles and bring them to certain collecting points, where they will then be distributed simultaneously to both the Regulars and the Territorial Force. This clause is for the purpose of making it quite clear that the officer of a County Association, when an emergency requisition has been issued, will have the power to do the requisitioning both for the Regulars and for the Territorial Force.<lb/>
Clause 6 is simply intended to fill a certain hiatus. Its object is to make it clear that the Governor of a Colony can by warrant be authorised to convene and confirm the findings and sentences of general Courts-martial if he has had conferred on him the command of any of His Majesty's forces. At present it is necessary that he should have had conferred on him the command of a body of Regular forces; therefore such a warrant cannot be issued to the Governor of a Colony in which no Regulars are stationed. The position is rendered more absurd by the fact that it is the big Colonies which sent contingents to the South African War and which are likely to send contingents again, that suffer under this disability, whereas in respect of the smaller Colonies and Protectorates which may happen to have a certain number of Regular troops in them the power already exists.<lb/>
The powers of billeting are dealt with in Clause 7, and are extended, but only in cases of emergency. When a time of emergency arrives and a general mobilisation takes place it may become absolutely necessary, in moving to some threatened spot that part of the military forces retained in this country for the purposes of home defence, to billet them elsewhere than in victualling houses. As your Lord
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0338"/>
<col>627</col>
ships will see, there are ample safeguards in this section and in the section of the Territorial Forces Act referred to. The powers will only be exercisable when the Territorial Force is embodied, and the Territorial Force can only be embodied when a Proclamation calling out the Reserves on permanent service is in force, and such a Proclamation can only be issued in the case of imminent national danger or great emergency, and the issue of such a Proclamation necessitates the summoning of Parliament, if Parliament is not already sitting. Unless you have the power of moving the Territorial Force to any threatened spot and of housing it when it gets there the Force cannot be said to have any real mobility.<lb/>
Clause 8, the object of which is to make individual members of Indian and Colonial forces subject to the Army Act when attached to any part of home forces for the purposes of training or exercise in the United Kingdom, is inserted at the wish of the self-governing Colonies. Clause 9 is merely an enabling clause. It makes it clear that the Colonial Legislatures can, if they wish to do so, apply the whole or any part of the Army Act to the Forces of the Colony when they are serving with the Regulars. The creation of the Special Reserve has rendered Clause 10 necessary. Under the Army Act as it stood the Reservist, when called up, became a Regular. That was in the days when all Reservists were ex-Regulars, and when practically the only time they were ever called up was on mobilisation. But now the existence of the Special Reserve has created a new kind of Reservist, and it is not thought desirable to treat him as a Regular when he is up simply for annual training. This clause, therefore, enables him to serve as a Special Reservist and not be treated as a Regular when on annual training.</membercontribution><membercontribution>Clause 8, the object of which is to make individual members of Indian and Colonial forces subject to the Army Act when attached to any part of home forces for the purposes of training or exercise in the United Kingdom, is inserted at the wish of the self-governing Colonies.

The object of the provision in Clause 11&#x2014;the last clause of the Bill&#x2014;is to extend the definition of the Governor so as to include the High Commissioner or Commissioner of a British Protectorate. The definition of Colony was extended by the Army (Annual) Act of 1904 so as to include Protectorates, but no corresponding alteration was made in the definition of Governor. It is also made clear that in Australia and Canada "Governor" means the
<col>628</col>
Governor-General of Canada and Australia, and not the Governors of the Provinces of Canada or the States of Australia. I think I have now explained the whole of the provisions of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member>: <membercontribution>I think the lucid statement of the noble Lord the Under-Secretary will have made it quite clear that a number of points have been dealt with in this Bill which have long required to be dealt with, but which, in the experience of successive Secretaries of State, have had to be put off through exigencies of pressure at this time of the year in the House of Commons and the necessity for carrying the Army (Annual) Bill by a particular date. I do not propose to trouble your Lordships with any remarks at this stage, except to congratulate the Secretary of State on having at last put in order a number of things which might otherwise have been left to be settled in time of crisis. But I would ask your Lordships to consider the statement made by the noble Lord the Under-Secretary with regard to the constitutional responsibility of the Secretary of State. I think that in the transfer of these duties to the Army Council, however necessary they may have become, it is extremely desirable that we should satisfy ourselves that the responsibility of the Secretary of State to His Majesty and to Parliament is not in any way interfered with.<lb/>
I cannot, I confess, view with the same equanimity as the noble Lord does the position as it is left under Clause 4 of the Bill. New powers are conferred on the Army Council. Those powers are statutory and absolute; but the powers conferred upon the Secretary of State by the same clause are not statutory and absolute. He has a responsibility under the Order in Council of 1904, and care is taken to show that there is to be no interference with that responsibility. But that Order in Council is by prerogative, and what has been given by prerogative can be withdrawn by prerogative. There is nothing, so far as I am advised, which could prevent the Crown, on the advice of the Ministry, from withdrawing the Order in Council of 1904, and thereupon the responsibility of the Secretary of State to His Majesty and to Parliament, existing under and given by that Order in Council, would to that extent be limited and withdrawn.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0339"/>
<col>629</col>
What I would press upon His Majesty's Government is this. There certainly is, in the minds of many people, a doubt upon this question, and it seems to me that it would to only reasonable and wise, before parting from the Committee stage of the Bill, to put among the provisos in Clause 4 a clear statement that nothing in the clause shall interfere with the responsibility of the Secretary of State to His Majesty and to Parliament. That will not in any way affect the intention of the Government, and I commend it more especially to the consideration of the noble Lord because I understand that in another place an Amendment to that effect was down for discussion, but as the clause fell under the closure before the Amendment was reached there was no opportunity of eliciting the views of the Secretary of State and of competent lawyers in the other House on this subject. I do not wish to trouble your Lordships further, except to express the hope that the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, will press the Amendment of which he has given notice, and that it will not be placed in any way as a limitation of another Amendment, but will be allowed to form a subsection by itself, so that it may be clearly established that the responsibility of the Secretary of State, which has always existed, to His Majesty and to Parliament is left entirely unimpaired.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, allusion has been made to an Amendment which I have placed on the Paper, to add, at the end of Clause 4, a new subsection to the effect that&#x2014;
<quote>"Nothing in this section shall affect the responsibility of the Secretary of State to His Majesty and to Parliament."</quote>
Perhaps it may be for the convenience of the noble Lord the Under-Secretary that I should state now my reasons for putting down this Amendment, rather than wait until we get in Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: <membercontribution>I understand that the object of the Government is exactly the same as my own, and that they do not wish to interfere in any way with the responsibility of the Secretary of State. Indeed, it is stated in the Notes on Clauses which precede the Bill that&#x2014;
<col>630</col>
<quote>"The full responsibility of the Secretary of State to the Crown and to Parliament is expressly preserved."</quote>
Therefore clearly it is the object of the Government to preserve full responsibility. The question is, Is that responsibility expressly preserved by the Bill? In the Bill as it stands I venture to think it is not; and for this reason. At the present moment the responsibility of the Secretary of State to His Majesty and to Parliament is fixed by the Statute of 1863. If your Lordships look at Clause 4 of this Bill you will see that subsection (2) provides that&#x2014;
<quote>"Nothing in this Act shall affect the responsibility of the Secretary of State under the Order in Council dated the tenth day of August nineteen hundred and four respecting the responsibility of the Secretary of State to His Majesty and Parliament and regulating the distribution of business amongst the members of the Army Council and the powers and duties transferred to the Army Council by this section shall be deemed to be business within the meaning of that Order and any part thereof may be reserved to the Secretary of State accordingly."</quote>
By the Letters Patent which constituted the Army Council the Secretary of State became a member of that Council, and therefore the question is whether, as a member of the Army Council and being one of that body, he still retains actual responsibility as Secretary of State to His Majesty and to Parliament. The powers given to him by this clause are given with reference to such powers as are mentioned in the Order in Council, which, as has been pointed out, may be altered or abolished. Let me suppose, just for a moment, that this Order in Council were revoked. What, then, would be the position of the Secretary of State? I think, at all events, it is doubtful; and as I am sure the Government desire that no doubt should exist, I do not see, as at present advised, why they should object to insert a distinct and separate proviso to the effect that&#x2014;
<quote>"Nothing in this section shall affect the responsibility of the Secretary of State to His Majesty and to Parliament."</quote>
That is the whole point, and I agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, that it is better that this proviso should appear as a separate subsection.<lb/>

<p>Clauses 1 to 3 agreed to.</p>
<p>Clause 4:</p>
<p>*<member>LORD LUCAS</member>, <membercontribution>who had an Amendment on the Paper to leave out subsection (2), which Lord Camperdown had just read, and to insert the following new sub-section&#x2014;
<quote>"(2) The powers and duties transferred to the Army Council by this section shall as from the commencement of this Act be deemed to be business within the meaning of the Order in Council dated the tenth day of August nineteen hundred and four regulating the distribution of business amongst the members of the Army Council and the provisions of that Order as to the reservation to himself of any part of such business by the Secretary of State and as to the responsibility of the Secretary of State to His Majesty and Parliament shall apply accordingly,"</quote>
asked permission to alter the wording of this Amendment by leaving out the words&#x2014;
<quote>"and the provisions of that Order as to the reservation to himself of any part of such business by the Secretary of State and as to the responsibility of the Secretary of State to His Majesty and Parliament shall apply accordingly,"</quote>
and inserting in their place the words&#x2014;
<quote>"The Secretary of State may however reserve to himself any such business and nothing in this section shall affect the responsibility of the Secretary of State to His Majesty and to Parliament"</quote><lb/>
This, he said, embodied Lord Camperdown's words, and the Government thought the provision appeared better in this form. The effect of the Amendment was two-fold. In the first place, the subsection was redrafted in order to remove any possible ambiguity as to whether or not it could be interpreted as being retrospective. As the Government particularly wished that it should not be made retrospective because of the case of Lieutenant Woods, which might thereby be affected, they had had it re-drafted so that by no conceivable circumstances could it possibly be considered as retrospective in any way. In the second place, the Amendment as he now proposed to move it gave absolutely everything that Lord Camperdown desired. It was not usual to insert in an Act of Parliament words defining the responsibility of a Secretary of State, because this responsibility had already been established by what he might describe as the unwritten law of the Constitution. There could be no question of the delegation of responsi
<col>632</col>
bility as between the members of the Army Council and the Secretary of State; and in order to make it clear that the responsibility of the Secretary of State did not rest on the terms of the Order in Council, the Government proposed this Amendment.<lb/>
Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In Clause 4, page 3, line 25, to leave out subsection (2) and to insert the following new subsection:</quote>
<quote>(2)'The powers and duties transferred to the Army Council by this section shall as from the commencement of this Act be deemed to be business within the meaning of the Order in Council dated the tenth day of August nineteen hundred and four regulating the distribution of business amongst the members of the Army Council. The Secretary of State may however reserve to himself any such business and nothing in this section shall affect the responsibility of the Secretary of State to His Majesty and to Parliament.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Lucas.</i>)</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> <membercontribution>said it was difficult to argue upon an Amendment which was not on the Paper, although the noble Lord the Under-Secretary had been good enough just before the meeting of the House to show him the Amendment as he had now moved it. The Amendment was open to the objection that it dealt with two subjects&#x2014;first, the distribution of duties among the members of the Army Council, and, second, the responsibility of the Secretary of State. He preferred the words of his own proviso. As he had stated what his objection to the Government's Amendment was, perhaps the noble Lord the Under-Secretary would kindly tell him what the objection of the Government was to accepting the perfectly clear and distinct form in which he (Lord Camperdown) proposed to insert this proviso.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I think there is not any very great difference between the Amendment of the noble Earl and the redrafted Amendment of my noble friend the Under-Secretary, but there is one particular advantage in the drafting of Lord Lucas's Amendment which I think the noble Earl will recognise when it is pointed out to him. In the first place, may I say that I am not aware of any previous Act wherein what is called the responsibility either of a Secretary of State or of a Minister of the Crown to Parliament has ever been expressly recognised. The truth is that all the powers conferred by an Act of Parliament upon a Minister are bestowed, so to
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0341"/>
<col>633</col>
speak, in an atmosphere of Parliamentary and constitutional responsibility which is supposed to cover them all. No references can be found in an Act, for example, to the Cabinet, nor to its responsibility. It is a part of the constitution of the country, and as such is very well known by everyone. Accordingly, being somewhat of a purist in these matters, or, if you like, a prude, I do not like the idea of introducing this special reference to Ministerial responsibility in an Act of Parliament. However, it was introduced into an Order in Council in 1904, when the constitutional advisers of His Majesty did not include myself. There it is in the Order in Council, and now what is desired is, by Act of Parliament, to make a transfer of some fresh powers to the Army Council in addition to those dealt with by the Order in Council. That being the case, the noble Earl opposite proposes to provide that nothing in this section shall affect the responsibility of the Secretary of State to His Majesty and to Parliament. In my opinion nothing of the kind could happen: but what the noble Earl desires is secured by the Amendment of my noble friend the Under-Secretary, which also secures something else&#x2014;namely, that the Secretary of State may reserve to himself "any such business." If it is desirable to say that responsibility to Parliament is to be preserved by Statute and ought not to be preserved by Order in Council, is it not equally desirable to say that the reservation by the Secretary of State to himself of any such business should be secured by Act of Parliament instead of by Order in Council? This is the difference between the two Amendments, and I think the noble Earl would be well advised to accept Lord Lucas's Amendment subject to reconsideration on Report.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member> <membercontribution>said he understood that Lord Camperdown desired to secure that the reservation which he moved concerning the responsibility of the Secretary of State, and as to which the noble Earl and the Government appeared to be agreed, should be given the dignity of a separate subsection. It seemed to him that Lord Camperdown's Amendment in no way contradicted the Government's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member>: <membercontribution>I would suggest that the settlement of the Amendment might be left over until the Report
<col>634</col>
stage, so that the drafting could be considered, and an opportunity allowed for a conference, if necessary, between the noble Earl and the Secretary of State. There is really nothing between us.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> <membercontribution>said he would be pleased to accept that suggestion. He only wished to make it plain that the reservation of business was one thing and the statutory responsibility of the Secretary of State quite another thing. Because they were different he had thought it better that they should be referred to in separate provisos.</membercontribution></p>

On Question, Amendment agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HAVERSHAM</member> <membercontribution>asked whether there was any real necessity for the large powers which the clause took to billet in private houses. Under the clause there was not a single private house that could not be entered for this purpose by the military authorities in the event of emergency. In the past, public halls, and buildings of that character, had been utilised for billeting Volunteers, and he hoped to have an assurance that the tremendous powers given by this clause would not be exercised except in the case of absolute necessity, and that the chief officer of police would in all cases consider the convenience of private householders by ascertaining first whether accommodation could not be found in public halls and
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0342"/>
<col>635</col>
similar buildings and in victualling houses in the neighbourhood. If the troops were quartered at one place for any length of time they would, of course, be put under canvas, and the difficulty would not arise. The clause also provided that&#x2014;
<quote>"The prices to be paid to an occupier other than the keeper of a victualling house for accommodation furnished and food and fodder supplied by him shall be such as may be fixed by regulations made by the Army Council with the consent of the Treasury."</quote>
He trusted that, in fixing these prices, the Army Council would not adopt a schedule such as that contained in the Bill. That schedule would, in the case of soldiers billeted in private houses, be altogether unjust. He therefore hoped the Army Council would press upon the Treasury for a much more liberal scale of allowances.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD LUCAS</member> <membercontribution>replied that these powers would only be exercised in the case of great emergency. The best use would be made of public buildings, and it would only be in the last resort that billeting
<col>636</col>
would take place in private houses. Everything had been done to make the inconvenience necessarily caused in time of danger as light as possible. With regard to the question of prices, a schedule could not be laid down for a time of emergency, but when an emergency did arise full consideration would be given to the price of food at the time and the inconvenience to which the occupiers of private houses were placed.<lb/>

<p>Moved, That the House do now resolve itself into Committee.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Hamilton of Dalzell</i>.)</p>
<p><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF ONSLOW):</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, before your Lordships go into Committee on this Bill perhaps I may be allowed to say a word or two. I have been in communication with the noble Lord in charge of the Bill, and a number of the Amendments standing in his name will go a long way to meet the objections entertained to the Bill. But there are some other matters, dealing principally with Clause 4 (Supply of electricity to railways, tramways, and canals partly outside area of supply). On the question whether procedure should be by the Order of the Board of Trade simply or by a Provisional Order confirmed by Parliament, I have not been able to agree with my noble friend; and I shall, therefore, ask your Lordshpis to consider some Amendments at the next stage of the Bill. It may be necessary for me to make some observations to-day on the Amendments to be moved in the course of the proceedings in Committee, and, if so, I shall ask your Lordships to permit me to leave the
<col>640</col>
Chair for that purpose. Lord Avebury has some Amendments to Clause 15, but they only appeared on the Paper this morning. I have been in communication with the Municipal Corporations Association, who speak for the larger boroughs mainly concerned in matters of electric lighting, but I have not yet been able to ascertain whether the proposal of the noble Lord would meet with their approval. Therefore I would ask my noble friend to be good enough to defer his Amendments to Clause 15 till we reach the next stage of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD AVEBURY:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords I will, of course, readily comply with the request of my noble friend. I am sorry I was unable to put the Amendments to Clause 15 on the Paper earlier, but there were various people interested in the matter who had to consider them. In the circumstances, I am quite willing to defer those particular Amendments and to move them on Report.<lb/>

[The EARL OF ONSLOW in the Chair.]<lb/>
Clause 1 agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> <membercontribution>moved to insert, after Clause 1, the following new clause&#x2014;
<quote>"It shall not be lawful for any undertakers after the passing of this Act except with the consent of the Board of Trade to construct any generating station on any land acquired by them after the thirty-first day of March one thousand nine hundred and nine unless the construction is authorised and the land is specified in a special Act or Provisional Order and the Board of Trade shall not in any case give such consent until notice has been given by advertisement or otherwise as the Board of Trade may direct to owners and lessees of land situate within three hundred yards of the land upon which the generating station is to be constructed and an opportunity has been given to those owners and lessees of stating any objections they may have thereto."</quote>
He thought the Amendment conveyed within its own phraseology the object he had in view in placing it on the Paper, and he was hopeful that His Majesty's Government might be able to accept it. Therefore he would not at the present moment do more than simply outline the case on its behalf. An electricity generating station was not altogether a thing of beauty. It was an evil in almost any district; but it was
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0345"/>
<col>641</col>
possibly one of those things which came within the category of necessary evils, which must be endured where they could not be altogether got rid of. The present position was that when any body of undertakers desired to construct a generating station and to acquire a site compulsorily for the purpose, they specified the site in their Bill or Order, in regard to which any one could appear before the Committee and make such objections as might seem fit. When, however, compulsory powers were not sought, there was a modified procedure, and in that ease also, if the undertakers sought power to regulate their procedure, objection could be taken and parties could appear. But there was a third way of constructing a generating station&#x2014;namely, on land acquired by agreement, In that case, if the undertakers proceeded to set up the generating station they were, of course, liable to the ordinary law as to nuisance. That, however, was not a very satisfactory position, because the law of nuisance took no account of amenity, and amenity might be a very serious thing in certain localities in which it was proposed to construct a generating station. He instanced the large generating station constructed close to the Greenwich Observatory, and said that if what had taken place there had been fully realised beforehand steps would have been taken to obviate it. There was an instance in the University of Cambridge where a generating station had been erected in close proximity to a college, and other cases could be mentioned where important buildings had been seriously damnified from the amenity point of view by the erection of large generating stations. The Office of Works had been alive to this, and, being able to watch all these Orders, had secured protection where they thought it necessary. The suggestion made in his proposed new clause was that hereafter, when any undertakers proposed to construct a generating station for either electric power or electric lighting, they should be required to get the sanction of the Board of Trade, a body which in a matter of this kind would obviously be regarded, not only as the most fit, but as an impartial, tribunal. The undertakers would have to publish notice and a local inquiry would be held. As at first drafted, his proposed new clause would have applied to land purchased before or after March 31 last, but, on the suggestion of the Board of Trade, it had
<col>642</col>
now been confined to land acquired after March 31; and he hoped, in those circumstances, having regard to the extremely reasonable character of the proposal, the Amendment would meet with acceptance.<lb/>

The point with regard to the word "local" was that there was no definition in the Bill of a local authority, and the definition contained in the Electric Lighting Act of 1882 did not include a county council. The object of his Amendment was to embrace any local authority. But if the noble Lord was of opinion that the words "local authority" included a county council, he would not press the Amendment.<lb/>

<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> <membercontribution>said that though the Amendment appeared at first sight a very simple one, it really embodied an important principle and one to which the Board of Trade could not consent. The object of the clause was to allow a supply of electricity to be brought
<col>644</col>
into a district from a generating station situated outside that district, and for that purpose the clause provided that the roads might be broken up. In the part of the clause which the noble Lord wished to amend, it was laid down that the local authority through whose territory the main was to pass should have a qualified veto&#x2014;that was to say, they might oppose the laying of the main, but their refusal might be appealed against to the Board of Trade. What the noble Lord asked by this Amendment&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> <membercontribution>said that the noble Lord was dealing rather with his (Lord Clifford's) second Amendment, to which he had only referred but which he had not yet explained or moved.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> <membercontribution>replied that he understood that the noble Lord had dealt with the two Amendments together. At any rate, the Board of Trade objected equally to both Amendments.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> <membercontribution>said he would raise no objection, if the the noble Lord in charge of the Bill thought it advisable, to leaving in the words "in whose district the road is situate," but adding the words "or which is liable for the maintenance of the road." The question divided itself into two. First, there was the authority in whose district the work might be going on, and, second, the authority on whom fell the duty of keeping the particular road in order; and it seemed to him only reasonable to provide that both authorities should be given the qualified veto to which the noble Lord had referred. The point in regard to the words "local authority" was only as to whether or not they included a county council.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> <membercontribution>said that in regard to the latter point there could be no doubt that, in the meaning of the Electric Lighting Acts, a county council was not a local authority for the purposes of electric lighting. What the noble Lord's two Amendments, read together, would do would be to substitute the county council for the local authority within the meaning of the Electric Lighting Acts&#x2014;that was to say, that if the road to be broken up was a county road the council would then become the authority to be allowed to oppose the proposal, instead of the urban
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0347"/>
<col>645</col>
council, or district council, or municipality as the case might be. The reason for giving the veto to these local authorities was that by the Electric Lighting Acts they were given priority in the matter of the supply of electric light within their districts, and also when the time came for the purchase of electric light undertakings they were the authorities which had the right of purchase. County councils did not exercise any of those powers, and therefore from that point of view there was no reason for making the county council the authority which should be allowed to object under this clause. County councils were fully protected by Section 14 of the Schedule to the Electric Lighting (Clauses) Act, 1899. That section provided that undertakers desiring to execute works in main roads must serve a notice, together with a plan, of the proposed works upon the county council, and the county council had power to approve the plans with such Amendments as they might think fit, or to disapprove of them, subject always to an appeal to the Board of Trade. The reason the Board of Trade objected to the noble Lord's Amendments was that as regards roads the county council were fully safeguarded by the section to which he had referred, and that as regards electric lighting they had no interest in the matter.</membercontribution></p>

This addition was to effect the purpose intended to be achieved by the words "or for enabling a supply of electricity in bulk to be given," which words the Committee had omitted by the adoption of his last Amendment. The object of Clause 3 was to allow a local authority to supply in bulk to another local authority or electric light undertaking passing through the territory of an intervening district, and the Amendment was moved in consequence of a suggestion made by the Lord Chairman that this was a more easily understandable and more regular way of effecting that purpose than by the words which originally appeared in the clause.<lb/>

<p><member>LORD AVEBURY</member> <membercontribution>expressed very great doubt as to this clause, which seemed to him to constitute an additional interference with private enterprise over and above
<col>648</col>
anything that had been done hitherto. The clause provided that&#x2014;
<quote>"If an auditor appointed by the Board of Trade to audit the accounts of any undertakers who are not a local authority reports to the Board that the undertakers have declined or neglected to comply with any of his recommendations or requirements the Board may if they think fit after giving the undertakers an opportunity of being heard make an order directing the undertakers to comply with such recommendations and requirements with or without modification as may be specified in the order subject to an appeal to the Railway and Canal Commissioners or any two of them who shall finally decide the matter and confirm annul or amend the order as they may think fit."</quote>
Surely such a provision ought to apply equally to local authorities, who should be placed on the same footing as companies. He therefore moved to insert a new subsection to make the section applicable in the case of any auditor or auditors appointed under the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1875, or the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, or by the Local Government Board, to audit the accounts of any undertakers who were a local authority. There was a strong impression out of doors that local authorities did not make proper provision for depreciation and reserve, and the Amendment would make it possible for their auditors to report to the Board where the authority declined or neglected to comply with their recommendations or requirements. At present they had no such power, and the result was that reports were sometimes submitted which were quite fictitious.<lb/>

<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> <membercontribution>said the Amendment was one which the Board of Trade could not accept. The audit of the electric light undertakings of local authorities was not in the hands of the Board of Trade, but, in the case of the majority of those bodies, in the hands of the Local Government Board auditors, and in the case of municipal boroughs the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0349"/>
<col>649</col>
audit was carried out by auditors elected by the municipality. The change which the noble Lord proposed might or might not be a good one, but it was rather a strong order to alter the whole system of auditing the accounts of municipal bodies, certainly as regards the supply of electricity, by a clause in a Bill of this kind. It was not for him to say whether the audit of all municipal authorities was as effective as might be desired. He could conceive that that was a matter which it might be worth while to inquire into. Indeed, it had been gone into very fully in the course of the inquiry into municipal trading generally. He thought the House would see that the change proposed was too drastic a change to introduce in this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> <membercontribution>asked whether the Committee were to understand the noble Lord to say, on behalf of the Government, that the audit was effectively carried out already by other Government Departments.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> <membercontribution>replied that the audit was carried out in the case of most local authorities by the Local Government Board auditors. He had no reason to think that that duty was not most efficiently done; he had every reason to suppose that it was. But he could not speak from personal knowledge of the way in which the elected auditors of municipalities carried out their work, because it was really not a matter into which he had had an opportunity of inquiring.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> <membercontribution>said that the impression he gathered from the statement of the noble Lord was that the audit was far from being satisfactory. Unless the audit was effective it was not only no good but a positive evil, because it misled the public as to the financial soundness or otherwise of the undertakings. He hoped that a more complete answer would be given on this subject at a later stage, for the question was an important one.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD AVEBURY</member> <membercontribution>urged that the Government apparently proposed to introduce a drastic amendment of the law which was to apply to the companies only. The amendment, however, was just as necessary in the case of local authorities, and certainly the Joint Committee on Muni-
<col>650</col>
cipal Trading were not at all satisfied with the audit. The general impression outside was that in many cases the audit was not satisfactory, and the whole object of his Amendment was to provide that in respect of the local authorities the same principle should be applied.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, as it happened that I presided over the Joint Committee to which the noble Lord referred, I may, perhaps, say one word. It is quite true that, as regards the general question of municipal audit, the Committee did make certain recommendations, but neither the Government of noble Lords opposite, which was then in power, nor the Governments which have existed since have seen their way to alter the whole system of municipal audit, although I, for one, think that in some respects it might be improved. But the point made by my noble friend who represents the Board of Trade seems to me a perfectly sound one&#x2014;namely, that, whatever may be our opinion on that point, the consideration of this clause of this particular Bill cannot be made the occasion for a complete alteration of the system of municipal audit. I hope, therefore, that the Amendment will not be pressed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</member> <membercontribution>indicated that he had in consultation agreed to certain words, which might be inserted at a later stage of the Bill, to confine the recommendations of the auditors of companies' accounts to such matters as would affect either the value of the undertaking which might hereafter be purchased by a local authority, or which might affect the sliding scale on which dividends were reckoned and the price at which electricity was to be sold. If the clause was so limited it would not apply to municipalities at all. He hoped the noble Lord would not press his Amendment at this stage. If, at a subsequent stage, words were introduced which would confine the recommendations of auditors in the manner indicated, he thought their Lord ships could safely allow the clause to pass </membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD AVEBURY</member> <membercontribution>again insisted that it was most desirable to have a good audit in both classes of undertakings; but he would

<p>*<member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> <membercontribution>moved to amend Subsection (1)&#x2014;
<quote>"Nothing in any Provisional Order whether confirmed before or after the passing of this Act shall in any way limit or affect the powers of any county council to re-build alter widen or repair the structure of any bridge upon which any work authorised by the Order may be constructed or impose upon the county council any liability which was not by law imposed upon them prior to the commencement of the Order,"</quote>
by inserting, after the words "affect the powers of any county council," the words "or railway company." The proposal in the Amendment seemed to him an eminently fair one, having regard to the fact that the Government were altering the present state of the law in favour of county councils. He argued that in a case in which a railway company owned a
<col>652</col>
portion of a road and was for all practical purposes in the position of a county council the company ought to have the same facilities and privileges as the county council. If a road had to be widened and the electric plant removed the expense was now placed on the body that wanted to make the alteration; ii the Bill passed in its present form the onus of paying the expense of removal would in all cases where roads were vested in county councils be put on the undertakers who were the owners of the plant. He thought that was not unreasonable, because they were, so to speak, intruders on the property. But if that principle was fair in the case of a county council the same consideration applied with great force to railway companies. Take the case of a bridge carrying a railway. That bridge was, of course, the private property of the railway company, but, in spite of that, if he read the clause rightly, it would still be obligatory on the railway company, if they desired to widen the bridge and the bridge carried an electrical plant, to pay the expense of altering the position of the electrical plant. That seemed to him very unfair, and he submitted that if a relaxation was to be given to the county council the railway companies as owners of a bridge were in a stronger position.<lb/>
Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 10, line 9, after the word 'council,' to insert the words 'or railway company.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Balfour of Burleigh</i>.)</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> <membercontribution>pointed out that when a railway interfered with a road the obligation of the railway company was to restore that road by making a bridge so as not to interfere with its free use by the public. The same principle applied to those who used the road in accordance with their statutory powers, such as electric light undertakers. It was obviously wrong that if a railway company found it necessary to make an alteration in a bridge any expense should be put upon the electric light undertaking.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> <membercontribution>could see no reason why a railway company should be put in a different position from that of a county council. There was no difference in the physical conditions. A county council wishing to make a change for public purposes was to have the privilege of compelling the electric light undertakers
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0351"/>
<col>653</col>
to pay the expense of moving their plant while the alteration was made. If a railway company, it might be for public purposes too, desired to make a change, why should they be placed in a worse position? The noble Lord had not said a word about the case where the railway was carried over a bridge and the electric mains ran along the bridge which carried the railway.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> <membercontribution>confessed that he did not quite understand the last point. When a county council made a bridge they constructed it over some natural obstacle, probably over a river, and therefore they were not in the same position as a railway company, who were obliged by Act of Parliament to carry the bridge over an obstruction which they themselves had created. The difference appeared to him to be a perfectly obvious one.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> <membercontribution>said the railway company and their bridge were there first, and the electric light undertakers were, so to speak, intruders on existing property. It would, therefore, be fair to put railway companies in the same position as county councils. Suppose a railway line crossed a public road and the bridge afforded a convenient means of carrying an electric light company's mains from one side of the road to the other. The railway company was compelled to allow that to be done; but if they had to make a quadruple line instead of a double line, how could it be fair that they should be compelled to bear the expense of altering the electric mains? The noble Lord would find that the Board of Trade were perfectly familiar with the point. From previous communications and some knowledge of the subject he had anticipated that the answer of the Board of Trade to his Amendment would have been that they did not, as a matter of practice, give such powers in these cases. If that had been the noble Lord's answer he was prepared with this reply, that that was a mere matter of administrative convenience and that there was no obligation on the Board of Trade to maintain that policy. It might be changed at any moment, and if it were changed it would be a serious grievance and a great expense to railway companies placed in that position. If it would be more convenient he was perfectly willing to postpone his Amendment, but he should do so in the
<col>654</col>
earnest hope that the Board of Trade would consider the point in a judicial spirit.<lb/>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> <membercontribution>moved an Amendment to extend the principle of the clause to diverting, widening, raising, draining, or improving any road. He said that the late President of the Board of Trade, in replying to a deputation from the County Councils Association on this subject, had expressed sympathy with county councils, and had admitted that there was a great deal to be said for their contention in the matter of bridges, since in most cases electric light undertakings were private concerns run for profit. The right hon. gentleman, therefore, agreed that it was rather hard on county councils that they should be put to further expense in regard to electric mains when they were obliged, in the public interest, and in the public interest alone, to make alterations in their bridges. But he (Lord Clifford) was unable to see any difference between a bridge and an ordinary road. It was for the public use alone that a county council were obliged to alter or widen a road, and therefore they ought not to be put to any additional expense in respect of electric lighting mains when they did so.<lb/>

<quote>"In page 10, line 10, after the word 'bridge' to insert the words 'or to divert widen raise drain or improve any road repairable by them.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Clifford of Chudleigh</i>.)</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member> <membercontribution>said the Bill provided that where electric mains had been laid in a road which crossed a bridge, and where it was found necessary to alter or rebuild that bridge, the local authority responsible for the bridge should not be put to any expense on account of the existence of the electric mains. What the noble Lord now asked the Committee to do was to apply the same principle to all alterations of roads. He admitted that it was not easy to say what difference there was between roads and bridges in this connection. He supposed it might be argued that the hospitality which the undertakers received in a road was not quite of the same value as that accorded them on a bridge, and that the expenditure of the local authority on paving the road was not to the advantage of the undertakers but rather to their disadvantage, because they had to dig through and replace an expensive
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0352"/>
<col>655</col>
surface, whereas in the case of a bridge they actually reaped the benefit of the money which had been spent because they found the chasm, or whatever it might be, already bridged for them. But that was not the point he wished to press. He would confess at once that what the Board of Trade had done was in the nature of a compromise. As their Lordships knew, a compromise was very useful, but it was not always possible to defend it on strictly logical grounds. What the local authorities said, and said very rightly, was that it was hard that when they had to alter a road in the public interest they should be put to additional expense in consequence of electric mains. But the undertakers also held that it was very hard that they should be put to expense in carrying out their statutory obligations to supply electric light because the local authority could not make up their minds as to the best place for the road. The arrangement which had been arrived at was a compromise. He also pointed out that if the Amendment were accepted there would be one law for county roads and another for non-county roads.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member> <membercontribution>said that when a matter was stated to be one of compromise it was generally supposed that that concluded the discussion. He confessed that he rather pitied the noble Lord for having to defend a compromise with so little material. Here were two cases which seemed to be exactly parallel, the case of the road and the case of the bridge. Both belonged to the public authority and existed for the benefit of the public, and the undeniable force of the argument in the case of the bridge seemed to him to apply equally to the road. It was a distinct hardship on local authorities that the Government did not give way on this point. He did not believe that the expense which would be thrown upon electric light companies would be a very serious matter. It was not as if local authorities were in the habit of capriciously diverting roads. The noble Lord in charge of the Bill had spoken of a county council not being able to make up its mind where the road should be. There was no question of that kind. The diversion of a road was a serious matter, involving a great deal of inconvenience to many persons. It was never undertaken except after careful consideration and with the greatest reluctance, and if in those

very rare cases the electric light company had to share the inconvenience and expense to which the public itself was put, that did not seem to him to be a very great hardship on the company. He did not know how far his noble friend intended to press the Amendment, but on the arguments submitted to their Lordships the Government did not appear to have much of a case.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD JOICEY</member> <membercontribution>thought the noble Marquess's argument tended rather to show that it was unwise on the part of the Government to admit bridges. Alterations to roads had been spoken of, but the words in the Amendment were "divert widen raise drain or improve" any road. If a charge of the kind in question were placed upon electric light companies, who, after all, were serving the public and in many cases supplying electricity at fixed figures, it would completely alter the whole of their arrangements. He hoped the Amendment would not be pressed, as it would undoubtedly place a very heavy increased expenditure upon these companies.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> <membercontribution>announced that in the circumstances he desired to press the Amendment to a division. The noble Lord who spoke for the Board of Trade rather suggested that electric light companies obtained no advantage at all from taking their cables along the high road, and seemed to think they were under a disadvantage in willingly selecting a macadamised road; but it was obvious that they gained great advantage thereby. Moreover, it was much cheaper than obtaining compulsory powers for taking the plant over the fields of adjoining landowners. For this reason he failed to see why any difference should be made between a bridge and a main road. The only argument that at all impressed him was the argument that the matter was a small one, and that local authorities seldom diverted, widened, or altered their roads. It was, therefore, contended that it would only be in a few cases that his Amendment would be applicable; but he regarded that as equally an argument for passing the Amendment as for rejecting it. He would, therefore, divide the Committee on the Amendment.<lb/>

<p>Amendment agreed to accordingly.</p>
<p>Consequential Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member> <membercontribution>moved to further amend Clause 21 by providing that the company should to the reasonable satisfaction of the county council keep the portion of all roads repairable by the county council which should be broken up by the company for the purpose of constructing, laying, or repairing any works authorised by the Order in good repair for twelve months after replacing and making good the same, and should compensate the county council for the extra repair rendered necessary by concentration of traffic on any portion of the road not broken up by them. He said that very often these works occupied a considerable time, and the whole, perhaps, of a very heavy traffic was meanwhile concentrated on the half or smaller portion of the road not broken up. The result was that that section of the road came to be repaired very much sooner than would otherwise be the case. The undertakers, on the conclusion of their work, reinstated the portion of the road which they had taken up, but did nothing to repair the damage caused to the other portion which they had not touched but upon which there had been a great concentration of traffic. He submitted that it was perfectly reasonable that the undertakers should be liable for any damage which could be clearly proved to be due to this concentration of traffic.<lb/>
Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 10, line 32, after the word 'out' to insert the words 'The company shall to the reason-

able satisfaction of the county council keep the portion of all roads repairable by the county council which shall be broken up by the company for the purpose of constructing laying or repairing any works authorised by the Order in good repair for twelve months after replacing and making good the same, and shall compensate the county council for the extra repair rendered necessary by concentration of traffic on any portion of the road not broken up by them.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Clifford of Chudleigh</i>.)</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON of DALZELL</member> <membercontribution>admitted that there was a good deal to be said with reference to concentration of traffic in the case of the laying of tramways, which meant, as many of their Lordships must have noticed in motoring in and out of London, the blocking up of roads for a considerable time. But the laying of electric light cables was a very different thing. It only necessitated a trench some twelve inches wide, and the extremely hard nature of the surface of the road made the undertakers unwilling to break up more of it than could be helped. He did not think that the concentration of traffic caused by a trench twelve inches wide was such as to render it necessary to insert a provision dealing with it in an Act of Parliament. He therefore resisted the Amendment as unnecessary.<lb/>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<lb/>
Clause 21, as amended, agreed to.<lb/>

<title>DISCLOSURE OF ADMIRALTY DOCUMENTS.</title>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government, with reference to a letter written by Captain Bacon, R.N., to the First Sea Lord in April, 1906, commenting on what he describes as "the Service agitation headed by Lord Charles Beresford and Admiral Lambton," for what purpose the letter was published and circulated; whether the Board of Admiralty as a whole consider that the letter in question with the sentiments expressed in it was a proper one to have been written by a junior captain to a First Sea Lord; whether they approve of its printing; and whether they approve of its publication and circulation.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE EARL OF CREWE:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I am not sorry that the noble Earl has put this series of Questions, because the matter, I understand, is one which has aroused some little interest in the Press and has led to Questions in another place. I understand that the letter referred to was a private letter written by Captain Bacon to the First Sea Lord, he having been previously at the Admiralty in a subordinate position closely associated with the First Sea Lord. The letter was not circulated or published. It is true that it was printed, but, as noble Lords opposite who are acquainted with the working of public Departments know, it is by no means an uncommon thing for a purely private letter to be printed for the convenience of the head of the Department. In this case the letter was printed for the convenience of Lord Tweedmouth, who was at that time First Lord of the Admiralty, and the printing was simply carried out for the purpose of convenience of record. That is a frequent practice. The noble Viscount opposite, Lord Midleton, who has been Secretary of State for India, knows that I am right in saying that practically every private communication received from India is printed. Therefore to assume, as the noble Earl, or those who have advised him, seem to assume, that the printing of a document of this kind implies in any sense publication is to be entirely mistaken as to the facts of the case.</membercontribution></p>
<col>660</col>
<p><member>The noble Earl</member> <membercontribution>then asks whether the Board of Admiralty as a whole consider that the letter in question with the sentiments expressed in it was a proper one to have been written by a junior captain to a First Sea Lord. As a rule I strongly deprecate questions as to the opinions of particular members of the Board of Admiralty, or of the Army Council, or of any other kindred body. It is a custom&#x2014;I think a very unfortunate custom&#x2014;which has grown up of late years to attempt to go behind the opinion expressed by the political head of a Department and endeavour to discover what his permanent advisers think of a particular question. In this case I have no quarrel with the noble Earl for asking the question, because it is, of course, a personal matter, and one affecting the honour of individuals, and consequently it is relevant to ask what the opinion of the members of the Board may be. I am able to say that all the members of the Board of Admiralty, without exception, consider that the letter was a perfectly proper one to have been written by Captain Bacon to the First Sea Lord.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl asks whether they approve of its publication and circulation. In one sense, as I have pointed out, the letter has not been either circulated or published; but in another sense, I am sorry to say, it has been published, or, at any rate, parts of it have been published, and it can only have been published through a flagrant breach of confidence on the part of some person; and, so far as that kind of publication is concerned, I am quite certain that not only the Board of Admiralty, but also everybody else, will strongly disapprove of the action which has been taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH:</member> <membercontribution>Would it be indiscreet to ask whether any steps can be taken to find out who is responsible for the circulation of the letter?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CREWE:</member> <membercontribution>I will inquire.<lb/>

<title>ROMAN CATHOLICS AND THE ROYAL DECLARATION.</title>
<p><member>THE DUKE OF NORFOLK</member> <membercontribution>rose to ask His Majesty's Government what course they had decided to adopt in regard to the Royal Declaration. The noble Duke said: My Lords, in December last the noble Earl the Leader of the House, in reply to a Question by my noble friend Lord Braye, said that the Government had for some time had in anxious consideration whether any solution could be arrived at in regard to the question surrounding the Royal Declaration, and he stated that they had hopes that at some not distant tine they might be able to bring forward something which would prove a satisfactory solution. The noble Earl added that were they able to do so he had the fullest confidence that noble Lords on this side of the House would be in accord with the Government in their desire to remove what was so very deep-felt and heart-burning a grievance to so many loyal subjects of the Crown. Four months have passed since then, and I am sure the noble Earl will not be surprised at my now asking what course His Majesty's Government have decided to adopt in regard to this question. I am specially anxious to do so at the present moment because a Bill has been introduced into another place dealing with this among other subjects; and although, of course, I do not invite the noble Earl to discuss here anything connected with a Bill in another place, yet the fact of there being a Bill before Parliament does undoubtedly give an opportunity to His Majesty's Government of dealing with the question. Therefore I feel that the situation is one which cannot be allowed to remain as it is. I earnestly trust that the noble Earl will be able to give us some assurance that the careful consideration which for some time past, as we have been told, the Government have been giving to the question is now about to bear fruit in some measure that will remove this great grievance&#x2014;a grievance which, I think, many who are not Roman Catholic subjects of the Crown also feel to be a disgraceful enactment, and which bristles with questions that ought to be set at rest. I beg to ask the Question standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<col>664</col>
 <p>*<member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Duke for having postponed for some little time his Question on a subject which he and many others, I know, in this House regard with deep anxiety, and I only wish that I could give a reply which would be more satisfactory to the noble Duke, In considering this question of the Royal Declaration there are two classes of persons whom at no time we can hope to satisfy. At the one end there are those who will not be content unless the Declaration is abolished altogether, or an absolutely colourless Declaration is substituted for it; at the other end there is a class of persons, like the other, I should hope, not a very numerous class, so enamoured with the phraseology of the existing Declaration that they cannot bear to see it altered in any particular. Between these two bodies there exists, I believe, the very great majority of the people of this country who would desire to see enacted, or at any rate be prepared to express themselves content with, some new formula which would make the position of the Sovereign on the solemn occasion of his first meeting his Parliament perfectly clear in relation to this matter, but at the same time would be entirely devoid of those expressions which are so offensive to many millions of His Majesty's subjects and which must be, as we feel, most painful to any Sovereign to utter. Experience, I am sorry to say, has shown us how difficult it is to find a formula of that kind, because within that large class, representing, as I have said I believe it does, the great majority of the people of the country, there is a wide diversity of opinion as to how far the formula ought to go in the direction of stating that the Sovereign repudiates or does not accept the Roman Catholic faith; and before there can be any real hope of arriving at that formula it is necessary to consult with men of very different shades of opinion. That we have done, so far as time has permitted, and I cannot pretend to the House that the result so far has been very encouraging. At the same time, speaking for myself, I do not despair that in process of time some such formula may be discovered, but I regret to be obliged to inform the noble Duke that in our opinion there is no prospect of our being able to propose any legislation on the subject this session.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0357"/>
<col>665</col>
<p><member>THE DUKE OF NORFOLK:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I hope I am not out of order in expressing profound disappointment at the reply to which we have just listened. I do not wish to be ungracious, but if that was all we were to hear to-day why were we told what we were told four months ago? The noble Earl made a statement in December, for which we thanked him at the time, in which he asked those of us who are interested in this question not to take any action pending the deliberations of the official advisers of the Crown. We have complied with that request, but the deliberations of the official advisers of the Crown appear to have been very protracted. No doubt there were many persons interested, but the Government have had four months in which to interview them, and it will be remembered that the noble Earl said at the time that the Government had then been giving consideration to the matter. The Government admitted that the question was one of great importance, and one calling for action. I really feel that our hopes were raised; but after all this, we are now simply told that any hopes we had allowed ourselves to entertain were futile. We are told that although the Government may be glad to do something some day, at present they can do nothing. I cannot help in the strongest way protesting against treatment of this kind. I can assure the noble Earl that his reply will cause profound disappointment and dissatisfaction throughout the Catholic body. We have held our hands since the statement made on behalf of the Government in December, but I do not feel that' can pledge myself as to what action my co-religionists may feel it necessary to take in the future. For myself, I am disappointed and indignant that no further assurance can be given.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I should like to say a word in support of what has fallen from the noble Duke. I am certain that the reply which we have heard from the Leader of the House will cause very great disappointment to large numbers of His Majesty's subjects. It seemed to me, in listening to the noble Earl's statement, that the Government were going the very best way to avoid any action, because he said that their proceedings consisted in going about asking the views of people of different opinions&#x2014;in fact, attempting that which is generally agreed upon as the impossible, namely,
<col>666</col>
trying to please everybody. I should have thought that the Government, if they had the courage of their opinions, might have stated some definite policy after having made up their minds as to what was fair in the matter, and then have trusted to the reasonable people in the country to support them. To go about it in the way described, trying to please everybody, is to adopt a policy foredoomed to failure; and it is evident that the Catholics of this country will have to wait indefinitely for the removal of what they regard as an intolerable grievance.<lb/>

<p>The noble Lord said: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise, in pursuance of the Notice which appears on the Paper, to call attention to the Special Reports on the Burden of Existing Rates and the General Financial Position of the Outer Hebrides presented to the Local Government Board for Scotland in 1906, and to ask whether His Majesty's Government have considered the state of matters now existing in those Islands, and whether they cannot see their way to do something to alleviate the financial pressure upon those who are chiefly concerned. I think I shall have no difficulty in establishing two things&#x2014;namely, that the state of matters is quite within the mark to be described as disastrous, and also that

it is not in any way the fault of those who are the chief sufferers in consequence of the present position. It is very serious, and your Lordships will see that it is also very unjust.<lb/>
I cannot, of course, conceal from your Lordships that I touch the fringe, at any rate, of what is a very much larger subject&#x2014;namely, how far, and upon what principles, it is right and reasonable for the central authority to do something more than is at present done to alleviate local burdens. That was the main part of the reference to the large and important Commission on the whole subject of local taxation appointed by the late Government some years ago, over which I had the honour to preside. But I do not intend to raise to-night any of the larger issues which were before the Commission. I think, however, I may say this, that the question of local taxation really lies at the root of the possibility of bringing in approved schemes of social reform, especially in regard to the Poor-law, upon which the Commission presided over by Lord George Hamilton has recently presented a Report. I do not know which of these two subjects is the more important, but of this I am pretty certain, that you cannot, with due regard to existing interests and existing grievances, bring in any scheme of administrative reform with regard to the Poor-law unless and until you have done something to reform the method of local taxation.<lb/>
I deeply regret that nothing has been done in this direction during the years which have passed since the Local Taxation Committee reported. I am not going to say that it is the fault either of those who sit on the other side of the House or of those who sit near me. I am certain that if it had not been for the disturbance of financial conditions consequent upon the South African War the late Government would have done something to bring in measures of reform. I know that other subjects have attracted the attention of the present Government, but I repeat, and I repeat with some confidence, that if they are going further in the direction of social reform, if they are going further in the direction of Poor-law reform, they will have to do something to alleviate the burden, at any rate, of the poorer districts in the country before they can make much advance in that direction.

<col>671</col>
I want to impress upon the House the point of difference between what I venture to describe as services which are national in character and onerous on the ratepayer and those which are local in character and confer a direct benefit upon those who pay for them. I admit that it is not altogether in the last resort possible to draw an absolutely logical and precise distinction between them; but none of us will have any doubt that such matters as water and drainage are essentially local in character, while those services to which I refer as mainly national are those of which the universality is characteristic, which are ordered by the State, and in regard to which the State insists upon the same sort of general and universal standard in every locality. I mean such matters as education, Poor-law, police, most sanitary matters, and things of that kind.<lb/>
Before the Commission over which I presided there were two distinct classes of grievances alleged, and, as I venture to say the Report establishes, proved. There is, first, the grievance that this class of national service is undoubtedly paid for by those who are interested in special classes of property, I am not going into that branch of the subject to-day; but there is also the grievance, and it is hardly a less one, that even as between the owners of these same classes of property&#x2014;real property in England and heritable property in Scotland&#x2014;the burden which each has to bear varies according to the differences of the localities in which the property happens to be placed, and very seldom, comparatively speaking, is that the fault of those who are the owners or occupiers of that class of property. I do not deny that in some cases there may be extravagance; but the first point I wish specially to impress upon the House is this, that the test of whether the service is fairly borne or not is according to the ability of the locality to bear it, and, if your Lordships will allow me, I will say that the ability of the locality to bear the service may be best measured and attained by the amount of valuation per head of the population. Valuation gives the riches of the locality. The population is a rough, but not unfair, measure of the probability of the burden which will have to be borne.<lb/>
I venture to say, without fear of contradiction, that administrative reforms, however desirable they may be, which
<col>672</col>
greatly increase the burden upon the individual ratepayer, cannot with any sense of justice or fairness be imposed on the poorest districts equally with the rich. Two things have to be kept in view, I admit. The first is economy in the discharge of the local administration, and, secondly, how far it is possible to improve that administration. None of your Lordships who have not studied the question with some closeness really realise how much the ability of different districts to bear certain charges varies. I am not able to say what the extreme limits of variation in England are, but they are very great. They are not, perhaps, quite so great as they are in Scotland, because the unit of administration is, speaking generally, larger in England than in Scotland, being the union for Poor-law purposes in England while it is the parish in Scotland. The richest parish in Scotland has a valuation of &#x00A3;44 per inhabitant, while the one which is poorest by this standard has only a valuation of 9s. per head of the population. It is obvious that a parish with &#x00A3;10 per head of valuation can raise twice as much with the same sacrifice as a parish with only &#x00A3;5 per head of the population. Therefore, when I tell your Lordships that in one parish, at any rate, the valuation is &#x00A3;44 per head and that in another it is only 9s. per head, it is clear that the comparative ability of these parishes is nearly 100 to one; in other words, that a penny in the &#x00A3; per inhabitant in the richest parish will raise nearly 100 times as much as a similar rate in the poorest parish.<lb/>
As I have said, I am only concerned tonight with such matters as poor relief, roads, police, education, and sanitation. The administration, speaking generally, has to conform to a certain national standard while the administration is local, and those who have to administer in each locality ought to have regard, and I think as a rule do have regard, to three considerations&#x2014;to what are the requirements of public policy imposed upon them, to reasonable economy in the discharge of the duty, and to ability to bear the burden imposed. There has been special inquiry into the ability and administration of these parishes in the Hebrides to which I am specially referring. An inquiry was ordered by the Secretary for Scotland who preceded the noble Lord now in office, and it was conducted by one of the most qualified sheriffs in Scotland, and by
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0361"/>
<col>673</col>
two perfectly competent gentlemen in the employment of the Local Government Board for Scotland. The verdict of this tribunal in regard to the parishes in the Outer Hebrides was this, that the expenditure is not greater than to be expected in the circumstances in which they are placed, and that the poverty of the districts makes the burden which they must bear, even in circumstances of the most stringent economy, extremely excessive. The words are that an exceptionally heavy burden has to be borne by an exceptionally poor community. The complaints made by all classes are quoted.<lb/>
This is not a mere landlord's question; it is equally felt by all who own and occupy private property in those districts. It is the same by the shopkeeper as the landlord, by the small-holder as the larger farmer; and as one man said to Sheriff Fleming&#x2014;
<quote>"the amount of rates we have to pay really amounts to a duplication of the rent."</quote>
In passing, I may say that it is not surprising, in these circumstances, that in these outer islands the small-holders have an extremely hard struggle to live; the weight of the rates imposed upon them is really one of the main causes, if not the main cause, why small-holders in those districts have so poor and precarious an existence. I believe that in the parishes in the Outer Hebrides the lowest rate in the for the services I have mentioned amounts to 10s., 12s., or 15s. in the &#x00A3; and in one or two cases it rises to the extraordinary amount of 25s., 26s., and 27s. in the &#x00A3;. A word of explanation is necessary in that connection, because if the rate was 25s. or 26s. upon the gross rental it, of course, could not be paid; it would mean bankruptcy. But your Lordships know that under the system in which rates are levied in Scotland there are certain powers of deduction given to parish councils in the case of owners and certain powers of classification in the case of occupiers, so that, although the rate in the &#x00A3; may seem more than the basis upon which it is laid, it is not, and cannot be, of course, paid if it exceeds the gross sum which is the produce of the property.<lb/>
For purposes of comparison I am going to discard to-night all question of the rate per &#x00A3; that is raised, simply because it
<col>674</col>
would not make a fair comparison between one parish and another. I have, with the assistance of some friends in the Scottish Office, and with the full consent of the noble Lord opposite, and also by means of explanations which have been given to me by the owners of some of the property in these districts, been, I think, able to compile a statement which will show your Lordships, without fear of misunderstanding, how really serious and heavy the burden is which is borne by these communities. It is not, as I have said, only a landlords' question. The same burden relatively is borne by everybody, whether he be owner or occupier, one-half of the rates being borne by the owner and the other half by the occupier.<lb/>
I take the case of the parish of Loch. Major Mathieson, who is the owner of a large portion of that parish, supplied me with these figures, which have been corrected and criticised in the way I have just mentioned. His gross rental from the parish in 1907&#x2013;8 was &#x00A3;2,900. I take that year as being the last available year, because in the following year there was a certain amount of litigation which confused the issue and which has not, I believe, altogether been determined. Therefore, it is bettor to disregard for our present purposes this year and to take the previous year. The gross rental from the property in 1907&#x2013;8 was, as I have said, &#x00A3;2,900. Allowing ten per cent. of that as not recoverable&#x2014;a moderate allowance&#x2014;the net sum received was &#x00A3;2,600. The parish rates&#x2014;that is, for poor relief and education&#x2014;amounted to &#x00A3;1,121, the county rates to &#x00A3;435, and other charges, such as minister's stipend and land tax, to &#x00A3;150, so that the gross rates for purely onerous services for which no return is rendered at all to the individual owner came to &#x00A3;1,706 out of a total received of &#x00A3;2,600, leaving a balance of &#x00A3;894. But out of that balance there had to be paid income tax, management, repairs, insurances, and any mortgages or jointures which might have had to be paid by the unfortunate proprietor. And management in a case of this kind does not mean merely supervision. Management in a case where there is a large amount of sporting rental includes such things as keepers' wages, and, if the shooting is not let, the unfortunate proprietor has still to pay these wages and to pay the rate on the rental he has not received. That is a plain and unvarnished
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0362"/>
<col>675</col>
tale, and I venture to say that so stated&#x2014;and it cannot be contradicted &#x2014;it reveals an absolutely unparalleled case of hardship when it is demonstrated that there is no extravagance and that due regard to economy in administration has been had. Indeed, it amounts to absolute bankruptcy.<lb/>
I will take one other case. I do not desire to unduly take up the time of your Lordships, but I will take the case of the parish of Barvas, the parish to which I referred a moment ago as the poorest parish in Scotland. In the case of Barvas the figures are almost equally instructive. The circumstances are these. The rental of the estate to which I refer is &#x00A3;2,459. I ought, perhaps, to say that, without making any deduction at all, the total amount of rates borne by the owner as owner of the whole and as occupier of those parts left in his occupation amounts to &#x00A3;1,017, or, for parish services alone, 41 per cent. on the total income drawn from the subjects in question. But when you add county rates and the other things I have mentioned, over which the owner has no control, such as minister's stipend, land tax and so on, and deduct them from the total received, there is only about &#x00A3;590 left, and this is still subject to income tax, repairs, insurance, management, and the other things I mentioned a moment ago.<lb/>
The position in these two parishes is aggravated by another set of circumstances. Only two or three days ago a meeting was held in Stornaway which was addressed by Provost Anderson, well known to the noble Lord opposite as one of the ablest and most energetic of the local administrators in that district, and he supplies to some extent the explanation why the charges are so heavy in those parishes. He says that, in addition to the crofter and the farmer, there are a class of persons known as cottars and squatters. The difference between a cottar and a squatter is this. The cottar is the parasite upon the crofter. He has taken part of the crofter's holding. He cannot be got rid of by the crofter, and I believe he can hardly be got rid of by the landlord once he has settled there without such an amount of expense as to make it prohibitive. The squatter is the analogous person who has squatted on the common grazing belonging to the whole community. There is no difference between them in
<col>676</col>
degree&#x2014;the one is the parasite upon the crofter, the other the parasite upon the community as a whole; and Provost Anderson says there are no fewer than 1,103 cottars upon the crofts the occupiers of which are not rated. They are not tenants of anybody, and they pay neither rates nor taxes. In addition to those 1,103 cottars there are 289 squatters in the four parishes in the Lews, and, out of a population of 27,000 in the rural parts of the Lews, no fewer than 7,247 belong to the cottar and squatter class. Not one of these individuals pays a penny either in rates or taxes or rent. They contribute nothing whatever to the amelioration of the burden, but they share in all the benefits, such as they are, of poor relief, education, and other things of that kind.<lb/>
I think I have established my case at any rate to this extent, that there is a clamant grievance crying for a remedy, and I think it is only a type, perhaps an exaggerated type, of what will have to be done if any scheme of general Poor-law reform costing more money is brought into operation. I have shown that the local finances of these districts are absolutely on the verge of bankruptcy. I have undoubtedly taken the two worst cases I know of, but they do not materially differ from what is going on in any of the parishes in the Outer Hebrides. This is no mere personal grievance of one or two people. It is making the useful and beneficial occupation of a property, whether as owner or occupier, in these districts absolutely impossible. The facts have been established by the inquiry and they will not be disputed; and the question I wish to put to His Majesty's Government is whether, in the circumstances I have explained to the House, they cannot hold out some hope of coming to some extent to the assistance of those who are suffering from a state of matters for which they are in no way rsponsible.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the main facts relating to the financial condition of the Outer Hebrides have already been exhaustively dealt with by the noble Lord who has just sat down, and I do not propose to detain your Lordships by entering into a detail of figures and statistics. It is now nearly three years since the Local Government Board for Scotland received the two Reports dealing with the pressure of local rates in the districts
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0363"/>
<col>677</col>
referred to, and although they contained the statement that these rates formed an exceptionally heavy burden on an exceptionally poor community, no relief has yet been afforded. A sound basis for such relief was suggested by Lord Balfour of Burleigh as far back as 1902 in the Final Report of the Royal Commission on Local Taxation, but since those suggestions were made there has been an enormous increase in the burdens of these parishes, accompanied in most cases by a diminished rental.<lb/>
For many years the injustice of the incidence of the rates throughout the whole of the country has been recognised by successive Governments, with the result that the Imperial Exchequer has contributed towards local expenditure, those contributions taking the form of grants in aid, but such of these grants as were allocated in accordance with expenditure have in these parishes in proportion to the total expenditure greatly diminished. I think, in view of the existing high rates in these districts, that these grants cannot be considered as having proved adequate to removing the injustice caused by the inequalities in the local burdens. The chief sufferers under this heavy burden are not only the owners, but also the hotel-keepers, shopkeepers, and all those who occupy their own premises and pay the combined rate. It is, in fact, a prohibitive tax on industry and capital. The effect is to be seen in these impoverished districts.<lb/>
The noble Lord called attention to the difference in valuation per head of the population in different parishes in Scotland. Under such conditions it is, perhaps, hardly surprising to find that the combined county and parish rates amount in two parishes respectively to 27s. and 25s. in the &#x00A3;. These figures are certainly open to some criticism on the ground, as the noble Lord pointed out, that the parish rates are assessed on the net rental and not on the gross; but a more accurate means of ascertaining the true increase and extent of the ratepayers' burden might be obtained by taking the actual expenditure of the parish council for a year, and, having deducted all Government grants, comparing the figures with those obtained in a similar manner for some former year. On this basis the expenditure on poor relief alone in one parish has increased by over 50 per
<col>678</col>
cent. since 1896. That is after having deducted all Government aid.<lb/>
I think the real reason of these high rates is to be found in the low assessable rental of the population combined with the ever increasing demands made on the poorer parishes by progressive legislation. Economy in local administration could never remedy this, for even with the same amount of pauperism and the same expenditure per head the rate in these islands would still be six times as heavy as in Scotland generally. In giving your Lordships those figures I have assumed that the burden of pauperism is equal in the areas compared, but this assumption is not borne out by the facts, for the burden of pauperism is much heavier in these districts. A considerable portion of the population consists of cottars and squatters who pay neither rent nor rates, but receive the full benefit of the local government. But there is another factor directly contributing to the heavy poor rate in the numbers of these poor people who, having spent the whole of their lives working in industrial centres, return as paupers to the land of their birth. As an instance of this, I may mention that of fourteen applicants for relief before the South Uist Parish Council three weeks ago twelve had been made paupers in other districts on the mainland, only two being local inhabitants.<lb/>
In considering these financial difficulties it should also be borne in mind that practically the whole of the ratepayers, as agricultural occupiers, are only assessed on three-eighths of their rental under the Agricultural Rates Act of 1906. That Act, while very justly relieving the land of part of its excessive burden, did not reduce the total expense falling on the rates, and the agricultural rates grant, which was intended to recoup the parish for this reduction, has in these islands proved insufficient. The result is that owners and non agricultural occupiers have to bear the greater part of the extra burden caused by this reduction. There is no doubt that the taxable capacity of these islands is quite inadequate to meet the demands of local government. It is the natural result of the over-population of poor land, and the natural difficulties have been increased by dividing up the land into small holdings without any regard to economic conditions.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0364"/>
<col>679</col>
I recollect last year the Secretary for Scotland remarking in the House of Commons that the Vatersay question and similar troubles in these districts would be solved if the Crofters' Act had contained powers for the enlargement of holdings and for dividing up the land among the crofters. But I would point out that taking the land for this purpose unfortunately either curtails or abolishes the principal ratepaying subjects, and I think the noble Lord, in solving the one problem, would under our present system of rating rind himself confronted with another and probably more serious problem. I would make it quite clear to your Lordships that I am in favour of establishing small-holdings wherever possible. I think that is a principle on which we are all agreed; but it is relative to the subject we are discussing this evening to point out that the question is entirely an economic one and has a direct bearing on the rates. Even if these smallholdings could be made self-sustaining, their taxable capacity would still be inadequate to supply their local requirements, and nine-tenths of the local expenditure would still fall on the owners and non-agricultural occupiers. This is neither just nor is it expedient, for the State should recognise that the greater portion of this expenditure is raised for national purposes. In other words, many of these rates give no direct return to the ratepayers for the taxation levied. In these districts, from which the majority of the young men migrate to the large commercial centres, education certainly gives no return to those who paid for it. Yet efficiency in education is absolutely necessary to our national well-being. I think I may say it is almost as important as national defence, and in a similar manner its cost increases in accordance with the competition of other countries. Therefore, if His Majesty's Government have made up their minds, which I trust they have, to demand of these poor parishes an efficient administration of these services, services which the noble Lord has justly termed national services, I think they must of necessity pay for it.<lb/>
It is in districts such as these that we see the injustice of our present system of taxation, and it seems to me that the best remedy as regards these districts would be in the taking over of certain services by the State, services which are national in character
<col>680</col>
and of national importance. So far as these islands are concerned I would venture to point out to your Lordships that the chief objection to nationalising these rates does not apply. It is obvious that the parish councils are elected by those who have to pay the smallest proportion of the rates, consequently there cannot be the same incentive to economy of administration as in the wealthier parishes. I have taken the figures of four parishes, and find that the total amount paid in rates in respect of the occupancy of each croft averages 4<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., the bulk of the rates, amounting to over &#x00A3;5,000, being borne by the owner. These are abnormal conditions, and it is in view of these conditions that I am doubtful whether any scheme based on a system of Government grants would result in attaining the same degree of efficiency and economy in the administration of these islands as could be obtained by the nationalisation of the rates. But, considered in relation to the local taxation of the three countries, the scheme advocated by Lord Balfour is undoubtedly a far safer and more practical method of equalising these burdens. I do not wish to submit any proposal as to how His Majesty's Government should deal with this problem, but I would point out that the question is now in an acute stage, and that, pending some legislation in regard to our system of taxation, some temporary and exceptional measure of relief for these islands is urgently needed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH) </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, with the main lines of the case which has been presented to the House this afternoon I have no desire to quarrel, and perhaps I may be allowed, as Secretary for Scotland, to welcome, in the first place, the speech which the noble Earl who has just sat down has made and which I know to be delivered with much knowledge, to which I cannot pretend, of the facts and circumstances of the western islands. Lord Balfour of Burleigh, too, speaks on this subject with unique authority. On the one hand, he has held the office of Secretary for Scotland for many years; and I should like to take this opportunity of acknowledging how readily he has placed at the disposal, at any rate, of one of his successors, his great experience and knowledge on Scottish questions. But he speaks also with unique authority on this subject as having presided over the deliberations of
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0365"/>
<col>681</col>
the Royal Commission on Local Taxation, which reported, I think, some seven years ago.<lb/>
It is not probable that your Lordships will expect from me to-day any statement dealing with the recommendations of the Royal Commission, or any indication as to the policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to them. But perhaps I may be permitted to say this, that it must be a subject of general regret in all such cases that elaborate inquiries, involving great labour and much time, should take place and should then remain for many years before they are acted upon. The grievances remain, the inequalities as between localities or as between parishes remain, the clamour for assistance continues, the distinction between national and local services remains uneffected, and very often in the maze of grants, fee grants, stereotyped grants, assigned revenues, whisky money, and the rest of it&#x2014;in the maze of difficulty that surrounds the subject few people have the leisure or will give the energy to master the subject, with the result that the advocates of some special interest or some particular reform too easily capture the public attention and warp public opinion before it is really roused to consider the whole subject.<lb/>
Before I pass to the local case, perhaps I may say this on behalf of the Government on the general case which has been presented. While the Government have not been able to lay before Parliament or the public any proposals dealing generally with local taxation, some advance has been made on lines which are particularly associated with the name of Lord Balfour. I refer to the scheme which he propounded to the Royal Commission and embodied in the additional Report, by which highly-rated and poor localities might receive benefit at the expense of more fortunate districts, through a scheme of distribution of grants so calculated that they should give most help where most help was needed, and should have particular regard to ability to pay. In the Education Act which was passed last session for Scotland we adopted this principle.<lb/>
The moneys devoted by Parliament to Scottish education fall into two categories. By far the larger amount, something like two-thirds or more of the whole, is provided by annual votes in Parliament. The
<col>682</col>
remainder consists of moneys which from time to time and by various Acts of Parliament have been allocated to special educational purposes. There are grants which have been made in relief of fees, there are grants for secondary and technical education, and grants for many other purposes, totalling something like half a million of money. These grants were all devoted to some special purpose, permitting no co-ordination so far as their application went of the various kinds of education, and presenting a very intricate and difficult question to those who had to deal with it. The simple step was taken of paying all these sums into one fund and enacting that that fund should be distributed according to the very principle which Lord Balfour had advocated in his additional Report. It is obvious, however, that for a change of this kind to be carried out, unless great opposition is to be provoked, no authority must suffer by the change; that is to say, every local authority receiving grants must at least receive as much as it had received heretofore. In order, therefore, to carry out the scheme of giving greater aid to poor localities an additional sum was required, and &#x00A3;105,000 was provided by the Treasury to carry out that plan of distribution. If any such plan is applied on a general scale to the relief of local authorities a corresponding sum will, I venture to think, be required for the purpose. I mention this instance in order that it may be placed to the credit of the Government that they have at any rate done something to profit by the labours of the Royal Commission, and as showing some earnest of a desire to proceed to the reform of local taxation.<lb/>
I pass now to the special case brought before the House this afternoon of the rating of these parishes. The Hebridean parishes mentioned are eight in number, and there have on former occasions been difficulties and complaints in regard to the rating. The proprietor of part of the Island of Barra some three or four years ago declined to pay the rates due. The parish council resigned, and a clause of the Act of 1845 was put into force. A parish council was constituted of officials and the chairman of the last elected board, and the Poor-law and other Acts are administered now by that authority. There had been some unwisdom and carelessness in administration. That has been put right. The rate has been
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0366"/>
<col>683</col>
reduced by a considerable sum in the last three years under the more efficient management, and though the administration has not resumed its normal course, yet I trust that if no other difficulties supervene we may Le on a fair road to that end.<lb/>
In the Lews, which consists of four parishes, we are now confronted with a difficulty which has been raised by the refusal of the proprietor there to pay his rates. It becomes necessary, therefore, to consider what actually are the burdens borne by him in this respect. I do not intend to enter into, or to dispute, the figures given by the noble Lord who asks this Question, except in one particular. I do think it is necessary to bear in mind that Major Mathieson, whilst being the proprietor of the whole island, is also the occupier of various shooting properties on the island. The custom is for the owner to be rated in respect of those shootings not only as owner but also as occupier, but if the shootings are let he then recovers the rates from the shooting tenant. Therefore, that qualification must be borne in mind when the rates paid by the proprietor are mentioned.<lb/>
I will not quote the figures to your Lordships, but will content myself with stating what I understand to be the general situation in the Lews. The island consists of four parishes, but there is no question just now about the fourth parish, which contains the burgh of Stornaway. We are concerned with the three rural parishes. In the first place&#x2014;and here I rather demur to the statement made by the noble Earl who spoke second&#x2014;there is no adverse criticism so far as I am informed of the administration of the parish councils. They are economical, they have been careful, and have carried out their somewhat difficult and onerous duties to the satisfaction of all concerned. There has been no accusation of lax administration, or extravagance, or anything of that kind, and I trust they may continue to discharge the duties which they have performed satisfactorily in the past. The burden of the poor&#x2014;that is to say, the number of the poor&#x2014;is not excessive. The proportion of pauperism to the population is not excessive. It is under the average for Scotland. Take the parish of Barvas. The proportion in that
<col>684</col>
parish is under the average for Scotland, and that fact is very creditable to the people, for many of them are very poor. The burden of expenditure on the poor is not abnormal. That being so, there being no fault to find with the administration, the number of poor not being excessive, the burden of expenditure on the poor not being excessive, how is it that these high rates of which complaint is made come about? The explanation is, of course, that given by the noble Earl, Lord Dunmore.<lb/>
The real cause of the high rate is the low assessment. On whom does it fall? On what classes of ratepayers does this burden fall? The rate, broadly speaking, is borne half by the owner and half by the occupier. Major Mathieson is the proprietor of, practically, the whole island, and therefore the owner's rate falls almost exclusively upon him. Of the occupiers, upon whom does the burden fall? Take the parish of Barvas. The burden does not fall upon the crofters. Their rental is one-third of the whole rental of the island. What do they pay in rates? They pay from &#x00BD;<i>d</i>. to &#x00BD;2<i>d</i>. a week in rates. That surely cannot be considered an excessive burden. The burden, therefore, does not fall upon them. The reason they pay so low a rate is that they receive not only the benefit of the Crofters Act, but also receive relief from the Agricultural Rates Act. That is the explanation. Nor is the burden heavy on the farmers, who also receive relief from the Agricultural Rates Act. It really falls, so far as the occupiers are concerned, upon the merchants and the sporting tenants. There are not very many of them, and, as I have indicated, the proprietor is really responsible ultimately if the shootings are unlet for the rates of the sporting tenants. It is quite true that the nominal rate is high, that the burden on the rental, which is a low rental, is high, but the burden per head of population is not high. It is a remarkable thing that the burden per head of population is extremely low. The average annual amount of parochial assessment in respect of all the rates raised in these three parishes produces a burden of 5<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. per head of the population.</membercontribution></p>

<col>685</col>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH</member>: <membercontribution>I shall not forget to mention them. The burden per head of the population is 5<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>., whereas in the county of which this forms a part it is 10<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>.&#x2014;approaching double&#x2014;and in Scotland as a whole it is 10<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. There must be some explanation for this, and the explanation is largely to be found in the fact to which Lord Balfour has drawn attention, namely, that there is a large population in this island who pay neither rent nor rates, and who contribute certainly their share to the burden laid upon the education rate and upon the poor-rate. The real truth then is this, that the burden, taken as a whole, is not excessive; and bearing in mind that fact I confess I see great difficulty, pending a general reform of local taxation, in finding any method of affording relief to this island.<lb/>
The real truth is, it is the distribution of the burden among the population which is at fault. I will not go into the figures. They have been very much quoted, and the rate which Major Mathieson has had to pay has been stated. The fact has been published that in these three parishes the rates as a whole were 16<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>., 15<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>., and 17<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. That is the nominal rate. When it is desired to find the burden we must look at the burden of expenditure borne by this assessment. There are two observations to be made about that burden. In the first place, comparing this year with last year there is no increase in the burden. Comparing this year with three years ago there is no substantial increase in the burden. Comparing the burden this year with that of ten years ago, and bearing in mind that the general rise in parochial assessment throughout Scotland has been something like thirty-three per cent. in that period, there is no abnormal increase in the burden borne in the Lews. There is, of course, the difficulty of the existence of the cottar population, which entirely alters the distribution of burdens and throws an extremely heavy burden upon the proprietor.<lb/>
Your Lordships are aware that all this occurs in spite of the operation of certain grants voted by Parliament in the hope of giving relief to Highland districts. There is the Highland Relief Grant and there are the funds of the Congested Districts Board, of which some &#x00A3;30,000 have been spent in the last ten years in this island. It is not
<col>686</col>
to be forgotten, too, that the people who live here do not entirely subsist by the produce of their croft and their work in the islands. The able-bodied among them are employed in occupations outside the islands for a large part of the year, with the result that a sum of something like &#x00A3;127,000 in a named year went into the island, with the further result, calculated in these Reports, that the outside earnings of every crofter family came to something over &#x00A3;26. The operations of the Old Age Pensions Act passed last year have also had a remarkable effect in the Lews. A sum of no less than &#x00A3;18,600 will now go annually into that island as old age pensions. This, I hope, may have a good effect, in the first place, in reducing the number of those who are put upon the pauper roll, and, in the second place, in making it more easy for the older of these small tenants to pay their rents. When rents are mentioned, it ought, I think, to be recollected that there is no complaint, so far as I understand, on the part of the proprietors that rents are not fairly paid.<lb/>
I am extremely sorry not to be able to take a more hopeful view of the possibilities of the Government being able to help in this matter. It cannot, however, I think, be denied that, important as this question is to those concerned&#x2014;and I should be the last to minimise its importance&#x2014;it is neither large enough in scope nor typical enough in character to entitle the Government to commit themselves in respect of it to any general line of policy with regard to the main recommendations of the Royal Commission on Local Taxation. I have mentioned to your Lordships that we have tentatively and experimentally applied to part of the education money for Scotland the principle advocated by Lord Balfour. I trust that may give some relief to these parishes. It is intended to give them some relief. The final decision as to the application of that fund still rests with Parliament. A Minute will be laid before the House of Commons during this session, submitting for their approval a plan for the distribution of these moneys. I trust this may give some relief to the Lews parishes, though I know it may well be considered infinitesimal when placed by the side of the burden which the proprietor has to bear. And when I mention the proprietor I ought to say that it would be far more agreeable to me to be able to go further to meet his
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0368"/>
<col>687</col>
desires this afternoon, on public grounds if on no other; he is a considerate and kindly landlord who lives among his people and is deservedly popular; but, except indirectly, through the influences I have mentioned, I am not able to give any assurance on the part of the Government to-day.<lb/>
There is no reason, I believe, to anticipate any increase in the burdens which we have been discussing: it is more likely they will diminish. It must be borne in mind that, compared with the rest of Scotland, there has been no substantial increase in them during recent years. There remains the question of the cottars. I would ask your Lordships' attention for one moment to this question. The cottars form one quarter of the population of the island. Their stock is on the crofters' grazings, and their houses are either on the crofters' grazings or on the crofters' holdings. The movement for some regularising of their position deserves every sympathy and encouragement. Some of them are people who have no hope of a career, and whose only desire is to end their days where they are now; but the others include many who resent the position of inferiority in which they are placed, and some of whom, I hope, would be willing to become rentpayers and ratepayers like their neighbours. It must be demoralising to have in the community men escaping public burdens who are better able to bear them, in many cases, than those upon whom they fall; and I hope something will be done to bring these people within the area of rent-paying and rate-paying inhabitants, so that they may bear their share of this burden, which is all the heavier now because it is not properly and equitably distributed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the situation in the Lews, which has been laid before your Lordships to-night by Lord Balfour, is very serious indeed, and has become actually acute. The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland said that the proprietor had refused to pay his rates. The reason is that the proprietor cannot pay his rates. They amount to very nearly the whole of his income. The ratepayers, too, cannot pay their rates. Why? Because they have not the money. In the Island of Lewis the average rent of crofts is under &#x00A3;2. It is absolutely impossible for the crofters to make a living out of them. The noble
<col>688</col>
Lord says that the rates are inconsiderable in amount. So they are. But you must take them in relation to the rent which these people pay and their means.<lb/>
In the Lews you see the crofter system in perfection. The average rental is, as I have said, under &#x00A3;2, and one-fourth of the people are cottars and squatters. The noble Lord says that the cottars and squatters are people who very likely feel the indignity of their position. They feel very much injured because they are said not to contribute in any way to the advantage of the community. What I complain of is this, that it is exactly that class which the Secretary for Scotland is doing everything he can to encourage. If the cottars and squatters were a certain number of men beyond whom there would not be any increase, then I think it might be possible to deal with the difficulty; but the reason why it is perfectly impossible to deal with it is that as soon as you find a small-holding to accommodate one of these persons he sets to work to breed other cottars and squatters. And the more you divide up this island the more will the population increase and the greater will be the difficulties. The noble Lord at the present time continues encouraging landowners to break up their farms and divide them among these people. He is simply doing his best to create another Ireland, and before very long that result will follow. <lb/>
What consolation has Major Mathieson or the population of the Lews got from this debate this evening? None whatever. This is a difficulty which will not wait. The noble Lord says there has been no increase of rates during the last five years. I notice that when he forwarded the complaint of Major Mathieson to the Treasury, some Treasury clerk sent an answer to that effect. When rates have approached or surpassed 20<i>s</i>.in the &#x2014; what does it matter what increase there is? Even supposing there has been no increase within the last three years the income of the islands during that period has been unequal to meeting those rates. That is the difficulty with which we have to deal.<lb/>
This question of the outer islands is a most serious question and is becoming more serious every day. The noble Lord was asked last year if he was aware that
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0369"/>
<col>689</col>
there were between 7,000 and 8,000 squatters in the Lews, and he replied in the affirmative, adding that the matter was under his consideration. The trouble is that everything is under his consideration, and that everything remains there. I know no person who is better able than the Secretary for Scotland to give a sympathetic answer that has nothing in it. I defy anyone to extract anything&#x2014;certainly not comfort&#x2014;from any answer he gives. In this case what will happen? Major Mathieson is unable to pay his rates, and unless the noble Lord adopts some practical line of action the state of Lews will become, if possible, worse than it is now.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I ventured to observe the other evening, when we were discussing the affairs of Lady Cathcart's estate, that it seemed to me that the policy of His Majesty's Government was to promote the creation of what I described as uneconomic holdings in that part of Scotland. The debate which has taken place this evening I think absolutely confirms that impression. We have really had a most illuminating picture of the condition of the population of these islands. A great portion of them were described by my noble friend Lord Balfour, who speaks with special authority on these subjects, as being people who were parasites of the legitimate inhabitants of the islands. They pay no rent; they pay no rates. Occasionally they get the advantage of a liberal grant-in-aid out of public funds, and now, of course, old age pensions will be poured in liberally into these regions. It really looks as if these islands will be the only thoroughly happy and comfortable place to live at before long. There is one other most disquieting phenomenon which was touched on by by noble friend Lord Dunmore, to whom we listened with much pleasure on the occasion of his first speech in this House. He pointed out that, while all these things were taking place, the effect of this policy of creating new crofts, of giving these squatters slices out of other people's holdings, was to put an end to the existence of the only solvent rate-paying members of the community. The picture does seem to me to be a really alarming one, and I trust that on some future occasion we shall learn that His Majesty's Government are taking it a little more seriously than they appear to be doing at present.</membercontribution></p>
<col>690</col>
<p><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I shall trouble your Lordships with but very few observations. In regard to the condition of this island, my noble friend the Secretary for Scotland has said all that need be said, although, of course, I quite agree that the condition of things is not satisfactory. What I have risen to say a word upon is the line the debate has taken by reason of the observation of the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, that it is the desire of the Government to increase the number of squatters and cottars, who will breed other squatters and cottars, and so reduce these unfortunate islands to the condition of Ireland. I really think the noble Earl is not warranted in making that statement. I presume he referred to the Bill which this House refused to assent to more than a year ago.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN </member>: <membercontribution>I can assure the noble and learned Lord that I had not the Bill in my mind at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR </member>: <membercontribution>Then I will say no more. I was going to point out that the mere creation of smallholdings had no sort of relation with any method for perpetuating what I acknowledge to be a deplorable condition of affairs in some parts of the islands. As regards the general opinion which the noble Earl and the noble Marquess have expressed, I am quite certain that the Government wish nothing less than to continue the state of dependency and misery which exists in that part of the country. But what I was about to say falls to the ground when the noble Earl states&#x2014;and I accept unreservedly what he says&#x2014;that he was not referring to the Bill of a year ago.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN </member>: <membercontribution>If I used the word "holding" I can perfectly understand the interpretation which the noble and learned Lord put upon it. I was meaning crofts. What I was referring to was the policy that is being pursued at the present time by the Secretary for Scotland in urging the breaking up of farms and turning them into holdings on which these cottars and squatters may become tenants, which is invariably followed by the creation of more squatters and more cottars.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH </member>: <membercontribution>My
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0370"/>
<col>691</col>
Lords, I will not occupy more than a moment, but I desire to point the moral of what is admitted by the Secretary for Scotland. We have here a large class of people, the cottars and squatters, who pay no rent and no rates; and the noble Lord must remember that the crofters do not pay rates on anything more than the value of the croft. They do not pay rates on any improvements. Therefore, they might build an hotel on the croft or a house as big as an hotel, and they would not be rated upon it. So that we are really getting in the Lews an object-lesson of what would be rating on land values and nothing else, and I think the lesson is a very valuable one.</membercontribution></p>

<section>
<title>THE EDUCATION RATE.</title>
<p>*<member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member> <membercontribution>rose to call attention to the Circular 709 of the Board of Education giving notice that in the Code for 1909 the proportion of children in average attendance at public elementary schools to the number of teachers will be materially reduced, thus involving a considerable increase of the staff; and further giving notice that this is but a prelude to changes involving additional expenditure; and to ask His Majesty's Government whether they can state the amount of the increase in the rates which may be needful in order to meet these drastic changes.<lb/>
The noble Earl said: My Lords, it is so comparatively short a time since I drew the attention of the House to the burdens of local taxation and to the way in which national services were being paid for, not out of national but out of local funds, that I feel I owe some apology to the House for reverting to the question even in a different form and under different aspects, more particularly as the noble Lord, Lord Balfour, has just engaged your Lordships' attention in a somewhat lurid picture of the state of affairs in the Outer Hebrides. But I am afraid that we are closely approaching the time when that which is happening in <i>ultima Thule</i> will be happening in our immediate midst&#x2014;namely, when rates and taxes will between them absorb all the value of the land of this country.<lb/>
The utterances of the noble Lords opposite and of their colleagues in another place, full of sympathy with the ratepayers and of appreciation of the difficult
<col>692</col>
position in which they find themselves in regard to important national services, leave nothing to be desired; but what does leave a great deal to be desired is the tardy fulfilment of the promises noble Lords opposite have made. We, of course, expected that when the Budget for this year was produced there would be some increase in the income-tax payable on real property, but we did think that some consideration would have been given to the local ratepayer. Indeed, when I came to read the remarks of the Chancellor of the Exchequer I was buoyed up with hope at the earlier part thereof, in which he spoke of the promised consideration for the local ratepayer and the financial proposals which he intended to lay before the House which would enable him to make good that promise. I read on and on through the Chancellor's speech till I got to the end of it, but I did not find one single word about relief to the local ratepayer, and there is no such relief of any kind promised by His Majesty's Government. As far as real property is concerned, the only property which bears the burden of local taxation, more taxation is to be placed upon it when it is bequeathed, more taxation when it is settled, and more taxation when it is given away; and if it is situated, as mine is, in a populous district where the agricultural value is very small and the capital value considerably higher, it will be liable to additional taxation because some day it may be built on.<lb/>
The Prime Minister some little time ago received a very important deputation on the question of the burden of education on the local rates; and he said, speaking for himself and his colleagues, that in education they had the preventative of many social evils, and that unless education were kept in a state of complete and progressive efficiency they would have failed in their attempt. It is not only the ratepayers, but equally educationists, who view the present state of affairs with a feeling of grave alarm. A resolution was passed by the National Union of Teachers to the effect that the&#x2014;
<quote>"ever-increasing burden of rates is a grave menace to educational efficiency, and calls for immediate increase of grants from the Exchequer."</quote>
That is the view, not of the ratepayer, but of the educationist who is pressing the Government and the represensatives of the ratepayers to spend more money on education.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0371"/>
<col>693</col>
At the deputation to which I have referred a gentleman who represented the County Councils Association pointed out that the grievance among ratepayers was not so much against increased expenditure which the ratepayers and their representatives could control, as that imposed by Acts of Parliament and by Departmental circulars. The Prime Minister, replying to these observations, remarked that no greater disservice to economy could be done than to throw a disproportionate charge on the Exchequer while the actual daily management rested with the representatives of the ratepayers. It does not rest with the representatives of the ratepayers. The local authority has scarcely any real control; and I think Mr. Runciman must have smiled a little when those remarks were made by his colleague the Prime Minister, because he had all the time in his pocket, so to speak, the education Circular to which in a moment I shall draw your Lordships' attention. He had in the pigeon-holes of his office the bitter cry of the representatives of many local authorities. He had the proposals coming from Leeds to suspend the increase in the teachers' salaries in view of the growing increase in the rates. He knew that economies were being made even in fuel, and that there was an endeavour on the part of many local authorities to get back something by letting their schools for other purposes. Yet within a month of this deputation the Circular to which I draw your Lordships' attention was sent round to every one of the local authorities.<lb/>
What does this Circular do? It is a very unusual document. It is a forecast of the Code for the year 1909, and it is quite clear, I think, from the wording that the Department foresaw that it would create no small alarm in the minds of the local authorities if it came upon them as a bombshell in the shape of the Code itself. It was, therefore, circulated some time beforehand, in order to prepare their minds for the blow which was about to fall upon them. Under the terms of this Circular the Code for 1909 will provide that in future no class is to contain more than sixty pupils, and the size of the upper classes is to be still less, ranging from forty to fifty. Pupil teachers are no longer to be counted on the staff, and after August of this year no more men will be recognised as supplementary teachers, and such women as are recognised will be
<col>694</col>
allowed to teach only (1) scholars registered as infants, or (2) older scholars in the lowest class in a school of a rural parish in which the average attendance does not exceed 100. The value of head teachers will be reduced from 50 to 35 scholars&#x2014;a reduction of 30 per cent. Certificated assistants will remain as before, but uncertificated assistants will be reduced in value from 45 to 35 children&#x2014;a reduction of 22 per cent. It is necessary to bear mind that the staff represents three-fourths of the whole expense of a school. To call upon the local education authorities between now and August next to make this enormous change will involve a very heavy burden on the ratepayers.<lb/>
I have asked for a few figures from some of the local authorities to show approximately the magnitude of the extra charge which may be thrown on the local authorities. I am told that to carry the Circular out to its full effect in the county of Norfolk will mean an expenditure of &#x00A3;11,000&#x2014;equal to a rate of 2<i>d</i>. in the&#x00A3;; in Gloucestershire it will mean an expenditure of between &#x00A3;7,000 and &#x00A3;8,000, equal to an extra rate of 1&#x00BD;<i>d</i>, in the &#x00A3;; in Staffordshire an expenditure of between &#x00A3;5,000 and &#x00A3;6,000, equal to a rate of three-eighths of a penny; in East Suffolk, &#x00A3;3,400; in Nottinghamshire, &#x00A3;3,000; in Lincolnshire, &#x00A3;5,000. In Hertfordshire the rate is now 11<i>d</i>., which includes &#x00A3;3,000 spent on medical inspection. In Hampshire the additional cost will be very heavy, especially in the smaller schools where there are only from 75 to 100 children.</membercontribution></p>
<p>This expenditure will undoubtedly be more onerous in the country than in the towns, but in some of the towns it will be quite as heavy. In Sheffield it is estimated that the additional cost will be over &#x00A3;9,000 or an extra rate of 1&#x00BD;<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3;. I do not know whether the noble Viscount the Lord President of the Council is a considerable ratepayer in the town of Wolverhampton, but, if so, I have a grim satisfaction in feeling that his withers will not be unwrung. It is estimated that the cost will be &#x00A3;4,328 in Wolverhampton, necessitating an extra rate of 2 8<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3;. I see that the noble Viscount shakes his head. I also observed that the President of the Board of Education stated, in another place, that there had been a great deal of wild estimating on the matter among county councils.</p>

<p><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON)</member>: <membercontribution>Hear. hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW </member>: <membercontribution>I have asked in my Question that we might be furnished with actual facts and figures, and nobody will be more delighted than the local authorities of the counties I have referred to if it should prove that the cost is not quite so heavy as has been indicated. Then I am told that, although these may be the nominal requirements of the Department, a great deal of latitude will be left to the inspectors. I do not know which I most dislike&#x2014;the interference of a Government Department or the arbitrary impositions of Government inspectors. We know that all Government inspectors are human and many of them are faddists, and if we are to be left to the mercy of a faddist inspector of the Board of Education as to how far or how little the requirements of the Department are to be carried out, Heaven help the ratepayers! I think a little light may perhaps be thrown upon the origin of this very remarkable Circular. There is a very powerful organisation, powerful in the House of Commons as well as in the country, called the National Union of Teachers. That body holds an annual meeting at which all subjects of interest to educationists are discussed, and this Circular has not escaped attention. One of the speakers at the annual meeting said that&#x2014;
 <quote>"The Board of Education has happily seized the opportunity offered by the temporary cessation of strife over Education Bills to consider the staffing of public elementary schools and the size of classes, with the result that an admirable Circular had been sent out by the Board."</quote><lb/>
He went on to say that&#x2014;
<quote>"There were some 500 well-equipped college-trained certificated teachers waiting to fill the gap which would be caused by the new regulations of the Board of Education, and an additional 4,000 would be seeking employment in August."</quote>
Is it not remarkable that August should be the exact date which the Board of Education has fixed as the time when these extra teachers shall be employed! The National Union of Teachers was not blind to the fact that some grave difficulties would arise in the path of those who desired to see this Circular carried out if the whole burden were to fall on the ratepayers, and it was stated at that time that the strain on the local authorities would become intolerable, and a reaction would
<col>696</col>
set in unless something was done to relieve the burden on the rates.<lb/>
I read a speech the other day by a member of your Lordships' House, who has occupied a very high position in Government, and who is a very great authority on finance. He did not hesitate to advise those who act with him in his part of the country that local authorities and county councils would be justified, by a combined process of passive resistance, in making it impossible to carry out this Circular. I do not know whether that advice will or will not be acted upon, but, if it is, I should be very curious to know what would be the attitude of His Majesty's Government with regard to the administration of the Local Authorities (Default) Act. That is a very useful Act, and if it had been put in force in the recent Swansea case it might have been productive of much good. But His Majesty's present Goverment were not the authors of that Act. They were always opposed to it, and, as far as I know, have set their faces very deliberately against coercing any local authority under the powers conveyed by that Act. That is in the womb of the future, and I leave it to His Majesty's Government as to how they may deal with the action which recalcitrant local authorities may possibly take.<lb/>
It is very hard that Parliament, which does not represent the ratepayers&#x2014;and I am glad to see the Government now admit that the ratepayer and the taxpayer are not the same person&#x2014;should impose these burdens on them, but still more objectionable is it that by a stroke of the pen from a Government Department it should be possible to add 2<i>d</i>. to the rates without the county affected having any power to protest or remonstrate except through the voice of their representatives in Parliament. I really am surprised that Noble Lords opposite should support what I venture to think is so great a departure from sound Liberal principles. We are told now, in almost every Act affecting local administration, that in cases of need the Government Department may step in and force the representatives of the ratepayers to do that which they may be unwilling to do. There was a provision to that effect in the Small Holdings Act. There the Board of Agriculture is to step in and do
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0373"/>
<col>697</col>
that which the representatives of the ratepayers think may place an undue charge upon the rates. The same power of a Government Department to coerce representatives of the ratepayers is to be found in the Housing and Town Planning Bill, which will no doubt reach your Lordships' House later in the session. I do not for a moment deny that it may be extremely desirable, from an educational point of view, that schools should be better staffed than they are at present in some parts of England. The Circular states that the intention of the Board of Education is to bring those authorities who are behindhand in staffing their schools up to a level with those who, in their opinion, have their schools sufficiently staffed; and I notice that in some of the counties, more particularly in Cheshire, it is not expected that the Circular will produce any effect in increasing the cost of education. I do not know whether that is merely a coincidence, or whether it is due to the fact that the noble Lord opposite, Lord Stanley of Alderley, who, I think, is accepted by all of us as the greatest authority upon education in this House, happens to be a Cheshire man, and has brought his Cheshire people up to such a level that nothing is to be desired in that extremely well-managed county. But Cheshire, Lancashire, London, and other densely-populated counties have a very large rateable value, and the burden to their ratepayers is insignificant in comparison with the burden which is placed upon purely rural and agricultural counties like Norfolk and Suffolk.<lb/>
Your Lordships will have another opportunity of expressing opinion on this subject when the Code for 1909 is laid upon the Table; but, at any rate, I do hope your Lordships will declare, with no uncertain voice, that it is not desirable that, in the picturesque language which has been used elsewhere, Departments should be perpetually applying ginger to local authorities to make them do what the Departments deem to be their duty, but which they do not. I think that, as far as possible, local authorities ought to be left to administer the law that Parliament entrusted to them, and that this Circular, calling for enormous expenditure and issued by a stroke of the pen of a Government Department, ought either to be paid for out of funds provided by Parliament or to be discountenanced and discouraged by Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<col>698</col>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am not going to follow the noble Earl in any discussion as to the Budget, nor am I going to discuss the general question of finance. But there are one or two questions he has asked which I should like to dispose of at the beginning of the few remarks with which I shall trouble your Lordships. The noble Earl objected very strongly to this change which the Board of Education contemplate being announced by a Circular prior to the issue of the Code. That Circular was issued simply with the object of promoting public convenience. The Board of Education thought that, as they were proposing a considerable change with reference to the administration of educational affairs in the forthcoming Code, they should, as soon as, possible, before that Code was prepared, lay before the local authorities the changes contemplated. There was no <i>arri&#x00E8;re pens&#x00E9;e</i> in that proceeding. With reference to the statement of the noble Earl regarding the month of August, I would point out that the 1st of August is the date on which the new Codes always come into operation, and all changes of an important character must, for obvious reasons, take effect in that month.<lb/>
There are two totally distinct questions before your Lordships&#x2014; one educational and the other financial, and the two should be kept quite distinct. I am entirely in sympathy with the noble Earl with reference to the position of ratepayers. One of the greatest questions of the day is the unsatisfactory relations between local and Imperial taxation. I think that the ratepayer is often very unfairly treated under our present financial system, and the Government have made no secret that the first business of next session will be to deal with the Poor-law which is at the bottom of all these questions. Nothing will be satisfactory until Parliament deals with the whole problem of the Poor-law. I do not quarrel with the noble Earl in his complaint of any addition to local rates, but I think he has been sadly misinformed as to the facts of the case and as to the ultimate result of this Circular so far as cost is concerned.<lb/>
The objects of the changes introduced by Circular 709 are stated in paragraph 2 of the Circular itself, as follows:&#x2014;
<quote>"The Board aim, on the one hand, at a reduction in the size of classes, such as will afford relief to teachers, often seriously over-burdened, and secure
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0374"/>
<col>699</col>
more individual attention for scholars; and, on the other hand, at stimulating the employment of teachers possessing superior qualifications."</quote>
As regards the employment of teachers, the Circular is intended to encourage the employment of certificated teachers as compared with teachers holding lower qualifications, to discourage&#x2014;or rather to restrict the range of&#x2014;the employment of teachers who have no recognised qualifications at all, such as supplementary teachers, and to stimulate, so far as may be necessary, the employment of a greater number of teachers in individual schools, especially in small schools. I am very glad to see in his place the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford. When it was expected that this debate would come on at an earlier date, the right reverend Prelate wrote a letter to <i>The Times</i>, in which he expressed his regret that he would not be able to be present on that occasion to take part in the debate. The right reverend Prelate, however, made some very important remarks in that letter with reference to the position of unqualified teachers, and I hope he will say in the House to-day what he wrote to <i>The Times</i> on that question.<lb/>
If it is necessary to quote any authority in support of the reforms which the Circular contemplates, I should refer to the recommendations of the Royal Commission over which Lord Cross presided, and which reported as long ago as 1888. Both the Majority and Minority Reports laid stress on the laxity of the scale in the Code of that date prescribing the minimum staff of the schools, and pointed out that, as a matter of fact, the aggregate staff employed in the schools at that date was largely in excess&#x2014;to the extent, indeed, of forty-nine per cent.&#x2014;of the staff required for the aggregate number of children in average attendance. There was, in effect, available a very considerable margin of teaching power, and the Commissioners urged that steps should be taken to bring the requirements of the Code up to the standard of the practice of the great mass of the schools. The situation at the present day is very similar to that of 1888, and there is, in the aggregate, a considerably greater margin of teaching power, especially in the more highly-qualified grades of teachers.<lb/>
The Majority Report does not recommend any specific staff scale, but it com
<col>700</col>
ments strongly on the large size of the classes existing in many schools, and summarises the opinion of the expert witnesses who appeared before the Commission as being that the average maximum number for an ordinary class in the schools should be forty, and for the highest class twenty-five. The Minority Report in this respect is rather less drastic, and concludes with the following words:&#x2014;
<quote>"We are of opinion that, though in large schools with thoroughly efficient trained assistants classes of sixty in average attendance may be satisfactorily taught, yet that classes of fifty would be far better, and that it would be more easy to educate as well as to instruct them."</quote>
Some progress has been made since 1888 towards introducing the reforms advocated, and the staff scale was gradually raised in some particulars, but no substantial change has been made since 1898; and, as regards the size of classes, it may fairly be said that the reforms advocated in 1888 have been very long overdue. This is a difficult matter to explain except to experts. But the question on which this reform turns is the number of teachers to be employed properly to staff a school. What is proposed is this, and I think the House will see that in a typical case it is not a very extravagant proposal. The number of scholars for which the head teacher counts is reduced from fifty to thirty-five; the certificated assistant teacher counts for sixty as hitherto; the uncertificated teacher counts for thirty-five instead of forty-five, and the supplementary teacher for twenty instead of thirty.</membercontribution></p>

<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON </member>: <membercontribution>That is to be the measurement of the staff, as a whole, but there is no interference with the local authority as to its distribution. The local authority will redistribute, alter, regrade, or do what they think proper, but they must have a certain number of teachers in a school which contains a certain number of scholars. They will apportion them among the classes, and they are given greater freedom in this respect than formerly. Every one desires the improvement of education, and the only way to do it is to improve the qualifications of the teachers and not to overwork them. I think I may say that, so far as educational
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0375"/>
<col>701</col>
considerations are concerned, the Circular has been received with general approval, and those interested in education would be glad to see the reforms carried out. The whole of the criticism of the Circular has been focussed on its financial aspect&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>SEVERAL NOBLE LORDS </member>: <membercontribution>Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON </member>: <membercontribution>And it has been urged that such great additional burdens should not be imposed on local authorities without additional State aid.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>SEVERAL NOBLE LORDS </member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON </member>: <membercontribution>If the Imperial Exchequer would find the funds, there would be no objection to the principle.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>SEVERAL NOBLE LORDS </member>: <membercontribution>Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON </member>: <membercontribution>That certainly narrows it down. There are good reasons for believing that the financial burden likely to be imposed by these changes has been greatly exaggerated. Although since 1888 the staffing scale has several times been made more severe, I am not aware that the successive changes have been made the occasion of demands for increased aid from the State; and if it is the case that the Circular&#x2014;or rather the Code in which it will be embodied&#x2014;only requires some authorities to do what other, and very similar, authorities have been both willing and able to do on their own initiative&#x2014;in other words, if the Circular only contemplates a levelling up to the standard of good or adequate existing practice&#x2014;the case for increased Exchequer aid to be given to all authorities alike is not a very strong one. I do not wish to say anything disrespectful of the local authorities, but I know the source from which a good deal of this information comes. Estimates have been published in certain areas which not only show signs of hasty or careless work, but also indicate a disposition to make the worst of it. The language of the Circular is not, I think, open to the charge of obscurity or want of precision; but, even if it were, it must be remembered that it is addressed to experts, or at all events to bodies who have experts in their employment, and nothing would have been easier than for those bodies to address a question to the Board of Education on any point on which they did not feel certain. Very few inquiries, however, have in fact
<col>702</col>
been addressed to the Board by authorities as to the meaning of the Circular.<lb/>
The principal points on which the Circular has been misunderstood are the following: It has been assumed that a certificated teacher would be required, not only for each complete group of 80 children at a school, but also for each fraction of a group over and above a complete group. The illustration given in the Circular itself seems to me to render this interpretation quite out of the question. It has also been assumed that the individual teacher in a school may not teach a larger number of scholars than that for which he counts when the sufficiency of the staff as a whole is being considered. For instance, it has been assumed that, because the uncertificated teacher counts for 35 children in the staff scale, he may not teach a class of more than 35 children. This misunderstanding was removed by the answer given as long ago as April 5 in the House of Commons by the President of the Board of Education to Mr. Charles Roberts.<lb/>
The methods of estimating the financial effect of the Circular in some areas have been singularly hasty and fallacious. It is, however, quite possible to form a very fair estimate of the financial effect, and some very excellent specimens of close estimating have in fact been furnished to the Board of Education. In some cases, however, the estimator has contented himself with doing a very simple sum in arithmetic. He has argued that as the teaching value of certain grades of teachers has been reduced at certain rates, therefore new teachers must be provided to make up the aggregate teaching value of all the teachers in the area to the figure at which it stood before the reduction. This method is doubly erroneous. In the first place, it entirely ignores any existing margin of teaching powers in the aggregate staff, and it entirely ignores the margin in the staff of individual schools, by reference to which alone any reliable estimate can be formed. It assumes that, if the authority had, say, 20 per cent. margin under the old conditions, it must maintain the same margin under the new conditions. It is quite possible, however, that the practice of the authority is so far above the old scale that in these cases no increase of the staff at all would be required. In other cases the estimating officer has taken each school and class separately, but has entirely
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0376"/>
<col>703</col>
ignored the possibility of any adjustment by regrading or reclassifying the school and by redistributing the staff. Where this method of estimating has been pursued, and at the same time the Circular has been misunderstood in the way I have already described, it has not been at all difficult to produce a most alarming financial result.<lb/>
The noble Earl referred me to Wolverhampton. Having been chairman of the Wolverhampton School Board, I am not quite ignorant on this point, and I have gone into the question of Wolverhampton. Wolverhampton has a very good school staff at the present moment, and I am satisfied that the additional expenditure of putting the Circular in force will be practically insignificant&#x2014;you would have some difficulty in giving it a rate value at all. I know it was widely reported that the Wolverhampton authorities anticipated that the Circular would involve an additional expenditure equivalent to a rate of much more than 2<i>d</i>. in the &#x00A3;. I am informed by the Board of Education that this is an entire mistake, and that there is no reason to anticipate that the changes announced in the Circular will involve any substantial increase in respect of salaries.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW </member>: <membercontribution>Does the town clerk admit that?</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON </member>: <membercontribution>I am quite sure the town clerk would not form any opinion that he was not satisfied was perfectly sound and right, but it is evident that he has arrived at a conclusion on the figures supplied to him which is not correct. Another case to which publicity has been given is that of the borough of Leicester, where it was estimated that additional staff costing &#x00A3;3,310 would be required. I am informed that at least &#x00A3;3,000 can safely be struck off this estimate. The calculations of the Leicester authority appear to have been based on the present size of existing classes, and make no allowance for the possibility of regrading. I may say, in passing, that one case is quoted in Leicester of a class in Standard VII having an average attendance of no fewer than 88 scholars under a single certificated teacher. I put it to your Lordships whether that can be defended on any ground whatever. As regards other areas, I have seen estimates that, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the cost of additional salaries would be &#x00A3;23,000 a
<col>704</col>
year, and that in the county of Durham the cost would be no less than &#x00A3;20,000 a year. I am advised that these figures may safely be rejected. No estimate is worth anything which does not take account of the possibilities of adjustment by regrading and reclassifying schools, and by redistributing the existing staff.<lb/>
In the areas of almost all local authorities there is a very considerable margin of teaching power in the aggregate. Without this aggregate margin, there could, of course, be no margin in the individual schools. The problem is to distribute the available staff in such a way that there shall be a sufficient margin in all schools and no excessive margin in any school. In one case&#x2014;that of Leicestershire&#x2014;I am informed that the very able Director of Education has made an exhaustive inquiry into the circumstances of every school, and has found that a saving of between &#x00A3;700 and &#x00A3;1,000 on his first estimate can be effected by redistribution of staff, reducing the cost involved by the Circular to practically nothing at all. If it is said that there are educational objections to adjustment by redistribution, regrading and reclassifying, I can only say that I am informed that in, many cases distinct educational advantages would result. It is, perhaps, rather a bold prophecy to make, but I am not at all sure that in the end some local authorities will not have reason to bless the Circular which has been issued by the Board of Education for calling their attention to points in which economies can be legitimately effected by improved. administration.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW </member>: <membercontribution>Could the noble Viscount say what the original estimate in Leicestershire was and what it has been reduced to?</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON </member>: <membercontribution>No. I have not the figures, but the Director of Education has, after making exhaustive inquiry, found that a saving of between &#x00A3;700 and &#x00A3;1,000 on his first estimate can be effected by redistribution of staff. The noble Earl alluded to the requirement in the Circular that no class shall contain more than 60 scholars on the registers. Speaking generally, I do not think it is too harsh to say that, if a local authority is severely hit by this rule, it does not deserve much consideration. It may, of course, be conceded that where an authority
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0377"/>
<col>705</col>
has inherited a long-standing deficiency of accommodation or a large number of badly designed or arranged school buildings which require replacement, or has really had great difficulties in meeting the demands of a growing population, it would be unfair to condemn it without qualification for teaching some of the children in unduly large classes. This consideration applies to a case like that of Newcastle-on-Tyne, where the problem of school accommodation is admittedly a difficult one. But I am informed that in Newcastle there were quite recently 331 classes with over 60 scholars on the roll, 52 classes with 70 or more scholars on the roll, and 16 classes with 75 or more scholars on the roll. I think that shows how very desirable it is that some improvement should take place.<lb/>
After all, however, there remain a very considerable number of local education authorities who, it is believed, will either not be affected at all, or not affected very seriously, by the new Regulations. Among county areas I may refer to the cases of Lancashire, Cheshire, Surrey, Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, and Leicestershire. Among urban areas I may mention London and the county boroughs of Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Plymouth, Devonport, Bradford, Blackburn, Burnley, Norwich, Yarmouth, Croydon, West Hartlepool, Southport, Chester, and other places. In some cases improvements have been contemplated, or are already in progress, which will be completed before the effect of the new Regulations is felt; and it is, of course, quite unfair to attribute to the new Regulations the cost of improvements which would in any case have been undertaken, or which the authority would have been obliged to undertake, under the old Regulations. There has, I am afraid, been a disposition to saddle the Circular with some expenses which do not properly belong to it.<lb/>
The noble Earl complained that under this Circular the local authorities will be placed more at the mercy of the Board's inspectors. In administering a great Department of the State you must trust your officers, and having been concerned with educational matters for some years I can safely say that there is no staff of public servants who deserve more confidence than the staff of inspectors under the Board of Education. Their instincts are not to spend but to save money, to get as good an
<col>706</col>
education for as small an amount of public expenditure as is possible. There is not the least reason to fear that His Majesty's inspectors as a class will act with less discretion and consideration in the future than they have in the past. I admit that the new Regulations will constitute an important change, but it is a step onward, and I cannot think that the House of Lords will express disapproval of an attempt made by a very competent Board of eminent administrators to carry out a policy which Lord Cross's Commission of twenty years ago recommended as desirable. Politics have nothing whatever to do with this matter. The Board of Education are proceeding cautiously and carefully, and I believe that when effect has been given to this scheme we shall all be glad to admit that it has brought about a great improvement in the public education of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD BELPER:</member> <membercontribution>My Lords, I listened with great interest to the speech of the noble Viscount, very conciliatory in tone, but a great part of it an <i>ex parte</i> statement with regard to the financial liability which will be cast upon the boroughs and counties. There was one remark which the noble Viscount made at the beginning of his speech in which I entirely concur&#x2014;namely, that two questions are involved, one educational and the other financial; and to my mind it is a great mistake if we to-day succeed in mixing up those two questions in any way. Let me say, speaking for the County Councils Association, that they recognise that fully. They recognise that the educational question is one on which there may be all the satisfaction which has been expressed by the noble Viscount, and many of the county councils would, I know, be very willing to see this reform carried out if it could be done without a large additional burden on the ratepayers. For that reason the resolution which has been passed by the Executive Council of the County Councils Association does make this very clear distinction, for it declares that&#x2014;
<quote>"Whilst abstaining from any consideration of Circular 709 until a report thereon has been obtained from the educational committee, the Council deprecates the practice of imposing heavy additional burdens on the ratepayers by Departmental circulars without previous discussion in Parliament."</quote>
That, I think, is a very intelligible ground to take up. As a matter of fact, this
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0378"/>
<col>707</col>
resolution was carried almost unanimously, only one gentleman voting against it, and I believe it very fairly represents the feeling of the county councils with regard, as I say, to the financial part of this scheme.<lb/>
The noble Viscount said the object of the Circular was to give notice to the local education authorities as to what they might expect in the Code; but what we complain of is this, that in the middle of March, at the time when the estimates for the coming financial year are made up, there is suddenly sprung on the county councils and borough councils, without any notice and without consultation of any sort, this Circular, which if it is to be carried out must throw some financial burden, at all events, on a great number of authorities during the course of the financial year. It is an axiom of those who manage the affairs of the nation that they cannot entertain any alteration of the estimates after the time that the estimates have been considered; and surely, knowing that the financial estimates of the year in every educational body&#x2014;and they form a very large part of the rates that have to be raised&#x2014;are always made in March, it is unreasonable in March to send down a Circular to county councils which will cause their estimates to be reconsidered.<lb/>
The other point I wish to put is that the circumstances under which this Circular has been brought forward are such as to cause very strong feeling indeed amongst local education authorities. Let me revert to the point which Lord Onslow put in his opening speech. There was a very influential deputation, representing every education authority in England and Wales, which was the result of a meeting at which resolutions were passed unanimously urging the Government to readjust the education burden, which was so much larger compared with the grant given by the Government than in years past, and especially dwelling on the question of medical inspection. The Prime Minister received that deputation, and he not only declined until the whole question of local taxation was considered to give any relief for education, but he absolutely refused to give anything at the time for medical inspection, although there had been a provisional promise a year ago that some grant would be given on this heading. Mr. E. N. Buxton, the well-known educationist, who was once Chairman of the London School Board and is now
<col>708</col>
Vice-Chairman of the Education Committee of the County Councils Association, pointed out that the Act which dealt with medical inspection was one with which they all sympathised, but it was supplemented by an expansive Circular sent out by the Board of Education necessitating extra financial burdens. The Prime Minister, in reply, said&#x2014;
<quote>"I do not think, as to that, there is any point in regard to which the head of the Education Department has increased the severity of the burdens; in fact, he had no power to do so by any Circular from whatever source it may come."</quote><lb/>
I hailed with great delight the statement of the Prime Minister that the Board of Education has no power to issue regulations increasing the charge put upon the rates by the Act. I quite admit that this does not refer intimately to the matter now before us, but when the question of medical inspection comes up again the statement of the Prime Minister will be very valuable evidence with reference to the position taken up by the Board of Education in trying to force particular expenditure in regard to medical inspection upon the authorities. It did strike us as rather a strong instance of the irony of the situation that the very next day the Circular to which the noble Earl has called attention was issued, putting this additional burden upon local education authorities. We feel very strongly upon this matter, and I sincerely hope, after the statement that the noble Viscount has made, that the charge will not be so high as has been anticipated. But I should like to ask him to, at all events, consider, when the time comes, the estimates and figures brought forward by the educational authorities.<lb/>
We have a committee of the County Councils Associations sitting this week which will have information from all the counties in England with regard to their estimates. I can assure the noble Viscount that we have no wish to exaggerate what those estimates are likely to be. They will be very carefully sifted, and if it comes to a question whether this will put any, or a serious, burden on counties, I hope the Board of Education will promise to give consideration to our statement as well as to the facts that they have gathered themselves. I only mention that because there was another occasion, with regard to medical inspection, when, although our figures had been very carefully collected, the Board of Education declined to discuss
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0379"/>
<col>709</col>
the matter with us at all. I trust that, as there is some doubt as to what this extra charge will be, the matter will be carefully looked into with a view on both sides of arriving at a true solution. With no wish to say anything with regard to the educational part of the question, I do desire again to enter a strong protest&#x2014;and in this matter I think I am speaking on behalf of a very large number of counties in England&#x2014;against these charges being continually put upon the ratepayers, charges many of which have not the direct sanction of Parliament and which the authorities themselves could not foresee, and, therefore, have not been able to include in their estimates.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD STANLEY OF ALDERLEY</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I will not at this hour go at any length into this question, but I desire to made one or two remarks on the Circular. In the first place, having given a good deal of attention to it and tried as far as I could to verify some of the figures that have been published as to its probable extra cost, I wish to say that, in my opinion, the information on which the noble Earl who initiated this discussion has relied is grossly exaggerated. The suggestion of an increased burden of 2<i>d</i>. in the pound is far beyond any possibility. Twopence on the rate throughout England and Wales would amount to &#x00A3;1,300,000 or &#x00A3;1,400,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW </member>: <membercontribution>I only mentioned one county&#x2014;Norfolk.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD STANLEY OF ALDERLEY</member>: <membercontribution>I do not think we are competent at this moment to discuss the financial question properly. It requires very careful examination. I am obliged to the noble Viscount the Lord President of the Council for the official information he has given us, but I feel that in a question like this it is important that the financial side should be gone into very carefully, the local authorities being able to be heard and to explain their views. I cannot help thinking that if a small and able committee of the County Councils Association could call at the Board of Education and confer with the officers of the Board, the matter could be cleared up.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Runciman,</member> <membercontribution>in the reply which he gave in the House of Commons the other day, stated that five county authorities had submitted to him their own estimate of what the proposals in the Circular were going to
<col>710</col>
cost&#x2014;namely, Gloucester, Hertfordshire, Devonshire, Bucks, and Cheshire. After all, these are the figures coming from the authorities themselves, who would certainly not understate the case of pressure; and I may say that, having worked out the figures which they gave, according to Mr. Runciman's answer, I find that on the question of teaching staff the increase in the cost in these five counties, on their own statement, is 2.7 per cent., and if we take the increase on the whole of their maintenance cost it would be under 2 per cent.<lb/>
I was very much surprised when I read the statement made by the Town Clerk of Wolverhampton, and I have taken some trouble to test his statement. Having gone into the matter I am absolutely satisfied, as the noble Viscount below me is, that the Town Clerk of Wolverhampton was unnecessarily terrifying his town council and that he raised a perfectly gratuitous scare. Among other things, he stated that, on account of the alteration of the size of classes and the value of the teachers, they would have to build a very large number of additional class-rooms. I have obtained the latest figures of Wolverhampton, and find that this is a town which has very materially neglected its duty in the way of school provision. There were a large number of schools scandalously overcrowded, and I took the opportunity of observing to this official that the evidence showed that, quite irrespective of any Circular, they were under an obligation to make a considerable addition to their school provision. The answer I received was that they were at present building for 1,200, and plans were being prepared for the accommodation of a further 1,200.<lb/>
This Circular is a very belated contribution to the bringing of our teaching staffs of elementary schools up to something like the standard as to numbers which efficiency requires. I wish sometimes that a noble Lord from Scotland would tell us how very much behindhand we are in the matter of education as compared with Scotland. To give England the same proportion of certificated teachers as Scotland possesses the number would have to be increased by 26,000, and the training college accommodation would have to be twice enlarged. I should like to ask how many supplementary teachers there are in the whole of Scotland, and what proportion they bear to the teaching staff. The fact is that
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0380"/>
<col>711</col>
we are wretchedly behindhand. We have been going on teaching our children with teachers incompetent for the purpose, and the sooner we make up our minds that that is to come to an end the better. I am glad to say that a large number of the county authorities have increased their staffs; and it is improbable that the cost of acting on the Circular will be more than a halfpenny rate in the small fringe of counties where the schools are understaffed.<lb/>
Now, may I say a word in sympathy with those who have spoken from the other side? Though I think this Circular was rightly issued, being intended to be a warning and intimation and to pave the way to enable people to discuss and consider what would come later in the Code, I do feel that in this time of transition and ever since the Act of 1902 the local authorities have had very heavy work put upon them. They have had very heavy expenses to incur, and some of them have rushed into expenses that they need not have incurred. The National Union of Teachers is a very powerful organisation, and is always contending that the teacher is the person who ought to get the money; and anyone who has studied the figures of expenditure on schools since 1902 will see that the larger portion of the increased expenditure has been on the salaries of the teachers, and I think if there had been little more caution at the beginning the pinch would not be so great now. The local education authorities have had many problems to tackle which would have proved difficult in the case of authorities that had been at work for many years and were thoroughly familiar with all the details of administration. Therefore, I do sympathise with the local authorities who would like to have a little breathing time, and I also sympathise very much with those noble Lords and others who feel that there ought to be some protection of the rights of self-government possessed by local authorities in charge of education.<lb/>
Complaint has been made of the great amount of administrative discretion put into the hands of the Board of Education. You could not possibly administer an education Code without giving immensely wide powers of an administrative character to the Board of Education; but I do say that the present Board is pressing Depart
<col>712</col>
mental authority a little too far. I will take the case of the medical inspection of schools. I was delighted when I saw the statement made by the Prime Minister that Departmental circulars cannot extend a statutory right. There is no doubt that the Board of Education has taken upon itself in its Departmental circulars, and now in the Code, to invent an officer called a school medical officer&#x2014;an officer not contemplated by the Act requiring medical inspection; and the Board of Education is practically trying to force upon local authorities the appointment of one medical officer for the county who should be associated with the work of schools. As to whether that is good or not I do not express an opinion, but I do feel that there ought not to be an attempt by Departmental circulars to exercise powers which the Act of Parliament never conferred.<lb/>
There is another matter to which I should like to refer. I daresay some noble Lords may have seen, in the course of the recent controversy about this Circular, that there appeared a long <i>communiqu&#x00E9;</i> in the <i>Morning</i> Post giving an official explanation of the purpose of the Circular. The <i>Morning Post</i>, which has been a remarkably ably-conducted paper on this matter of education, had a leading article in which it was stated that this was the " official explanation." I do not think the Board of Education ought to publish commentaries and explanations on their own circulars through a newspaper. If that is to be done, it should be done officially from the Department itself.<lb/>
I do think that the Circular is a little obscure and requires clearing up. There is a point in it which I wish to criticise because it illustrates what I have been objecting to&#x2014;excessive Departmental interference with local management. It is quite true that the Circular gives general values for the staff and in some ways gives greater liberty to the local managers than the old Code did, because whereas the old Code earmarked a particular teacher for his own value, the new Code leaves discretion to the managers and to the head teacher to organise the school and to put a teacher at considerably more than what I would call his face value provided that the staff as a whole satisfies the requirements as to numbers. What I do not like is that the Code gives the Government inspector the power of making what I would call a per-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0381"/>
<col>713</col>
sonal assessment of each individual teacher. The Government inspector may object to any teacher being sent to any class which the inspector thinks he is not competent to teach. I think that is too minute an interference. The Code should say that you must have teachers of proper qualifications and that the teachers of proper qualifications are valued at so much. I hope that the inspectors will be a little restrained on that point; otherwise the inspector will become something that he ought not to be. He will be the organiser of the school instead of these matters being left in the hands of the local authority.<lb/>
There are many other things that one might say, but at this late hour I will conclude by repeating that in my opinion the Circular is only a small instalment of what is due to the efficiency of education. At the same time I would be glad if the Government could satisfy the apprehensions of the local authorities by showing in detail that it will not cost what they think it will, and if they would restrain what I must call the grasping at power by the officials of the Board of Education. At this moment the Board of Education has not exactly the confidence of the people who locally administer education, and I think a greater sense of security among those who manage the schools would be very valuable to the public.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE LORD BISHOP OF HEREFORD:</member><membercontribution>My Lords, I rather hesitate to ask your Lordships' indulgence at this late hour, but there are one or two words I desire to say. I would not venture to intrude with reference to finance, except to say that, in my opinion, there is no more wasteful finance than the continuance of an expensive and inefficient system of staffing our schools and maintaining them. But what I rather desire to say is a word or two on behalf of the children from the educational point of view. I venture to think that it has not been sufficiently emphasised to-night that the real business of the Board of Education is to see that the system of education is efficient, and, as I understand this Circular, without, of course, committing myself to approval of every little detail in it, it means that the Board of Education is desirous of making our system in some sense really efficient. If the Board of Education has failed at all hitherto it has been in the way of being far too tender and too dilatory in this respect.
<col>714</col>
The Board is met with two great obstacles&#x2014;first of all, the excessive size of the classes in a great many of our schools. I am quite sure that none of us would be satisfied if our own children were being educated, at any age, in classes of sixty, seventy or eighty under one teacher, and, therefore, I cannot but feel that the Board of Education deserves our entire support in its endeavour to reduce the number of children in each class. Then, again, the Board is met with the prevalence, in some parts of the country, at any rate&#x2014;a prevalence which is not decreasing&#x2014;of uncertificated and unqualified teachers. Many of these teachers have no adequate knowledge of the duties they are called upon to perform. I may venture to mention to your Lordships a little experience of my own. Some time ago we established for my city and neighbourhood a system of special classes for pupil teachers, and in establishing those classes I ventured to make it known that we should be glad to see any of the uncertificated teachers at our classes who chose to come, so as to improve their education, and a considerable number of those teachers came. But the masters in charge of the classes very soon reported that they had nearly all disappeared, and when we inquired the reason we found that it was that they were ashamed to expose their ignorance before the pupil teachers in the classes. That led us to try another experiment&#x2014;namely, the forming of special classes for uncertificated teachers. Again they came in good numbers, but very soon the classes almost entirely dwindled away, because so many of them were ashamed to show their ignorance before one another. These Article 68 teachers have been rechristened supplementary teachers, but they are still being appointed in large numbers in many parts of the country. I venture to think that it is the plain duty of the Board of Education, by some such means as this Circular, to stop the appointment of teachers who possess no known qualification except, I believe, that they are eighteen years of age, of good character, and have been vaccinated.<lb/>
If this liberty to appoint uncertificated and cheap teachers is to go on, we are left in this ridiculous position, that we have established a certain number of training colleges and are turning out students from those colleges, a great number of whom cannot obtain situations without having to wait a considerable
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0382"/>
<col>715</col>
time owing to the places for which they are fully qualified having been already occupied, and occupied in many cases by the very young people who failed to pass the tests of qualification which these students did pass. Indeed, the only qualification which many of these cheap teachers possess is that they have failed to pass the examination necessary to enter the training colleges. I do think that, in the presence of such a state of things, we ought to give our sympathetic and hearty support to every endeavour on the part of the Board of Education to make the system of education with which it is charged as efficient as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I cordially concur in what was stated by the noble Viscount the Lord President and also by Lord Belper that the question must be looked at from two totally different points of view, and I think I can say, conscientiously, that during the three and a-half years I was privileged to be President of the Board of Education I did my utmost to promote the efficiency of education and to emphasise the necessity of considering the heavy burdens which the ratepayers had to bear.<lb/>
The provisions of the Circular have been fully dealt with, and your Lordships will hardly expect me to re-discuss them. But I should like to say that, from the education point of view only, I find no fault with the Circular. The right reverend Prelate alluded to the hardship to those teachers who have gone through a course of training and who at the present moment find themselves in a position in which they are unable to take advantage of the training they have undergone. I concur with what he said. I think that after they have trained themselves to become teachers, and in view of the important fact that each of those would-be teachers has cost the State something like &#x00A3;200, their services should not, if possible, be lost to the State or any injustice done to them. I would, however, remind the right reverend Prelate that a few years ago there was a shortage of trained teachers, and the Board, to meet this, had to sanction the employment of untrained teachers. These supplementary teachers having come to the rescue and done their work honestly and conscientiously, it does seem to me that these drastic provisions will bear hardly upon them.<lb/>
I turn now to the other side. There is
<col>716</col>
no question that in all parts of the country there has been great complaint of the way in which the rates have increased, and undoubtedly in all parts of England the education rate has risen very materially and has caused great grumbling on the part of the unfortunate ratepayers. This Circular must, to a certain extent, increase the rates. Whatever the actual figures may be, there is no doubt that there will be an increased expenditure as a consequence of this Circular. In the first place, there must be new class-rooms to accommodate the more numerous classes, and the replacement of less expensive teachers by more expensive teachers must, of necessity, increase the cost. It is in rural schools, where the numbers are small and supplementary teachers are employed to a considerable extent, that the cost under this head must naturally fall. It is in the rural districts and not in the towns that the burden of this extra expense will be most heavily felt.<lb/>
There is great diversity of opinion as to what is to be the cost of the new Regulations under this Circular, and I think we are justified in asking for some statement on that subject from His Majesty's Government. I think we should be justified in even moving for a Return giving some idea as to the cost before we accede to this proposal. Perhaps the noble Lord who will follow me will be able to give us the figures, but, if not, I hope he will tell us that when the Code is brought up the Government will be able to give the figures on which they base their estimate as to what the cost will be. An important deputation, as has been pointed out, waited upon the Prime Minister on March 18, before the issue of this Circular, to urge upon the Government the necessity for increased grants for education. Mr. Hayes Fisher said on that occasion&#x2014;
<quote>"Buildings, equipment, every single item of expenditure in connection with education, was going up, most of all, necessarily so, that for the increase of the salaries of teachers. Hygiene, manual education, physical education, organised games, all conjured up a vista of expenditure, all of which was falling on the ratepayer. The pressure of the Department, of expert opinion, and of public opinion, all tended to make the cost of education greater. But the relative portion of the charges borne by the ratepayer had increased, and must increase unless they got more Exchequer grant. From 1892 to 1902 the Exchequer grant was more than sixty per cent. of the total cost. Since 1902 that percentage had been gradually going down, and was now less than fifty per cent."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0383"/>
<col>717</col>
It cannot be said that the Prime Minister, in his reply, offered the deputation any satisfaction. Mr. Asquith said&#x2014;
<quote>"It was quite true that the Royal Commission on Local Taxation described education as, at any rate in the larger sense, a national service, and he agreed with them. But it was a national service, as they pointed out, which was locally administered&#x2014;in other words, a service in which the representatives of the taxpayer had no direct or immediate control. When they were dealing with a service national in its character but local in its administration they could do no greater disservice to economy, and therefore to efficiency, than by throwing a disproportionate amount of the charge upon the central Exchequer, while the actual daily effective management rested with the representatives of the ratepayers."</quote>
Proceeding, the Prime Minister used these important words&#x2014;
<quote>"It was said that in the successive Education Bills introduced by the present Government sums varying from a million to a million and a-half pounds or more would have been asked of Parliament in addition to the existing Parliamentary grants. He agreed. They would have been prepared to pay a very large price for educational peace."</quote>
When I heard the noble Viscount the Lord President say that this was not a political question, these words recurred to my mind. I cannot but think that this was an attempt to bribe the local authorities to accept the Government's education policy. It seems to me that it was another attempt to influence administration in the direction of their own political opinions. Mr. Birrell promised &#x00A3;1,000,000 in his Bill, Mr. McKenna &#x00A3;1,400,000, and Mr. Runciman &#x00A3;1,600,000. Now when the local authorities ask for a grant they are sent empty away. If these grants could be offered for political purposes, surely a grant should be given when demanded by so important a deputation on behalf of the local authorities. I hope we shall hear something on that point before the debate concludes.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I desire to make one or two observations in reply to points that have been raised in the course of the debate, but at this hour I will not detain your Lordships for more than a few minutes. So far as the educational merits of this Circular are concerned there has been little dispute, and the statements of the Lord President have not been contravened by any subsequent speaker. The noble Marquess who has just sat down devoted the latter part of his speech to the
<col>718</col>
financial aspect of the case, and asked whether it would not be possible for the Board of Education now, or, at any rate, at as early a date as possible, to make some definite estimate of what they understood the cost would be. Owing to the very nature of the case that is not entirely an easy thing to do. The amount of the actual cost must undoubtedly depend to a fiery considerable extent upon the manner in which the re-arrangements are carried out by the different local authorities. That duty, no doubt, throws a heavy burden of work upon them, and until that work has been carried out it is difficult for the Board of Education to form any definite estimate; but as soon as they have received from the various local authorities their revised estimates, which I think in many cases will be very different from the hurried estimates sent in on the first alarm, the Board of Education will endeavour to check them, as far as they can, from their own information, and, although I am not able to make any promise, I hope we may be in a position when the matter comes before Parliament again to say something rather more definite on that matter. What we can say at present is that there is no doubt that a great many of the preliminary estimates of the local authorities were largely exaggerated. Some of them seem to have gone through the simple process of dividing the teachers into the number of children, and, of course, it is perfectly evident that if that was done you could reach the most alarming results. They left out altogether the almost unlimited possibility of regrading and rearrangement of classes, which in a great many cases will, I am confident, have the effect of reducing the charge to almost nothing.<lb/>
The noble Marquess who has just sat down spoke of the supplementary teachers. It is frankly admitted by the Board of Education that the desire, which I think must be shared by all those who are enthusiastic for education in the country, is, without hardship to individuals, gradually to replace those supplementary teachers by certificated teachers. I have no doubt that in many cases you can find a supplementary teacher who is a very good teacher. We do not dispute that for a moment; but, other things being equal, it is, of course, obvious that the goal to which we have to look forward is the time when all teachers in all schools shall be
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0384"/>
<col>719</col>
thoroughly qualified and trained. There is one observation I wish to make with regard to the remark which fell from Lord Stanley of Alderley. In very kindly terms, and speaking with an authority which we all recognise to be unequalled in this House and almost unequalled in the country, he drew attention to what he considered to be something in the nature of a usurpation by the Board of Education in directions which might be left to the discretion of the local authority. I have no doubt that my right hon. friend who presides over that Department will attach every weight to what the noble Lord said, but I confess that this consideration does occur to me. I think we must agree that of all the directions in which local management has to be combined with some degree of central control there is none in which the relation is likely to be so difficult a one as in this matter of education. We are not, I am afraid, as a nation very greatly in love with education, and although I am not going to disparage for a moment the admirable work that is done by the education committees of different county councils, those education committees work often under difficulties of their own. They work
<col>720</col>
in some parts of England, I am certain, knowing that they are not in complete sympathy with the majority of their council, who may in many cases be the opposite of educational enthusiasts; and therefore I ask the noble Lord to reflect whether what he considers undue interference on the part of the Board of Education may not tend to strengthen those members of the county council, sometimes the minority, who are educational enthusiasts. At the same time I quite admit that it is desirable to leave local discretion to operate as far as possible in all cases where it can reasonably be done; and I repeat that the words which fell from my noble friend will receive the careful attention of the Department. I have nothing more to add. The question has been very fairly argued, and the important distinction between the educational aspect of this matter and the financial aspect has been carefully drawn and kept to during the debate. Consequently I think my noble friend may be well satisfied with the result.</membercontribution></p>

<p>[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p>Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, your Lordships will expect me to explain in a
<col>722</col>
few sentences why this Bill has been introduced, and the reason that it takes the present form. Your Lordships will remember that at a late stage of the Children Bill last session my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack introduced a clause which provided, in effect, that in every case of murder of a child up to the age of one year by the mother, the Judge trying the case should have the option of sentencing the person as if convicted of manslaughter instead of pronouncing the sentence of death. My noble and learned friend supported that proposition on two main grounds. The first was the mockery, as he properly called it, under some circumstances, of pronouncing the death sentence in a case in which it was known that it would not be carried out, and he referred to the fact that the death sentence in the case of the murder of an infant child by the mother had not been carried out for something like twenty-seven years. He also urged his clause upon the ground that there would be a greater opportunity of getting convictions.<lb/>
I felt obliged&#x2014;and the majority of your Lordships agreed with me&#x2014;to oppose the Lord Chancellor's proposal. It was open to the serious objection that it placed the death penalty in the option of the Judge, and, in my judgment, for reasons which I gave last year but need not repeat again, it would be a disastrous thing in the administration of the Criminal Law if any such option existed. In that view I was supported by the majority of your Lordships, and the clause did not pass. An appeal was then made to me from more than one quarter of the House, notably from the Bench of Bishops, that, as I had recognised to the full how undesirable it is that the death sentence should be pronounced where there is no reasonable probability of its being carried into effect, I should endeavour to deal with the matter so as, at any rate, to get rid of that objection.<lb/>
The clause of last year proposed to deal with the deaths of children up to the age of one year. That, of course, might have been modified. A most careful examination of this question has led me to the conviction, in which I am supported by those who are working every day in connection with the protection of child life, that the number of child murders is so great&#x2014;I
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0386"/>
<col>723</col>
will not trouble the House with the statistics, although they are alarming&#x2014;that we ought to do nothing to in any way spread the feeling that there is to be any less punishment in cases of child murder. Therefore, I felt that I was bound to deal with the case from the point of view in which I could meet the objection raised by the Lord Chancellor&#x2014;namely, in regard to the pronouncement of the death sentence. After careful consideration and consultation with others competent to express an opinion, it seemed to me that the only way in which I could do that was by applying to a limited class of child murder the privilege now given in a number of cases of recording the death sentence instead of pronouncing it.<lb/>
Then I had to consider the class of case to which that ought to be applied. It unquestionably ought not to be applied to cases where the child is murdered after the recovery of the mother from her confinement. Deliberate murders of infants from three to six or nine months by poor women who desire to get rid of their offspring are among the worst murders. Then there are, again, murders where preparation has been made, even before birth, for getting rid of the child. Therefore I have limited the Bill to cases in which the mother has not fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child, and in which the learned Judge thinks there ought to be an exercise of the prerogative of mercy.<lb/>
It will be said, and truly said, that I am attempting to alter the considered opinion of the Judges of the day in 1860. I have attached to the Bill a short Memorandum reminding your Lordships that in cases of piracy (with attempt to murder) and burning of dockyards, cases in which, as in murder cases, sentence of death necessarily follows (12 Geo. 3. c. 24. s. 1; 7 Will. 4 and 1 Vict. c. 88. s. 2), there is express statutory authority under the existing law for following the procedure adopted in the Bill, namely, recording the sentence of death without actually pronouncing it 4 Geo. 4 c. 48; 7 Will. 4 and 1 Vict. c. 77. ss. 3 &amp; 4); and up to 1862 that might have been done in cases of murder. As a result of the appointment of a Committee, on which many eminent Judges sat, the Act of 1862 was brought in, and since then the death sentence must be pronounced in all cases of murder. I recognise the weight
<col>724</col>
of that authority, and hesitated before introducing a contrary proposal; but I did feel that the case made by the Lord Chancellor for preventing the solemn pronouncement of the death sentence in cases where it would not be carried out ought to be met as far as possible. It seems to me that the best way of meeting it is that proposed in the Bill. I am quite aware that this Bill does not go as far as the proposal of the Lord Chancellor. As to my noble and learned friend's opinion, he will, of course, state it for himself. I did not introduce the Bill without conferring with him. I have also communicated with the Home Secretary, and as far as the Bill goes, he approves of it, though he would be glad to see it go further. Personally, I cannot conscientiously say that I think it ought to go further. I beg to move.<lb/>
Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Alverstone.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have a few words to offer to your Lordships on the subject of this Bill. The House will recall that on the consideration of the Children Bill last session I moved an Amendment that in cases of child murder it should be in the discretion of the Judge, if he thought right, to abstain from imposing the death penalty, and to inflict, instead, a lesser and more proper sentence on the guilty prisoner. The grounds upon which I maintained that proposition were plainly stated. In the first place, it is wrong that the terrible and solemn event of passing sentence of death in a Court of Justice should partake of the character of mockery. My noble and learned friend said there had not been an execution for such an offence for twenty-seven years. Not for sixty years has there been any execution for such an offence, whatever Home Secretary, whether legal or lay, has been in office. The second ground was that the knowledge that the death sentence would be imposed in such cases prevented evidence from being obtainable for securing suitable and proper punishment for those who were guilty. That proposition has never been contested or denied. The third reason which I gave was that the same dread of committing the power of death over these unfortunate persons into the hands of the Executive Government moved juries to return verdicts of not guilty. In these circumstances it seemed to me a small thing to ask that His Majesty's
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0387"/>
<col>725</col>
Judges, who have to discharge the painful duty of seeing that a proper verdict is given, so far as they can, in cases of life and death, should be entrusted with part of the prerogative of mercy, so that they should be able of themselves to say that this sentence should not be passed and that the wretched person should not be put in the agony of the dread of death when it was certain that the sentence would not be carried out. I cannot myself honestly say that I understand why His Majesty's Judges should object to being invested with this particular part of the prerogative of mercy.<lb/>
Your Lordships did not assent to my proposal last year, but it was only rejected by a narrow majority. I was defeated by six votes, which, in this House, having regard to the experience of recent years, may be regarded as rather a triumph on my part. I was, however, defeated; but I am glad that what was said on that occasion has borne a little fruit. Now my noble and learned friend the Lord Chief Justice proposes that the sentence of death, instead of being pronounced in open Court, should be recorded in secret. But the punishment will still remain unless the Sovereign interposes. I think that with the knowledge that the punishment remains, the same influences will still operate on witnesses and juries. All that will happen is that the sad pageant of passing the death sentence in open Court will be dispensed with. Except for what takes place in Court, there is absolutely no difference between the present law and the law as it would be after this Bill passed. I shall certainly vote for the Bill, although I should be glad if it went further. But I am sure the Lord Chief Justice will not be surprised if, supposing that it is not altered in your Lordships' House, it comes back from another place wearing a very different appearance and going much further.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the House is in a somewhat novel position. We have the Lord Chief Justice recommending a Bill which is to practically abolish the penalty of death according to law in certain cases by a statement that the crime of infanticide, at which it is directed, is appallingly on the increase. That is an extraordinary proposition; and my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack has suggested that he is going to vote for the Bill under the belief and conviction
<col>726</col>
that it is to come back to this House a very different Bill from what it is at present. I must say I do not think that is a very respectful mode of suggesting legislation to any deliberate assembly.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member>: <membercontribution>I said supposing the Bill not to be altered in this House in the first instance. I did not exclude that hope.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member>: <membercontribution>Of course I accept that correction, but I gathered from what the Lord Chancellor said that his vote would be given for the Bill because he thought it would be altered. I confess that I entertain the same view towards this Bill that I did when its substance was last before the House. To any one who knows the statistics of infanticide, it is very unwise to take away from that crime the terrors that follow upon it. I believe that the present system acts as a deterrent, though not so much as it should do. This Bill is only to apply to those who may be supposed not to have recovered from the effects of child birth. The answer I make to that is that the Judge to whom so much is to be entrusted could not have performed his duty, or otherwise the conviction could not have taken place in that case. For those reasons I certainly shall vote against the Bill, and I am extremely sorry that this question should be, as I think, somewhat trifled with in the mode in which it has been. There is one reason, I think a very good reason, apart from what the Lord Chancellor has said, why the Judge should not be entrusted with this power. The power still exists of relieving from the death penalty where it is considered it ought not to be carried out, and that power is committed to the Government of the day, who exercise it subject to responsibility to Parliament. To entrust the Judge with the power of remitting the death penalty is to shift responsibility which ought to be borne by the Government of the day. That was one of the things gravely commented on a good many years ago, and which led to the alteration of the law in the year 1862, by which it was rendered necessary that the sentence of death should be pronounced by the Judge, leaving the power of remission to the Government of the day.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD JAMES OF HEREFORD</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, as one who has for some years taken great interest in the reform of our
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0388"/>
<col>727</col>
Criminal Law, I regret that I find no cause for enthusiastic support of this Bill. I must congratulate my noble and learned friend the Lord Chief Justice on his appearance to-day as a Criminal Law reformer. That is a <i>role</i> which I am afraid has not been played hitherto by our principal Judges. My noble and learned friend, with every good intention, has introduced a measure which, if analysed, cannot be satisfactory to anybody. My noble and learned friend in this very proposition gives the key to what the remedy ought to be. Why should he not say that if the conditions to which he refers exist and the woman takes the life of the child at a time when she has not recovered from the effects of child-birth, the offence should then become one of manslaughter? If that were the provision in the Bill it would meet all the objections and would throw upon the Judge the responsibility of saying what the sentence should be. How is humanity benefited by this Bill? Do you spare the feelings of the prisoner? What is to be her fate? She is to be told, as she descends into the cell, possibly by the female warder, that the sentence of death has been recorded against her. The fact remains that it is the sentence of death. But the proposition of my noble and learned friend gets rid of the deterrent effect of the death sentence being pronounced in open Court. I ask, Is this an advance in criminal reform? I say it is not. I was at one time in despair
<col>728</col>
that we should have any reform in our Criminal Law. We have lately had several great reforms. My noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury gave us the reform under which prisoners are permitted to be examined in their own defence. We were told that all the evils possible would result from that reform; but now we have Judges bearing testimony to its value and thanking the Legislature for allowing them the opportunity which this reform affords of acquitting innocent persons who might otherwise have been convicted. Then my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack gave us the Court of Criminal Appeal. We were again told that that would produce evils, but it is working wonderfully well, and innocent people are being set free by virtue of that Court. Had my noble and learned friend suggested in this Bill that if, owing to a woman's condition after child-birth, she had committed a crime that might rank as manslaughter, we could then insist that the Judge should bear the responsibility of saying that she should not be sentenced to death but to exactly that amount of punishment that represented the measure of her crime.</membercontribution></p>

<section>
<title>INDIAN COUNCILS BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p>Commons Amendments <i>considered</i> (according to order).</p>
<p><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Amendments made by the Commons, subject to the insertion of certain Amendments in the following new clause which has been inserted by the Commons:&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
</section>
<section>
<title>Commons' Amendment.</title>
<p><quote>After Clause 2, insert the following new clause&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>3.&#x2014;(1) It shall be lawful for the Governor-General in Council, with the approval of the Secretary of State in Council, by proclamation, to create a council in any province under a Lieutenant-Governor for the purpose of assisting the Lieutenant-Governor in the executive government of the province, and by such proclamation&#x2014;</quote>

<ol type="a">
<li>to make provision for determining what shall be the number (not exceeding four) and qualifications of the members of the council; and</li>
<li>to make provision for the appointment of temporary or acting members of the council during the absence of any member from illness or otherwise and for the procedure to be adopted in case of a difference of opinion between a Lieutenant-Governor and his council and in the case of equality of votes and in the case of a Lieutenant-Governor being obliged to absent himself from his council from indisposition or any other cause.</li>
</ol>
<quote>(2) Where any such proclamation has been made with respect to any province the Lieutenant-Governor may with the consent of the Governor-General in Council from time to time make rules and orders for the more convenient transaction of business in his council and any order made or act done in accordance with the rules and orders so made shall be deemed to be an act or order of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.</quote>
<quote>(3) Every member of any such council shall be appointed by the Governor-General with the approval of His Majesty and shall as such be a member of the Legislative Council of the Lieutenant-Governor in addition to the members nominated by the Lieutenant-Governor and elected under the provisions of this Act.</quote></p>
<p>Your Lordships are aware of the circumstances under which what was then Clause 3 was struck out when the Bill left your Lordships' House. Both the noble Marquess opposite (Lord Lansdowne) and the
<col>730</col>
noble Lord who sits next to him (Lord Curzon) were emphatic in saying that the rejection of the clause was not permanent or final. I welcomed that language, feeling that it indicated a conciliatory spirit, and I resolved in my own mind that I would do the best I could in the circumstances of the case to meet that spirit. But, of course, my view of the importance of the old Clause 3 remains very much what it was. I do not believe that the noble Marquess opposite, for example, would contend that what I have indicated as the principle of that clause was an erroneous principle&#x2014;that it would be a great error and a great inconvenience, both to the Government of India and to Parliament, if, whenever a proposal was made to attach an Executive Council to a Lieutenant-Governor, there should arise in Parliament here a full dress debate in each House on Second Reading, in Committee, on Report, and on Third Reading. I felt very strongly&#x2014;and I regretted that your Lordships did not agree&#x2014;that that would be a great error.</p>
<p>Then there is another point which ought not to be overlooked. I have been addressed more than once by noble Lords opposite of great authority and exhorted to pay respect to the Government of India. The Government of India, as a matter of fact, were strongly in favour of the old Clause 3, and Lord Minto, in his speech the other day, under the formal and almost solemn circumstances of an address to his own Legislative Council, said that he greatly regretted that your Lordships had omitted Clause 3, and added that he was in perfect accord with the Secretary of State in this proposal. A very important member of the Executive Council in Calcutta used the same language. The Press used language of a precisely similar kind, and I should like to trouble your Lordships with a passage. Though it has one or two personal references in it, which I may or may not regret, I do not think they at all impair the value of this criticism. The <i>Times of India,</i> speaking of Clause 3 and the action against Clause 3, quote the Viceroy's
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0390"/>
<col>731</col>
language which I have already fairly described, and then proceed&#x2014;
<quote>"Then we have here Sir Edward Baker, the only Lieutenant-Governor who would be immediately affected by the acceptance of the clause, declaring that the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal cannot undertake the duties that will be imposed upon him under the Councils Act without assistance. On the other side we have to set the opinion of Lord Curzon's Government in 1905&#x2014;"</quote>
I hope the noble Lord will forgive me for reading this&#x2014;
<quote>"We are not impressed by that authority, not only because water has run under the bridges at a tremendous pace since it was penned, but because it represented a school of thought that has contained few elements of permanence."</quote>
There are other remarks about the noble Lord which I need not quote. The article proceeds&#x2014;
<quote>"Then we have Lord Mac Donnell informing the Lords that the choice lies between corporate government whereby the Executive Government is weakened, or personal government whereby the Executive Government is strengthened. That remark puts Lord Mac Donnell out of court. There is no more direct connection between Government in Council and Executive weakness than, let us say, between Lord Mac Donnell and consideration for one's subordinates."</quote>
It is a remarkable fact, of which I am only now beginning to understand the full significance, that the Government of India are very sensitive to the intervention of Parliament wherever that can be properly, constitutionally, and conveniently avoided, because language is apt to be used both in another place and in your Lordships' House which in this country, of course, is appraised at its proper value, but what is a mere indiscretion here or in the other House becomes a danger in India. I am bound to say&#x2014;and I have had the singular advantage of feeling the brunt of the indiscretions in both Houses&#x2014;I think the palm for master indiscretion must be given to the noble Lord, Lord Mac Donnell, because his language, more than once repeated and put down in the formal shape of an Amendment on the Paper, in regard to the Partition of Bengal has been felt by the Government of India and by myself as having been a most injurious indiscretion, perhaps the most injurious that I have had experience of during my three and a-half years of responsibility for the affairs of India.</p>
<p>I pass from that and turn to the immediate Amendment. My object almost from the first, certainly since the weighty
<col>732</col>
speeches in another place of Lord Percy and Mr. Balfour, was to secure that an understanding should be arrived at. My very strong desire is that there should not be exhibited to India a spectacle of any avoidable friction or contention between the two Houses of Parliament, and that the Bill and the regulations that will eventually be framed upon it should go before the people of India as having been granted by the Parliament of Great Britain freely and practically unanimously. That is my point of view. I am told that Asiatics have great difficulty in understanding our Parliamentary system of Government. Sometimes we have a little difficulty ourselves. But what is our system? It may be defined as "contention <i>plus</i> compromise." My principle, therefore, in reference to India would be to have as little Parliamentary contention as possible, and every reasonable compromise that is possible. I have every reason to believe that the noble Marquess opposite, and your Lordships generally, will feel that the Amendment to the old Clause 3 to which we ask the House to agree is a reasonable compromise. The point of it is that Bengal is to have an Executive Council. That, I think, is agreed to by everybody. It is earnestly desired by the new Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal.</p>
<p>Then upon the point whether the Government of India is to be free to proclaim an Executive Council in provinces beyond Bengal, what I propose is that the Governor-General shall, if he deals with any other province beyond Bengal, draft a proclamation to be laid by the Government upon the Table of both Houses for sixty days. This may seem a very long period, but communications between the Secretary of State and the Government of India will be, or may be, tolerably numerous, and it is desirable to give plenty of time. The proclamation will remain on the Table for sixty days, and if an Address is moved by either House against the proclamation it is thereby estopped; if no Address is moved it will become operative at the end of the sixty days. At first I thought that it ought to be an Address of both Houses, but it was represented to me that this would be to strip one House of its veto, and, being seriously anxious to meet the fair claim of every one concerned, I agreed that the proposal should take this form, that an Address from either House should be sufficient to stay the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0391"/>
<col>733</col>
proclamation. There is not really much in this either way, because I cannot imagine the Government of India, with the sanction of the Secretary of State necessarily, sending home a draft proclamation with, I presume, the reasons for it set forth&#x2014;I cannot imagine such a proclamation coming home and being vetoed by either House. It would be impossible&#x2014;the case of Bengal proves it&#x2014;for your Lordships to resist a proclamation deliberately framed constituting an Executive Council in another provincial government. Therefore I have every confidence that, in effect, this will make very little change.</p>
<p>I should like to say a word upon the Amendment standing on the Paper in the name of Lord Mac Donnell, which is to the effect&#x2014;as I understand it, that, if it should seem fit, the same powers of revoking and making changes in the Constitution and so forth as now exist under the Statute of William IV, of 1833, should extend to these new Councils. I would point out that the Act of 1833 has been a dead letter, and in reference to the Councils of Bombay and Madras it has never, so I am informed, once been acted upon. The Amendment conveys a kind of innuendo that these councils, when brought into existence, will very likely work so ill that it will be necessary to alter their conditions of existence, of function, and of authority. The Government cannot accept this Amendment. I object to inserting in the Bill, which is an enlarging measure, language which really implies that you suspect that, so far as this provision goes, it may end in either moonshine or mischief. Besides, it is against all tradition of Indian government and administration to take back powers once conferred and to annul bodies once created. I do not think I need or ought to detain your Lordships longer. I beg to move.</p>
<p>Moved, That this House doth agree with the Amendments made by the Commons subject to the insertion of certain Amendments in the new clause which has been inserted by the Commons.&#x2014;"(<i>Viscount Morley of Blackburn.</i>)</p>
<p>*<member>THE EARL OF CROMER </member>, <membercontribution>who had an Amendment on the Paper to omit, from the third line of the new clause inserted by the Commons, the words "any province," and to insert, in their place, the words "the province of Bengal," said: My Lords, it will be observed that I have an
<col>734</col>
Amendment on the Paper which virtually covers the same ground as that of the noble Viscount, and, with your Lordships' permission, I will deal with the two together. The noble Viscount has given us the history of the past in connection with this clause. I do not in the smallest degree challenge the accuracy of his statement, but as I think that the story permits of being related in two different ways I should like to give my version.<lb/>
Your Lordships will remember that some months ago when this subject was first broached the Government of India wrote a Despatch in which they threw out a hint&#x2014;I do not think it can be called more than a hint&#x2014;that Executive Councils should be established in the Lieutenant-Governorships; but they added what appeared to me to be the very wise proviso that that could only be done after very mature consideration and full consultation with the various authorities concerned. Upon that this clause was introduced into the Bill. Possibly there may have been consultations with the local authorities in India, but, if so, we were not informed of them. When the measure came to your Lordships' House some noble Lords objected to the clause on its own merits, but I think the general feeling of your Lordships was not to reject the clause altogether. What we thought was that the evidence laid before us for such a very important piece of legislation as this was insufficient, and that before this clause was put upon the Statute Book we ought to have some indication of the opinion of the Lieutenant-Governors.<lb/>
The noble Viscount did, indeed, read us a telegram from the Viceroy of India. It was a very important telegram, and naturally we attached very great weight to its contents; but it did not contain the smallest allusion to consultation with Lieutenant-Governors. Neither was any reason given why the Government of India had so entirely changed its mind in the course of the few months. We all therefore, myself certainly among the number, thought that the views of the Lieutenant-Governors should be obtained. What happened in the other House very much confirmed my impression in that respect. I am, I believe, precluded from reading any passages in debate in the other House, but, so far as I understand, Mr. Hobhouse, who was in charge of the Bill, deprecated any
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0392"/>
<col>735</col>
further consultation with Lieutenant-Governors. But I must be allowed to say that his arguments tended to exactly the opposite conclusion. What he said was that the Lieutenant-Governors exercised very great authority inside their provinces, but that they could not be reasonably asked, neither could they expect to be asked, to give their opinions on subjects outside their provinces. My Lords, that is my case. Nobody expects that a Lieutenant-Governor should dictate the general policy of the Government of India, but this is a matter essentially inside their provinces and that is why we think their opinions should be invited.<lb/>
The circumstances have materially changed since I placed my Amendment on the Paper. The difference between my Amendment and that of the noble Viscount is this. Both of them limit the immediate operation of the Bill to Bengal, but whereas by my Amendment fresh legislation would be required, under the Amendment of the noble Viscount Executive Councils will be able to be called into operation without legislation and merely with the proviso that the proclamation is to lay on the Table of both Houses. I quite agree as to the undesirability of Indian matters being frequently before Parliament, though I am not quite certain that I am filled with the same amount of terror as the noble Viscount as to indiscretions which might be committed in this House. At the same time, I should not like to propose anything which would involve frequently bringing Indian questions before us. Therefore I am quite prepared, for my own part, to accept the noble Viscount's Amendment and to withdraw my own.<lb/>
I should like, however, to add that I certainly could not have withdrawn my Amendment if the noble Viscount had not provided in his Amendment that either House of Parliament should have control over the proclamations. This appears to be a subject about which the House of Lords has eminently a right to exercise some direct control. It is not a financial question or one which in any way touches the privileges of the Commons. It is an Imperial question, and it is a notorious fact that whereas there are a considerable number of members in your Lordships' House who have had actual Indian experience, that experience does not exist to so great an extent among members of the other
<col>736</col>
House. I should like also to thank the noble Viscount for the manner in which he has met my own proposal and others, and I have now great pleasure in withdrawing my Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I acknowledge with pleasure the admission made by the noble Viscount the Secretary of State at the outset of his speech when he told us that his proposals had been approached on this side of the House in a conciliatory spirit. It has been our desire from the first that this question should be dealt with in a conciliatory spirit, and we have, I venture to think, done all that lay in our power to prevent the discussion from following party lines or from ourselves doing anything which might suggest the idea that we desire to make party capital out of the proposals of His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
The noble Viscount told us what was, in his opinion, the principle of Clause 3, which has now been restored to the Bill. May I venture to tell him what was the principle which underlay our observations upon that clause? We felt that the clause was one which dealt with matters of such immense importance, matters really of Imperial importance, that this House ought on no account to part with the full and effective control which at this moment it possesses over the provisions of the clause. I cannot believe that we shall be regarded as having been unreasonable in taking that view. What is it that this clause does? It has been spoken of as if it dealt with some purely local and comparatively insignificant detail. Under this clause a new constitution can be given to these great Indian provinces&#x2014;provinces including a population exceeding that of these islands. To say to those provinces, You shall for the future be governed, not by a Lieutenant-Governor, but by a Lieutenant-Governor with a Council, which is to include native members, and perhaps native members with no experience&#x2014;to say that is to announce to these important parts of the King's Dominions that their political constitution is to undergo a fundamental change at the bidding of the Parliament of this country. Upon a question of that kind I conceive that this House has a right to have an opinion, and to act upon that opinion; and, if I may be allowed to say so, I am not very much moved by the argument which the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0393"/>
<col>737</col>
noble Viscount founded upon opinion in India and particularly upon the opinions expressed by the Anglo-Indian Press. I submit that we are far better judges of what is constitutionally due to this House, I would say even than the Government of India, and certainly than the Anglo-Indian Press.<lb/>
We quite understand that the noble Viscount should desire that if it should be found necessary hereafter to create these Councils in other parts of India, the Government of the day and the Government of India should be relieved of the trouble and anxiety by which Parliamentary legislation is always attended. Therefore, many of us have from the first been favourably disposed to an arrangement which, while it avoided these inconveniences, at the same time preserved to this House an absolute and unqualified right of having an effective voice with regard to any proclamations hereafter issued under this clause. Surely that is not an unreasonable view. In the first place, do not let it be forgotten that although the Government of India at this moment is in favour of the third clause of the Bill its affection for the policy which it involves was a few months ago certainly of a very lukewarm character, and it is well known that at a not very remote period the proposal was regarded with unfavourable eyes by the Government of India.<lb/>
There is another matter. The whole question, as the House remembers, has been lately considered by the Decentralisation Committee, which has presented a very interesting Report dealing with many Indian questions. When we come to examine the Report of that Committee we find that it contains no such proposal as that embodied in the Government's Bill. The proposal of the Decentralisation Committee was, as the noble Viscount knows, of a very different character. Another consideration which greatly weighed with us was the failure to consult the Provincial Governments. As to that I must say that I noticed with considerable alarm and much regret a tendency to treat the opinions of the Provincial Governments as if they were not of any very great importance. I believe that nothing could be more unfortunate than to create the impression in India that changes of this kind can be carried out over the heads of the Provincial Governments.
<col>738</col>
Many of us hold the view that, in these circumstances, whilst the extension of Executive Councils to other provinces might be allowed to remain indefinitely in abeyance, it might be well to make this concession in the Province of Bengal, and I should have gladly supported the Amendment of my noble friend Lord Cromer. But, my Lords, in deference to the very strong representations which have been made to us, and having, as we have, a strong desire that upon a question of this kind there should be no acute difference between the two sides of the House, we are of opinion that the arrangement offered to us by the noble Viscount is one which we may reasonably accept. The essence of that arrangement, of course, is that an Address from either House of Parliament would be sufficient to arrest the further progress of a new proclamation. The noble Viscount told us that in the event of a proposal under this clause coming home from the Government of India and being proposed by the Government of the day, he could scarcely conceive that it should be resisted. I say most certainly that if a proposal of that kind came to us backed in such a manner I cannot conceive that it should be lightly put on one side; but we do desire to maintain, as I said a moment ago, a real and effective control over the matter. We have that real and effective control at this moment, and I certainly do not think we should have been justified in parting with it. I am glad that the noble Viscount has been able to meet us in so reasonable a spirit.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>EARL ROBERTS </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I deeply regret that I was not able to be present when the discussion on this Bill took place a few weeks ago, but I am glad to have this opportunity of saying how entirely I am in accord with the opinions then expressed by Lord Lansdowne, Lord Curzon, and other noble Lords who voted against Clause 3. I regard the formation of Councils in the provinces where they do not already exist as not only unnecessary, but as not being likely to help Lieutenant-Governors in carrying out their onerous duties. But, at the same time, under the Amendment introduced by the noble Viscount, I would certainly not offer any objection to a Council being introduced in Bengal. The important question of the appointment of a native member to the Viceroy's Council has been settled; but
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0394"/>
<col>739</col>
I cannot help expressing my great regret that the noble Viscount has not delayed, at any rate for a time, the carrying out of a measure which is likely to have such momentous consequences. I very much doubt whether the presence of a native member in the Viceroy's Council will not be a matter of distrust among the ruling Princes. It certainly will not satisfy the demagogues who are now shouting for it, and, so far as I am aware, it is not desired by the people of India generally. The people believe in their English rulers, but, for reasons of their own, they have not the same feeling of trust in native officials, owing, no doubt, to the prejudices of caste and religion. Some years ago a question arose in India which created a considerable amount of caste and race feeling. I was at the time in Madras, and Sir Madhava Rao, an old friend of mine with whom I was talking the matter over, said&#x2014;
<quote>"This is the fault of your own people. They raise these questions without knowing what the feelings of the people in India are."</quote>
In the course of further conversation, I asked what would happen supposing we left the country. He replied:&#x2014;
<quote>"If you went to the Zoological Gardens, opened all the cages, and let all the wild animals loose, there would be a terrific fight, and at the end of the fight the tiger would walk proudly over the dead bodies of all the other animals."</quote>
Asked whom he meant by the tiger, my friend replied&#x2014;
<quote>"I mean the Mahomedans from the north."</quote>
I do not know whether my friend's prognostications will ever come true, but of this I am certain, that India would never be governed by Bengal Baboos. I am confident that the Bengal Baboos of the present day and men of that class, who are shouting and clamouring for position and place, would not be heard of six months after we had left the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, with your Lordships' permission and indulgence I should like to offer a few remarks upon the personal references which have been made to myself by the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for India. This is the second occasion during the course of these debates on which the noble Viscount has thought fit to make depreciatory remarks regarding myself. I feel, therefore, that it is due to myself and to the House that I should, as
<col>740</col>
briefly as I possibly can, and with an avoidance of anything like acrimony, so far as I can manage it, explain to your Lordships what my position is. I was invited by the noble Viscount to assist him in the discussing and framing of the schemes of reform now before the House. The letter in which the noble Viscount invited my assistance is entirely at variance in spirit and in language with the language which he has thought fit to apply to me this evening. I most willingly gave my assistance to the noble Viscount, coming over from Ireland for the purpose, and after fully and carefully discussing the whole of the proposals embodied in the Bill I received from the noble Viscount an expression of his thanks and satisfaction for the assistance I had given him. Afterwards we differed. I have always thought that matters connected with India were outside the sphere of party politics, but even if they were not, I do not think that the bonds of party should lie upon me so heavily, sitting on this side of the House as I do, that in a matter of the first Imperial importance I should not express to your Lordships my honest convictions. I have endeavoured, with all respect to the noble Viscount, to express those convictions in this House, and on only two great subjects&#x2014;namely, the appointment of a native member to the Viceroy's Council and the creation of Lieutenant-Governor Councils&#x2014;was I really at variance with the noble Viscount.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>The Partition of Bengal.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member>: <membercontribution>I will come to that. Upon these points, if it were necessary for me to ask for your Lordships' approval of my action I could find it in the fact that my views were in harmony with those of the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, who with such distinction presided over the Government of India; with those of the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, who has done in India work which the present time is not capable of appreciating; and with those of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, who knew a good deal of me in India. It is quite true that in regard to the Partition of Bengal I held an opinion at variance with that of the noble Viscount, and at variance, to my regret, with that of Lord Curzon. The whole of my early life was spent in Bengal. I know every district of it. I know the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0395"/>
<col>741</col>
temper of its people and the course of its history, and my belief was that if advantage was not taken of this great occasion to remove a source of what I believe to be real hardship and also a source of much discontent we should be losing a great opportunity. I may be wrong, but that was my honest opinion, and I endeavoured to express it in the Amendment which I placed on the Paper in such a manner as to interfere as little as possible with established facts. This is the history of my intervention in these debates.<lb/>
I have been accused by the noble Viscount the Secretary of State of being a bureaucrat, and to-night, by inference, he accuses me of a want of consideration for my subordinates. During thirty-five years of service in India I have been brought into personal connection with the great men who have built up and maintained the British Empire there, from John Lawrence downwards, and one of the lessons I learned at their feet was that, a chief must carry his officers with him. I believe, if your Lordships will excuse the personal reference, that I am the only person now living of the Sovereign's servants in the East who has administered the affairs of four great provinces one after another&#x2014;administered them in times of stress, in times of war, and in times of famine and plague&#x2014;and in each province it was necessary for me to carry my officers with me, for without them I could have done nothing. I ask your Lordships whether the great men who have administered the Indian Empire would have placed me in one great government after another if it were true that I was discourteous or unfair to my subordinates and unable to carry them with me. The great men with whom I have been associated in India were able to play on that stormy harp whose strings are the hearts of men. They did not learn by sitting in offices or by writing books how men should be managed.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have no desire to intervene in the difference, if difference it be, between the noble Lord who has just spoken and the Secretary of State. Still less would I venture for a moment to take up the position which he has sometimes occupied with regard to me of a <i>tertius gaudens</i> when differences of this nature arise in your Lordships' House. I think there is not one of us who will not have listened
<col>742</col>
with some sympathy, as well as with respect, to the personal vindication of himself which has just been offered by the noble Lord, Lord Mac Donnell. I will not pursue that matter further, except to say that, in my judgment, the passage which the Secretary of State read from the <i>Times of India</i> in its reference to Lord Mac Donnell was singularly ungenerous in tone, and that your Lordships might very properly have been spared its quotation in this House. Neither do I propose to follow the noble Lord, Lord Mac Donnell, on the present occasion into the wholly irrelevant question of the Partition of Bengal. I have always counted myself unfortunate that in dealing with that measure I did not secure the support of the noble Lord. The measure has already, I believe, justified itself, and will continue still further to justify itself in the future; but clearly that is a matter which it would not be proper for me to discuss on the present occasion.<lb/>
I have risen because, having taken some part in the previous discussions on this Bill and having had some responsibility for recent affairs in connection with India, I do not like to give an altogether silent vote. The noble Earl, Lord Cromer, gave a correct description of the circumstances in which this Bill left your Lordships' House a few weeks ago, and in which we are now asked to recede from our previous attitude with regard to Clause 3. There are many of us in this House, of whom I certainly am one, who hold strongly to the view that government by an individual is for the greater parts of India a better, a more efficient, a more vigorous, and a more rapid form of government than government by a Cabinet or by a Council. There are many of us, too, who regard with some apprehension the placing of native gentlemen, however talented, in positions where they will be called upon in the future, without a previous training in official life and without the steadying influence which service in India gives, to exercise great powers of patronage over natives and English alike. That was the view of some of us who had had experience of India; but the view, I think, of the majority of your Lordships, who have not had that particular experience, was that the reasons given for Clause 3 in the form in which it was first submitted to the House were inadequate and perfunctory. I will not go over that ground again.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0396"/>
<col>743</col>
Accordingly, what we asked for at that stage was that in the interval between the time when the Bill left this House and the date when it should come back the noble Viscount should give us, if it lay in his power, further information as to the views of responsible persons in India, more particularly those who would be affected by this change, whether they were persons in positions of authority or whether they were the leading classes of the community in the provinces that were likely to be affected. As I listened to the speech of the noble Viscount the Secretary of State to-night, I naturally asked myself whether he had supplied your Lordships with the information for which we asked, and which would be sufficient to justify us in receding from our opinion. So far as his speech is regarded from that point of view, I do not think that any one of your Lordships will say that any substantial addition has been made to our information. We have merely been told, what we knew before, that the Government of India are now in favour of this proposal; but, as the noble Marquess behind me has pointed out, their conversion on this matter, although convenient, has certainly been extremely rapid, and only six months ago they were saying something entirely opposite.<lb/>
The case as regards the Lieutenant-Governors has been given away. Nobody contends that any Lieutenant-Governor in India at the present time is in favour of this proposal, with the important exception of Sir Edward Baker in Bengal. I do not, of course, desire to depreciate the authority of that officer, and I agree that when an official so competent speaks so strongly as Sir Edward Baker did in the debate on the Budget the other day at Calcutta about the needs of his province, the Government at home and your Lordships would accept a considerable responsibility if you ignored that appeal. I may say, in passing, that the case made cut by Sir Edward Baker, resting as it does on the enormous increase in the responsibilities of the Lieutenant-Governor and the work that will devolve upon him and his officials in consequence of the changes in the system of Legislative Councils which this Bill is going to introduce. is in itself the strongest corroboration of the views taken by many noble Lords on this side of the House, including myself, as to the drastic and far-reaching character of the proposals with regard to those Councils which are embodied in this Bill.
<col>744</col>
All the way through it has been our contention that these Legislative Councils in the provinces will not be large debating societies, but small Parliaments, and here we have the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal practically using that argument as a justification for asking for further assistance to himself. As I say, I think that this is a request on behalf of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal which it would be impossible for us to resist. But at present he stands alone. No other Lieutenant-Governor has been or can be quoted as being in favour of the proposal at this date.<lb/>
Then the noble Viscount said that the Press of India is in favour of the proposal. I probably make as close a study of the Indian newspapers as does the noble Viscount, and when he quoted that passage from the <i>Times of India,</i> which, by the way, I had also read, I only regretted that I had not brought down with me a passage from the same paper a week or two earlier which expressed a very unfavourable opinion of the manner in which the noble Viscount has conducted this Clause. However, I agree with the noble Marquess behind me that what an isolated Anglo-Indian newspaper says for or against the proposal is not very germane to this discussion. Surely it would have been much more pertinent had the noble Viscount been able to tell us that in the interval that had elapsed since your Lordships dealt with this measure there had been any substantial demonstration of opinion in India in favour of this Clause. To some extent there has been an expression of opinion in its favour, but I cannot help thinking that it has in the main emanated from those who thought that if this Clause were introduced into the Bill and these new Councils set up, opportunities for serving upon them would be created for themselves. I doubt very much whether these provisions have been regarded by any class in India as likely to tend to the betterment of government in that country. Suppose that instead of introducing this provision for Executive Councils in the Lieutenant-Governorships with a clear intimation that he proposed to place natives upon them, the Secretary of State had merely proposed to create Councils of three or four officers, all of whom were to be Europeans and members of the Civil Service. I doubt if he would have found any enthusiasm in any part of India in favour of the proposal. I do not, how-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0397"/>
<col>745</col>
ever, desire to labour that point. I have merely been contending that, so far as additional information is concerned, we stand in no different position from that which we occupied some six weeks ago.<lb/>
In that case, is there anything in the present state of affairs which justifies us in accepting the proposals now made, as the noble Viscount very justly remarked, in a spirit of compromise? I think that there is. The situation is rendered very different by the steps that he has taken to-night. In the first place, the appointment of an Executive Council is definitely limited to the case of Bengal. In the second place, we are to have opportunities of Parliamentary discussion before any similar appointment can take place in the future. In the third place&#x2014;rather a small point to which the noble Viscount did not allude&#x2014;he has introduced into his Amendment a form of words which gives to the Lieutenant-Governor greater powers in the future determination of the duties, authorities, and distribution of work between the members of his Council than were provided in the original form of the Bill. All of these, I think, are points to the good, and justify those of us who regarded the original proposal with some suspicion in adopting a friendly attitude towards the present Amendment of the Secretary of State. I do not think that he will expect me to say that it comforts us for one moment on the main principle. Although the existence of this power will prevent any weak or ignorant Viceroy, any impulsive or despotic Secretary of State, if such a combination is at any time to be contemplated, from introducing an Executive Council into a province of India where it is not required, yet at the same time I take it that it is a pretty correct prevision of the future when the noble Viscount says that the authority of this House or of the other House of Parliament in the matter is one which is not likely to be frequently or rashly used. As a matter of fact, what will happen?<lb/>
I think your Lordships, in accepting this compromise, ought to have a clear idea as to the future to which we commit ourselves. Bengal will have its Executive Council, as I understand, straight away. I have very little doubt that before many years have passed, when the present Lieutenant-Governors in India are changed and others have taken their places who
<col>746</col>
may not, perhaps, hold similar views, and when constant agitation&#x2014;and if there is one thing certain it is that when once you concede this privilege to Bengal agitation will immediately start for its extension to other provinces&#x2014;has prevailed, you will have Executive Councils extended to province after province, and that within the next twenty years there may scarcely be a single province, with the possible exception of those on the extreme frontier, which will not have an Executive Council. If that be a correct forecast of the future, it is a .state of affairs which I, at any rate, cannot regard altogether without apprehension; but, at the same time, the guiding consideration in our minds, I think, ought to be that the responsibility in this matter rests with the Government, and with the Government alone. All through this Bill the attitude taken by the Secretary of State, the manner in which he has more than once appealed to us not in any way to break the coherence or the symmetry of his measure for fear of re-arousing the unrest in India which he hopes by his legislation to allay, has placed the Opposition in a very difficult position, and all of us, I think, who have thought over the matter have come to the conclusion that in the last resort we must leave the responsibility where it has been assumed, where it rests, and where history will ultimately place it. With this expression of my views I will say that I think we may on the present occasion, with justice both to ourselves and to the attitude we have previously taken, accept the compromise which has been offered by the noble Viscount.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, with your Lordships' indulgence I should like to say one sentence in regard to what fell from the noble Lord behind me, Lord Mac Donnell. I do not suppose that there is anybody in this House who is more averse than I am from introducing personal elements into an Imperial discussion. My feeling, which may have appeared needlessly pointed towards the noble Lord, has remained with me since the week in December when I first had the honour of explaining to your Lordships the policy of the Government in all these matters. At that very moment the noble Lord launched views about the Partition of Bengal which he has repeated since, and which were not merely pious opinions. A view against the Partition of Bengal,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0398"/>
<col>747</col>
launched by a noble Lord of his great Indian authority, inflicted a very serious blow on Lord Minto and myself and the Government of India. Here had we been for two years upholding the Partition of Bengal against great difficulties, and with an opinion of it not much differing from that of the noble Lord. The agitation had more or less cooled down, but when a noble Lord of his authority said that it was the greatest blunder ever committed by the Government of India it kindled the ashes of what was an expiring flame.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD </member>: <membercontribution>I do not think it is an expiring flame.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN </member>: <membercontribution>Then in that case it is still worse. Lord Minto and myself, at all events, were bound to treat it as an expiring flame. We will not be parties to a reversal of that Partition. I have said that before, and I venture to say it now. The noble Lord is perfectly entitled to his own opinion; but at a time when he found the Executive Government taking a certain view and doing their best against many and enormous difficulties, I should have thought that a noble Lord who had been so eminent a servant of the Indian Government for so long a time would not have added to those difficulties.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>Lord MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD </member>: <membercontribution>I can only make a further remark with your Lordships' permission, but I should like to say that my object was to obtain a reconsideration of this question in connection with what was and is a revision of the entire Indian political situation. You are considering the entire scheme and scope of Indian Government, and I thought that the circumstances were such as could properly permit of my bringing this matter under the consideration of your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>

the new subsection standing in my name on the Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p>Amendment moved to the new clause inserted by the Commons&#x2014;
<quote>"After subsection (1), to insert as a new subsection :
'(2) It shall be lawful for the Governor-General in Council with the like approval by a like proclamation to create a council in any other province under a Lieutenant-Governor for the purpose of assisting the Lieutenant-Governor in the executive government of the province. Provided that before any such proclamation is made a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of Parliament for not less than sixty days during the session of Parliament and if before the expiration of that time an address is presented to His Majesty by either House of Parliament against the draft or any part thereof no further proceedings shall be taken thereon without prejudice to the making of any new draft.'"&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Morley of Blackburn</i>.)</quote></p>
<p>On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p>*<member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the Amendment which I have placed on the Paper, proposes to insert, after subsection (3), the following proviso&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided always and be it enacted that it shall be lawful for the Governor-General in Council with the approval of the Secretary of State in Council to revoke or to suspend so often and for such periods as the said Governor-General in Council shall in that behalf direct the appointment of councils in all or any of the said provinces under Lieutenant-Governors or a Lieutenant-Governor or to reduce the number of councillors in all or any of the said councils and during such time as a council shall not be appointed or shall be suspended in any province under a Lieutenant-Governor the executive government thereof shall be administered by the Lieutenant-Governor alone."</quote>
This proviso is no innovation. As the noble Viscount, the Secretary of State for India has said, it is to be found in the Act of 1833. Your Lordships are aware that Executive Councils have existed in Madras and Bombay from early time, but these Councils were different from those contemplated under the Bill. The Councils contemplated by the Act of 1833 consisted of three officers who were selected from the Company's servants in India&#x2014;from what is now known as the Indian Civil Service&#x2014;for their ability, their experience, and their trustworthiness. Notwithstanding the fact that the Council was so constituted, the Government in 1833, and at an earlier date, thought it right, in their prudence and foresight, to provide that under certain circumstances the Government of India and the Board of Control, as it was then, now the Secretary of State, should have the power to revoke the establishment
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0399"/>
<col>749</col>
of any Council, to suspend its operation for any particular time, or to reduce the number of its members. That provision was in the nature of a precaution against emergencies when personal government through the Governor was considered to be the most desirable and most efficacious in the interests of British rule in India.<lb/>
The noble Viscount stated that this provision of the Act of 1833 is practically obsolete, that it has never been put into execution. I think the noble Viscount will find that the provision has been put into execution. Three members of Council were appointed under the Act, but that number has been reduced to two. Two members now exist in the Councils of Madras and Bombay, and the reduction was effected under that particular Act. It therefore cannot be said that the provision has fallen into disuse. But I go further and say that where you have an Act which is passed not to compass any immediate object but rather for a preventive purpose, surely its efficacy is established by its not being put into operation rather than the reverse. One estimates the efficacy of preventive measures by the fact of their not being made use of. If this particular section of the Act of 1833 is not introduced into this Bill, it is quite possible that the Government might have to pass legislation <i>ad hoc</i> for the purpose which this particular section was intended to meet. Besides, the Councils for the future are to be very differently constituted from what they have been in the past. The Councils in the future are to be mixed Councils, composed partly of European officers of the Crown and partly of native politicians with no previous experience of administration. Who can cast his eyes into the future and say that circumstances may not arise when it will be necessary for the Government of India to have a power, in the first place, to reduce the number of councillors in these Councils? In the next place, if the Councils became so divided that administration was blocked or inefficient, who can say it would not be useful for the Government of India to have power to suspend the Council for a time? The mere existence of such a power would be a safeguard against any such block or inefficiency as I have referred to.<lb/>
I cannot think that there is anything disrespectful or calculated, as the noble
<col>750</col>
Viscount seemed to think, to throw suspicion upon the Councils to be created, in the fact of our extending to these new Councils the provisions which already exist in regard to the old Councils. In point of fact, the easiest way of doing it would be to say that the provisions of this section should apply to all new Councils created. I should be the last to bring forward a measure which would cast suspicion on the new Councils, but at the same time we cannot say what the future has in store for us. It is the opinion of the majority of your Lordships&#x0214;an opinion which I share&#x0214;that the creation of Councils in Lieutenant-Governorships is an experiment. It is an experiment which should be safeguarded, and it would be very much better if that safeguard were applied in the beginning rather than at the time when the emergency arose.<lb/>

<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have already said as much upon this Amendment as it seems to require. The noble Lord is, I am sure, wrong, if I may say so, when he states that the Act of 1833 has been applied. I have proof that it has not been applied in this. We took the opinion the other day of the Law Officers of the Crown upon the question whether the Crown has or has not the right of putting a third member on to the Council of Bombay or the Council of Madras, and the opinion of the Law Officers was that the Crown has that right. It follows, therefore, from that that this Statute of 1833 has not come into operation; otherwise the Crown would have been stripped of that power.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member>: <membercontribution>By the Act of 1833 three members are
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0400"/>
<col>751</col>
appointed to the Councils of Madras and Bombay. There are only two members on each of those Councils now. Consequently one must have been reduced, and I am not aware of any power to reduce the number except the provision in the Act of 1833. That is the only existing authority, so far as I know&#x2014;and I have made inquiries on the point&#x2014;by which a member of Council could be reduced, and under that authority one member has been reduced in the Council of Madras and also in that of Bombay.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member>: <membercontribution>My legal advisers lead me to believe that it was not done under this Act, but under some prerogative of the Crown or I know not what. At any rate, Sir Courtenay Ilbert, for example, lays it down that the Act has remained a dead letter and has never been put in force. But whether I am right or wrong is immaterial. I think I am right. The noble Lord's speech really confirms the suggestion that I brought forward before he moved his Amendment. It is to insert into this Bill a provision which is a sheer innuendo. The House is being asked to give this power as if they expected these Councils, as the noble Lord does, to need to be revoked or mutilated.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member>: <membercontribution>I beg the noble Viscount's pardon. I do not expect it, but I think it is only right to retain this power.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member>: <membercontribution>If we are going to guard ourselves against all the evil things that may happen, of course we may make a great many clauses. I submit, with great earnestness, that it is most undesirable to insert such an ungracious innuendo as the last parting blow of your Lordships to this Bill. And when I say that, I hope I am not understood as complaining for a moment of the treatment the Bill has received at your Lordships' hands. I cordially confirm all that the noble Marquess claimed. The debates have been thoroughly fair, entirely free from acrimony, replete with weighty arguments, and I should be glad if the last proposal made should not be the ungracious proposal mentioned by the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I must say that it seems to me that if sheer arguments are to be weighed,
<col>752</col>
my noble friend Lord Mac Donnell has had the best of this discussion. You have here provisions which at the present moment are applicable under the existing law to the Councils of the Presidencies of Madras and Bombay. Lord Mac Donnell's suggestion is that there is no reason for discriminating in favour of the new Executive Councils, and that if precautions of this kind are desirable and form part of the existing law in respect of the old Councils, they are certainly not less desirable in the case of the new Councils. That seems to me to be a somewhat difficult argument to meet, and I must say that the provision is one which might have very well been included in the original proposals made by His Majesty's Government for introducing Executive Councils into provinces where they do not now exist. But the noble Viscount states that his advice is to the effect that the section of the Act of 1833 on which Lord Mac Donnell relies is a dead letter. The noble Lord, Lord Mac Donnell, says, on the contrary, that there have been within his knowledge cases in which the Executive Councils were diminished, and he contends that they were diminished under this Section of the Act of 1833; and the noble Viscount, I observe, is not able to tell us under what statutory enactment they were diminished if they were not diminished under this particular provision of the law. Therefore, on the strict merits of the case, I should have been very much inclined to support my noble friend on the Back-bench opposite. But the consideration which weighs more with me is this. We have now arrived at the very concluding stage of the Parliamentary discussion of this Bill. If we carry the Amendment of the noble Lord the Bill will have to go back to the House of Commons, and, judging from past experience, it seems to me highly improbable that my noble friend's Amendment would find favourable acceptance there. If that were so, I do not think we should care to take the responsibility of insisting upon the Amendment when the Bill came back without it to this House. Upon the whole it seems to me better, in the circumstances, to incur such risk as may arise from the omission of this clause, to accept the anomaly, for I think it will be an anomaly to have a provision of this kind applicable to the old Councils and not to have any provision of the same kind applicable to the new councils&#x2014;it seems
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0401"/>

to me that we must face those disadvantages, and that it would probably be wise on my noble friend's part if he did not insist upon taking the sense of the House.</membercontribution></p>

<section>
<title>THE MAHOMEDAN ELECTORATE.</title>
<p>*<member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have a Question on the Paper of which I gave notice to the Secretary of State, and which he, perhaps, will allow me to put with a few words of explanation. It runs as follows:&#x2014;
<quote>"To ask the Secretary of State for India whether he can give to the House any further information concerning the proposed Mahomedan electorates under the Indian Councils Bill, and other matters connected with the operation of that measure."</quote>
I may reassure the House at once by saying that I do not propose to say anything about other matters connected with the operation of that measure, My few observations will be confined to the question of the Mahomedans, a question which I was told I could not raise on the strictly limited discussion on the Amendments hitherto before your Lordships, but which I think the Secretary of State will not think it improper on my part to raise this afternoon, because of the immense importance of removing any ambiguity that may exist on the subject.<lb/>
Your Lordships, I am sure, will be agreed as to the great importance of securing a satisfactory representation of the Mahomedan community in India, under the provisions of this Bill. As the House knows, they desire a representation in excess of their numerical strength and an exclusively Mahomedan electorate for all bodies concerned in returning them to the new Councils. The Mahomedans in India have understood, and we have understood, that the position had been conceded by the Secretary of State. That belief rested, in the first place, upon the strong assurance of the Viceroy given to the Mahomedan deputation whom he received more than two years ago, and it was confirmed by the observations made by the noble Viscount opposite
<col>754</col>
in the debate on the Second Reading of the Indian Councils Bill. I need not trouble your Lordships by reading his remarks, which I have here, in full, but they amount to a definite pledge that both of the requests I have named&#x2014;the demand for a separate register and the demand for representation in excess of numerical strength&#x2014;would be met by the Government. The words of the noble Viscount were&#x2014;
<quote>"These two demands we are quite ready and intend to meet to the full."</quote>
We were very glad to receive that assurance from the noble Viscount, and there, as I think most of us thought, the matter satisfactorily terminated. But the other day there was read in the House of Commons a telegram from the Viceroy, dated April 12, in which the Viceroy said&#x2014;
<quote>"The method proposed is simply that in general electorates such as municipalities, district boards, and provincial councils, all sects and classes, including Mahomedans, will vote together. By this means some, but not sufficient representation will be obtained for Mahomedans. In addition, a certain number of seats will be reserved for Mahomedans, and no one but Mahomedans will have a voice in filling them. They may be filled in many ways&#x2014;by election pure and simple, by election by association, by electoral colleges, or by nomination, as the circumstances of each province require. The methods will vary in different provinces, and will be subject to alterations from time to time as experience may dictate."</quote>
These words, if interpreted in the ordinary meaning of the language, certainly suggested that, so far from there being a separate register for Mahomedans, there were to be two processes in their election to these Councils. In the first place, there was to be a sort of mixed general election in which they would take their chance with Hindus and other persons, and then if, owing to their lack of numbers or want of organisation, they found themselves in an inferior position, that deficiency was to be made up either by election or by nomination on the part of the Viceroy or by some other means.<lb/>
My apprehensions on that score were, to some extent, confirmed by the speech delivered in the Budget debate at Calcutta by Mr. Gokhale. Mr. Gokhale has been mentioned as a capable leader of native opinion in India, and he has developed an almost extraordinary prophetic capacity of anticipating what is in the mind of the Secretary of State. In the debate at Calcutta to which I have referred, Mr. Gokhale spoke as follows:&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0402"/>
<col>755</col>
<quote>"I think the most reasonable plan is first to throw open a substantial minimum of seats to election on a territorial basis, in which all qualified to vote should take part without distinction of race or creed. And then supplementary elections should be held for minorities which numerically or otherwise are important enough to need special representation, and these should be confined to members of the minorities only. What minorities in the different provinces should have special representation and how many seats should be assigned to each minority must depend upon the special circumstances of each province. The great advantage of this plan is that it provides for composite action by all communities up to a certain point and then it prevents injustice in practical operation to minorities by giving them special supplementary electorates of their own.</quote>
If that were a correct divination of the views of the Government of India, it would mean not only, as I have said, that there would be this system of a mixed election to start with and then a supplementary election for Mahomedans, but that the same treatment might be applied to minorities belonging to other sects and communities in India.<lb/>
When the Viceroy's telegram of April 12 was published in India great consternation was, not unnaturally, caused among the Mahomedans, and they represented everywhere that they were afraid that the pledge given to them was likely to be departed from. They said they were quite willing to surrender any claim to vote in a mixed electorate so long as they could be assured of the right to vote on a register of their own. When the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr. Hobhouse, was challenged on this matter in the House of Commons, he made an explanation. I confess to having studied it, in so far as it is reported in <i>The Times,</i> many times over, but I cannot understand the conclusion to which it is intended to lead. The Secretary to the Treasury, in his defence of the telegram, or rather in his explanation of the telegram, about which he seemed to think there had been some misunderstanding, pointed out that the local authorities in India would no doubt find it impossible to apply a uniform system under which the principle of election for Mahomedans would be carried out. We can fully appreciate the difficulties of a single cast-iron mode of election on a separate register for Mahomedans throughout the country. We can understand that such a scheme is impossible. My object in putting this Question on the Paper is not to have those difficulties further dwelt upon, or even cleared up. My sole object is to ask the noble Viscount to make some declaration
<col>756</col>
to us, which I suspect he is not at all unwilling to do, that for the ambiguity in the position from which the Mahomedans suffer so much there is no cause, that the pledges given by the Viceroy and the Secretary of State still hold good, and that whatever be the actual method or variety of methods adopted in the last resort, the Mahomedans will still retain their separate register, and will not be required to go through the double process of taking part first in a general election and then in a special election.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the noble Lord is perfectly right in thinking that I am not sorry to have an opportunity of clearing up more than one ambiguity that has arisen in connection with this vitally important subject. So far from complaining, I really am obliged to the noble Lord for giving me that opportunity. I need not detain your Lordships long. I think I shall do what is best by reading textually parts of the telegram I received from the Viceroy last night. First, upon the speech of Mr. Hobhouse, which the noble Lord naturally referred to, the Viceroy says this&#x2014;
<quote>"The speech has been interpreted as meaning that major portion of representatation accorded to Mahomedans is to be given through the mixed electorates, such as district boards and municipalities, on which they will vote conjointly with other classes, and that the special electorates in which Mahomedans will vote separately are only intended to supplement general elections, and will carry only a small number of seats."</quote>
Then the Viceroy points out, as the noble Lord has done, what would follow from that. He proceeds&#x2014;
<quote>"I need hardly say that this is not at all what we contemplated. Our intention was that Mahomedans should have, by means of separate electorates, a number of seats closely approaching that to which their numerical proportion in the population would entitle them, and that over and above this they would obtain some seats in mixed electorates such as district boards and municipalities, Universities, Presidency corporations, and as landholders. In Bombay, for example, under the scheme detailed in my telegram of February 8, four seats are specially assigned to Mahomedans, and in addition to these, two Mahomedans will be elected by landholders and district bodies of Sind, so that they will secure a certain minimum of 6, or 28 per cent., their ratio to the general population being only 20. In the United Provinces, where they number only 14 per cent.; they will have four special seats, or nearly 20 per cent. of the seats assigned for election. Of course, the same ratio cannot be applied in all provinces, and allowance must be made for the <i>status,</i> character, and educational attainments of Mahomedan population in each case."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0403"/>
<col>757</col>
All that, I think, is intelligible enough. The Viceroy goes on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"There has also been misapprehension of our views regarding nomination, which are intended to be merely a temporary expedient to be resorted to until the community should be ripe for election. I do not understand any Mahomedan here to claim concession suggested&#x2014;namely, that wherever elections are found possible they should be conducted on basis of separate representation of the Mahomedan community. If interpreted literally, that would involve having separate Mahomedan electorates within the various electorates proposed, such as Presidency corporations, district boards, and municipalities, Universities, landholders, and the commercial community. This is manifestly impracticable. It could only be effected by recasting the entire scheme and increasing maximum strength of all councils as fixed by Bill. On the whole case, my view is that present proposals as now explained do reasonably fulfil pledges given to Mahomedans."</quote>
Something was said by the noble Lord as to what the Mahomedans had expected and what they had asked for. The Moslem League declared, on February 4, that the arrangement in the Despatch of the Government of India, dated October 1, 1908, on the reform scheme was in keeping with the maintenance of the principle of effective Mahomedan representation, and had also the virtue of linking the various class interests together in the rural and territorial electorates. They went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"The Mahomedans are under a heavy debt of gratitude to your Excellency and to your Executive Council for the Despatch."</quote>
That shows that the Mahomedans, construing the Despatch of October in the way that I have described, were contented and grateful, and that if the Government of India go on with their projects and the working out of their schemes on the present lines they will certainly come up to the demands and expectations expressed by the Moslem League on February 4 last. It is quite easy to discover inconsistencies in a matter so intricate, complicated, and difficult as this adjustment of Mahomedan representation, and those difficulties become greatly multiplied by the fact of distance, the cumbrousness of telegraphic communication, the length of time a despatch takes, and so on; and I do not think it is to be wondered at that language has occasionally been used which seems out of accord with language used at some other date. But this, at all events, is the last view of the Government of India, and it is for the Government of India to work it out. Lord Minto says here&#x2014;and I

<col>758</col>
entirely concur with him&#x2014;that we can have no part in any scheme which is not felt to be a loyal adherence to the pledges which both the Viceroy and I have more than once given to the Mahomedans; and when this scheme, completed and worked out, comes to be examined it will be found that we have carried out the pledges to which the noble Lord referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, we have every reason for being grateful to the noble Viscount for the interesting information he has just given to the House So far as I was able to follow his statement, it seemed to be of a distinctly reassuring character. It is not very easy to follow an explanation of the kind, and other similar explanations have sometimes had the effect of rather perplexing people's minds. I hope therefore, that the noble Viscount will let us have, at any rate, the substance of the documents from which he has quoted, so that we may have an opportunity of considering them at leisure. But I gather that the essence of what is in the mind of the Government of India is this, that the Mahomedans are to depend upon a separate Mahomedan electorate for a measure of representation fully equal to whatever they are numerically entitled to, and that that amount of representation may be supplemented by any other representation which the Mahomedans are able to secure in competition with other candidates at the mixed elections. That, of course, suggests a widely-different arrangement from that which some of us fancied we had gathered from the extremely puzzling and cryptic telegram read in the other House lately. But what comforts me most of all in the noble Viscount's statement is the announcement which I understood him to make that the Viceroy believes that at this moment the Mahomedans are contented and grateful for the arrangements which they are being led to expect. I trust that that confidence will not be in any way misplaced on their part.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member>: <membercontribution>No representation has been received to the contrary&#x2014;that is the exact language&#x2014;from the Mahomedans.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member>: <membercontribution>I was going to remind the noble Viscount that these pledges to the Mahomedans have been of the fullest and most emphatic character.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0404"/>
<col>759</col>
There is a long series of them, beginning with the pledge given by the Viceroy, followed up by the pledge given by the noble Viscount to the Mahomedan deputation, followed again by his statement in this House on the introduction of the Bill this year&#x2014;those pledges have been reaffirmed in the other House of Parliament by the representative of the India Office; and, of course, we must all feel that it would be a public disaster if anything were to happen which would make it open to the Indian Mahomedans to contend that those pledges had not been fulfilled to the utmost extent. I welcome the noble Viscount's announcement that, in his mind, at any rate, there is no doubt whatever that those pledges will be so made good.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE TERRITORIAL FORCE.</title>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise, in accordance with the Notice standing in my name on the Paper, to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War when commanders of units of the Territorial Force may expect the additions to the permanent staff already sanctioned. I am sure your Lordships fully realise the importance that the recruits who have been enlisted should have an experienced staff in order that they might receive the necessary instruction. In the past they have been a good deal hampered by a shortage in the staff. In one of my own units there were in camp no fewer than 600 recruits, and the extra work thrown on the shoulders of the reduced staff made it extremely difficult to give the necessary instruction. If that is so in an ordinary infantry unit, the difficulty is obviously much greater in the scientific units; and where you have a new arm, all the surroundings of which are entirely strange to the men, it is clear that if you are going to secure that efficiency for which the County Associations have been made responsible there must be a proper staff to give the instruction. Sanction has been given up to eight permanent staff per Infantry battalion, and, in addition to that maximum the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief may sanction the attachment of any number of temporary instructors. These extra instructors beyond the maximum of eight depend, I understand, upon the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, but I do not propose to raise this point now. All I wish to-day is to urge upon my noble friend the great importance of this question and the
<col>760</col>
pressing necessity for the promised instructors. Nothing would encourage the Territorial Force more than the completion of their staff, and the completion of the equipment that has been promised. I would also ask my noble friend if he could tell us how many of these additional members of the permanent staff have been appointed, and how soon commanders of units may expect to have their full complement.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LOVAT</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I desire at the same time to call the noble Lord's attention to the grave deficiency in the staff for training the Artillery. As the noble Earl has said, the Artillery require more careful training, possibly, than any other branch of the service. They have more work to learn, and owing to the Field Artillery and Horse Artillery being entirely new corps, taking the place of garrison batteries, not only the men but also the officers are in most cases, in a sense, recruits. Yet for the instruction of a battery thus composed there are no competent instructors except the adjutant and the non-commissioned officer. In an average battery there are from sixty to eighty absolute recruits, but there are only two men&#x2014;the instructor and the adjutant&#x2014;to put them through the difficult and varied work they have to learn. It is quite impossible, even in a matter like foot-drill or riding, to take more than twenty men at a time, and when it comes to instruction in signalling, gun-laying, and such matters, the class, if the instruction is to be at all adequate, should not consist of more than six men. Is it not possible to admit the principle, where units have been raised absolutely <i>de novo</i> and where the whole of the men are untrained, as is the case in the Horse Artillery batteries, and, to a lesser extent, in certain Field batteries, that additional instructors should be given. I know that some of the Generals have stated that the work is going on admirably, but I would like to quote two other opinions. One is that of an officer of the French General Staff, who came over to address a meeting on the subject. He stated that the whole question of Artillery must turn on your permanent staff of instructors. The other day I took a German officer of Artillery over a certain battery, and, while expressing himself interested in the work that was done, he pointed out that, with the small number of instructors that were present, it would be impossible, even with Regular soldiers, to get them properly
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0405"/>
<col>761</col>
trained. In the British Isles we give only forty drills to Artillery recruits and the fortnight's training. Is it not, therefore, essential that they should receive the best instruction possible? I would suggest that, if we cannot get Regular non-commissioned officers, we should be willing in these Artillery regiments to put up with corporals, bombardiers, or men who had been in the ranks and had just left. They could, at any rate, relieve the permanent staff of some of the instruction. </membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY of STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am sorry if I did not make the point clear in my reply to the noble Earl, Lord Dartmouth, the other day. In the statement I then made I did not intend to convey that eight sergeant-instructors were to be appointed to each battalion. That number was to be the maximum, and was only to be given to very scattered battalions.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member>: <membercontribution>I did not mean to suggest that I thought that every unit throughout the country was to have eight men. I understood the noble Lord to say that the maximum was to be eight.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>The eight sergeant-instructors were only to be given in the case of very scattered battalions, with no companies within, say, a distance of five miles. There are very few of such battalions in existence. The average per battalion is very much smaller than eight. If the noble Earl will give me an instance where he thinks that it is clearly impossible for the work to be done by the present permanent staff, I would be very glad to have the matter considered. With regard to the point raised by Lord Lovat, I would point out that the whole of this question of permanent staff is complicated by the fact that we have at the present time a very large number of recruits; and, although anxious to see these recruits properly trained, we do not want to lay down an establishment of permanent staff on the basis of the work that is to be done at the present time. I quite admit that when you have anything like a hundred recruits in a battery a permanent staff of two is inadequate; but we provided for that some time ago by saying that if cases were brought to our notice&#x2014;we asked that they should be&#x2014;where more instructors were required we would attach temporary instructors. If there are cases of that sort
<col>762</col>
we would be very glad to have them considered from that point of view. But that is an entirely different question from having a permanently larger establishment of permanent staff.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LOVAT</member>: <membercontribution>Numerous batteries that I know of have made application for extra instructors, but have not obtained them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>It has to be remembered. that an instructor on the permanent staff is a very expensive item, and costs altogether, if you take into consideration the non-effective charges as well as the actual cost of the man himself, between &#x00A3;150 and &#x00A3;200 a year. If the County Associations could arrange to have the clerical work now done by the instructors transferred to somebody else the instructors would be free to give more time to their proper and more important duty. I do not say that that would meet the difficulty entirely, but it is worthy of consideration. I will undertake to see that the case of the Artillery shall be considered. Our reputation is very much involved in the success of the Territorial Artillery, and we will do all we can to give it the very best chances possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member>: <membercontribution>With the permission of the House, I should like to ask a supplementary Question. Am I to understand that all that the County Associations have to do is to satisfy the Army Council that the existing staff is not sufficient for the work, and that in that case the necessary additions will be made. Obviously, expense is involved. You cannot run a Twentieth Century national defensive force on principles of Elizabethan finance. You have to pay for it, and if the force is to be a success I do not think expense ought to stand in the way.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>I hope the noble Earl will not think that I wish in the least to speak slightingly of the Associations, whose representations on this point, as on others, will receive the fullest consideration. But this is primarily a military matter as apart from administration, and we are bound to look at it in that light. We are not inspired in this matter by niggardly questions of pounds, shillings, and pence, but there is behind it the consideration as to how far the training of the Territorial Force should be entirely in the hands of men of the Regular Army attached to it for that purpose. One
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0406"/>
<col>763</col>
encouraging feature that I see arising is the fact that in a great many places Territorial non-commissioned officers are coming forward and doing this work very satisfactorily indeed. That was comparatively unknown before. The efficiency of the non-commissioned officers is one of the elements on which the Force as a whole will depend, and
<col>764</col>
one of the effects of this apparent shortage of the permanent staff is to bring these men out and improve their efficiency by inducing them to do this work.</membercontribution></p>

<title>VEHICLES ON HIGHWAYS BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<section>
<title>[SECOND READING.]</title>
<p>Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p>*<member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I do not wish to call attention to this matter in any spirit of old time prejudice to the motor car industry. I think your Lordships will agree that at this time of day any remarks of that sort would be wholly out of place. Probably I am right in saving that with the fall of the Sultan of Turkey we have seen the complete disappearance of the extreme anti-motor spirit. I will not say whether I wish motor cars had been introduced into this country twenty-five or thirty years later. My own views about them are that they appear to be singularly out of place in the hunting field. I could not help thinking yesterday that they had never been better employed than when I saw them carrying electors up to the poll to vote for Mr. Foster in the Stratford-on-Avon division.<lb/>
I propose now, with your Lordships' permission, to address myself to one or two aspects of the matter which may, perhaps, be broached in connection with a Bill introduced by an unofficial member of the House. The Government, I am glad to see, intend to deal with this matter in their Budget. In fact, with the exception of one or two benevolent remarks about the agricultural landlords&#x2014;which, by the way, were speedily discounted by
<col>766</col>
looking at the increase in the income tax and the death duties&#x2014;I think the Chancellor of the Exchequer's references to motor cars were the only part of the Budget in which I was able to find the slightest satisfaction. There is no doubt whatever that it would be very easy to make a long speech to prove the existence of grievances with regard to the way in which motor car traffic is conducted. I cannot help thinking that almost the chief grievance as regards the administration of the present law is the total failure to command obedience to one of its most important provisions.<lb/>
I do not propose to argue as to whether it is, or is not, an offence against morality to disobey the law with regard to the speed limit. It would, I am sure, be impertinent to do so in your Lordships' House, because I daresay I may be in the presence of some who may at one time or another have travelled in a motor car a little faster than twenty miles an hour. Exceeding the speed limit has come to be regarded in much the same category as breaking a by-law, and no stigma attaches to a man for driving a motor car at a speed of more than twenty miles an hour. I think your Lordships will agree that one regrettable aspect of the matter is that the police, in the execution of their duty, have been obliged to resort to machinery which a great many people, because they consider it vexatious, have taken means to prevent. When you find an important body of people employing an agent to keep <i>cave</i>&#x2014;as we used to call it at Eton&#x2014;it looks rather as if they were contemplating some breach of the law, or, at any rate, doing something in contravention of the spirit of the Act of Parliament, which they would rather not be found out as having done. However that may be, the statute law, which was passed for the express purpose of protecting the public from an intolerable nuisance, has utterly broken down in one of its most important provisions. That is an unwholesome state of things, and I think your Lordships will agree that Parliament ought to pass an Act as speedily as possible which will have some prospect of being obeyed.<lb/>
The three difficulties from which the general public have suffered most since motor cars were introduced arise from dust, danger, and damage. Of course, dust is by far the most fruitful source of
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0408"/>
<col>767</col>
the unpopularity of the motor car. It is not, in my humble opinion, such a serious matter as the danger, but you hear a great deal more about it, because the dust nuisance is ubiquitous. The disagreeable effects of dust are brought home to everybody, whereas a fatal accident only creates a sort of nine days' wonder in the particular locality in which it has happened. The dust nuisance, therefore, is the real reason why motor cars have become, at any rate in country districts, cordially detested by so many people. This is not in any sense due solely to the inconsiderate use of motor cars, but is absolutely an inherent result of the use of any motor car which is driven at a speed greater than ten miles an hour. It is not too much to say that nobody can go out on a dusty day and drive his car at anything like what he may consider a suitable speed without running the risk of causing very grave inconvenience to somebody or other on the highways.<lb/>
There are those who think that the alleviation of the dust nuisance is to be found in the preparation of the roads. The Chancellor of the Exchequer alluded to this in his Budget speech the other day, and I am very glad that in proposing this alleviation he had in mind the dust nuisance. But I was rather sorry to see that he qualified his proposal with regard to the dust nuisance and his general project for dealing with this trouble by saying that he had consulted the Automobile Club. I daresay he was very well advised, but I hope he will not think that because any of his proposals have received the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Automobile Club they are necessarily going to be accepted by everybody else. May I also say that I hope his visits to the Automobile Club will be tempered by an occasional call on the Highways Protection League, where he will receive some useful and excellent advice about this important matter. There is not the slightest doubt that the treatment of the roads is a highly necessary step.<lb/>
The condition of the highways in this country in a great many places is worse than it was eight years ago before the introduction of motor cars on anything like a large scale. I should think the highways of England had never been in such a good state as they were some eight or ten years ago. I am not aware that at present any invention has been adopted for the preparation of a dustless surface. I know
<col>768</col>
that here and there an inventor has claimed a success, but it is necessary to ascertain whether his preparation is really durable and whether it is not extremely expensive. It is essential also to find out whether a preparation of this kind is going to withstand the constant wear and tear of the steel-shod tires which nowadays nearly everybody has on his motor car. I hope it is not too much to express the hope that the Government, in dealing with this matter, will keep in mind the steel-studded tire and its great disintegrating power on the surface of any road, examples of which your Lordships may see in plenty up and down the country.<lb/>
Then there is another matter which ought not to be lost sight of. You cannot put the highways of this country into a condition which will make them suitable only for motor car traffic. Supposing that you can get your dustless surface, you will have to bear in mind that you must produce a road fit in all respects for public use&#x2014;a road not only fitted for motorists, but which could be used at the same time for all kinds of horsed traffic. There are in the neighbourhood of certain country towns which I know one or two roads of a very hard and slippery kind which are becoming increasingly dangerous for horses. As years go on I find I take considerably more of my pleasure in the hunting field riding down the middle of the road. It is sincerely to be hoped that the roads of the country will be treated in such a way as to keep them in a suitable state for people to take their pleasure on them on horses at the same time as others use them for motoring.<lb/>
Although I believe that the preparation of the roads will have a great deal of effect in laying the dust, there is no doubt that some part of the remedy for the present nuisance is to be found in the regulation of the speed limit. As a matter of fact, the universal treatment of the roads to prevent the dust plague will be expensive and will take a long time, and I cannot help thinking it is rather unfair to ask the general public to wait and be "dusted " day after day, week after week, and month after month until we have found time, and money, and brains to prepare our roads in a proper and suitable manner. There is no doubt that dust has a direct relation to speed. The findings of the Royal Com-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0409"/>
<col>769</col>
mission prove that beyond the shadow of a doubt. You will remember that in the opinion of the Commissioners the quantity of dust raised at a speed of ten miles an hour is comparatively slight. It increases greatly when the speed is from ten to twenty miles an hour, and continues to increase, though not quite at a corresponding ratio, at greater speeds.<lb/>
Then there is the question of the danger. I will not recite to your Lordships the number of accidents which occur every year in this country. That number, as you are aware, is great. The answer of motorists will be&#x2014;at any rate it is the argument one usually hears&#x2014;that there have probably been more accidents caused by horsed vehicles than by motors. If that point is raised my reply is that the Bill which I am asking you to consider deals with the question of horsed vehicles as well as motor vehicles. The most disastrous of all accidents which are caused are, undoubtedly, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer said, the accidents to children. It would of course, be very difficult to prevent children loitering on the road when returning from school. I do not propose in this Bill that children should have a right to play in the road and to use it for all and sundry purposes whenever they wish to do so. But the fact remains that you will not be able by running over them to bring the children of England into such a frame of mind that they will get out of the way speedily whenever they see a motor car coming.<lb/>
It is impossible not to sympathise in a sort of way with those who have had the misfortune to run over children in the road, but somehow or other after an accident of that kind, by means of the Press accounts of the occurrence and letters which are written to the newspapers, the sympathy which in the natural order of things the parents of the child should enjoy is contrived to be shifted to those who have perpetrated the accident. I daresay your Lordships will remember the terrible tragedy which happened at Staines a few months ago. I am not calling attention to that sad occurrence now for the purpose of making capital out of it, though I think it would be quite possible to make a great deal of capital out of it. Neither do I wish to bring any charge whatever against the humanity of the owner or the of the motor car, nor find fault with or traverse
<col>770</col>
in any way the judgment delivered in respect of that very disastrous accident. But I think you will agree with me that the parent who went from the graveside after burying one of his children to the bedside in the hospital of three more of them, finding one helpless with a broken thigh and the other two unable to speak or to recognise their father, was a more deserving object of sympathy than the gentleman who ran down the children. This undoubtedly is a state of things which must be remedied by nothing less than an Act of Parliament.<lb/>
The Bill I am asking your Lordships to consider contains what I hope all parties concerned in the question may find to be a reasonable compromise in the matter of speed; because, after all, it is speed and nothing else but speed which has been at the bottom of nine-tenths of the trouble as regards the nuisance caused by motor cars to the general public. In dealing with this matter I have preferred to leave the condition of the large towns as it is at present. London, for instance, has a sufficient organisation of its own to make itself felt and to insure that its views shall be properly represented in Parliament. Not only that, but in London and other great cities the police are always at hand, whereas in country districts they are very often absent at the moment when they are most wanted. I therefore propose that in rural villages and other places which are dangerous according to the spirit of this Bill there shall be a speed limit of not more than ten miles an hour. The answer to this may be that in a great many places such a restriction has already been imposed; that the local authority has, in fact, already set up a speed limit where it is necessary. My reply is that the local authority is by no means to be depended upon to do this, and that in many places where local authorities have actually imposed a speed limit, observance of the regulation is not enforced by proper penalties. Also the signals are not taken proper notice of by motorists, who shoot past them without slackening speed, and go straight into the danger zone as if the signals were not there at all.<lb/>
I have had a certain amount of experience of driving on the roads ever since I left school. I have driven every sort of carriage from a hansom cab to a four-in-hand for pleasure and hire, both in town
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0410"/>
<col>771</col>
and country. Therefore I believe I may humbly suggest that I have some right to speak about the dangers of the roads; and I say, without fear of contradiction, that ten miles an hour is quite fast enough for any motor car or horse-drawn vehicle to proceed through country villages, over cross roads, round corners, or through any tortuous places where a difficult situation is likely to arise at any moment, bringing with it considerable dangers. This restriction would be no hardship to motor car owners, but would be shared by them in common with the owners of other vehicles, and should not therefore be objected to in any way. I have no wish to say anything that could be at all construed as a threat, but unless this principle is accepted by those who represent what I may call the motor party I, for one, will be no party on this occasion or in the future to extending the speed limit in the open.<lb/>
Now we come to the extension of the speed limit to thirty miles in strictly open country. That is a matter which has aroused considerable controversy. Some people say it is a great deal too much, while others say it is not nearly enough. I think on the whole, from letters I have received and other evidence which has reached me, that in my desire to effect a compromise between the two extreme parties I have met with the greater condemnation from those who think that a speed of thirty miles an hour in the open is too much. But although this may be thought by some to be a considerable concession, everybody at some time or another goes at nearly thirty miles an hour, and a great many go considerably faster. As far as I can see, the Legislature is entirely unable at the present moment to prevent people travelling at twenty-five or twenty-six miles an hour. It is a practice which is almost universally indulged in by motorists who go out on the country roads. Some people may say the fact that everybody breaks the law at the present moment is not a sufficient reason for pandering to this sort of thing, and that we ought to stiffen the penalties so as to compel them to keep within the twenty mile speed limit. But we are faced with the situation that at the present moment the attempt to enforce a speed limit of twenty miles an hour has collapsed altogether, and something must be done, in the interests of good government, to
<col>772</col>
pass a law which has some chance of being obeyed by motorists. Thirty miles an hour seems to me the outside speed at which any vehicle, horse-drawn or otherwise, should be allowed to proceed along the roads of this country.<lb/>
There is a certain school of motorists which wishes to do away with the speed limit altogether, but I hope your Lordships will agree that the abolition of a general speed limit of some kind or other would create a very serious lack of public confidence, and is not a thing which the vast majority of the electors of this country would find themselves in accord with for a single moment. As far as I am concerned, I must offer a most uncompromising opposition to the entire abolition of the speed limit. Some owners say, "Why don't you abolish it altogether and fine us heavily if we drive to the common danger?" A noble Lord says "hear. hear." That is, I admit, on the face of it an exceedingly fair way of dealing with the matter. I was going to use the word "plausible," and I hope noble Lords will not accuse me of any offence in the matter. It is, however, very difficult to prove that anybody is driving to the common danger, as frequent experience has shown. If you abolish the speed limit altogether a clever motorist will be able to spend most of his life travelling about the roads at a speed of forty, fifty, or even sixty miles an hour, and, if he has a bit of luck, and does not print the letters on the back of his car in large type, he may escape punishment altogether. Such a man might throughout his career as a motorist constantly cause intense inconvenience to other users of the public roads on which he travelled, and I think few people would say that he should be allowed to do this unchecked.<lb/>
There are, however, those who say that there are quite a number of places in this country where it is possible to go at a considerably greater speed than thirty miles an hour with perfect safety. Salisbury Plain is usually the place instanced by this school of thought when they argue as to the extension of the speed limit. But there is only one Salisbury Plain in England, and although there are other places, like the fen country in Cambridgeshire, where you may travel at a speed of thirty miles an hour, or even a little more, for a few minutes without encountering
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0411"/>
<col>773</col>
serious danger, these are not the considerations which ought to be taken into account in dealing with the regulation of motor traffic. England is not big enough for that kind of thing. The country is intersected for the most part by rather narrow winding roads, and there are few places where the kind of enterprise I have described can be indulged in with absolute safety. I have in my possession a copy of an advertisement of a motor light which I have no doubt has been sent to some of your Lordships. It must be advertised, I suppose, to meet a demand for this sort of thing. One of the advanatges claimed for this light is that if you use it on your motor car you will be able to go at a speed of at least forty miles an hour on a dark night. This suggests a state of things which should not be allowed to continue, and I sincerely hope that the noble Earl opposite (Earl Russell) in considering the motor question, will take very serious note of it. I shall be only too pleased, if he wishes to know the name of the gentleman who advertises this light, to supply him with it on a suitable occasion.<lb/>
The limit of speed to thirty miles an hour is not, I submit, in the nature of a restriction that will injure the motor car industry in any way whatever. It will be a concession to a class of motorists who, after all, form quite a small fraction of the motor community, and a still smaller fraction of the community at large. Those who use motor cars for pure pleasure in this country will not, I am convinced, find fault with me when I suggest that, after all, they are a very small minority of the whole community, and that others are entitled to consideration as well as themselves. In order further to secure the safety of the public I have caused a clause to be drafted in this Bill to the effect that the fact of a motorist being able to prove that he was driving at a speed below thirty miles an hour, or ten or twenty miles as the case may be, shall not necessarily be held to be a valid answer to the charge of driving to the public danger. In this way the public will receive a double protection.<lb/>
I now come to the apportionment of the roads over which these various speed limits may be exercised. This is, I admit at once, a matter of very considerable difficulty. The first impulse. of course, is to say to the local authority that they ought to do it in response to the appeal of the inhabitants
<col>774</col>
of any particular locality. But the county council are not always to be trusted in this matter. I do not like telling tales out of school about my own county council; but I am going to do so all the same. The Warwickshire County Council have been particularly unsatisfactory in this respect. It has frequently been memorialised by dwellers in the villages and elsewhere, but somehow or other the appeal has not been forwarded to the quarters where the memorialists hoped it would eventually be sent. I am not for a moment bringing any charge against the purity of intention of the county council. I have not the slightest doubt that they act with the greatest integrity, but if the proceedings had been controlled by the President of the Royal Automobile Club himself they could not possibly have played better into the hands of the motorists. I trust, however, that in accordance with the suggestion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the local authorities will be required to carry out the proposed duties under the control of the central Government.<lb/>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer himself suggested that the management of the roads should become a part of the duties of the central Government. The scheme of the Bill is that the Local Government Board shall make regulations and prescribe the class of roads to come under the ten, twenty, and thirty mile speed limits respectively. Then the local authority is, within three months after the passing of the Act, to submit a draft scheme to the Local Government Board, showing the places and limits in their district within which, in accordance with the regulations, the respective speed limits should be fixed as the maximum speeds. The draft scheme is to be advertised, and any person will have a right to lodge an objection to it with the Local Government Board, who will determine whether the scheme is satisfactory or not. I will not, however, weary your Lordships with details of the machinery. I have set forth the main object of the Bill, which is that we should secure something like uniformity in the management of the roads of the country, and the general application of the speed limit and of motor car regulations. I contend that this can only be done by taking the power out of the hands of the local authority and having the whole matter controlled by the Local Government Board. There are one or two matters
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0412"/>
<col>775</col>
that will require a certain amount of attention.<lb/>
There is a clause in the Bill that the owner of a car shall be guilty of an offence under the Act as well as his driver. This is a clause which I hope the noble Earl on the Front Bench opposite will give his very serious consideration to in framing any future regulations. It is only in accord with the recommendation of the Royal Commission. If your Lordships refer to paragraph 97 in the Blue-book containing the Report of the Royal Commission on this question, you will find there a recommendation to this effect. It is so easy to say that the owner of a car cannot control the driver if the owner is not himself in the car and if the driver is exceeding the speed limit. I believe, however, the owner is <i>particeps criminis</i>, and ought to suffer as well as his chauffeur. If anybody says that his chauffeur is constantly in the habit of exceeding the speed limit without him knowing about it, this means either that he cannot or will not issue proper orders to his own servants with regard to keeping the law. If I had a car, which I have not, I would see that the driver always restrained himself within the limits prescribed by law.<lb/>
With regard to the penalties, I propose that under the Bill they shall be increased as compared with the penalties we are already accustomed to in the case of offending motorists. A great many fancy penalties have been suggested at one time or another, such, for instance, as the impounding of the car. I believe the impounding of the owner himself will in the end be found to be more effective than anything else. I propose, therefore, to rely for punishment on the old-fashioned methods of fine and imprisonment. These are, I believe, the best method's of stigmatising those who have committed an offence against society. They are set forth in the Bill. There is an increased power given to magistrates to fine motorists, and a second offence can be punished, if thought desirable, by imprisonment. At the present moment the fine which magistrates are allowed to inflict is hopelessly inadequate, because it is no punishment for a rich man to be fined on ten or twenty occasions in a year the trifling sum of &#x00A3;5 or so. I also thought, in order to help insure that everybody should know what he was doing, that a speedometer should be carried
<col>776</col>
in every motor car. This, I think, might help to provide a check upon speed.<lb/>
Then there comes the question of the abolition of the horn or loud instrument of warning. I can hardly find any one to support me in my desire to do away with the motor car horn. I cannot understand why. The provision, however, is not vital to this important measure, though I do think that if you take away the power of a motorist to clear all the traffic when a considerable distance away you will tend to lessen the speed at which he goes. Not only that, but the constant blowing of horns in villages and populous places is becoming a very grave nuisance indeed, and I have received a great number of complaints from those who live near street corners. It seems to me that motor car owners and drivers wish to arrogate to themselves the privileges of the fire engine, and to be enabled to order everybody out of the way for a considerable distance ahead of them. This is very much objected to by almost everybody. The general public think it is far better to sacrifice their personal dignity to their personal safety. Drivers of motor cars do not wish to be put to the trouble that drivers of horse carriages are occasionally put to of having to stand up and shout to drivers of vans to get out of the way. The policy to which I have tried to give effect in this Bill is that of treating horse carriages and motor cars in the same way. I have endeavoured to explain, as briefly as possible, the few proposals I have ventured to lay before your Lordships' House, and I desire to thank you for the kind way in which you have listened to me.<lb/>

<quote>"In the opinion of this House, the public safety will not be promoted by any legislation dealing with the speed of vehicles apart from the surrounding circumstances, and failing to distinguish between questions of speed and questions of danger, or to recognise the superior control of mechanically propelled as compared with horse-drawn traffic."</quote><lb/>
The noble Earl said: My Lords, since the noble Lord gave notice of the Second Reading of this Bill the situation has become slightly changed, and I think there
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0413"/>
<col>777</col>
will not be so many motor cars to annoy him after the various taxes we have heard of in another place are imposed. But I think a word of thanks is due from motorists to the noble Lord for the courtesy and moderation with which he stated his case against the motor car, and for not repeating a great many of the arguments I am sure he hears at the Highways Protection League when he presides over its meetings. We have seen in the papers extremely intolerant and violent utterances directed against motorists which have been inspired purely and simply by prejudice. The noble Lord did not, of course, repeat those accusations here.<lb/>
There is one merit in this Bill&#x2014;I will not say its only merit, but a preeminent merit&#x2014;and that is that for the first time motor cars and carriages are treated on the same basis. If that view had been adopted almost from the beginning&#x2014;as I believe your Lordships' House was at one time ready to do, or, at any rate, to go very far in that direction&#x2014;I think we should have had very little of the trouble which has arisen. The Bill in that respect does not go so far as it might. If the noble Lord had carried it a little further and included the licensing of those who have charge of horses and the other provisions of the Motor Car Act, I am not sure he would not have induced me to refrain from moving anything against his measure, because we who use the roads, not always behind horses, suffer from the vagaries of those who are put in charge of horses on the highways. We also have our grievances, but they are not much listened to, and therefore we do not trouble to make them.<lb/>
The particular proposals of this Bill, I think, are worth examining for a moment. The first part of the first clause deals with speeds of ten, twenty, and thirty miles an hour. At first sight it appears to be a very curious provision to make the speed limit in towns twenty miles an hour, while in rural villages, with their open streets, it is only ten miles an hour. There is one reason which may have been in the mind of the noble Lord&#x2014;namely, that the towns can make or apply for their own regulations. So far as that goes, so can rural villages under the present Act. The noble Lord shakes his head; but I would direct his attention to Handcross on the London and Brighton road, where the Local
<col>778</col>
Government Board&#x2014;why, I cannot say&#x2014;have granted a speed limit of ten miles on a perfectly open road with no houses on it. There is a small populous district in the middle, but at either end there is a perfectly open and safe road. That is a case where a rural village has managed to obtain a regulation. But there is another reason which has occurred to me, and may have something possibly to do with the noble Lord's proposal, which is that in a rural village people shall be free to wander about the streets, and even, perhaps, play in the streets, without paying any attention to the traffic. I am sure your Lordships are acquainted with many of these villages round London, but I should like to give one or two examples.<lb/>
Take, for instance, Colnbrook on the Bath Road, which your Lordships who are acquainted with the road will probably agree would not be at all an unsuitable place for a ten-mile limit. It is a very dangerous and narrow street, and is entered by a corner at either end. Then there is a village known to most of us&#x2014;Ripley, on the Portsmouth Road&#x2014;which has a very wide road running through it bordered on either side by a very wide margin. It is quite impossible for any sane individual to reach the road through Ripley without being seen for a long way in advance, and I defy the noble Lord who moved the Second Reading of this measure to give any adequate reason connected with the public safety which would justify a limit of ten miles in that village. There are similar cases all over the country, and I venture to suggest to your Lordships that an artificial limit laid down in an artificial manner will never meet the necessities of the case.<lb/>
If you look at paragraph (a) in subsection (1) of Clause 1, among other things mentioned are cross-roads. There, again, I think, those of us who use the roads. whether with horses or motors, know that there are cross-roads and cross-roads. There are some cross-roads with walls right up to the corner on each side, with the result that many will round them at four or five miles an hour with fear and trembling. There are other cross-roads on open heaths and commons where you can see either side for 200 yards. No two cross-roads are alike in their characteristics, and it is quite impossible that the same hard and fast limit should apply to
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0414"/>
<col>779</col>
cross-roads in a town and cross-roads in the country without distinction. The provisions of Section 1 of the Motor Car Act are reproduced in subsection (2), and to that, I think, there is no objection on the part of any motorist. Motorists have always held that that section is the one to be relied upon. Subsection (3) deals with competitions on the public highway, and I am not quite sure how much the noble Lord means to include. To drive a vehicle on a public highway in competition with any other vehicle for the purpose of racing is, as I think everyone would agree, improper; but "for the purpose of racing or for any wager " would raise another question. It seems to me that if two people agree to drive their vehicles at ten miles an hour for a bet of five shillings to see who should use the lesser quantity of petrol, that would come under the noble Lord's clause. I do not know whether that is intended.<lb/>
I now come to Clause 3, under which it is proposed that the local authority shall make a draft scheme, in default of which it shall be made by the Local Government Board. This matter is to rest upon the local authority, but not entirely, because the noble Lord is not satisfied apparently with what the local authorities have done. From the motorist's point of view some of the local authorities have a reasonable sense of their duty, while others take an unreasonable view. Hertfordshire has applied for a ten-mile limit for a large number of places which I think most motorists would consider perfectly safe, and, rather to my surprise, the noble Lord gave as an example the County of Warwickshire. It may be that the County Council of Warwickshire has not applied for the ten-mile limit in all the places to which he would like to see it applied; but, so far as unreasonableness goes in enforcing the speed limit, Warwickshire has gone very far, because I understand that all the roads leading to Coventry are trapped by long distance traps. The noble Lord probably knows his own county, but it is stated that 100 stop-watches have been purchased for the express purpose of timing motorists. If the noble Lord in these circumstances is not satisfied with the action of the local authorities in Warwickshire, I think I am entitled to view with some apprehension any legislation which will carry it further. With regard to the road between Warwick and Leamington,
<col>780</col>
it is stated that only recently there has been a large number of prosecutions of motorists for travelling at a speed not exceeding sixteen or seventeen miles an hour. That road is one of the widest and straightest roads in the Kingdom as regards a large part of its length, and I believe that the trams which run along the middle of the road habitually go faster than the speed allowed to motor cars. Perhaps the noble Lord is satisfied with what has happened upon that particular road, at any rate.<lb/>
Then we come to Clause 5, which deals with the use of the horn. I was not surprised to hear the noble Lord say that he had not much support for that section. I have a friend who habitually walks, and he tells me that the one vehicle to which he objects is the bicycle, on account of its silence. He dislikes to find himself suddenly in danger of being run down without any warning, and I think, from the point of view of those who walk on the roads, there is no objection to the use of the horn to warn them. The noble Lord has certain complaints to make at the way in which the horn is used, and to that extent I am with him. If it is used to clear the road, as in the case of a fire engine, it is quite a different thing. It is not the fault of the motorist but of the law, which requires the motorist to use the horn to give warning of his position or approach. I have been in cases even before a London stipendiary magistrate in which the driver of a motor car has been convicted for not sounding his horn at a cross-road, even although no traffic was there and he could not tell whether there was anything to warn. The result of the law and of these rules is that a motorist who does not sound his horn on every occasion on which there can possibly be something to warn, exposes himself to conviction, and he is between the devil and the deep sea. He is between his desire not to be offensive to other users of the road and the chance of finding himself held up by some officious constable. Therefore the horn is used more often than is necessary. As to the process of standing up and shouting, that may be all very well in a drive of reasonable length, but if you are to cover 100 miles in a day and you stand up and shout at every vehicle that obstructs you, you will not have much voice left at the end of the day, and many people, I think, who did not start with a good voice would not care to drive a car
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0415"/>
<col>781</col>
at all without somebody to run in front. If the noble Lord has ever tried to pass a traction engine with three trucks behind it on a country road he will know that very often shouting does not attract the driver, and for such occasions most of us, I believe, carry a dog whistle.<lb/>
The noble Lord stated that Section 9 of the Motor Car Act was passed for the express purpose of protecting the public, but Section 9 is not used for protecting the public. The counties against which motorists have most ground of complaint are the home counties. The state of things in Surrey is a disgrace to the administration of the law. Surrey has many narrow and dangerous lanes, with populous villages. But the police are not stationed at the dangerous corners, but on the most open and straight pieces of road that can be found in the county. They are not stationed there to protect the public. They are not in the view of the public or of the motorist. They are concealed behind hedges, and they appear only if the motorist is exceeding the twenty-mile limit and for the purpose of securing a prosecution and a conviction. That is a way of enforcing the law which really brings the law into contempt. What is surely desired by all of us is the safety of the public, which is in no way secured by setting police traps on the Cobham fair-mile. Probably your Lordships are aware that there have been fatal accidents at a very dangerous corner in Esher. I daresay all of your Lordships are not aware that on one of these occasions, when an unfortunate fatal accident occurred at that corner, no policeman was there on duty to regulate the traffic, but three policemen were hiding behind a hedge half a mile away on a straight piece of road. These are the things which have made motorists feel that Section 9 is not used for the safety of the public, but for undesirable reasons, and on that ground motorists have often urged that reliance should be placed on Section 1.<lb/>
The noble Lord says, in regard to Section 1, that it is difficult to obtain a conviction under that section. If the noble Lord means it would be difficult to obtain a conviction for driving to the public danger on the Cobham fair-mile because you are going at twenty-five miles an hour, surely that is a very right and proper thing, because in ordinary cases there would be
<col>782</col>
no danger to the public. I think from this very county of Surrey I can draw an instance as to the supposed necessity for an invariable ten-mile limit from a case which occurred not very long ago at Godalming, where at a very dangerous corner a car was driven round at a speed which was proved to be twenty-two miles an hour. The driver was summoned before a bench of Surrey magistrates, who are not particularly favourable to motorists. The speed was admitted, but evidence was given which so completely satisfied the magistrates of the absolute control under which the car was, and of the fact that at any moment the car could be pulled up within the range of the driver's view, that they dismissed the case, though with reluctance. I know I should not care to go round that corner at twenty-two miles an hour, but I can conceive that this particular car, in good order, might be driven at that rate without involving danger to the public.<lb/>
Many of us regard not only danger to the public but consideration for the feelings of the public. We do not desire to go round a corner in such a way that we can stop in safety only with a skid. We desire to drive in a way that does not alarm the public. Those who have to pass through Surrey get no consideration for this line of conduct. The only places where you can drive fast are the towns and the villages. On the open roads the motorist has to spend his whole time watching the speedometer and thinking about the police and the law. The noble Lord said that the power to enforce Section 1 would collapse because the letters on the car would be of small size. Surely the noble Lord knows that there is a standard size prescribed by regulation, and it is impossible for the owner of the car to alter that size. It has been shown that there is no real difficulty in stopping a car or getting at a car, if not in the place of the offence, at any rate in the next village. It is for those reasons I venture to submit the Amendment standing in my name, to the effect that legislation which deals with speed, apart from the surrounding circumstances, does not conduce to the public safety.<lb/>
The noble Lord talked of Salisbury Plain as an instance where you can exceed twenty or thirty miles an hour. I can give dozens of other instances upon downs in Wiltshire and Hampshire, a large portion
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0416"/>
<col>783</col>
of the Holyhead road, the Great North road, and the Bath road. There are many places where these speeds are perfectly safe&#x2014;that is to say, where you can drive and no human being can come within a quarter of a mile without your knowledge. The noble Lord said he had had long experience in driving every kind of horsed vehicle. That is exactly the difficulty in this discussion. Experience, however prolonged, in driving horsed vehicles, does not bring to the driver a knowledge of the control of a motor car, which can only be obtained by driving it himself in all circumstances and in all conditions. With the best will in the world the noble Lord could not, and does not, appreciate the control which is possessed by the driver of a modern motor car when he is handling that vehicle on the road. That makes discussion of this sort so extremely difficult, because one has not common ground to go upon. We who do drive motor cars have realised that control of the car is the great thing. We know very well that the other user of the road does behave in a very unexpected and disconcerting manner, and you have to be prepared for that.<lb/>
I will not follow the argument as to the dust nuisance, which seems to be quite a separate question, and has nothing to do with the safety of the public. It may or may not be right to limit the speed to ten miles an hour because the roads are dusty; but that is a different question from the one put forward in this Bill. It is for these reasons that I ask your Lordships to express what was your opinion before, and I hope is still, that regulations of this sort, applying whether the streets are crowded or not, whether the surface of the road is greasy or not, whether you are driving in the busy part of the day when a market is going on, or at 5 a.m. when there is not a soul in the street&#x2014;that restrictions of this sort, which lay down an artificial limit, cannot tend to the safety of the public.<lb/>

<col>784</col>
<p>*<member>LORD ALLENDALE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the House, I am quite sure, will have listened with considerable interest to the debate initiated by my noble friend opposite. It is not the first time that the noble Lord has raised the question of motor traffic in your Lordships' House, and before I go on to other questions with which this Bill deals I should like to say how glad I was to hear the expression of satisfaction made by the noble Lord at the financial aspect of the case as foreshadowed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer a few days ago. I can only hope that it will equally give satisfaction to my noble friend Lord Montagu, who last year, I rather think, advocated the course now proposed. Last year, as I need hardly remind your Lordships, the noble Lord who moved the Second Reading of this Bill, raised a debate on motor traffic by way of a Question to His Majesty's Government and referred generally to matters connected with motor traffic, and more especially to the dust nuisance and speed Limit to which he has specially addressed himself to-day. It was my duty to tell the noble Lord that it was not the intention of His Majesty's Government at that time to introduce fresh legislation on the subject, although the Local Government Board was, and is, carefully following the operation of the existing Acts which govern locomotives on highways and motor traffic, with a view of dealing with the matter when the occasion arises. No doubt it was my inability to satisfy my noble friend last year on this subject that induced him to bring forward this Bill to-day.<lb/>
The Bill, as has already been pointed out, deals with various subjects, probably the most important of which, and certainly the most controversial, as we have already seen to-day, is the question of speed limit. Your Lordships, of course, are all familiar with the provisions of the existing Motor Car Act passed in 1903. Under that Act the Local Government Board, on the application of the local authority, can impose a lower maximum speed of ten miles an hour in certain places and under certain conditions. The Bill before us provides for considerable alterations in the matter of maximum speed. It proposes three different maximum speed limits, namely, ten miles when near any rural village, dangerous corner, or cross-road; twenty miles in or near any town; and thirty miles in
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0417"/>
<col>785</col>
the open country. The expression "open country" is very vague, but the thirty mile maximum is, no doubt, proposed as a compromise for the more universal lower speed limit. It is not easy to say precisely what is intended by the term "open country." Salisbury Plain has already been alluded to, as it generally is when the question of open country is mentioned. Possibly, too, some moorland roads in the north of England, although, perhaps, not very inviting to motor traffic, may be included in the term "open country." Many stretches of highway, such as the Great North road, to which reference has been made, and other main roads on which dwellings are few and villages far apart, but which are fenced generally on either side, in some cases by high fences, and are intersected by cross-roads can, I think, hardly be called "open country." A more precise definition than that laid down in the Bill would certainly be necessary.<lb/>
The noble Lord who moved the Second Reading of this Bill also raised the question, to some extent, of the wear and tear of the road and the dust nuisance, but these particular points he also brought to the notice of the House last year. I think those subjects were the main burden of his speech on that occasion, when he denounced, as I thought, motor traffic generally. I was surprised, therefore, that the noble Lord, holding the views he does, should propose to extend the speed limit to thirty miles an hour; and I very much doubt whether he will carry public opinion with him in this proposal even in regard to open country or on such roads as I have described. Then the Bill attempts to classify speed limits in what I may call a somewhat anomalous manner. There are cases where ten miles an hour in or near any rural village may be unduly low, and cases where in the open country thirty miles may be unduly high. At any rate, attempts to differentiate between the speeds in certain areas would be very difficult.<lb/>
I may, perhaps, now refer to the Amendment of the noble Earl, the purport of which was not quite clear to me before he made his speech. If the intention of the noble Lord is to abolish the speed limit altogether, I am afraid it will be as impossible for the Government to accept his Amendment as it will be for them to accept
<col>786</col>
the Second Reading of the Bill. I am quite sure that the Government could not carry public opinion with them were they ready now to extend the speed limit beyond what the present law provides for. The present speed limit, although, perhaps, rather arbitrary and artificial, has been imposed with a view to public safety, and although I certainly have some sympathy with the contention of the noble Earl that speed in itself, apart from surrounding circumstances, is not the only consideration, we do not think public opinion would tolerate any great extension of the speed limit.<lb/>
Under Clause 2 of the Bill the Local Government Board are to make regulations, which are to describe generally classes of places and limits within which respective speeds shall not be exceeded, and the Local Government Board can proceed to make special regulations of a local nature in regard to particular places. This is, I take it, in order to remedy the somewhat vague definition of areas and localities, which the noble Lord or his draftsman has not felt able to deal with in the Bill. If any clearer definition is to be made I would certainly suggest that it should be done in the Bill and not left to a Government Department. As has already been explained, draft schemes are to be submitted by the local authority in the form to be prescribed by the Local Government Board, and are to be submitted to that Department. Those draft schemes are to be submitted by all county councils and by the councils of boroughs whose population was over 10,000 at the last census, and the draft schemes are to show the places and limits in their districts within which, in the opinion of the local authority, the respective speeds mentioned in the Bill should be fixed as the maximum speeds. I think your Lordships will see that that would be a very difficult matter. The case of boroughs would be, perhaps, somewhat simple, but innumerable difficulties would be presented in county areas. As I read the proposals in the Bill, the county council are to make a scheme for all public highways in their own area, distinguishing such of them as are in or near rural villages or come within the expression "dangerous corner," "cross-road," "precipitous place," and so on; in or near any town; and in the open country. Then, if the local authority do not submit a draft scheme to the Local Government Board
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0418"/>
<col>787</col>
within a certain period, further time is to be given, and if they then fail, they are to be compelled by mandamus to submit one. I venture to say that this is almost impossible to carry out. How are you going to deal with county councils if they refuse to draw up a scheme? It would be a work of great magnitude for some county councils to carry out a scheme of this sort at all, and it would entail a great addition to their staff as well as to the staff of the Local Government Board. I shudder to think what the increase of the staff would be. There would have to be an army of inspectors of the Local Government Board going all over the country to examine the schemes proposed and to report upon them.<lb/>
The sub-division of the country, as proposed by Clause 1, is both unsatisfactory and quite unworkable. No regulation which the Board could issue under Clause 2 could make it otherwise, and there would be the greatest difficulty in insuring that the local authorities would act under the clause. The question of dust has been alluded to by the noble Lord, and knowing the opinion which he holds, I am very much surprised at his proposal to increase the speed. I am sure that on a day like this, for instance, with a strong East wind blowing, dust would be a great nuisance if you were going only ten miles an hour, but I think there is no denying that the dust becomes a much greater nuisance as the speed increases. The noble Lord makes no provision in the Bill, and I do not see how he could, for dealing with the construction of roads, and I quite agree with what has fallen from him that roads which could be made partially dustless by the expenditure of a great deal of money would be very unpleasant for horse traffic. I know certain portions of roads which have been laid down in Northumberland with a view partly to abate the dust nuisance. They are very unpleasant and slippery if you happen to be riding along them when hunting.<lb/>
I now come to the question of horns, which also was discussed last year. As I pointed out then, there are two sides to the question. No doubt the use of the horn is sometimes very much abused, and I, for one&#x2014;and I am sure most of your Lordships&#x2014;will not accept the theory that, because a man chooses to blow his horn continuously, every other kind of traffic is to
<col>788</col>
make way for him. But, on the other hand, if the speed limit is to be extended, as Lord Willoughby proposes, to thirty miles an hour, I think he would find the use of the horn to be far more necessary than it is at a lower speed. It is not only with motor cars that horns, bells, and so on are a nuisance. I do not know whether the noble Lord has ever stayed in Brussels. I once stayed there for two or three nights and was kept awake by the ringing of tram bells, which is a far greater nuisance than any motor horn I have ever heard. As pointed out last year, in cases of accidents where police proceedings follow, one of the first questions put is, "Did the man blow his horn? " and an irate person who has just had a narrow escape always asks the driver why he did not do so. Although I admit that unreasonable use is made of the horn at times, on the whole the balance of advantage is on the side of the use of the horn as an instrument of warning. I need hardly go into the question of speedometers. Their accuracy cannot, I believe, be guaranteed. When one has been invented which can be certified as correct. and which is not capable of being tampered with, then I think will be the time for the compulsory use of speedometers.<lb/>
I should like to refer for a moment to what fell from the noble Lord with regard to the Report of the Royal Commission on Motor Cars. I think the noble Lord takes the Commissioners rather further than they intended to go upon this question of responsibility of the owner of the car for offences under the Bill. No doubt, if the owner of a car is in the car and connives at any offence committed by his driver, he ought to be held equally liable, but on many occasions the owner of the car knows nothing about driving, although he makes use of the car a good deal. He may not be a judge of speed and may not know in what way the law is being broken by the driver. Paragraph 97, to which the noble Lord referred, in the Report of the Royal Commission on Motor Cars, after drawing attention to the liability of the owner at common law, says:&#x2014;
<quote>"To impose a further criminal responsibility appears to us undesirable, but we think that when the owner or hirer or any person in the car can be shown to have been abetting the driver in offences under Section 1 of the Motor Car Act, 1903, he should be equally liable to fine or imprisonment, to withdrawal of licence, and to suspension of registration of his car."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0419"/>
<col>789</col>
I think most people will agree with the view expressed by the Royal Commission, and that the clause proposed by the noble Lord goes too far. I have referred to the main provisions of the Bill, and to the objections which His Majesty's Government entertain with regard to them. Whilst the Act of 1903 cannot be considered in any way as final, and no doubt in many particulars requires amendment, yet the Bill which your Lordships are asked to read a second time to-day is, in the opinion of the Local Government Board, who have carefully gone into the matter, much too drastic, and would not improve the existing state of affairs as regards motoring. I venture, therefore, to ask your Lordships not to read it a second time.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>*LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, there is not very much more to be said on the subject after the able speeches to which we have listened. While I agree to a great extent with what Lord Russell said, I do recognise that the noble Lord who brought in this Bill wishes to hold out an olive branch to motorists generally, and by extending the speed limit to thirty miles an hour he has made a distinct advance upon any previous position he has taken up. But the whole matter of motor car speed and regulation must, and probably before long will, be dealt with by the Government as a Government; and I do not think the noble Lord's Bill really covers anything like the points which will have to be dealt with. In addition, in my opinion, it raises the penalties unduly in many cases, and leaves the motor community suffering under grievances the removal of which we should wish to make part of a bargain or an arrangement with anyone who brought in a Bill by which we were submitted to higher penalties.<lb/>
As regards the three speed limits, I am not in the least opposed to them in principle. I have always said that a speed limit of some kind was necessary for populous places, and a higher speed limit for those which were less populous. I think a thirty-mile limit on the open road, provided it was fairly fixed, not by any local highway authority but by responsible people appointed by the Local Government Board, would have a great deal to be said for it. The Bill to-day, as the noble Lord who last spoke said, is extremely crude, and though I and a great many motorists who agree with me have no objection to
<col>790</col>
the Second Reading, I do not think the noble Lord who introduced it would like the Amendments we should wish to introduce in Committee. I think in the end he would hardly find the Bill in accordance with the views of those on whose behalf he has brought it in. It is a very dangerous thing, indeed, to give small local bodies large powers with regard to motors. You have only to carry your mind back a very few years to recall the fact that any invention or improvement of locomotion has been opposed by small local bodies, who are almost always in the frame of mind to oppose anything new, especially anything which tends to upset their preconceived notions. That being so, I have very little trust in the small local bodies, and although the noble Lord in charge of the Bill spoke ether slightingly of county councils in general, I think on the whole they have dealt with the matter impartially and sensibly. So far as my county council in Hampshire is concerned, they have looked at the matter from a perfectly impartial and common-sense point of view, and I think on the whole have given satisfaction to all classes in the community.<lb/>
But if you are going to allow every little authority to set up its own speed limit the position will be intolerable. In France you see the most ridiculous notices in villages telling drivers not to exceed four miles an hour on a perfectly wide road; but as no one is there to enforce the requirement, it is merely a pious opinion on the part of the local authority. Such special notices as "Please drive slowly through the village," is, in my opinion, a far more effective way of getting people to drive through a certain locality slowly. Another reason why I am rather inclined to think the House should pause before giving this Bill a Second Reading, or should, at any rate, alter it very seriously in Committee, is that since the Budget was introduced it is obvious that a large amount of money to be raised from motorists will be applied in widening dangerous places, in cutting off corners, and doing various things which will increase the safety of the public. Therefore I think that the clause about cross-roads and precipitous places will become quite obsolete in the course of a few years.<lb/>
The noble Lord who spoke on behalf of the Government said he hoped I found the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0420"/>
<col>791</col>
proposals of Mr. Lloyd-George to my liking. That is a question rather hard to answer at first, because none of us exactly know how the impositions are going to fall; but those who are not violent partisans on this question have always asked for some fund for the maintenance of the roads, and I for one will cheerfully pay the tax. On the whole, I think, that it will be of advantage to motorists and the public, and that with slight modifications the principle is not bad. This discussion, however, seems to be more or less academic. After what the noble Lord opposite said the Bill is evidently defunct. The Government will have little time to discuss measures of this kind in the present year, and therefore we may regard this as more the discussion of a principle than actual progress towards passing a measure. Speaking purely for myself. I would be glad to see the Bill read a second time and amended seriously in Committee, though I do not think the noble Lord would be in favour of reading it a third time after the process of Committee. On the whole, therefore, it is hardly worth while wasting any more time, and in that, I think, I shall carry the majority of the House with me.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I own that I am inclined to support the Second Reading. When the original Bill was first under discussion in your Lordships' House I ventured to propose an Amendment which suggested that no car should be registered capable of going more than thirty miles an hour. That Amendment was not a very popular one, and was eventually withdrawn; but I should like to say now that if my noble friend goes to a Division I shall support him. One thing my noble friend behind me said was that the Government would have no time to consider measures of this kind in the present session. What I would suggest to him is that while we are waiting for more important measures it would be a very excellent thing for your Lordships to occupy the time in discussing provisions of this kind.<lb/>
There are one or two points in connection with this measure on which I should like to say a word. With regard to a speed limit, I quite agree that you cannot lay down any speed that is always safe. I know many roads in my own county where a speed of ten miles an hour would be dangerous, and therefore I should be
<col>792</col>
inclined to leave it to the local authorities to regulate the speed limit over the various roads in the counties. With regard to the question of the sounding of horns, my noble friend said he could not understand why horns were necessary. I will tell him. It is because a horsedrawn vehicle gives notice of its approach by the hoof-beat of the horses. If you are driving a sleigh over snow you have bells. It is absolutely necessary in the interests of pedestrians that the driver of motor cars should blow horns to give warning of their approach.<lb/>
My noble friend asked whether the preparation that is to be put on the roads will be of any value. I do not suppose anybody can tell him that until it has been tried. The whole question of motor driving hangs on the questions of consideration. It is obvious that you cannot drive that quality into people by Act of Parliament; hut consideration does make it far more pleasant for everybody concerned. The instructions I give to my own driver are these. I endeavour to introduce into the "rule of the road " on land what I understand to be the "rule of the road " at sea. It is that the more powerful vessel must give way to the weaker, and therefore the pedestrian, being the weakest vessel of all, has the privilege of the road, and the motor car, being the most powerful, has to give way to all.<lb/>
I have often seen it stated that one of the disadvantages of driving motor cars is that when you go round a blind corner you find drawn up on the wrong side the road some old lady in a governess car. I instruct my driver to drive round every corner with a full expectation of finding that old lady. If she is there we greet her as an old friend; if she is not there we are quite disappointed. I believe that every man has the right to the full use and enjoyment of his senses. With regard to the dust that offends the eye, with regard to the petrol that is offensive to the nose, and with regard to the horn that is offensive to the ear I give full instructions to my driver that they shall be used with the greatest care and reduced to an absolute minimum.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S OF ROCH CASTLE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, in listening to the noble Lord who moved the Second Reading of this Bill I found I was not in agreement with
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0421"/>
<col>793</col>
very much that he said. At the same time, with regard to the groundwork of his Bill I confess to having a great deal of sympathy. It does seem to me that he put the question in the main on the right lines. He did not put his proposal for a speed limit chiefly on the ground of public safety although he touched upon that a little; he put it mainly on the ground of dust. There is an undoubted grievance at the present time in the villages on the main roads with regard to dust. On the ground of its doing something in the matter of dust, and almost on that ground alone, I have sympathy with the Bill. The &#x00A3;600,000 which the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposes to take from motors and devote to main roads will undoubtedly, with local assistance, do much, in from three to five years, to do away with the grievance of villagers. Had the noble Lord taken that as the foundation of his Bill and, as a sort of compromise, put a limit of from three to five years on the provisions so as to extend over the interval before the proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer will have taken effect on the main roads of the country, there would have been a very fair case for giving his Bill a Second Reading.<lb/>
This very real grievance of dust is not a new grievance. For the past seventy years, since railways were built and stage coaches disappeared, the main roads of England have not been used. Everybody who has driven across England knows perfectly well that you may meet a few carriages in the towns and a few bicyclists in the villages, but that over long distances from town to town the roads are not used at all. There are a few pedestrians, a few bicyclists, and a few carts, but, speaking broadly, the main roads of the country are deserted. But that was not the case always.<lb/>
I have got out a few particulars which may be of interest as regards this question of dust. The noble Lord has laid down in this Bill ter miles an hour in villages as a fair speed for all time; he has not got any proposals for a time-limit of three or five years. I will give him a few instances of the times in which coaches did their journeys to London in the old days. There was a coach called the "Wonder," which used to go from Shrewsbury to London at an average of ten miles an hour for the whole distance, and it kept it up
<col>794</col>
from day to day throughout the year. But what does it really work out at. Shrewsbury to London is 158 miles, and they took sixteen hours over it. They spent sixty-five minutes in stops for food, and fifteen minutes in changing horses. That is eighty minutes off the time; and if you work that out you will find the actual running time of this coach, which was a slow coach, was eleven and a half miles an hour all the way from Shrewsbury to London. They were not going only ten miles an hour through the villages. Coaches make dust&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member>: <membercontribution>The answer to that is that the coach only came through the village once a day, and everybody knew the exact hour to expect it. After all, I do not suppose a speed of twelve miles an hour was exceeded.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ST. DAVID'S OF ROCH CASTLE</member>: <membercontribution>I had already gathered that the opponents of motor cars were a little vague in their ideas about these coaches. Somebody had a coach called the "Nimrod," which was to "knock the 'Wonder ' into a cocked hat." The owner of the "Wonder " did not desire to increase the pace of the "Wonder " more than he was obliged to, so he got a coach called the "Stag." The moment the "Nimrod " started, the "Stag " went off and the "Wonder" came behind. They shepherded it all the way to London, so that it should not get any passengers; and they came along at such a pace that often all three arrived as Islington two hours before the scheduled time. In that case the villagers could hardly tell the exact hour when the coach was to pass. But that was not the fastest time.<lb/>
From Birmingham there were two coaches, the "Tally-Ho" and the "Independent Tally-Ho," running in competition. At certain stages they were doing eighteen and three-quarter miles an hour, and only on one stage did they drop as low as twelve miles an hour. When they raced, as they often did, they came all the way from Birmingham to London, including stops, at a rate of fourteen and a quarter miles an hour. The road from Oxford to London was not a road that could be described as "quick," but the coach that journeyed from Oxford to London did it in three hours and forty minutes, or at the rate of fourteen miles
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0422"/>
<col>795</col>
an hour, including stoppages. Birmingham was fairly well up to date. They had four fast coaches running, all in competition with one another. They were the "Tally-Ho," the "Independent Tally-Ho," the "Real Tally-Ho," and the "Patent Tally-Ho." They left Birmingham at ten miles an hour. The moment they were out of sight of the police they started racing, and they did the distance from Birmingham to London, 108 miles, in seven hours, which works out at fifteen miles an hour, after allowing for necessary stoppages.<lb/>
The noble Lord says the coach only passed once a day. Has the noble Lord the slightest notion of the number of coaches running to London on the road between Oxford and London in the coaching days? There were ninety-seven coaches a day! Spreading it over the miles, there was roughly a coach to every half mile. But these coaches were run in competition, and if one started at seven o'clock the competitor across the road started at the same hour, and they were racing head to head all the way down the road; and great fun it must have been at the bridges for the old ladies inside. The Oxford road was not an exceptional case. The great road was the Holyhead road. Between London and Barnet there were 194 coaches running a day. There must have been a coach nearly every 100 yards.<lb/>
But the coaches were not the whole of the business. It was the middle-classes who rode in coaches. Noblemen did not use them; it was below their dignity. The great man went in his own chariot, with relays of his own horses, and people not quite so rich went in post-chaises. Poor people who could not afford these went in stage wagons, which, after all, carried the great bulk of the traffic. Just fancy what the state of the road was! Picture the road from London to Barnet with these coaches, private chariots and stage wagons! It was a perfect pandemonium of danger and dust. The road most used by the motor-car to-day is a quiet, secluded, and safe spot compared with the average coaching road in the olden days. I am perfectly willing to vote for any legislation that will lessen the dust in the country villages, which I am sure we all deplore. I am glad to think that the present Budget does present a chance of doing something. I am willing
<col>796</col>
to vote with the noble Lord, until some other remedy is offered, for a speed limit of ten miles an hour in villages. But do not let it be supposed that there never has been dust on the roads of England before.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE EARL OF LOVELACE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, there is one small matter I desire to mention. It is not exactly germane to this subject, but has arisen in the course of the discussion. The noble Earl who moved the rejection of this Bill dwelt in rather severe terms on the county of Surrey, to which I have the honour to belong. He dwelt in severe terms on the police and also on the magistrates of the county, and the impression left on my mind was that in their judgment on, and dealings with, these cases they had been, in the opinion; of the noble Earl, not strictly fair.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL RUSSELL</member>: <membercontribution>The only thing I did was to refer to a case before the Godalming Bench, and to say that I did not think the Surrey magistrates might be thought to be favourably disposed towards motorists.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE EARL OF LOVELACE</member>: <membercontribution>I am a member of a bench of which the noble Earl would probably have severe things to say&#x2014;namely, the Guildford Bench. I wish to point out that Surrey is in an exceptional position. It is one of the home counties; therefore it is beset by motorists, and I do not think you can look upon Surrey in the same light as you could a distant county.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ATKINSON</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, it is only fair to the noble Lord who introduced the Bill that I should indicate some of the objections to its minor provisions which it would be incumbent to raise in Committee if the Bill were given a Second Reading. The clause to which I particularly refer is Clause 7, which says&#x2014;
<quote>"If an offence under this Act is committed by any person who is the servant or subject to the control of another person who is in the vehicle when such offence is committed that other person also shall be guilty of an offence under this Act."</quote>
The noble Lord who introduced the Bill was under an entire misconception as to what is recommended in the Report of the Royal Commission. The Commission never recommended any such provision as this. There is not, so far as I know, any such provision in the whole criminal law.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0423"/>
<col>797</col>
What the Report of the Commission did recommend was a very different thing. It was simply this, that where an owner either orders or commands or abets his servant in breaking the law, he is, of course, responsible, because the breach of the law is his act done through the hand of another. In such case, as in every other case, a man who procures another man to commit a crime is as responsible as the person who commits it. The master is always civilly responsible for the act of a servant done within the scope of the master's knowledge, but the idea that one man should be criminally responsible and liable to be sent to gaol for the act of another, which he may not even have observed, is absurd. That, too, not merely in reference to acts against public order but in reference to exceeding the speed limit. Take this case. A lady owns a motor car and employs a driver to take her to the theatre or to a friend's house, and has told him to be particularly careful. If he should drive round a corner to the public danger, not only is he convicted but the lady, under this clause, is criminally guilty and can be convicted. There is nothing in the public law, save possibly in some statutes dealing with the Customs, approaching in any way to this. A man can only be made responsible for acts committed by himself, either directly or through the instrumentality of others. I do not know if the noble Lord said he had introduced this Bill in a spirit of compromise, but if this is what is done in a spirit of compromise, I am very glad indeed that no Bill is introduced in a spirit of downright animus, because then one might almost expect capital punishment to be inflicted.<lb/>
Every motorist knows that there is a great grievance with regard to motor traffic; that grievance is dust. Danger to the public is a thing rapidly decreasing. I believe that as men drive better, as cars are better constructed, as people are learning to be more considerate, that grievance will decrease. The grievance of dust can only be remedied in one way, and that is by providing funds out of the Imperial Exchequer to bring about a better construction of the roads; and as far as I am concerned as a motorist, I will heartily and gladly pay any reasonable increased tax that may be imposed for the purpose of carrying out that improvement. I do not think any motorist really objects to that. I will tell you what they may object to. It is that having paid the penalty and the road authorities having
<col>798</col>
obtained it, the roads should not be properly constructed for motor cars, that the dust should be allowed to lie upon them, and that these authorities should make complaints against the men whose money they have. To that motorists would object, but not to increased duties upon motor-cars, for the purpose of having money to devote to the improvements of roads. So far as driving to the public danger is concerned no person is a stronger advocate than I am for people who thus offend being punished, whether the speed be three miles an hour or thirty miles an hour. If they drive to the public danger they should be punished. That is an elastic restriction, and I cannot help regretting that ever a speed limit was put in, because the elastic restriction would have dealt with all the evils.<lb/>

I had something to do with the passing of the Act of 1903, and I am perfectly aware that the speed limit was put into that Act in order to protect the public. Speed was not illegal in itself; speed was not to be punished because it was speed, but because a high speed was supposed to be injurious to the public. I regret that the Act, I am afraid in too many cases, has been administered as if the great object of the law was not to protect the public, but to entrap the motorists. I do not make that statement upon my own experience, or upon my own knowledge. It is dealt with at full length in the Report of the Royal Commission; because of all the extraordinary reasons ever given for the unjust administration of the criminal law it is the reason given in the eighth or ninth page of that Report. It is embodied in the explanation as to why the police do not prosecute for driving to the public danger. The explanation given is this. The only persons to carry out prosecutions are the police. If the police prosecute for driving to the public danger, the magistrate might be in this dilemma. He might have on one side the motorist who said "I did not drive to the public danger," and on the other side the constable who said "You did drive to the public danger," and the magistrate might have to make up his mind between them. That is a perfectly paralysing circumstance. The explanation goes on to say that it is much easier for the constable to convince a magistrate that the speed limit has been exceeded, and consequently he leaves dangerous villages and goes out to where there is an inviting piece of road so free from any public danger that the motorist will be entrapped into going at
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0424"/>
<col>799</col>
a high speed. The constable goes there with a stop watch and discovers that the motorist is driving at forty or fifty miles an hour, but without any public danger. But law and justice are vindicated, the magistrate is relieved from all difficulty, the policeman is patronised and lauded, and the public, who were never in danger at all, are protected. That is a summary of the statement in the Report of the Commission as to the way in which this Act is administered. In corroboration I may mention that a month ago I went on three successive days through Colnbrook village. Three roads meet at the centre, and it is, I think, most dangerous There was not a policeman or scout or anybody to give persons warning as they came to the centre of the village. But when you were out on the road at the other end, between Hounslow on one side and Slough upon the other, when you could have gone forty miles an hour without any danger to any individual, the police traps were all ready and prepared. It is lost sight of in the administration of the Act that the object of putting a speed limit was to protect the public, and not merely to punish, as a criminal offence, going at any particular speed where the public are not in danger.<lb/>
As far as I am myself concerned, I should like to see the noble Lord's Bill read a second time, mainly because I disagree with the greater portion of it, and because I should hope to put down Amendments on which I should be able to establish to my mind almost resistless reasons for striking out most of the provisions; and the more there were struck out the better, in my judgment, would the Bill be. The only part, which I think might be retained and which could be improved is that which fixes the limits for the speeds in the three different classes of places indicated. The objection that occurs to me is that the regulation is too rigid. It cannot be supposed that in the fixing of those limits the particular differences of the various localities would be as well kept into account as if the limiting authority were the local authority, although I know that the Bill makes provision for the local authority being taken into consultation with the Local Government Board. The noble Lord altogether omitted to mention that the Royal Commission, whilst desiring to strengthen clauses dealing with driving to the public danger in the way my noble friend suggests, also recommend that the speed limit should be abolished, as it has been in three or four continental countries.
<col>800</col>
I know there is a prejudice against motor cars. Many people have an almost insuperable objection to them. I think possibly that is dying out. I see that in America a gentleman has brought in a Bill which provides that when any motor car meets a timid horse on the road the driver shall descend and cover his motor car with a tarpauling. I assure my noble friend that, whatever Amendment to his Bill I should propose, I should not propose an Amendment to that effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise for the purpose of saying a word as to the course which might be taken with regard to the Bill. But before I do that I hope I may be allowed to congratulate the noble Lord, not only upon having made a very excellent statement to the House, but also upon having initiated one of the most interesting and instructive debates to which we have listened for a long time past. There was one speech which I confess rather disappointed me. It was the speech of Lord Montagu of Beaulieu. I think your Lordships will recollect that not many weeks ago he gave us a most admirable address on the subject of a&#x00EB;roplanes, and he then made a confident prediction that before five years were over your Lordships would have the pleasure of seeing him arrive at this House on one of those admirable machines, and when my noble friend rose 1 fully expected that he was going to tell us that this motor question was really only a passing difficulty and would be surmounted by the adoption of a very different mode of progression.<lb/>
The speech of Lord Willoughby de Broke seemed to me particularly commendable for this, that it showed his great consciousness of what I feel your Lordships ought not to forget&#x2014;namely, that there is a very serious question arising out of the regulation of motor traffic. The introduction of motors has really revolutionised the conditions of country life in many parts of these islands, and I confess that I really marvel at the patience and good humour with which the village population have accepted this new, and to many of them, I am afraid, intolerable, incident in their daily lives. I feel very strongly that Parliament owes it to them to do everything in its power to mitigate the suffering and inconvenience which the introduction of motor traffic has produced.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0425"/>
<col>801</col>
I listened, as did the whole House, with much appreciation to the speech delivered by Lord St. David's, whose wonderful researches into the history of stage-coach driving in this country seemed to me to be most creditable to his industry. He told us that in the old coaching days there was on many of the roads leading to London what he described as a pandemonium of dust and danger, fully equal to anything of the kind that we now encounter. But I am not convinced even by the statistics of the noble Lord, and I cannot help believing that some of the roads in and out of London upon certain days of the week do present a condition of dust and of danger and of discomfort, to all persons using those roads, for a counterpart of which you might search in vain during the times when those roads were travelled by coaches instead of by motors. I have been told since I came into the House that it is not only private owners of motors who are answerable for these occurrences. I am told that the Secretary of State for War has lately boasted that on the occasion when a considerable number of troops were transported from the Crystal Palace to Hastings, the whole distance was traversed at a uniform rate of twenty miles an hour. As the road in question passes through a great many villages I think that 300 or 400 cars must have come as rather a distinct surprise to the local population.<lb/>
I feel very strongly that this question is one which really must be dealt with by the Government of the day and on their responsibility. The Government of the day has, as has been pointed out this evening, already made a beginning, and I join with other noble Lords who have spoken in hoping that the measures announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer will have the effect of affording a considerable relief in those cases where roads used by motorists pass through villages or over cross-roads and other dangerous thoroughfares. I cannot, moreover, help thinking that in some of the proposals embodied in his Bill my noble friend is not going exactly on the right track. I think it is true, as the noble Earl who moved the Amendment pointed out, that we have to deal, not with the question of speed alone, but with speed in reference to surrounding circumstances, and I am rather alarmed at the classification of maximum limits contained in the Bill. As I understand the Bill, it accepts a time limit of thirty miles an hour in the
<col>802</col>
open country. I say, unhesitatingly, that there are many parts of the open country&#x2014;that is, country not immediately close to a town&#x2014;where thirty miles might be an excessive limit. The twenty miles permitted in or near towns seems to me also to be a very considerable pace, and in spite of the precedent of the stage coaches, there may be many villages in which a pace of ten miles is excessive, if the place is crowded and there are many people in and about the road. I am afraid that these hard-and-fast classifications will break down in practice, and, personally, I should be much more inclined to depend upon the general question of danger to the public than upon any precise limits of pace.<lb/>
Then, with regard to horns, I feel pretty sure that my noble friend is mistaken in trying to get rid of horns. It is quite true that the sound of these unmusical instruments is very distressing to our ears, but if you were no longer to use them would not the result be that you would find on your high road a procession headed by the covered van which does not hear or pretends not to hear or to know what is happening behind it, or perhaps headed by that old lady in the governess car whom Lord Dartmouth spoke of with so much affection, and followed by a string of motor cars unable to make any progress with their journey? That would be a condition of things very detrimental to the convenience, not only of the owners of motor-cars, but to the travelling public generally.<lb/>
I gather that it is the intention of the Government not immediately, but at some future time, to deal with this question themselves. I therefore ask myself whether the House would really gain anything by reading this Bill a second time. I am afraid that if the Bill went to Committee it would encounter a great deal of adverse criticism, and, upon the whole, if my noble friend who moved the Second Reading asks me for my advice, I would venture to suggest to him that he should be content with the useful and certainly sympathetic discussion which has taken place, and that he should not ask the House to undertake the task of going through this Bill clause by clause in Committee, with the result which I am afraid would be inevitable, that we should produce a Bill which would not be my noble friend's Bill at all, and which, when
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0426"/>
<col>803</col>
we had produced it, would have very little chance of becoming law.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I find myself in the position of being in some sympathy both with the noble Lord who introduced the Bill and with the noble Earl who moved the Amendment, without being able to agree entirely with either. The noble Lord who introduced this Bill in a speech which led me to regret that he does not oftener take part in he deliberations of the House seemed to me to proceed on lines which, in themselves, are deserving of sympathy. I think his object was to translate into the form of a Bill the practices which a reasonable and considerate motorist might be expected to pursue in travelling on the roads of this country; that is to say, he endeavours, by splitting up the country into zones in which certain speeds may be permissible, to, roughly speaking, enable the motorist to proceed at a pace which the reasonable motorist might take when driving. The question is, Is it possible by a system of zones of this kind to achieve that result? I confess I very much doubt whether it is. As the noble Marquess said, these authorised speeds are very likely to be quite unreasonable speeds in a great many zones in which by the Bill they are allowed, and therefore the scheme to be drawn up in pursuance of the Bill must, if it is to be a real guide to safety in speed, include a vast number of changes within those zones. It may be perfectly safe to go for a few hundred yards at thirty miles an hour, whilst the next few hundred yards a careful driver would not go over at, perhaps, more than fifteen. Therefore, these arbitrary limits will, I am afraid, be found of very little more use in practice than the present general limit of twenty miles&#x2014;though I quite agree that that is by no means always observed&#x2014;and the occasional limitation to ten.<lb/>
The noble Earl who moved the Amendment also, I think, proceeds on lines which in the abstract are common sense lines. What really has to be considered is not the speed at which the car travels so much as the danger which is caused to human beings, to animals, or to property by the pace at which it moves. But as the
<col>804</col>
noble Earl made it clear in the course of his speech that he would like to see the speed limit altogether abolished, I am bound to say that in my opinion that course is an altogether impossible one to take. I do not believe that the country would stand for one moment the complete abolition of the speed limit, for two reasons. One is the existence of cars which go at racing speed. So long as there are cars which go at sixty or eighty miles an hour, I am quite certain that these cars ought not to be allowed on the road at all. But if you abolish the speed limit it would be very hard to warn a particular class of car off the road.<lb/>
The relation of speed to dust is undoubtedly clearly understood&#x2014;namely, that the higher speeds, speaking generally, produce a great deal more offensive dust than the lower speeds. As has been mentioned more than once in the course of the debate, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has devised a plan, which I am glad to say meets with a general meed of public approval, for doing something to improve the roads of the country, and that fact seems to me a sound reason for allowing legislation of this kind to stand over for a time until we see what results are produced by that plan. I do not think it is possible, in the present state of public opinion, to deal with the speed question until the question of the surface of the road has been decided one way or the other. I should not altogether dismiss the possibility that when a large sum of money has been laid out on roads the question of increasing the speed in certain places up to thirty miles an hour might be favourably considered. But it is not a proposal which I, for one, should think of putting forward at this time, and I hope the House will agree that it is not unreasonable to postpone a consideration of a Bill of this kind until the road question has received, as I hope it will receive, a solution from the action of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.<lb/>
I will not dwell on the minor points raised by the Bill. I am afraid the noble Lord has found no supporter for abolishing the use of the horn. By common agreement the use of motors would be made almost impossible, without serious danger to pedestrians, if the horns were abolished. I think the noble Lord has forgotten this, that it is the law of the land that slow
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0427"/>
<col>805</col>
traffic must make way for fast traffic. Under the Highways Acts any vehicle has to draw to the left to allow another vehicle to pass, and it does seem very reasonable that there should be some means for a comparatively silent vehicle of drawing attention to the fact that it wishes to pass. At the same time I entirely agree that the use of the horn is sometimes sadly abused. It is used in a manner that conveys something in the nature of a vocal threat, particularly to the unhappy pedestrian, and I should be very glad if its improper use could be made an offence, although, of course, it could not be treated as a very serious offence. As to the question of vicarious punishment imposed by the Bill, I will only say that, if the noble Lord had quite the logic of his opinion on this subject, when a driver is convicted of manslaughter and sent to penal servitude the owner ought to accompany his wretched servant to Dartmoor for the whole period.<lb/>
I think we may congratulate ourselves on the fact that this question, although I admit still acute, is not so burning a question as it was a year or two ago. I believe that the users of motors as a class are becoming more considerate, and I hope that the very strong feeling against the use of motor cars at all in some parts of the country has tended to die out. The Secretary for Scotland tells me that there the administration of the present law has been carried out, as he believes, to the satisfaction of the public. There have been few cases of complete prohibition of motor traffic on certain roads, and I often wonder whether that principle could not be introduced to a greater extent than it is in England. I have often thought that if certain lanes, for instance, were barred altogether to motor cars, those who wish to take country walks and so on would feel in a more secure and safe position than they do at present. But, as a matter of fact, I think that has been very little done, if at all, in England. Then my noble friend tells me that the restrictions of the speed of motors in Scotland have met with general acceptance in districts in which they have been introduced.<lb/>
The noble Lord who is responsible for this measure seemed to think it desirable that the matter should be to some extent taken out of the hands of the county coun-
<col>806</col>
cils. We have got into trouble lately from noble Lords opposite for suggesting that there are matters in which central authorities may have to put pressure upon county councils and local authorities. We are told we are interfering with the great principles that ought to regulate local government in this country. And I am bound to say in this case that it is a matter which may very fairly be left to the discretion of the local authorities, unless, of course, it can be shown that in particular cases or number of eases they have failed to carry out their duty in this respect. I conclude by saying that I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that there would be no real advantage in reading this Bill a second time. We have had a most informing discussion, and I do not think that by going into Committee and discussing a number of Amendments we should add very greatly to our knowledge of the subject. I therefore hope the noble Lord will be content with the degree of discussion his Bill has raised, and that both the Bill and the Amendment may be withdrawn.<lb/>

<title>THE VATERSAY CORRESPONDENCE.</title>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to ask, with reference to the correspondence about the Island of Vatersay recently circulated, why Sir Reginald MacLeod's letter of June 25, 1908, which commenced the correspondence, and why Lady Cathcart's letter of July 4, which stipulated that if their semi-private letters were treated as official, Sir Reginald's letter of June 25 should be included, have been omitted. The Vatersay Correspondence which I moved for in your Lordships' House has recently been laid on the Table. That correspondence began with a letter from the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland to Lady Cathcart, and I must say I was rather surprised to find that that letter did not appear in the correspondence. Perhaps I had better read it. It is as follows:&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0428"/>
<col>807</col>
<quote>"Dover House, Whitehall,<lb/> Thursday, June 25, 1908.</quote>
<quote>MY DEAR LADY CATHCART,</quote>
<quote>A seven hours' debate has just concluded on Vatersay. Mr. Sinclair definitely invited negotiations on the basis of arranging compensation, and I think from private conversations as well the Government are prepared to meet you some distance with a view to getting the settlement of Vatersay arranged on fair terms, with release, on your motion, of the prisoners. Could I see you? I would come down early Saturday. The matter is urgent. Please send me a wire to Dover House,<lb/> Yours very sincerely,</quote>
<quote>REGINALD MACLEOD."</quote><lb/>
I do not understand why that letter was omitted. It gives the reason of the noble Lord for commencing this correspondence, and it seems to me rather surprising that, in the circumstances, the correspondence should profess to begin with a letter from Lady Cathcart. While I say this letter ought to have been given in the ordinary way, there is a much stronger reason why it should have been given, because there was an implied arrangement with Lady Cathcart that her letter of the 30th should not be published without it. I must again trouble your Lordships. This is from a letter from Sir Reginald MacLeod to Lady Cathcart, dated July 4&#x2014;
<quote>"I at once placed your letter of the 30th ultimo, in Mr. Sinclair's hands and he has given it his most careful consideration. He appreciates the desirability of bringing this matter to a conclusion on all grounds, especially in view of the fact that ten of the cottars are now serving a sentence of imprisonment, and that the court might, on such a conclusion being reached, be willing, at your instance, to order their release."</quote>
The letter concludes in this way&#x2014;
<quote>"I trust with your permission, to treat your letter of June 30 and this reply, though unofficial in form, as forming part of the correspondence available for official reference."</quote>
To that Lady Cathcart replied on July 7&#x2014;
<quote>"I see you say that you propose to treat my letter of June 30 and yours of July 4, though unofficial in form, as forming part of the correspondence available for official reference, and I presume you intend your note of June 25 also to be included."</quote>
There was no further reference made to that, and therefore the understanding, of course, was that if this letter of June 30 of Lady Cathcart was published the other letters would be published too. Neither of the two last letters that I have read to your Lordships appears in the correspondence. Therefore I merely say that it seems to me the noble Lord had no right, under the
<col>808</col>
circumstances, to publish Lady Cathcart's letter of 30 June without publishing his own letter of the 25th, which was stipulated should be published also. Why should that letter have been omitted? The noble Lord has taken this short correspondence between the Under-Secretary and Lady Cathcart; he has made a selection and has selected Lady Cathcart's letter as a letter to be published, leaving out his own. I am not going to comment on that first letter now. I may have another opportunity. But what I would say is that the effect of the selection which the noble Lord has made has been to put his own part in this transaction as far backward as possible from the view of the public. I think we ought to have some explanation as to why he omitted to publish that letter.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am very glad to have the opportunity afforded me by the noble Lord for offering him such explanation as I am able to give. The noble Lord has the advantage of me in that he has in his hands a copy of the correspondence with which I have not been favoured, but which, I understand, has been printed for private information. It contains letters which are not contained in this printed correspondence. First of all, let me give the best of all reasons why I could not publish the first letter. It was written by Sir Reginald MacLeod to Lady Cathcart. I have not got it. I made every search in the Scottish Office for the letter. It could not be found. It was a private note, as the contents which the noble Lord has just read show. It was a mere note asking Lady Cathcart to see Sir Reginald MacLeod.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: <membercontribution>No, I cannot admit that.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH</member>: <membercontribution>I cannot for my own part conceive how any sinister motive could possibly be imagined for withholding the letter from the correspondence. Further than that, if the noble Lord will be good enough to look at the explanatory note to the correspondence he will see on the first page, in the second paragraph, a reference to this very note, which I think should assure him that I had no possible desire or reason or purpose in concealing or omitting the publication
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0429"/>
<col>809</col>
of this note from the correspondence. Then I come to the second letter mentioned by the noble Earl&#x2014;the letter from Lady Cathcart of July 4.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: <membercontribution>July 7.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH</member>: <membercontribution>I quite accept the correction, but I have not got that letter. Therefore it was not in my power to publish either of the two letters which the noble Earl mentioned. That is the only explanation I can give. I have searched for these letters. In regard to the letter from Sir Reginald MacLeod to Lady Cathcart, dated July 4, the noble Earl has omitted the really practical part of the letter, which was to arrange an interview between the Solicitor-General for Scotland, who was then going to Edinburgh, and Lady Cathcart's agent in Edinburgh. That was the real purport of that letter, and I am very glad to think that the noble Earl has read it to the House, because I am sure the House will agree there is no sinister purport in that letter either. There is one other point which the noble Earl has mentioned&#x2014;that there was an understanding expressed by Sir Reginald in the letter which he has read that two letters should be regarded as semi-official and added to the correspondence. Those are the two letters I never had in my possession. I shall be very glad, if Lady Cathcart conceives her interests injured in any way by the non-publication of these letters to which reference is made, to consider whether there is any objection whatever to their publication.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: <membercontribution>It appears to me that the confusion of the Scottish Office at the present time is even greater than I had supposed. Sir Reginald's letter is an official letter, because he himself says he wished it to be made official. Then there is another letter in which Lady Cathcart tells him that if he publishes her letter of the 30th, he is to publish his own letter of the 25th of June. That letter, again, is lost. I do not understand what the archives of the Scottish Office are like. My object is attained. When we discuss this&#x2014;and I certainly shall raise it on some future occasion&#x2014;I shall deal with those letters. But in the meantime I can only express my great surprise. Did the noble Lord, when he found this letter was not in the office, apply to Sir Reginald to ascertain where it was?</membercontribution></p>
<col>810</col>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH</member>: <membercontribution>I can only repeat what I have already said. These letters were not official letters.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: <membercontribution>They were made official letters.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND OF LYTH</member>: <membercontribution>The note to which the noble Earl referred was written by Sir Reginald MacLeod in my room in the House of Commons on a sheet of notepaper as a private note to Lady Cathcart, after the debate, asking if he could see her in my behalf. In considering what papers should be published so as to present to the public a full case I referred to this letter. Having no copy of it, and knowing that it could add nothing to the information which was freely given to Parliament in the published correspondence, I took no further steps in the matter. If the noble Earl wishes to make any attack on the Office over which I have the honour to preside I shall be very glad to answer him on the proper occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD SALTOUN</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, it seems to me that it would have been perfectly easy for the Secretary for Scotland to have obtained a copy of these particular letters by applying for them to Lady Cathcart. Another thing is that Lady Cathcart's letter expressly desired that her letters should be published with the correspondence. That was the condition of publishing the whole correspondence, and it made it still more incumbent upon the noble Lord to have taken some trouble to have found these letters.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[SECOND READING.]</title>
<p>Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p>*<member>THE LORD BISHOP OF HEREFORD </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the Bill of which I desire to move the Second Reading to-day is virtually the same Bill which I introduced in your Lordships' House seven years ago. It is a very simple Bill, and, I venture to think, long overdue. It proposes to prohibit three highly objectionable forms of sport&#x2014;the hunting, coursing, and shooting of animals which have been kept in confinement&#x2014;which more and more every year are felt to be an offence to the public conscience. I am sorry to observe that a noble Lord opposite&#x2014;Lord Newton&#x2014;proposes to move the rejection of the measure. I sincerely hope he may be able to tell us that he will not persevere in that intention. Knowing as I do the sincerity of the noble Lord, I am a little surprised that he should set himself against this much-needed Bill, the more so because, so far as I remember from what he said on the previous occasion, his views are in no sense on the side of those sports. Therefore I wonder the more that he proposes, while he does not approve of the sports, deliberately to assume responsibility for perpetuating them.
<col>814</col>
I ask myself why it is that the noble Lord takes this paradoxical attitude. He told us on the previous occasion that he did not himself approve of any one of these three practices, but that he had some conscientious difficulty. He had the feeling, which is, perhaps, a very generous and natural feeling, that it is not more cruel to shoot a pigeon let out of a trap than it is to shoot pheasants and partridges. Again he said, I think, that there was no more cruelty in hunting a carted stag than in hunting a wild Exmoor stag. It might be said, on the same lines, that there is no more cruelty in the tearing to pieces of a poor rabbit just taken out of a crate than in hunting down a wild rabbit. I think the noble Lord has overlooked the shock which these things give to the public conscience. The public, whether rightly or wrongly, do see a difference between shooting a pigeon which is let loose from a trap and shooting a wild bird living its natural life; between the hunting of a semi-domesticated, and, perhaps, petted deer which is brought to a starting point in a cart, and hunting the deer on its native haunts; and they also regard rabbit coursing as a degrading amusement. I therefore still entertain the hope that the noble Lord may see his way to let this Bill be accepted so far as he is concerned in this House. I recognise his difficulty; but all his arguments tend, not to the rejection of the Bill, but to the strengthening of it. If the noble Lord believes that there is objectionable cruelty in the shooting of pheasants, for instance, then I say the natural tendency of his argument should lead him to add a strengthening Amendment to my Bill. It is really a plea for extending the operations of this simple Bill. I do not wish to extend its operations at this moment for various reasons.<lb/>
If the Bill is passed in its present form it will satisfy the conscience of the community generally, and will not interfere with any single one of our manly and legitimate sports. I fail to understand, therefore, why the noble Lord and those who agree with him should have this difficulty. It is due, no doubt, to a certain tenderness of conscience. They feel that there would be a certain suspicion of inconsistency if they supported this Bill and yet continued to pursue their own sports. I venture to think that any member of this House may vote for this Bill and pursue all his ordinary manly sports with regard
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0432"/>
<col>815</col>
to wild animals with a very clear conscience. In all seriousness, I do hope your Lordships will give a favourable consideration to this Bill, for, although it is a small and modest measure, it is one which, if passed into law, would be a worthy addition to the series of beneficent Statutes which have done great credit to both Houses of Parliament. The purpose of the Bill is clearly described in the Memorandum which I have prefixed to it. It aims at the abolition of certain spurious kinds of sport, and thus at the protection of those animals which, though nominally wild, are in fact kept in confinement and released for the immediate purpose of being hunted, coursed, or shot.<lb/>
This Bill, as I have said, is only one of a series of Acts which from time to time have been demanded by the public conscience. The present Bill is, in fact, only an extension of the Wild Animals in Captivity Protection Act, 1900, which the noble and learned Lord, Lord James of Hereford, was successful in passing through your Lordships' House without opposition. I hope I may have the influential support of the noble and learned Lord on this occasion, with an equally satisfactory result. But that Act has proved to a great extent a dead letter, mainly, indeed, because of the want of the extension which is proposed in this Bill. The Cruelty to Animals Acts, 1849 and 1854, excepting one section which relates to fighting and baiting, apply exclusively to domestic animals; and the Act for the protection of Wild Animals in Captivity, 1900, does not apply to the hunting or coursing of any animal unless it has been liberated in a mutilated or injured state, in order to facilitate its capture or destruction, so that at present the animals which this Bill is intended to protect enjoy no legal protection whatever from any kind of cruelty in sport.<lb/>
I think I shall be able to show that two of these sports, at any rate, are liable to exhibitions of cruelty which shock the public conscience. In my view cock-fighting, which our forefathers abolished sixty years ago, was a manly sport compared with rabbit coursing. On the previous occasion I had in my hand a memorial in favour of the Bill&#x2014;I think it would still be supported by every one who signed it&#x2014;from 467 persons engaged in education at Oxford and Cambridge and in our great schools. Those who signed
<col>816</col>
this memorial comprised seventeen heads of colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, fifty-three professors there, 136 college tutors and lecturers in those two Universities, and 261 headmasters of public and grammar schools. Then I have the testimony of the very influential memorial which was addressed not so long ago to the late Prime Minister. That memorial was signed by sixty-five members of the other House, and by thirty-six distinguished persons who are not in the other House. At the head of that list I find the name of Field-Marshal Viscount Wolseley, and I might mention many others well known to your Lordships. I have in my hand another memorial exactly similar, which was quite lately addressed to the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack; and I hope we may hear the Lord Chancellor's view on the question this afternoon.<lb/>
Then, again, I have other testimony which I think ought to be brought before your Lordships. Almost all the best of our newspapers when they allude to these sports do so with deprecation. The <i>Field</i>, the country gentleman's newspaper, has not a word to say on behalf of them. I have here a letter from a highly respected incumbent in Sussex bringing to my notice what happened near his own house the other day. He says that a stag with its horns cut off and with one foot hanging owing to the near foreleg having been broken, probably by wire, was worried past his gate and down the lane beyond by the Surrey stag hounds. The poor brute endeavoured to stand at bay in a garden, and then hobbled on its three legs down the lane to a stable-yard, where it was despatched by the huntsmen. My correspondent adds&#x2014;
<quote>"A more revolting case of cruelty could hardly he conceived; and, needless to say, it created no small resentment among respectable people all round who saw it."</quote>
Another case of which I have particulars occurred the other day in Somersetshire, and is reported in the <i>Cheddar Times</i> under the heading "Savagery at Cheddar." It appears that a deer was imported on March 29 from the district of Surbiton. The animal, a tame semi-domesticated creature, was let loose upon the beautiful Cheddar downs on March 30 to be hunted. The deer had no chance to run far. Timid, strange, and frightened it had proceeded but a short distance when the hounds
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0433"/>
<col>817</col>
caught it and bore it to the ground. This however&#x2014;continues the newspaper account&#x2014;was not the intention of the huntsmen, who called the dogs off. The deer, bleeding heavily from a torn flank, then sped away and doubled back, and finally ran into the river where the dogs soon surrounded it. The animal was, however, rescued from its terrible position, and being in a state of collapse was given whisky to revive it. Its wounds were sewn up and it was removed, to be patched up apparently for use on some other occasion. This account, as was not at all surprising, was followed by a series of letters to the newspaper from persons remonstrating against such an exhibition of degrading cruelty being possible in this country. It has been said that this account is not a true one, but I have in my hand a letter from the editor of the newspaper in which he says that in every respect it is substantially true, and that he is prepared to stand against any proceedings that may be taken with regard to it.<lb/>
I return for a moment to the sport of rabbit-coursing, which, I am bound to say, is far and away the most degrading of all. This sport is a favourite one, I am told, in certain districts; it used to be so on the commons around London, especially on Sunday mornings, but, owing to the vigilance of the police and their being able to bring it in as a public nuisance, I am told that it has lessened in the neighbourhood of the metropolis. But that is not the case in some other districts. On the Tyne it is, I am told, very popular. In South Wales it retains its popularity, and nothing, I venture to think, would be more revolting to your Lordships than some of the scenes in these rabbit-coursing competitions. I have here a letter from a retired colonel in the north of England who is a Justice of the Peace. He says that these rabbit-coursing competitions are generally got up by some low-class publicans and betting men, and are of a cruel and degrading character. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"The training of young dogs for this sport is even more cruel and revolting than the sport itself. &#x2026; The rabbits are conveyed to the place of meeting very often in large crates; they remain crowded together in the crates for some hours possibly, and are taken out by the neck, dangled in front of the dogs, and then thrown out to be captured."</quote>
I noticed in the <i>Newcastle Chronicle</i> the other Saturday no fewer than seven
<col>818</col>
advertisements of different meetings of this kind for the purpose of rabbit-coursing immediately around Newcastle. The prizes offered varied from &#x00A3;5 to &#x00A3;30, and at the end of some of the advertisements were the words, "plenty of rabbits." I venture to think it is high time that this kind of exhibition should cease in a civilised country like ours.<lb/>
Then, with regard to South Wales, I have exactly the same kind of testimony. A man in a high position in one of the Welsh Universities states that he is afraid that this degrading sport is even on the increase among the miners of South Wales. I think we shall all agree that it does not imply special cruelty in those who follow these practices. The real fact is that they do not think. Their thoughts are concentrated on the sport and they forget the suffering. It is surely our duty as legislators to see that these cruelties no longer remain as a shock to the humane feelings of the more enlightened part of the population. I venture to think that if there is any place in which it is appropriate that such a Motion as this should be moved and adopted it is your Lordships' House, which is noted as an assembly of fine sportsmen; and in as much as that is the character of this House it is specially incumbent upon such a body of men to see that sport is not degraded. Legitimate and manly sport is one of the preservatives of the finest elements of English life, and we should be specially careful to keep it from the stains that such practices as these cast upon it. <i>Corruptio optimi pessima</i>. Your Lordships are in a particularly favourable position for initiating a beneficent motion of this kind, for you are independent, have time to consider it, and wide experience on the subject. By approving the Second Reading of this Bill you will purify English sport, remove a discreditable stain, strengthen the hands of the police in all parts of the country, and satisfy enlightened public conscience. I beg to move.<lb/>
Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>The Lord Bishop of Hereford</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD NEWTON</member> <membercontribution>rose to move the rejection of the Bill. The noble Lord said: My Lords, in response to the appeal made to me by the right reverend Prelate, whose honesty and consistency in this matter I do not doubt for a single instant, I should like to say that I have carefully
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0434"/>
<col>819</col>
examined my own conscience on the subject of this Bill, and it is because I am conscientiously unable to support it that I find myself compelled to take the step of moving its rejection. This Bill is an old friend which, after appearing under many <i>aliases</i>, is, in fact, really nothing but the Spurious Sports Bill over again. It is, as the right reverend Prelate has informed us, the same Bill which was introduced here by him seven years ago and which this House rejected, the right reverend Prelate apparently being not able to secure a co-teller with himself even though he represented that many of the unfortunate rabbits whose sufferings he described came from his own diocese.<lb/>
I am informed that this Bill is drawn in so faulty a manner and that so much mystery and doubt attaches to those well-known terms "place" and "enclosed place" that it would be almost impossible to carry it into effect. But I do not wish to enter into these legal technicalities. I desire to oppose the Bill upon its merits, and will leave the task of dissecting its legal weaknesses to some subsequent speaker. Although, no doubt, the Memorandum attached to the Bill is not absolutely accurate, it at all events blurts out the actual purpose of the Bill&#x2014;namely, that this is a Bill not to prevent cruelty to animals, but to brand what are called spurious sports and to draw a line between what is genuine and what is spurious&#x2014;a thing which, for my own part, I am not in the least inclined to do. And behind what I can only term this general attack on sport it is not difficult to see in the background the Humanitarian League and those persons who look upon zoological collections as immoral institutions and who raise shrieks of agony at the spectacle of Eton boys actually running with live beagles after a live hare.<lb/>
The right reverend Prelate, if. I did not misunderstand him, appealed to me, as a so-called sportsman, to support him in his endeavours. I do not lay any claim to be a sportsman, although I suppose I have the same vicious inclinations as most of the noble Lords whom I see sitting around me. I am not at all sure that I know what a sportsman is. A man who shoots big game is a sportsman; a man who rides a steeplechase is undoubtedly a sportsman; so apparently is a man who passes day after day watching what is
<col>820</col>
known as first-class cricket&#x2014;an occupation which, to my mind, is even less exhilarating than that of sitting on a Private Bill Committee and productive of even less excitement. A man is described as a munificent sportsman who, perhaps, invests several thousands on buying a two-year-old, and who very likely in the course of a few days' time would be unable to tell it from half-a-dozen horses of the same colour if he saw it among them; and the man in a lower walk of life who goes round the corner and backs, at starting price, a horse he has never seen and never will see, having ascertained first what has won the race, is looked upon as a dashing sort of sportsman. For my own part I give it up. The only method of deciding what a sportsman is would be for the right reverend Prelate to move for a Select Committee of this House to be appointed, with the noble Earl, Lord Lonsdale, as Chairman, assisted by capable assessors. For my own part I am quite incapable of defining a sportsman, and I doubt whether my right reverend friend can do so either.<lb/>
And if it is difficult to define a genuine or spurious sportsman, it stands to reason that it is equally difficult to draw the line between what is termed spurious sport and what we may call legitimate sport. As a matter of fact, all sport in this country, with the possible exception of rat hunting, is more or less artificial. It becomes more artificial every year, and it also becomes more expensive. In fact, it has become so artificial and expensive that it would not altogether surprise me if the present Budget were to put an end to a vast amount of so-called legitimate sport in this country. Take for instance, the standard sports. Take shooting. Nothing is more artificial than shooting as it is conducted in this country at the present time. What, I should like to know, would there be to shoot if you were to do away with your keepers, your watchers, your patent foods, your pens, your incubators, and all the paraphernalia necessary for the purpose of producing and rearing what are humorously called the <i>fer&#x0153; nature&#x0153;</i>.<lb/>
Let me take another sport&#x2014;that of hunting. Hunting, again, is one of the most artificial and at the same time one of the most expensive forms of sport which exist. I gather, from an interesting article contributed by a noble and sporting friend of mine who, I imagine, would be recog
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0435"/>
<col>821</col>
nised as a legitimate sportsman&#x2014;my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke&#x2014;that his poultry fund expenses alone amount to no less than &#x00A3;1,000 a year, and that no fewer than 10,000 chickens, valued at 2<i>s</i>. a-piece, were necessary in order to keep the highly artificially protected animal, the fox, in existence; and I do not think anything can demonstrate the artificiality of hunting better than this, that now I understand that the fences which it is safe to jump are carefully designated lest any mistakes should be made.<lb/>
Take the case of fishing. The industry of supplying and breeding fish and eventually turning them out for sporting purposes is now a large and elaborate industry; yet, under this Bill, supposing you had reared trout or whatever it may be upon the patent foods, horseflesh, and various nutritious diets provided by experts in these matters and you were to take one of these fish out and fish for it within a fortnight, you would come under the lash of this Bill and render yourself liable to fine or imprisonment&#x2014;that is, of course, if you were lucky enough to catch one. What we are asked to do under this Bill is to brand certain forms of sport which are not so dissimilar from what I may term legitimate sport as the right reverend Prelate would like us to believe.<lb/>
There are three so-called spurious sports aimed at. One of them is pigeon-shooting. Now pigeon-shooting is not an amusement in which I indulge. I have no admiration for it, and I do not think I have ever shot at a pigeon since I did so when an undergraduate at Oxford with very small success. But, after all, is there any essential difference between the production of pigeons for shooting purposes and the production of pheasants and partridges? The three species are reared for sport, and there is no deception about it. As a matter of fact there is considerable deception in the matter, because in each case the bird, from his earliest moments, is taught to regard himself as the object of man's special care and solicitude, and even up to almost the last hour of his life he still receives the careful ministrations of man, and then, no doubt to his inexpressible horror and amazement, man proceeds to attempt to kill him.<lb/>
Everybody who shoots knows that it is a very common practice to rear what are
<col>822</col>
called wild ducks. These ducks, unless they are treated in an extremely intelligent manner, are apt to develop lethargic and sluggish habits, and in order to counteract this tendency it is frequently found necessary to take these birds to, say, the summit of a hill, place them in a pen, and then liberate them and shoot at them, I do not say invariably with success. I do not contend that this is a particularly inspiring thing to do, but, at the same time, from the sporting point of view, surely it is superior to shooting these what I have termed sluggish birds whilst they sit quacking on a pond, which is the only alternative. What, I ask, is the essential difference between this practice and pigeon shooting?<lb/>
I pass from pigeon-shooting to what the right reverend Prelate calls the hunting of the carted stag; and, frankly, I have no hesitation in saying that I do not think there is any greater instance of misapplied energy than the crusade which is directed against the so-called carted stag. I look upon the hunting of the carted stag as a meritorious and laudable amusement. It is a form of sport which provides an enormous amount of enjoyment and causes a substantial amount of money to be spent in a useful way. To my mind it is a much more creditable thing to gallop after a carted stag than it is to pursue most forms of sport. It requires some courage to gallop after a stag, whether he be tame or wild; it requires no courage at all to follow the legitimate sport of a pheasant shoot or even a grouse drive, armed with a couple of guns and assisted, by a loader. The only danger which you run in that case is the danger which you may possibly incur from unskilful legitimate sporting companions.<lb/>
I should like to remind the right reverend Prelate of the evidence given upon the subject of the carted stag by my noble friend Lord Ribblesdale in the course of the debate which took place some years ago. Lord Ribblesdale stated that the stag, hind or buck, whatever it may be, was the object of universal interest and general attachment, and there is no denying the fact. The tame stag is so much a favourite that certain animals have become well known and enjoy exceptional popularity; so much so that just as star performers will draw a large crowd at theatres or operas, when it was known that a certain
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0436"/>
<col>823</col>
well-known stag or hind was going to be produced on a certain day the field always showed a corresponding increase in numbers. I would recommend anybody who feels any doubt on the subject to study the interesting work by Lord Ribblesdale, and from that he will gather that these tame deer are kept in the best of condition, given the best of food, and live on such good terms with their surroundings that there are instances of one of these much commiserated animals actually coming home in a sociable and amicable way accompanied by the hounds which had been pursuing him all day. There is an equally authenticated instance of a deer which was on such exceptionally good terms with the hounds that he actually fed out of the same trough with them; and in the three years during which my noble friend Lord Ribblesdale was Master of the Buckhounds he states that only four accidents took place, which I think is a sufficient reply to the charge of cruelty in connection with this sport. As a matter of fact, it seems to me that the charge of cruelty in connection with tame deer hunting has about as much foundation as a charge which I heard a foreigner once make against fox-hunting in this country. This gentleman said&#x2014;
<quote>"Fox-hunting is an extremely cruel amusement. At the very first fence which I jumped I spurred my unfortunate horse's eye out."</quote><lb/>
I pass to the third so-called spurious sport&#x2014;rabbit coursing; and here I must admit that the position is not quite so strong as I should like. Speaking selfishly, speaking on my own behalf and probably on behalf of many noble Lords who sit around me, I should be very glad to see this sport put an end to, because it is not only an undesirable form of amusement but a great incentive to poaching. As an instance I may mention that purveyors of this amusement have called upon me and actually had the impertinence, when I refused to sell them rabbits for coursing, to tell me that they would have them taken if I refused to accede to their request. There is practically nothing to be said in favour of this sport. At the same time I am disposed to think that the scenes of revolting cruelty which the right reverend Prelate alleges take place are somewhat exaggerated. In view of the fact that the law is sufficiently powerful to prevent even the overcrowding of goldfish and carp, as has been proved, I find it impossible to believe that it would
<col>824</col>
be hopeless for the various societies which occupy themselves with questions of this kind to interfere with success; and, if it comes to a question of cruelty, I doubt very much whether rabbits coursed by dogs suffer in reality greater pain than those rabbits, wounded in the case of legitimate sport, which expire probably in great pain at the bottom of their holes, or whether they really suffer more than those rabbits which pass hours caught in steel traps, or a rabbit which has its blood sucked from it by a ferret.<lb/>
But what weighs with me is not only the question of relative cruelty, but the fact that, in spite of what the right reverend Prelate says, this is most emphatically the sport of a class; and it seems to me that something more is needed than a mere, if I may say so, sentimental objection to justify us in suppressing a thing of this kind whilst we permit other forms of sport to be indulged in by the wealthier classes and by people who are able to choose whatever form of sport they prefer. The line of distinction between these classes of sport appears to me to be too narrow for legislation, for logic, or, I would even say for common sense; and I think it would not only be illogical, but extremely presumptuous, on our part if we were to dictate to the working classes as to what form their amusements should take. It is extremely difficult to argue with those convinced and honest persons who are sincerely opposed to all forms of sport, and who object to the taking of life for the purposes of pleasure; but I must say that I entirely fail to discern those signs of the public conscience being outraged by these exhibitions to which the right reverend Prelate alluded.<lb/>
The memorial which the right reverend Prelate produced for our edification conveys very little to me. It was obviously a memorial signed principally by dons, by schoolmasters, and, presumably, by divines. As far as I can see, very little interest is actually taken in this question. Not a single person has written to me on the subject of this Bill, except one association which asked me to oppose it. What evidence is there, I should like to know, that the conscience of the democracy is outraged by these so-called spurious sports? I admit that it is always difficult to ascertain what the opinion of the demo
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0437"/>
<col>825</col>
cracy may be upon any given question. The best opportunity for obtaining their opinion, we are always told, is the annual meeting of the Trade Unions Congress. At those congresses all sorts of extraneous subjects are discussed. I have even seen this House condemned, and I think I can remember numerous instances in which they condemned the Established Church. They have condemned such things as militarism; but I cannot recollect one single instance in which any view was expressed about the immorality or the degrading nature of these so-called illegitimate sports which we have been discussing this afternoon. When I see a genuine condemnation of them by the working men, and when I see a measure brought in by them and passed through the popular House, then I confess I should be much inclined to modify my opposition to Bills of this kind.<lb/>
All I have to say, in conclusion, is that I recognise the sincerity and the honesty of those persons of whom I have spoken who have a conscientious objection to taking life for the purpose of amusement. They are perfectly consistent, and some day their efforts may result in that beneficial change at which they are aiming. Some day any noble Lord who sticks a hook in a worm or a gentle, or who liberates a rat from a cage for the purpose of being worried by a terrier, or who even, without taking sufficient precautions, puts his foot upon a blackbeetle may be looked upon as a sort of outcast of society. But at the present moment we are a long way from reaching this, if I may call it so, angelic elevation. At any rate I know I am unregenerate so far, and I cannot help feeling a profound conviction that many of my noble friends are in the same position, and if we assume the attitude that we are to select our own amusements, that we are to go on pursuing any sports we like irrespective of the suffering caused, and at the same time we attempt to prescribe the forms of amusement of persons less fortunate than ourselves, it would not only be an act of presumption but it would be an act of hypocrisy. I beg to move the Amendment standing in my name.<lb/>

<col>826</col>
<p><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I should first like to associate myself with what fell from the noble Lord as to the sincerity which I feel certain inspired the right reverend Prelate in bringing this Bill before us to-night. I remember very well that, if I may say so, the Bishop of Hereford was a great pet with Lord Spencer on account of his fondness for horses and his liking for horsemanship. I quite agree with Lord Newton that the word "sportsman," like the words "young person," is almost incapable of definition and interpretation, and I do not know whether, on account of his liking for horses, we can call the right reverend Prelate a sportsman. At all events, that fact brings him into direct and active ympathy with many members of your Lordships' House. I did not know that this Bill was coming on till yesterday, and, unlike the noble Lord opposite, I have not been at much pains to examine my conscience about it. I am inclined to agree with the late Sir Leslie Stephen when he said that in the ordinary affairs of life most men over fifty should have established a <i>modus vivendi</i> with their conscience. But though I have not done that, I have tried to exercise such a degree of practical sense as I possess, and in those circumstances, I shall support the noble Lord opposite in voting against this Bill. I confess that if I supported this Bill I should feel considerable hesitation in going to hunt with a pack of staghounds, and I may add that I hope to have that pleasure with the hounds of a noble Lord whom I see in his place, Lord Rothschild.<lb/>
For the purpose of this debate I shall confine my few remarks to stag-hunting, which is the only point on which I am entitled to give any sort of opinion. I have never gone pigeon-shooting and have never witnessed rabbit-coursing. I think that a difficult proposition has been laid down. It is like the proposition which declares all wars to be wicked. You may say that all sport is cruel. I agree with the noble Lord who has moved the rejection of this Bill that it is difficult to say where sport ends and cruelty begins. What we have to look at is more or less the way in which people regard it in this country, and how far a Bill of this sort interferes with legitimate amusement.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Lord Newton</member> <membercontribution>was kind enough to allude to a book which I wrote, and he referred
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0438"/>
<col>827</col>
to a gentleman who hunted carted deer and whose deer were on such good terms with their surroundings that they trotted together with the hounds and fed out of the same trough. That is quite true; but the Winchester gentleman in question&#x2014;Mr. Neville&#x2014;had great powers with animals, and it is impossible to generalise from an exception of that kind. There is no doubt that in a badly-managed establishment there might be a good deal of cruelty associated with the hunting of carted deer. In stag-hunting the field always go out to ride, and when things go wrong it is due to the fact that the deer is a weak one or that the pack is badly managed. Directly that happens the sport is, of course, at an end, and the people in the hunt are just as disgusted as anybody else.<lb/>
The little hunting of which I have personal knowledge was done in a large way. We had splendid wild deer, bred in Windsor Park, and plenty of money to keep them as fit as fighting cocks, to which the right reverend. Prelate referred with comparative admiration. It is quite true, as Lord Newton said, that during the time I was Master of the Buckhounds we had only four or five accidents with the deer, and there was only one occasion when the hounds got at the deer. The other accidents were such as would have been equally likely to happen had the deer been wild. I do not go so far as to say that the deer actually enjoy being hunted, but I do say that the occurrences which the Bishop of Hereford has brought out are exceptional; and I ask your Lordships to dismiss the case of the Surbiton deer, or at least to retain it in your minds only as an exception and not as a common occurrence.<lb/>
The noble Lord was quite right when he said that the deer in good establishments are regarded with great solicitude. I remember one cold December day one of the Queen's deer jumped into an icy cold pond, and Lord Cork, who was then Master of the Buckhounds, with two of the hunt servants, jumped into the pond after the deer. Being encumbered with boots and leathers they found it very difficult to put into action their aquatic accomplishments, and the whole field had to help to drag them out as well as the deer. That shows that stag-hunting is not altogether without its element of danger to those who pursue it. I remember
<col>828</col>
that when we went out of office, in 1895, I was consulted as to what I thought about the future of stag-hunting in Berkshire. I said then that I thought Berkshire was wanting in some of the qualities essential for hunting carted deer; it was no longer wild country, and I said that on this account I could understand giving up stag-hunting. But speaking from actual and close experience&#x2014;and I do not think I missed a day during the whole time I had anything to do with that establishment&#x2014;I say that this general charge of cruelty in stag-hunting cannot be supported by any one who understands the question; and I would be very sorry if any one were to run away with the idea that what the right reverend Prelate has stated, though, no doubt, perfectly accurate, is what usually takes place in stag-hunting.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I desire to join with Lord Newton and Lord Ribblesdale in saying how much I appreciate the sincerity with which the right reverend Prelate has brought forward this Bill; and I am certain that, when we vote against the Bill, he, on his part, will acquit us of any wish to countenance cruelty to animals. I, in company with the two noble Lords who have just spoken, will yield to no one in the desire to oppose cruelty to animals. The right reverend Prelate has rested his case rather on the violation of the public conscience than on the cruelty to the animal. I am not myself an expert either on rabbit-coursing, stag-hunting, or pigeon-shooting&#x2014;the three sports threatened&#x2014;though when I was an under-graduate I took part freely in all three; but I honestly believe that the miners who indulge in rabbit-coursing and those who take part in pigeon-shooting do not do so in order to gratify any brutal instincts. With regard to stag-hunting, it has been abundantly proved by the last two speakers that there is very little cruelty attached to it.<lb/>
I was very glad the right reverend Prelate referred to the case of a stag which had been impaled on spiked railings. If there is one thing more than another which requires to be seen into, and, if possible, overhauled by legislation, it is the putting up of spiked railings in a hunting country. Noble Lords laugh. I am not going to make use of this debate for a defence of the sport in which I am interested. I am glad to say that at this time of day it requires no
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0439"/>
<col>829</col>
defence whatever. But is not all sport cruel? I admit most frankly that all forms of sport, and all relations of man to animal when he is pursuing it, must necessarily partake of the nature of cruelty, and one kind of cruelty cannot be separated from another by Act of Parliament. There are two sorts of cruelty. There is the physical pain inflicted upon the animal, like that which, no doubt, the fox feels when he is being torn by hounds, which is momentary, and there is the pain which a lot of well-meaning people think that an animal suffers because its surroundings appear to them to be of an unjust and cruel nature. You will never be able to settle how much the animal in question feels the injustice of its position. For my part I do not believe that a pigeon in a trap knows that there is a blood-thirsty man with a gun ready to shoot it the moment it is liberated. I feel that it is very difficult for us to say how far the surroundings in which it is placed can enter into the consideration of the animal itself.<lb/>
There is a form of cruelty which I think, might very well be dealt with by legislation. The amount of vermin which die lingering deaths in steel traps is very horrible to contemplate, and I, for one, would join heartily with any band of reformers who would turn their attention to that particular branch of cruelty. There are other things which we would like to include, but I do not think that a measure of that kind would have any more chance of passing into law than this Bill. There is, for instance, the erection of barbed-wire fences in hunting country with the full knowledge that people are certain to ride over them. That is an un-English thing to do. But if there is one thing more un-English than that, it is the kind of practice that has been alluded to&#x2014;namely, the putting up of danger signals to warn people that certain fences are dangerous to eldest sons or heirs to landed estates who ride to hounds. I hope that the right reverend Prelate, in his future consideration of the question of cruelty to animals, will seriously consider the question of steel traps. That is a matter which ought to be looked into by the Legislature, and I, for one, would give my hearty support to any attempt to deal with it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LORE 
<col>830</col>
BURN)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, this is a subject in which I have interested myself ever since I have been a Member of Parliament, and therefore I ask permission to say a few words on this Bill. I cannot sufficiently admire the adroitness of the noble Lord, Lord Newton. I have often admired it before, but never more than on this occasion. The noble Lord has succeeded, I think by reason of the discursive spirit in which he regarded the proposals in the Bill, in so attracting the attention of the House to other very interesting topics, urged with admirable humour, that we seem to have forgotten the nature of this proposal and what is the justification for it. The noble Lord, in the first place, distinguished between, or challenged others to distinguish between, those who are sportsmen and those who are not. I was sorry to observe that he regarded as being more or less in the same category people who sympathise with first-class cricket and those who were in the habit of putting money on a race after they knew the result.<lb/>
Does the noble Lord not know that one of the main characteristics of sport in this country regarded as essential by all men worthy of the name of sportsmen is that of giving the animal fair play? I will not say anything about stag-hunting. I have never been out stag-hunting myself, and do not intend at any time ever to go. It is a very small matter. There are very few stag hunts in this country, and therefore we need not trouble ourselves much with them. The main point is that of rabbit-coursing. The noble Lord himself did not attempt to defend that. He knows perfectly well that nothing would induce him to take part in it. Why? Because he knows it is not sport at all. It is not a sport, but a cowardly amusement&#x2014;a disgusting amusement. It is all very well to say that poor people cannot afford to have the luxuries of the rich. That is no reason why they should indulge in a cowardly and degrading amusement.<lb/>
Rabbit-coursing is indulged in mostly for the purpose of betting, and betting is spoiling most of the sports and games of this country. There is nothing finer in the world than a horse race. Nobody enjoys witnessing one more than I do, and yet whenever I do attend a race meeting I am always horrified at the betting
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0440"/>
<col>831</col>
adjuncts on the course. One result of the evil is that servants are induced to steal the silver spoons and forks from the side-board, in order to pay their betting debts. County Court Judges will tell you how betting agents persecute servants and others who do not wish it known that they have been betting. Gate-money is also doing great harm to cricket. Sport is a very fine thing provided you keep it as genuine real sport. It is no use seeking for further distinctions. Every one knows the difference between genuine sport and that which is not genuine; and I am quite sure Lord Newton would draw the line at rabbit-coursing. Rabbit-coursing is unnecessarily cruel and must be degrading to the people who take part in it. I do not know in the least how many of your Lordships are disposed to give a Second Reading to this Bill, but I sincerely hope there are some. For myself, I shall certainly vote with the right reverend Prelate.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I do not know whether my right reverend brother intends going to a Division, but in case he does not&#x2014;and it was, I think, by his own wish, and not through the failure to find a co-teller, that on the previous occasion he did not divide the House&#x2014;I should be sorry to remain silent. Of course it is always easy, when a discussion of this kind arises, to ride off upon the difficulty of defining the exact line that ought to be drawn, and the precise phraseology which would cover those who stand on this or that side. While no one could have treated this subject with more skill and grace than the noble Lord who moved the rejection of the Bill, yet even Lord Newton in his inimitable way admitted that the so-called sport of rabbit-coursing, against which this Bill is mainly directed, is an undesirable form of amusement, and that nothing was to be said in favour of it. This is one of those matters upon which public opinion necessarily grows from generation to generation. We have advanced upon the views of our grandfathers. I venture to think that most of us have in our own experience grown somewhat in the views we should adopt upon a matter of this kind quite apart from the mere question of advancing years. I am afraid that I myself ought to stand here in a white sheet after a good deal that has been said,
<col>832</col>
because I possess an insignificant cup&#x2014;I think it is only honest to say it&#x2014;which in my undergraduate days I won at pigeon-shooting. I think there are one or two noble Lords in the House who were my competitors on the occasion when I won the cup. I simply mention that as an argument to show how completely, as has occurred in my own case, a man's views may change as regards what is, and what is not, a legitimate form of sport. I find it hard now to realise that I could have looked upon this matter in the careless way in which one was apt to regard such matters years ago. To go back a few generations, bull-baiting used to be an extremely popular sport in this country. Objections were, as we know, taken to it long ago, but we all remember Macaulay's phrase, that the Puritans objected to bull-baiting, not because it hurt the bull but because it gave pleasure to the spectators. The other day I came across, in some of our Lambeth records, a protest raised by the inhabitants of Lambeth, who urged that the bull-baiting taking place in Vauxhall Gardens ought to be stopped because of the unpleasantly mauled condition of the terriers that were thrown on the ladies' laps by the bulls. We have drifted as far from that as it is possible to conceive; and I firmly believe that fifty years hence it will be found as impossible for the then members of your Lordships' House to realise why we refrained from taking exception to rabbit-coursing as it is pursued to-day as we now find it difficult to understand why a hundred years ago exception was not taken to things like bull-baiting. We are growing from generation to generation in the understanding of these matters, and I believe that by now and then expressing our abhorrence of things which are felt to be disgusting and cruel we help to stimulate public opinion on matters on which public opinion is somewhat sluggish. This discussion should prove helpful in that way, and our thanks are due to the Bishop of Hereford for having brought in this Bill. If my right reverend brother goes to a Division I shall certainly support him.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to explain the line which the Government take with regard to this Bill. This Bill or a similar Bill has been before both Houses of Parliament on various occasions. Different personal opinions have been expressed by different Home Secretaries upon the Papers in the Office, but the line the Home Office has adopted all through has been not to put the weight of the Government either upon the one side or the other.

<title>MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS (QUALIFICATION OF CLERGYMEN) BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<section>
<title>[SECOND READING.]</title>
<p>Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p><member>LORD MONKSWELL </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, this is a Bill to remedy what I hope your Lordships will agree is an indefensible anomaly with regard to the eligibility of clergy to serve on municipal bodies. The present
<col>834</col>
occasion the Government do not propose to depart from that line of action. Therefore, so far as their supporters are concerned they hope they will take just such action as they desire to take, without feeling that His Majesty's Government wish to influence them in any way.<lb/>
On Question, whether the word "now" shall stand part of the Motion?&#x2014;<lb/>
Their Lordships divided:&#x2014;Contents, 25; Not-contents, 62.<lb/>

law disqualifies clerks in Holy Orders and regular ministers of dissenting congregations from serving on municipal bodies, but at the same time clergymen are eligible to sit on county councils, even on the London County Council, which is the largest municipal body in the world, and they are also eligible to sit on the twenty-nine London borough councils. They can also sit on the councils of the University towns of Oxford and Cambridge, and they are eligible to be co-opted on the education committees of bodies to which they do not belong. It appears to be part of the duty
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0442"/>
<col>835</col>
of clergymen to concern themselves in education, and surely it would be far better if they were allowed to sit on the bodies which form the education committees instead of having to be co-opted from outside. If they sat on these bodies they would be able to justify in the full council the policy of the education committee of which they were members.<lb/>
The present state of the law seems to me to be indefensible from any point of view you may take of the duties of the clergy. There are two views with regard to the duties of the clergy. One is that they should confine themselves entirely, or very nearly entirely, to the exercise of their spiritual functions and should mix as little as possible in politics, either municipal or Imperial. Another view is that, even with regard to the exercise of their spiritual functions, it is just as well that clergymen should be to some extent men of the world and should understand mankind; that it is good for them and for their flocks that they should, to some extent, mix in the world. I submit that it is good for the community in general as well as for himself that any clergyman who feels that he has a vocation for municipal work should have an opportunity of doing that work. It seems to me perfectly clear that the present law is in a transitory phase, and that in this matter we must either go forward or backward. In 1882 the law forbade clergymen to serve on any municipal bodies, but in 1888 and in 1894 a different view prevailed in the Legislature. In 1888 they were made eligible to sit on county councils; in 1894 they were made eligible to sit on the London borough councils. The prohibition was then partially removed. It was removed in an absolutely illogical manner. I do not complain in the least of the Legislature. The legislation of 1888 and of 1894 was in the nature of an experiment, and what I say is that the present law is an unstable compromise between two absolutely different schools of thought with regard to the clergy, and that it is time now to settle which view shall prevail.<lb/>
I contend that experience has amply justified the experiment of allowing the clergy to sit upon municipal bodies, and that we may usefully make them eligible for all municipal bodies. It was said at one time, before we had any experience of the matter, that if we permitted the clergy to serve on these bodies they would
<col>836</col>
have such an ascendancy over their congregations that they would have an unfair advantage over their lay competitors and the result would be that the spiritual element would be predominant in these local bodies. That has not turned out to be the case at all. On the contrary, very few clergy have sought to sit on these bodies and very few have been elected, but those who have sat have shown that they were capable of doing excellent work. I sat on the London County Council for eighteen years, and can only call to mind&#x2014;I may have forgotten one or two&#x2014;five clergymen of all denominations who served on that Council during that period, and those who served did excellent work. I have it on the authority of Canon Jephson that there have been eight clerical mayors in London&#x2014;namely, in Marylebone, Southwark, Finsbury, Wandsworth, Hammersmith, Fulham, Lewisham and Chelsea. In the case of Marylebone the Rev. Russell Wakefield was re-elected because of his excellent work as mayor&#x2014;an unusual honour; and with regard to Chelsea, I can speak from personal experience of the excellent work of the Rev. Henry Gamble. I do not agree with him in politics and am not prejudiced in any way in his favour, but I say it is of great advantage to Chelsea that Mr. Gamble is the Mayor.<lb/>
Canon Jephson also informs me that there is at least one clergyman on every one of the twenty-nine London borough councils. Three or four per cent. of these councillors are clergymen; that is not a large percentage, and not one likely to swamp the lay element. The clergy have acted with great discretion in this matter. Only those clergymen have come forward who have a vocation for this kind of work, and they have shown that they can do it admirably. The Bill which I am asking your Lordships to read a second time is very much wanted. I have in my hand a very long printed list of clergy of all denominations, many of whom have served on local bodies, who are very desirous that this Bill should pass. I regard this question exclusively from the English point of view. I know very little about the circumstances of Scotland or Ireland. I therefore propose, in Committee, to restrict the operation of the Bill to England. I beg to move.<lb/>
Moved, that the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Monkswell</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0443"/>
<col>837</col>
<p>*<member>LORD ALLENDALE </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the noble Lord in moving the Second Reading has stated the case for the Bill so clearly that I am relieved of any necessity of going at length into the matter. I may say at once that the Government offer no opposition to the Bill. Lord Monkswell has pointed out that the Bill is designed to remove an anomaly with regard to the eligibility of clergymen and ministers of religion to serve on the councils of municipal boroughs. There appears no reason whatever why that anomaly and disqualification should continue, especially as ministers of religion can already sit on county councils and the councils of metropolitan boroughs. Possibly some people do not look upon clergymen as particularly good business men, but there are, of course, exceptions, and where these exceptions exist and the clergy are capable and willing to undertake these duties there seems to be no reason why their services should not be made use of when available. The Government, as I have said, offer no opposition to the Bill. In fact, they consider the object of the Bill, which is to effect uniformity in the law, a very desirable one.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE LORD BISHOP OF SOUTHWARK </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I can speak upon this matter as one connected with districts which are not under this disability, and can certainly confirm what has been said by the noble Lord who introduced the Bill as to the public advantage to be gained from the clergy being able to take part in these duties. I speak as one who is no indiscriminate admirer of clergymen taking up this work. I think in many cases it is very questionable whether a man with heavy burdens of another kind has a right to take on himself these large secular burdens, but there are, I know, cases where, in the circumstances, it is best he should do so. The supply of men highly qualified for municipal work is not in all cases adequate, and it may very well happen that the clergy are in a position to bring what very few men about them are able to bring to the work. Their special qualifications have been of value in regard to many matters affecting the welfare of the community. In a few cases they take an effective part, no doubt, as political partisans; but they also often take a line independent of party, and I think I am right in saying that in almost every case those who have been elected
<col>838</col>
have been valuable members of the body which they joined. In those circumstances, though as a Bishop it should be my part to hinder anything like an indiscriminate extension of the discharge of secular duties by the clergy, I do feel strongly that a case has been made out for the removal of the disqualification which is at present placed upon ministers of religion in this matter.<lb/>

<title>ELECTRIC LIGHTING ACTS (AMENDMENT) BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p>Amendments reported (according to Order).</p>
<p><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF ONSLOW)</member> <membercontribution>moved to amend Clause 5&#x2014;
<quote>"5.&#x2014;(1) Any local authority company or person authorised to supply electricity in any area may with the consent of the Board of Trade supply at any point within that area electricity for the purposes of haulage or traction on any railway tramway or canal situate partly within and partly without that area and for the purposes of lighting vehicles and vessels used on any such railway tramway or canal but the Board of Trade shall not in any case give any such consent until notice of the application for the consent has been given by advertisement or otherwise in such manner as the Board of Trade may direct and an opportunity has been given to any person who appears to the Board to be affected of stating any objections he may have thereto.</quote>
<quote>(2) The Board of Trade may by Provisional Order authorise any such local authority company or person to so supply electricity to be used for purposes incidental to the working or lighting of the railway tramway or canal other than the purposes aforesaid,"</quote>
by inserting, at the beginning of the clause, the words, "The Board of Trade may by Provisional Order authorise." The noble Earl said: Your Lordships will recollect that when this measure was under discussion in Committee I drew attention to the provision in Clause 5, and expressed some surprise that while it should be necessary to obtain a Provisional Order to authorise undertakers to supply electricity for purposes incidental to the working or lighting of a railway, tramway, or canal, it should not be deemed necessary to obtain a Provisional Order&#x2014;that is to say, to get the sanction of Parliament&#x2014;for the purpose of enabling local authorities to supply electricity to, say, a railway company. I am
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0444"/>
<col>839</col>
aware that a railway company, before it can use electricity for the purposes of traction, must apply for the consent of the Board of Trade, and presumably that consent would be obtained within a very short time. But the clause as it stands now is open, in my opinion, to this objection. A railway line running through a great extent of territory would pass through the area of a number of local authorities, companies, and, perhaps, private individuals, who would be able to supply electricity if they could obtain powers from the Board of Trade; and I venture to think it is somewhat dangerous to entrust a Government Department with the absolute power of allowing a small local authority or a small company to put up a vast generating station such as would be necessary for the purpose of supplying electricity to the whole of a railway. I cannot help thinking that in cases of that kind the check which is imposed by the requirement to come to Parliament for a Provisional Order would be a wise precaution in the event of such a thing being attempted. It might, of course, be quite right. The London and North Western Railway Company might desire to utilise the enormous generating station at Willesden for the supply of electricity; but I do not think it would be right that a small undertaking on the main line of a company should be allowed to supply the great amount of electricity which would be necessary for a railway unless it had previously obtained the sanction of Parliament. For that purpose I suggest to your Lordships that these powers should only be exercised on a Provisional Order obtained from the Board of Trade and subject to the control of Parliament.<lb/>
Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 3, line 35, at the beginning of the clause, to insert the words 'The Board of Trade may by Provisional Order authorise'"&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Onslow</i>.)</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, this is one of the points on which the Board of Trade have been in consultation with the noble Earl, and we had hoped it was a point on which we had been able to meet him, more particularly as we agreed to the insertion, on the last stage of the Bill, of the words which appear at the end of the subsection and which lay down that in the event of the Board of Trade making such an order notice must be
<col>840</col>
given to all the persons interested so as to afford them an opportunity of objecting. I am sorry that those words have not satisfied all the objections which the noble Earl feels to this Clause. The reason for having in this subsection a simple order of the Board of Trade and having a Provisional Order in the other one is this, that in the second case you are going to authorise an undertaker to supply electricity for lighting purposes within the territory of another undertaker, and we think that that ought not to be done without coming to Parliament by Provisional Order. In the other case we only ask for power to use this electricity which will be taken within the district from a point somewhere outside that district for the purpose of running the line or canal. There is a difference between the two things, because, in the second case, though this electricity may be used in the territory of another undertaker it would be for a purpose for which that undertaker has no authority to supply electricity. That can only be done on the authority of the Board of Trade. We think it is better to leave this to a simple order of the Board of Trade, because we wish to make it as easy as possible for these people to get this order. We wish to avoid expense and trouble and the great delay necessary in getting a Provisional Order. We think that the thing can be very much better done in that way. We are fortified in that feeling by the fact that the Railways (Electric Power) Act of 1903 gives the Board of Trade power by simple order to authorise a railway company to use electricity for the purposes of their line; and as the authority can be given by a simple order to the person who is going to use the electricity, it would seem much more convenient that it should also be done by simple order in the case of giving the authority to the people who are going to supply it. On these grounds I must ask the House not to agree to this Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I do not know what course my noble friend the Lord Chairman desires to take upon this Amendment, but undoubtedly the case is not a perfectly simple one. The noble Lord opposite is quite justified in saying that there is a great public object in avoiding delay and expense in promoting these undertakings; but, on the other hand, I feel strongly the force of my noble friend's objection that the power of
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0445"/>
<col>841</col>
entering upon the supply of electricity on the enormous scale that might conceivably ensue is a power of such dimensions that it ought not to be capable of being granted except on the authority of Parliament itself. The danger which my noble friend has in view, I gather from his speech, is lest these small local authorities should launch into all sorts of extravagant speculation in the matter of supplying electricity, which is really trading and not a service for the benefit of their own ratepayers. It is a speculative trading matter with which local authorities ought to have nothing to do. Those are the two points of view from which we may regard this Amendment. If I might make a suggestion, it would be this. Personally I should be satisfied if the noble Lord opposite were to give an undertaking, on behalf of the Board of Trade, that they would watch very narrowly the operation of this power and would take care that no such danger ensued as that which my noble friend fears. If such an undertaking were given by the noble Lord, I am quite sure it would be obeyed and followed out; and if, in the early stages of the administration of this Bill, those precedents were set, I do not think they would be departed from in future years. Therefore what we have to protect is the operation of this provision during the next few years, and that would be covered by a solemn assurance given on behalf of the Board of Trade by the noble Lord opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HAMILT0N OF DALZELL </member>: <membercontribution>With the permission of the House, I will answer the appeal made to me by the noble Marquess. In the first place, I do not think there is any great danger of a small local authority engaging in the supply of electricity to a very large railway company, and for two reasons. First, I do not think the Board of Trade would be the least likely to sanction such a proceeding; and, second, there is also the safeguard of the Local Government Board. The local authority could not borrow the money to get the plant for this undertaking without the sanction of the Local Government Board, and your Lordships will see, I think, that it is not at all likely that the Local Government Board would sanction such a proceeding as the noble Earl has indicated. Although I have no authority to give any assurance on this matter, I think I may make the mind of the noble Marquess easy. I am
<col>842</col>
quite sure the Board of Trade would not sanction small local authorities embarking on enormous schemes of this kind, and I think this is a matter in which the House may safely trust the two Government Departments concerned to look after the interests of the ratepayers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW </member>: <membercontribution>I have not very great confidence in some Government Departments and I have much greater confidence in Parliament. I have, however, some measure of confidence in the action of the officials of the Board of Trade, and I feel that if a matter of this kind can be left safely to any Department it can be left to the officials of the Board of Trade. In those circumstances I do not propose to ask your Lordships to divide on this Amendment,<lb/>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I move to add, at the end of Clause 5, this new subsection&#x2014;
<quote>"(3) A company local authority or body receiving a supply of electricity under this section shall not use the electricity in such manner as to cause or to be likely to cause any interference with Government observatories or laboratories but this subsection shall not apply to any such company local authority or body who by any Act of Parliament or Order confirmed by or having the effect of an Act of Parliament containing provisions for the protection of such observatories or laboratories are authorised to use electricity for the purposes for which a supply is authorised to be given under this section."</quote>
This is an Amendment which I move on behalf of the Commissioners of Works, and its object is to safeguard certain observatories and scientific institutions. It is on the same lines as an Amendment that was inserted in the London Electricity Bills last year.<lb/>
Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 4, line 10, after the word 'aforesaid', to insert the following new subsection: '(3) A company local authority or body receiving a supply of electricity under this section shall not use the electricity in such manner as to cause or to be likely to cause any interference with Government observatories or laboratories, but this subsection shall not apply to any such company local authority or body who by any Act of Parliament or Order confirmed by or having the effect of an Act of Parliament containing provisions for the protection of such observatories or laboratories are authorised to use electricity for the purposes for which a supply is authorised to be given under this section.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Hamilton of Dalzell</i>.)</quote><lb/>
On Question, Amendment agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0446"/>
<col>843</col>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member> <membercontribution>moved to amend subsection (1) of Clause 13&#x2014;
<quote>"(1) If an auditor appointed by the Board of Trade to audit the accounts of any undertakers who are not a local authority reports to the Board that the undertakers have declined or neglected to comply with any of his recommendations or requirements the Board may if they think fit after giving the undertakers an opportunity of being heard make an order directing the undertakers to comply with such recommendations and requirement with or without modifications as may be specified in the order subject to an appeal to the Railway and Canal Commissioners or any two of them who shall finally decide the matter and confirm annul or amend the order as they may think fit,"</quote>
by inserting, after the word "requirements" where it first appeared in the subsection, the words "in so far as they relate to matters affecting the interests of the authority empowered to purchase the undertaking or of the consumers."<lb/>
The noble Earl said: It will be in the recollection of your Lordships that some discussion took place upon this clause in Committee as to whether the audit of the auditors appointed to audit the accounts of private companies was such as was satisfactory to the public, and whether the system of audit ought not to be extended equally to municipal authorities. I will say nothing on the latter point for the moment, because an Amendment further down on the Paper in the name of Lord Avebury deals with that question. I understand that the object of this clause is to secure that the accounts of companies shall be kept in such a manner that the undertaking which becomes purchaseable after the lapse of a certain number of years by the local authority shall not be so manipulated in the accounts as to enhance the cost as against the local authority when the time comes for purchase; and, secondly, that the accounts shall be so kept that a proper amount is placed to depreciation so that the sliding scale on which the electricity is supplied shall be such that the public gets the full advantage which Parliament intended. I think that if your Lordships limit the clause to those two points&#x2014;and that is the object of my Amendment&#x2014;Lord Avebury will see that, to a great extent, at any rate, an Amendment proposing to extend this clause to municipal authorities will be inapplicable, because in the case of municipal authorities there is, of course, no question of the purchase of the undertaking, nor is there any question of sliding scale affecting dividends.</membercontribution></p>
<col>844</col>
<p>Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 7, line 32, after the word 'requirements,' to insert the words 'in so far as they relate to matters affecting the interests of the authority empowered to purchase the undertaking or of the consumers.'"&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Onslow</i>.)</quote></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL </member>: <membercontribution>The object of this clause as it appears in the Bill is as the noble Earl has stated; and as representations have been made to the Board of Trade that the words as they stand might be read to give power to the auditors to interfere in the commercial aspect of the undertaking, we accept the Amendment.<lb/>
On Question, Amendment agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD AVEBURY</member> <membercontribution>moved to insert, after subsection (1) of Clause 13, the following new subsection&#x2014;
<quote>"(2) This section shall also apply in the case of any auditor or auditors appointed under the provisions of the Public Health Act 1875 or the Municipal Corporations Act 1882 or by the Local Government Board to audit the accounts of any undertakers who are a local authority, and where the undertakers being a local authority have declined or neglected to comply with any of his or their recommendations or requirements and for such purpose this section shall have effect as if the Local Government Board was substituted for the Board of Trade."</quote>
The noble Lord said: As I stated the reasons for my Amendment a few days ago, I should not be justified in detaining your Lordships for more than a moment now. I quite agree that the words which have just been introduced on the Motion of Lord Onslow do to some extent, but not by any means entirely meet the objection which those for whom I am acting feel to the clause as it stands. The noble Lord who spoke for His Majesty's Government stated, when we were discussing this matter a few days ago in Committee, that my proposal was a very drastic alteration of the law and hardly germane to the Bill. I need hardly point out that it is a drastic Amendment which is being proposed by His Majesty's Government, and all that my Amendment does is to apply to local authorities the same wholesome provisions that it is proposed to apply to companies. If it is not germane to the Bill in the one case, I submit that it is not germane in the other. It is more necessary to have an effective audit in the case of municipalities than in the case of companies. If a private company is mismanaged and the accounts not fairly kept it is the share
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0447"/>
<col>845</col>
holders who lose their money; but if a municipal authority mismanages its affairs and does not keep its accounts properly it is the public who suffer. There is a strong impression that the accounts of local authorities are by no means all that could be desired. I admit that a great many of them are thoroughly well kept, but there are exceptions; and that fact came out very strongly in the evidence taken before the Joint Committee. It is said that this is necessary in the one case because municipalities may buy up some of these companies; but we know that there are some cases in which municipalities have found that they could not carry on electrical works at a profit and have resold them to companies. I think that in future we shall see as many instances of local authorities selling their electrical undertakings to private companies as we shall see of private companies selling to local authorities. At any rate, I hope, in the general interests of the public, that that may be the case. A satisfactory system of audit is most desirable. I submit that what is fair in the one case is fair in the other, and if you are going to insist on these strenuous rules with regard to private companies you ought to apply them to municipalities.<lb/>
Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 7, line 39, after the word 'fit' to insert the following new subsection: '(2) This section shall also apply in the case of any auditor or auditors appointed under the provisions of the Public Health Act 1875 or the Municipal Corporations Act 1882 or by the Local Government Board to audit the accounts of any undertakers who are a local authority and where the undertakers being a local authority have declined or neglected to comply with any of his or their recommendations or requirements and for such purpose this section shall have effect as if the Local Government Board was substituted for the Board of Trade.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Avebury</i>.)</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I hope the House will support the Amendment that has been moved by Lord Avebury, and I should like to endorse everything that has fallen from him, especially the remark he made at the conclusion of his speech that what is fair for one side should also be fair for the other. I had the advantage of serving on the Joint Committee which examined into the question of municipal audit, and if there was one thing more clear than another in that inquiry it was that in very many cases&#x2014;I do not say invariably but in

very many cases&#x2014;municipal audits are really very unsatisfactory. The system, as I understand, is that the accounts are audited by auditors elected by the municipality itself. The whole point of an audit of any sort is that it should be conducted by an independent party, and if the accounts of a local authority are audited by a servant of the municipality, who, in many cases, is tempted to "audit to order," if I may say so, it cannot be so satisfactory to the public concerned. Not only do I put that forward as a strong argument, but I submit that if you are going to establish this new form of audit for one party you should certainly adopt it for the other.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I opposed this new subsection the other day when it was proposed by the noble Lord, and I must again oppose it to-day. I ask your Lordships to remember for a moment what the object of the clause as it appears in the Bill is. It is inserted in order to strengthen the hands of the Board of Trade auditors. Those auditors are appointed by the Board of Trade because the Board have two duties in particular placed upon them in regard to the undertakings of electric light companies. Those are the duties, to which the Chairman of Committees alluded just now, with regard to the safeguarding of the local authority which may ultimately wish to exercise its power of purchase, and also with regard to the fact that the Department may at any time be called upon to readjust the maximum price which may be charged for electricity. Those reasons do not exist in the case of electric undertakings which are the property of local authorities. In those cases there is, of course, an audit of the accounts, but it is part of the general audit of the accounts of the local authority. It is carried out, as your Lordships have been told, in the case of all local authorities, except municipalities, by the district auditors appointed by the Local Government Board, and in other cases by two auditors, one of whom is appointed by the mayor and the other by the ratepayers. The powers of the Local Government Board auditors are very strong indeed. The Local Government Board do not ask that those powers should be strengthened, and, in fact, the passing of this Amendment would not strengthen their hands at all, because their powers are greater than are
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0448"/>
<col>847</col>
proposed in the noble Lord's Amendment; so that I think for them there is no necessity for the Amendment.<lb/>
With regard to the other auditors, those appointed by the municipality, I know that many Members of this House think that that system might be improved. I think my noble friend the Leader of the House indicated last week that it was his opinion that that system might be improved. I do not wish to say anything about that at present beyond this, that I do not think it is right&#x2014;I do not wish to use the word "drastic" again, as the noble Lord objected to it&#x2014;I do not think it is right to put a change of that kind into a Bill of this nature, and, if it were done, it would not be very effective because it would apply only to a small portion of the accounts of these municipalities, and if there were any irregularities taking place it would be very easy to conceal them in the other accounts over which these auditors would have no power. Therefore I do not think this Amendment would have any effect. Moreover, these auditors are not appointed by, and are not responsible to the Local Government Board, and it is, very doubtful whether this clause would really strengthen their hands at all.<lb/>
I would make an appeal to the noble Lord. This is an unfortunate little Bill, and it is considerably overdue. It is based on a Report of a Committee which sat eleven years ago, and I suppose that ever since the Report of the Committee this Bill has been lying at the Board of Trade and struggling to become law. It has made several attempts. It made one notable attempt in 1904, when the noble Lord who then represented the Board of Trade here actually got it through this House, but that did not happen until within two days of the close of the session. I suppose the other House, which is not quite so accommodating as your Lordships are in these matters, did not think two days sufficient to give consideration to the Bill. At all events, it did not become law, and it went back to its pigeon hole in the Department where it remained until this year. We have introduced it early this session and hope, with ordinary luck, to get it through; but I need not remind the noble Lord that if he saddles it with a highly contentious question of this kind, which has nothing to do with it, he will seriously impair its chance of becoming
<col>848</col>
law and will be doing great injury to people engaged in the supply of electricity in this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW </member>: <membercontribution>I certainly have a great deal of sympathy with the noble Lord who has moved this Amendment. I do think that the auditing of municipal accounts needs completely overhauling. I think, however, that the interest which I know the noble Lord has more particularly in view at this moment&#x2014;namely, the prevention of municipal trading&#x2014;would be better secured by a proper audit of municipal accounts and a better one than is obtainable under the present system. But I doubt whether this Bill, which only touches a fraction of the accounts of a municipal authority, is really the proper opportunity to raise the question. It would be better to deal with the subject in a separate Bill, when your Lordships could give consideration to the matter in its broadest aspect. If the Amendment were carried it would be almost ridiculous, because it would be confined, by the words to which your Lordships have just agreed, to two matters which do not concern municipalities at all. Therefore I join in the appeal which has been made that the noble Lord should not jeopardise the progress of the Bill by pressing his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, my feeling is very much that of my noble friend Lord Onslow. When the Lord Chairman proposed his Amendment I anticipated that my noble friend behind me (Lord Avebury) would have risen and explained that his Amendment was alternative to my noble friend's, because, although they do not absolutely cover the same ground, they interfere a great deal with one another. As amended the operation of the section is very much more limited than it was as the Bill appeared on your Lordships' Table this afternoon. The earlier subsection, upon which this subsection depends, is now confined to matters concerning the purchase of undertakings and the interests of consumers. I am afraid, therefore, that Lord Avebury's Amendment would no longer do what he hoped it would do, and, in those circumstances, I cannot help joining in the appeal that my noble friend should not press the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD AVEBURY </member>: <membercontribution>It is quite true that if this Amendment were carried we should
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0449"/>
<col>849</col>
not get a thorough and complete audit of municipal accounts but we should get an audit as applied to their electric undertakings. That is a matter of very great importance, and would be a step in the right direction. My noble friend suggested that I should bring in a Bill dealing with municipal audit. It is one thing for a private member to get a Bill through Parliament and another to get a clause inserted in a Bill which has behind it the weight of the Government. But, after what has been said, I will not put the House to the trouble of a Division.<lb/>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD AVEBURY</member> <membercontribution>moved to amend Clause 16, subsection (1), which provided that&#x2014;
<quote>"Where the undertakers are a local authority they may provide let for hire and fix repair and remove but shall not manufacture lamps meters electric lines fuzes switches fittings lamp holders motors and other fittings for lighting and motive power,"</quote>
by inserting, after the word "may," the words "through a contractor but not otherwise." The noble Lord said: This Amendment in reality raises the question of municipal trading. It has been suggested that there might be cases in which there was no contractor. I have endeavoured to deal with cases of that kind by the subsequent Amendment. It was in the model clause for some time that this work should only be done through a contractor; but the then Chairman of Committees thought there might be cases in which there was no contractor who could undertake the work and therefore the words have been dropped out of the model clause. I submit that there can be no inconvenience to the public if the House accepts my Amendment. If there is no contractor it will be open to the local authority to carry out the work. It has been suggested to me that the word "contractor" is not quite clear, and if the House is good enough to accept this Amendment I will put down a further Amendment for the Third Reading stage defining a contractor so as to meet any doubts on that point. I submit that if your Lordships do not accept my Amendment you will be in reality dealing another blow at that private enterprise to which the prosperity of the country owes so much.<lb/>

<quote>"In page 8, line 26, after the word 'may,' to insert the words `through a contractor but not otherwise.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Avebury</i>.)</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW </member>: <membercontribution>I think your Lordships have to consider, in the first place, the interests of the consumers of electricity. It is extremely convenient to be able to hire fittings from the persons who supply either the electricity or the gas, and I do not think your Lordships would willingly put anything in the way of that very convenient practice. The noble Lord has stated that there may be some doubt as to the exact meaning of the word "contractor," and he is, I understand, ready to bring up words which will widen the interpretation, so that "contractor" may, in practice, cover any man who is capable of undertaking the work of putting in these fittings and supplying the wires. Your Lordships will observe that municipal authorities are already by the clause specially precluded from manufacturing either fittings or wires, and therefore to a large extent the object sought to be attained by the Amendment is already provided for in the Bill. What the noble Lord proposes now is to still further limit local authorities by saying that they shall not fix these fittings or put in the wires in a house except through a contractor. I admit that there is much to be said on the score of the undesirability of allowing municipal authorities to enter too freely into competition with private firms. I have had some experience of this matter, because for some years I was a member of the London County Council, which possessed what it called a works department&#x2014;a department which carried out the work required by the London County Council without the intervention of a contractor. It was always said that if the council did not have a works department they would have a ring of contractors, and it would be impossible to protect the public against exorbitant charges. What have been the facts? The works department of the council has been done away with. The work is now done by contractors, and a comparison of the estimates made by the officials of the council as to what works in their opinion ought to cost with the actual contract price at which the contractors are prepared to do the work has shown, I believe in every case, a considerable reduction on the official estimates. I think that is the best answer to any argument that an Amendment of this kind is likely to
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0450"/>
<col>851</col>
lead to a ring of contractors. Therefore if the noble Lord will consider between this and the Third Reading words which will define a "contractor" so as to enable the small man who is working on his own account to come in and do this work on behalf of the municipality, I, for one, shall offer no opposition to the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD FABER </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to support the Amendment on two grounds&#x2014;first, because I am generally opposed to municipal trading; and, secondly, because I think that in this case there are special circumstances that require the consideration of your Lordships. As I understand Clause 16, it gives the local authority power, not to make electrical fittings and appurtenances, but to become merchants in such things as electric wires, lamps, stoves, and so on. The Amendment is to the effect that a local authority shall not become merchants in these things if there is a merchant in the local area already. I have always thought it dangerous that local authorities should become traders, because, of course, they have not the incentive that a private trader has to look after the concern. The private trader trades with his own money, but the official of a local authority trades with the ratepayers' money and therefore does not care so much whether the matter in which he is engaged is a success or not. Again, a local authority may very easily come into competition with its own ratepayer who is in that particular trade. That is not at all advisable. Another feature in this particular case which deserves the attention of your Lordships is that local authorities have a statutory obligation to inspect electric light wirings and fittings. I do not think it would be reasonable to ask the local authority to inspect fittings they had themselves put into a house. The Woolwich local authority became merchants in electrical fittings with a lamentable result. They lost &#x00A3;25,000 straight off; they continued to lose at the rate of &#x00A3;15,000 a year, and the result was that the business was closed. West Ham were also unfortunate. They increased their stock of merchantable articles in connection with this trade from &#x00A3;3,000 to &#x00A3;25,000. As time went on the stock became obsolete and ought to have been written off, but that has not been done. Therefore that is a bad case, too. I do not think the principle of municipal trading is a good
<col>852</col>
one, and if the noble Lord goes to a Division I shall support the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD MONKSWELL </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I cannot allow the statement of the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees as to what happened on the London County Council to pass without comment. I sat on that body for eighteen years and knew as much about the works department as probably the noble Earl. The noble Earl stated that it had been proved that the abolition of the works department had been a good policy because several works had been carried out by contractors under the estimate of the council's officials. I would remind him that the works department constantly did work under the estimate of the council's officials. It is very early for the noble Earl to declare that the new policy has resulted in a saving and, that there will be no rings of contractors. How does the noble Earl know that there will be no rings of contractors? It is not likely that they will be form rings at present, but directly they think the thing is safe and that there is no fear of any resurrection of the works department there will be rings. We formed the works department because we had evidence that there were rings of contractors, and we thought that the only way to fight them was to ourselves do work which we could reasonably do. The noble Earl is not correct when he says that the works department carried out all the work required by the council without the intervention of a contractor. We very often employed contractors, and only went to the works department when we thought we could do the work better that way.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, it seems to me that this Amendment is of such great importance as to warrant its being passed. The Lord Chairman mentioned that it was extremely convenient to be able to hire fittings from the local authority in the event of the local authority supplying the electricity. That may be, but that convenience is a mere flea-bite compared with the importance to the inhabitants of securing that these works are carried on in an economical and proper manner. Where municipalities carry on this trading they have not the same incentive to see that the work is properly done. For these and other obvious reasons I hope your Lordships will accept the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<col>853</col>
<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL </member>: <membercontribution>The object which the Board of Trade had in putting this clause in the Bill was to bring the general law into conformity with what has been the almost invariable practice of Parliament in individual cases. In drawing up this clause we followed as closely as possible the words of the model clauses of your Lordships' House. I will let your Lordships into a little secret. I have already said that this Bill has been for a long time on the stocks at the Board of Trade, and I confess that when these words appeared in the model Bill they also appeared in this Bill, and when they were struck out they were also deleted from this Bill last year. As we have followed the lead of the noble Earl in this matter and only desire to bring the general law into conformity with the model clause, we will accept the advice he has given to the House.<lb/>
On question, Amendment agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD AVEBURY </member>: <membercontribution>I do not think I need trouble your Lordships with the reasons for my next Amendment, because I dealt with them in moving the previous one. The new paragraphs which I move to insert deal with cases in which there may be no contractor immediately available, and I therefore hope the noble Lord will accept them.<lb/>
Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 9, line 11, after the word year,' to insert the following new paragraphs:</quote>
<quote>(d) Nothing in this section shall in cases where within three months after the undertakers have obtained any loan necessary for the purpose of the undertaking there is or are no firm or firms carrying on the business of electrical contractors within the area of supply prevent the undertakers themselves from exercising the powers given by this section without the employment of a contractor.</quote>
<quote>(e) If the undertakers fail to comply with the provisoes (a), (b), and (c) of this section they shall, on conviction under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts be liable to a fine not exceeding ten pounds and to a further fine not exceeding five pounds for each day on which the offence is continued after conviction therefore.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Avebury</i>.)</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW </member>: <membercontribution>Perhaps I may be allowed to say a word with regard to the observations of my noble friend who represents the Board of Trade. It is quite true that the model clause regarding this matter has varied this year and last year, but the reason was that it was found that if a clause exactly similar to the one in the
<col>854</col>
Bill as it has been amended by the Amendment of the noble Lord were put into a Bill promoted by a local authority cases might arise in which there was no contractor who could do the work, and therefore the work could not be done at all. I think that the Bill as amended and as proposed to be now further amended really covers both these points.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY </member>: <membercontribution>I think the noble Lord is to be congratulated on having carried his Amendment to this clause. He will, of course, bring up words defining a "contractor" at the next stage?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD AVEBURY </member>: <membercontribution>Yes.<lb/>
On Question, Amendment agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH </member>: <membercontribution>The only other Amendment stands in my name. It is a different Amendment, though it touches the same point as the one which I moved in Committee. In deference to the view of the Board of Trade I give up any idea of suggesting that they had power to allow electric plant to be laid across a bridge which carries a railway. The Board of Trade say they have no such power. I accept that, and will say nothing more on that point. On the other point, where a road is carried over a railway at the expense of the railway company, it seems to me that the Board of Trade must accept my Amendment. On the former occasion their argument was that as a county bridge was to overcome a natural obstacle it was right that the county should have protection, but that a railway bridge did not stand in the same position because it was constructed to overcome an obstacle for which the railway company was responsible. But the Amendment inserted in Committee on the motion of Lord Clifford of Chudleigh entirely carries away that argument. If the Bill had remained in the state in which it was introduced there would have been some force in the contention of the Board of Trade, but, as the result of the adoption of Lord Clifford's Amendment, the position is now this. Although, just like the county council, the railway company own part of the main road, subject, of course, to the right of traffic, they are not to have the same privilege as the county council is to have under the same circumstances. There cannot be the slightest logical reason,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0452"/>
<col>855</col>
after Lord Clifford's Amendment, for placing railway companies in a different position from county councils. In common fairness they ought to have the same privileges.<lb/>
Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 11, line 22, after the word 'out' to insert the words Wherever a main road is carried over a railway by a bridge maintained by the railway company all the rights powers privileges and exemptions conferred upon county councils and the benefit of all obligations imposed upon the undertakers by this section shall for the purposes of rebuilding altering widening or repairing such bridge be extended to the railway company and may be exercised and enjoyed by them as fully as if the railway company were a county council and the bridge were a bridge repairable by such council.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Balfour of Burleigh</i>.)</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL </member>: <membercontribution>This is certainly a logical extension of the principle to which your Lordships agreed at the last stage. But I objected, on behalf of the Board of Trade, to that proceeding, and I must object still more strongly in this case, because on top of the objections which we had to giving this immunity in the case of county roads, there is also the objection which I urged against railway companies to which the noble Lord has already alluded. I cannot allow that railway companies' bridges are on the same footing as county council bridges. As I say, we cannot accept this Amendment, but as we have already had a Division on almost the same subject I do not propose, at this late hour, to put the House to the trouble of dividing.<lb/>

<title>THE ARMY AND THE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE.</title>
<p><member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War&#x2014;(1) What is the total (a) combatant (b) non-combatant establishment of the Expeditionary Force; what number of officers and men of the Regular Army at present available will be included in this force; (2) what number of officers and men will be drawn from the Special Reserve (a) combatant (b) non-combatant; (3)
<col>856</col>
what number of men, if any, will be sent abroad under twenty years of age; (4) what number of officers and men over twenty years of ago at present on the strength of the Regular Army will remain in this country to replace the wastage of war after the Expeditionary Force has left (a) combatant (b) non-combatant; (5) what force could be mobilised at home of men of not less than one year's service after the Expeditionary Force has been despatched, dividing (a) Regulars from (b) Special Reserve, as the existing strength of these Forces.<lb/>
In putting these questions on the Paper I did not think that I was asking for information the publication of which could possibly be considered inconsistent with national interests. I was, therefore, somewhat surprised to receive a communication from the noble Lord stating that he could not answer my questions in public, but would do so confidentially. I trust, however, that the noble Lord will be able to give us some of the information for which we ask, or tell us the reasons why he cannot do so.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the Questions which the noble Viscount has placed on the Paper have been considered most carefully, and it has been decided that in so far as the answers to the Questions reveal to a certain extent our mobilisation plans it is impossible for us to give the answers in public. In adopting that position, we are doing only what is done by every country&#x2014;for no country reveals in public their mobilisation plans&#x2014;and it is, I believe, strictly according to the precedents in this country. But I would like to repeat what I said a few days ago, that we do not in the least wish to conceal what the position of the Regular Army is with regard to mobilisation. Although it is not in the public interest to make these figures public, if the noble Viscount will do us the honour of visiting the War Office I will endeavour to satisfy him to the fullest degree. I extend that invitation also to the noble Viscount on the Front Bench opposite (Lord Midleton), who has always taken great interest in this question, and to other noble Lords. We are not afraid to show the figures We are perfectly ready and anxious to satisfy noble Lords, as I believe we can, on this matter, but we cannot, I regret to say, make the information public.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0453"/>
<col>857</col>
<p><member>LORD NEWTON </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I hope that my noble friend is not going to be contented with the extraordinary answer which he has just elicited. We are to understand this from the noble Lord, that in the interests of the public it is not desirable that this information should be disclosed, but that if anybody here, however ignorant or however inquisitive he may be, chooses to take the trouble to go to the War Office he will be supplied with these particulars. I know this old dodge. The excuse of "public interest" is always put forward when there is something the Government wish to keep back. If the noble Lord had a million men up his sleeve and could produce them at a moment's notice there would be some reason for adopting this attitude. Considering that his chief has been going up and down the country boasting and bragging that the military position of this country is better now than it has ever been, and that we possess a finer Expeditionary Force not only than we have ever had before but than any other country has got, we are entitled to the information asked for. I do not know what my noble and gallant friend proposes to do, but I know that if I were in his place I should keep on pressing for an answer until I eventually succeeded in getting a public statement from the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON </member>: <membercontribution>I am quite certain that the noble Lord desires to give us all the information which he thinks can legitimately be given in the public interest, but I must remind your Lordships that we have been placed in a most unconscionably difficult position in this matter. Actually at this moment we have before us a Return which had to do with the first of January and which was so long under consideration at the War Office that it was only produced to your Lordships just before the Easter recess and a few days after the discussions in the House of Commons on the Estimates had ceased. Therefore we were unable to take advantage of the facts with which we were favoured for any discussion in the House of Commons. Now, when my noble friend brings the matter before your Lordships by Questions we are told that it is contrary to the public interest to give the facts necessary to elucidate these very unsatisfactory papers. Is there a single one of these facts which is not to be found in War Office documents if it were in our power to collate them? The total num
<col>858</col>
bers, combatant and non-combatant, have been given over and over again, as also have the number of officers and men to be drawn from the Special Reserve. But what we want to know is the practical strength on which we are working. Then, again, the numbers over-twenty years of age who will remain in this country to replace the wastage of war can be established from War Office figures which have been laid. But there is and always will be very great doubt as regards the actual numbers, and I do not think much would be gained by our forming an estimate and throwing it across the Table at the noble Lord to be told that the estimate was incorrect. What we wish to arrive at is the number remaining in this country on the present strength, not establishment, after the Expeditionary Force has sailed, and the military value of that force. It is unworthy of the Secretary of State at every public meeting he attends, to throw at us the challenges alluded to by Lord Newton, and then to refuse information to make good his boast. It is, too late to-night to attempt to go into all the points, but I would say this, that when the noble Lord appeals to precedent he should cite precedent. I will give two precedents which occur to me on the spur of the moment. I heard Lord Lansdowne when he was Secretary of State for War state, in the middle of the South African War, in answer to a Question in your Lordships' House, exactly the number of Regular troops which then remained in the country after we had sent out I forget what number. That was at a moment of crisis. I myself, as Secretary of State for War, was asked for in 1902, and I laid on the Table of the House of Commons, the establishment, the strength, and the ages of the whole of the troops forming the three Army Corps which we proposed to send out, together with the numbers here in this country and every detail from which such figures could be made out. Therefore I hope that the noble Viscount will put these Questions again in some pertinent form, and the noble Lord must not complan if we endeavour, by whatever means are left to us since we have not the handling of the Estimates in this House, to obtain what is to us important information&#x2014;namely, the military value of the force which will remain in this country after the Expeditionary Force has left&#x2014;and for which we have every right to ask.</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>LORD LUCAS </member>: <membercontribution>The Questions on the Paper go a good deal further than merely an interrogation arising out of statements made by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State in any of his speeches. To answer the Questions in full would be to reveal to a great extent our mobilisation plans, and I adhere to my statement that there is no precedent for that. I do not in the least admit that there is any analogy between the two cases quoted by the noble Viscount on the Front Bench opposite and the revealing of our mobilisation plans. With regard to the views expressed by Lord Newton, I can only say that had the noble Lord studied more carefully before he made those remarks what the invariable policy of all Governments has been with regard to mobilisation plans he would not have spoken as he did.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON </member>: <membercontribution>What precedent can the noble Lord cite for the refusal of the information asked for which is not mobilisation information?</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</member>: <membercontribution>I beg the noble Lord's pardon. From a private communication I understood that the noble Lord did not propose to move his Amendment at this stage.</membercontribution></p>

<p>Order of the Day for the Third Reading read.</p>
<p><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, in moving the Third Reading of
<col>864</col>
this Bill I think I ought to allude to a circumstance which arose on the last stage. Your Lordships will recollect that the Lord Chairman proved an Amendment to Clause 5, and that the noble Marquess opposite&#x2014;Lord Salisbury&#x2014;in saying that he thought Lord Onslow's Amendment might be withdrawn, asked for an undertaking from me that the Board of Trade would pursue a certain course. As I said at the time, the matter had not arisen before I came to the House, and not having plenipotentiary powers I was unable to deal with it. But since then I have consulted my right hon. friend, and I am authorised to say, on behalf of the Board of Trade, that in the case of any applications being made to them under subsection (1) of Clause 5 they will carefully consider all the circumstances of the case before giving their consent, and in particular will endeavour to prevent any extravagant speculation on the part of local authorities which might injuriously affect the interests of ratepayers or consumers of electricity within their district. I hope that will meet the point raised by the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>
<p>Moved, That the Bill be now read 3<sup>a</sup>&#x2014;(<i>Lord Hamilton of Dalzell.</i>)</p>
<p><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF ONSLOW)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, as far as local authorities are concerned the statement which the noble Lord has just made is perfectly satisfactory; but I would like to point out that the clause authorises any undertaker, whether local company or private company. Now a private company might obtain powers to supply a village with electricity while all the time it might have the intention at the back of its mind, or it might even possess a contract in its pocket, to supply a great railway company with electricity for the whole course of the line. It is in regard to that sort of thing that we require the Board of Trade to exercise vigilance. It is just as necessary to keep a vigilant eye upon private undertakers as it is upon local authorities, and I hope the noble Lord will convey this fact to the officials of the Board of Trade. So far as my Department are concerned, we are anxious to see that private companies or even individuals do not get extensive powers granted to them by the Board of Trade for purposes which, perhaps, would not be-sanctioned if the extent to which they
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0457"/>
<col>865</col>
intended to make use of the powers were known.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I desire to express, on my own behalf, thanks to the noble Lord for the courteous way in which he has followed the suggestion I ventured to make on the last stage of the Bill. I am bound to say that I was more interested in the question of restraining undue zeal on the part of a local authority than of a private company, but no doubt what my noble friend who has just sat down has said is true, that it is advisable that the Board of Trade should exercise vigilance in the case of a private undertaker just as in the case of a public undertaker. I think I speak on behalf of many noble Lords who sit on this side of the House when I say that we were specially interested on the last occasion in preventing undue speculation on the part of local authorities by which the ratepayers' credit and the ratepayers' money might be prejudiced; and we desired, therefore, to have a formal assurance on the part of the President of the Board of Trade that the Board would exercise great vigilance in the matter. I am much obliged to the noble Lord for the statement he has made.</membercontribution></p>
<p>On Question, Bill read 3<sup>a</sup>.</p>
<p><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am sure your Lordships will hear with regret that the noble Lord in whose name an Amendment stands on the Paper and who has taken great interest in this Bill (Lord Avebury), is prevented from being present this evening owing to sudden family bereavement. I am not, of course, responsible for the Amendment which the noble Lord has drafted, but inasmuch as it was framed to meet some objections which I took to the undefined nature of the word "contractor," and, I think, to a great extent does so, I have pleasure, in the absence of the noble Lord, in moving his Amendment, and I hope His Majesty's Government will agree to it.<lb/>
Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In Clause 24, page 13, line 18, after the word 'places,' to insert the words 'The expression
<col>866</col>

<p><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I should like to join with the noble Earl in expressing regret at the cause which prevents the noble Lord in whose name this Amendment stands from being in his place to-day.

We all hope that he will not be long kept away from our deliberations. As regards the Whitsuntide recess, it is common knowledge, I think, that we may be kept somewhat later in the year than we were last year, and in those circumstances we may fairly claim, and I think it would be in consonance with the general sense of the House to suggest, a somewhat longer adjournment than usual at Whitsuntide. Therefore, if your Lordships agree, we should propose that the House should adjourn after its sitting on Thursday, May 27, and that it should meet again on Wednesday, June 23.</membercontribution></p>

<p>Order of the Day for the House to be put into Committee, read.</p>
<p>Moved, That the House do now resolve itself into Committee.&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Hardinge.</i>)</p>
<p><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, if it is not inconvenient to His Majesty's Government it would enlighten the House if the noble Earl in charge of the Government Bill&#x2014;Hops (No. 2) Bill [H. L.]&#x2014;which I see was introduced in your Lordships' House yesterday and read a first time would tell us whether its contents have any bearing on the point of controversy likely to be raised between myself and the noble Viscount in charge of the Bill now before us.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Lord for giving me an opportunity of saying a word. The Government Bill which was introduced last night, and which will be in your Lordships' hands in a few days, is more or less the same
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0459"/>
<col>869</col>
Bill as was brought forward last year. Perhaps it would be convenient that I should say a word as to the course that we propose to take with reference to the Bill down for Committee to-day. I am sure the noble Viscount in charge of the Bill will acquit me and my colleagues of any want of courtesy in the matter, but I think it as well to state why it is that we do not propose to take any part in the consideration of his Bill in Committee this afternoon. The House will remember that the Government expressed great sympathy with the undoubted difficulties of the hop-growers under present circumstances, and they appointed a Select Committee in February of last year. It was a very strong Committee, of which Sir William Collins was chairman. The Committee reported in the following July, aid in December last the Chancellor of the Exchequer introduced a Bill in another place to give effect to the recommendations of the Committee. That Bill, which was introduced, as your Lordships will remember, at the fag end of the session, was certainly more contentiously received than had been expected, and there was not sufficient time to reconcile the differences that arose. On February 26 of this year, with the approval of my colleagues, I stated, at a very large meeting of tenant farmers at Canterbury, that&#x2014;
<quote>"If no unreasonable expenditure of Parliamentary time was required, the Government would reintroduce the Bill this session, as they were still of opinion that the grievance was a real one and one which called urgently for redress."</quote>
Notwithstanding that promise the noble Viscount&#x2014;I do not in any way complain of it&#x2014;introduced this Bill in your Lordships' House six day afterwards, and it was given a Second Reading on March 31, when my noble friends Lord Beauchamp and Lord Fitzmaurice, on behalf of the Government, confirmed my Canterbury pledge. Owing to having been, unfortunately, in the grip of the influenza fiend, I had been unable to carry out this pledge until yesterday, when the Government Bill was introduced and read a first time in your Lordships' House. Though, of course, the noble Viscount's Bill could get through this House without much difficulty, there is such a place as the House of Commons, and in the present state of business and in view of the period of the session I honestly think it would have very little chance, as a private member's Bill, of getting through the other House. Moreover, I think the House will agree that
<col>870</col>
 the Government could hardly be expected to thrash out to-day the details of this Bill when their own Bill has not been read a second time. I hope, however, that I may be permitted to congratulate the noble Viscount on the recognition that his efforts have received from the various agricultural associations, and I venture to express an earnest hope that that may be a happy augury for a favourable reception of the Government's Bill when it comes up for Second Reading. I have to thank the House for permitting me at his stage to state the intentions of His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CAWDOR</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am bound to say that I listened with some astonishment to the statement of the noble Earl. But may I first congratulate him upon his return to your Lordships' House? We are all glad to see him back again restored to good health. With regard to this Bill, it was only the other day that we read it a second time, and the noble Earl the Lord Steward, speaking on behalf of the Government on that occasion, said that the Bill was one on which we were all agreed. There was nothing, I think he said, with which he need deal at that stage, because the only points at issue were points which might be dealt with in Committee. We were, said the noble Earl, all agreed and working on the same lines. Now no one would have gathered from that statement that when the time came for going into Committee and dealing with those points His Majesty's Government would decline to take any action on the Bill. I think it is a most extraordinary proceeding, and at the present moment I do not understand the reason for it. The only reason, apparently, is that the Government as late as yesterday took the First Reading of a Bill which is not in print and of the contents of which your Lordships are ignorant. The noble Earl told us that his Bill is more or less the same as the Bill of last year. If the noble Earl could have told us in what way it was more and in what way it was less than the Bill of last year he would have been giving us some information. But we are in this peculiar position, that we are dealing with a Bill the Second Reading of which was agreed to by His Majesty's Government, whose spokesman stated that it was a Bill which only required some slight amendment in Committee in order to make it acceptable to His Majesty's Govern
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0460"/>
<col>871</col>
ment, and yet we are told that His Majesty's Government are going to take no part whatever in the discussion in Committee of this Bill. I think we have some reason to complain of the attitude taken by His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am very sorry if the noble Viscount thought that we had shown any want of consideration to him, but I imagine that we are all agreed in desiring that a measure should be got through your Lordships' House in the best form, and that it should at a favourable time go down to another place for consideration. I think, perhaps, we do owe the noble Viscount a certain degree of apology for the course which has been taken, but it has really been due to the fact that my noble friend in whose charge this subject is has been absent from the House through illness. The most reasonable and convenient course, I think, would have been for both Bills to proceed <i>pari passu</i>; at any rate, that one should not be considered until both had been seen. I do not know whether the noble Viscount would now be willing to postpone the Committee stage of his Bill until he has seen ours; but I should like it to be clearly understood that my noble friend behind me did not mean that we should ostentatiously hold aloof from the consideration of this Bill, but that it seemed to him&#x2014;and I think your Lordships will agree&#x2014;that we could not to-day usefully develop our own proposals, whatever they may be, and I confess I have not seen the Bill and do not know what they are or in what respect they differ from those of the noble Viscount. I therefore think it would be more convenient to wait until our Bill is before the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member>: <membercontribution>I do not quite know in what position we find, ourselves. It seems to me that the utterances of the two noble Lords who have spoken from the Government Bench were couched in very different language. The noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture seemed to wish to convey to your Lordships that His Majesty's Government did not intend to take any part in the proceedings. Now we understand from the noble Earl the Leader of the House that that was not his intention at all, and that all that His Majesty's
<col>872</col>
Government ask is that the noble Viscount would be willing to postpone the consideration of his Bill in Committee until your Lordships have seen the Bill which the Government have laid upon the Table, but which, apparently, has not been circulated to other members of the Government, and of which the noble Earl the Leader of the House confesses himself to be as ignorant as we are on this side. It struck me when I heard the statement of the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture that there was, if I may say so, a somewhat undignified competition for the credit of the introduction of a Hops Bill, and that His Majesty's Government were rather sore with the noble Viscount who comes from Kent because he had run away with their clothes while they were bathing. However, if His Majesty's Government really do desire that your Lordships should consider both Bills together and are not entering into competition to show that Codlin is the friend and not Short, I have no doubt my noble friend would be prepared to consider any representation made from so important a member of the Government as the noble Earl the Leader of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, personally I would much prefer to proceed with my Bill. The hop industry is more or less on its last legs, and it is important that something should be done without delay to help it. But I am perfectly willing to do exactly what the Leader on this side of the House desires me to do in the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member>: <membercontribution>It is clear that your Lordships have been taken by surprise by the action of His Majesty's Government, and it appears that a most important member of His Majesty's Government has also been taken by surprise&#x2014;I refer to the noble Earl the Leader of the House. Your Lordships have assembled this afternoon in the expectation that you would have to consider a Hops Bill, and I confess I should hardly like to suggest that we should delay our proceedings because at the very last moment the Government have taken a different view. I do not understand that the noble Earl who leads the House definitely desires us to postpone this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member>: <membercontribution>The
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0461"/>
<col>873</col>
noble Earl is quite content that we should proceed with it, and as we are assembled to deal with this Bill in Committee I, for my part, see no reason why we should not go on. If my noble friend thought it well after this stage to wait until we were in possession of the Government Bill before proceeding further that might be a reasonable course, but at the very last moment, when we have assembled for one particular object, to postpone the proceedings would, I think, scarcely be treating your Lordships' House with respect.<lb/>
On Question, Motion agreed to.<lb/>
House in Committee accordingly.</membercontribution></p>
<p>[THE EARL OF ONSLOW in the CHAIR.]</p>
<p>Clause 1:</p>
<p><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> had a number of Amendments on the Paper to Clause 1, which ran&#x2014;</p>
<p>"1.&#x2014;(1) A brewer for side shall not use any hop substitute in the brewing or preservation of beer and shall not receive or have in his custody or possession on any entered premises any beer containing any hop substitute or in the brewing or preservation of which any hop substitute has been used or (except for domestic use the proof whereof shall lie on him) my hop substitute.</p>
<p>(2) If any brewer for sale uses any hop substitute in the brewing or preservation of beer or receives or has in his custody or possession any article in contravention of this section he shall incur an Excise penalty of one hundred pounds and the article shall be forfeited.</p>
<p>(3) For the purposes of this section&#x2014;</p>
<p>The expression 'hop substitute' means any article substance or preservative other than hops capable of being used in the brewing or preservation of beer and includes any preparation of hops the use of which in brewing has not been previously sanctioned by the Commissioners for the time being having the management of the duties of Excise;</p>
<p>The expression 'beer' includes ale porter stout and any other description of beer and any liquor which is made or sold as a description of beer or as a substitute for beer and which on analysis of a sample thereof at any time is found to contain more than two per cent. of proof spirit;</p>
<p>The expression 'brewer for sale' has the meaning assigned to it by section nineteen of the Inland Revenue Act 1880."</p>
<p>The Amendments were to omit the words "or preservation" in each case where they appeared. The noble Lord moved, first, to leave out the words "or preservation" from the second line of the clause, and intimated that the decision of the Committee on this Amendment would rule the others standing in his name. The main
<col>874</col>
part of his case was that this Amendment was necessary to bring the noble Viscount's Bill into harmony with the Report of the Select Committee to which the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture had referred. No one denied that the hop industry was, in some respects, passing through a period of depression. That was frankly acknowledged in the Report of the Select Committee. That Committee went very thoroughly into the whole question, and made in its Report what he would venture to describe as a most masterly survey of the whole conditions affecting this industry. They proved, he thought to the satisfaction of any impartial person, that the main reason why the hop-growing industry was suffering depression was that the demand for hops had declined, while the supply, if. it had not increased, had not diminished at the same pace as the demand. Therefore, what was not unnatural in the circumstances, the price of the commodity had fallen. There was no doubt whatever, from the facts marshalled in the Report of the Select Committee, that less beer was being brewed, and that per barrel of beer less hops were being used.</p>
<p>Now came the point of controversy raised by his Amendment. No one denied, least of all did he or the Select Committee, that where substitutes of an improper or of a deleterious nature were used in place of hops, they ought, in the public interest, to be prohibited. There was no controversy on that point. The point of controversy appeared to be whether what were called preservatives and not substitutes should be regarded as so nearly substitutes that, along with other substitutes for hops, they ought to be prohibited. As he was informed, the chief reason why fewer hops were used was that a change had taken place in the public taste. That was strongly supported by the evidence before the Select Committee, whose Report contained this paragraph&#x2014;
<quote>"It is stated that the public taste demands a lighter, brighter, and therefore less heavily hopped beer than was formerly consumed; the substitution of glass vessels for pewter in the retail trade is said to have contributed to this result. The more aseptic methods of brewing adopted nowadays, and the practice of brewing beer for speedy consumption, have also rendered the use of hops for their preservative and antiseptic properties less necessary."</quote>
This Bill proposed to include, and to treat as substitutes, certain articles which the brewers said they used and valued not for
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0462"/>
<col>875</col>
their substituting properties but for their antiseptic effect upon beer. They were not, therefore, substitutes in the strict sense of the term.</p>
<p>He believed the case for the hop-growers was this&#x2014;and he wished to state the case as fairly as he could without raising the slightest unnecessary controversy&#x2014;that, if used in sufficient quantities, hops, from their preservative qualities, would have the same effect as the other preservatives used by brewers. But in answer to that the brewers said that if they had to use hops in the quantity suggested by the hop-growers they would spoil their beer for the public taste, that the beer would not be so effectively preserved, and that it was an unfortunate circumstance that, so far as the preservative qualities of hops were concerned, foreign hops were better than English hops; and therefore, even if this Bill were to pass as it stood, it would not have the effect claimed by its promoters. No one, he thought, would deny that brewers were at least as likely to know the truth of the matter in their own interests as agriculturists; and they could quote not only the Report of the Select Committee which sat last year but also the Majority Report of the Beer Materials Committee which sat some ten years ago, and which, speaking of these preservatives, stated that&#x2014;
<quote>"None are used which are positively deleterious. There may be doubt, as to certain preservatives, whether they increase the wholesomeness of the beer or otherwise. But the importance of soundness in beer from the health point of view is so great that it would be most unwise to prohibit or discourage the use of preservatives generally. If it should be established that any particular preservative is objectionable we may trust to the vigilance of the Inland Revenue authorities, who have full power to prohibit the use of noxious or deleterious materials."</quote>
Unless it could be alleged that the articles used were in any way deleterious to the public interest it was unfair, even for the sake of doing a kindness to the growers of hops, to prohibit their use. There was no evidence whatever from anybody except those interested in the sale of hops that these articles were in any way deleterious; and his suggestion to their Lordships was that, however much one might sympathise with the unfortunate circumstances through which hop-growers were passing, it was not in accordance with sound practice or with good policy to dictate to those engaged in the manufac
<col>876</col>
ture of any article what materials they should use, unless it could be shown that the articles used were contrary to the public interest.</p>
<p>No one more regretted than himself the absence of the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne. They were glad to know that the cause of his absence was likely to pass away, and that they would very soon see him in his accustomed place. He was confident that if the noble Marquess had been present he would have seen the point at issue, because it was perfectly clear that it was already more or less present to his mind when he made his speech on the Second Reading. On that occasion the noble Marquess said&#x2014;
<quote>"I confess that, in regard to the inclusion of preservatives&#x2014;a point on which the Bill of my noble friend differs from the Bill of His Majesty's Government&#x2014;I should like to hear a little more evidence before I commit myself to any definite view."</quote>
If the Amendment which he now begged to move, together with the others standing in his name on the Paper, were inserted it would bring the Bill back to the form of the Bill introduced by the Government in another place last year. That might or might not be regarded by the noble Viscount as a point in favour of the Amendment, but the real object which he had was to do what seemed right in the interests of everybody concerned; and they had behind them for that action not only the opinions of His Majesty's Government last year but the authority of the two Committees of the other House&#x2014;the one which sat in 1908 and the one which sat in 1899.</p>
<p>Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 1, line<ob/>6, to leave out the words `or preservation.'" </quote>&#x2014;(<i>Lord Balfour of Burleigh.</i>)</p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member> <membercontribution>opposed the Amendment. He did so for this reason, that any attempt to differentiate between hop substitutes and chemical preservatives was, to endeavour to assert that chemical preservatives were not hop substitutes, whereas every one knew that chemical preservatives were the principal substitute for hops in the man<ob/>uacture and preservation of beer. The large reduction in the quantity of hops consumed per barrel of beer was, he contended, mainly due to the use of chemical preservatives. How large
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0463"/>
<col>877</col>
that reduction was it was difficult to estimate, for, as he stated on Second Reading, no Government Returns were kept with regard to this matter prior to 1901, which date, no doubt, was subsequent to the commencement of the reduction of the proportionate quantity of hops consumed. In 1901 the consumption of hops per barrel was 2&#x00B7;02 lbs., whilst in 1907 it had fallen to 1&#x00B7;85 lbs. per barrel. Those who felt so strongly the necessity of passing this Bill into law attributed the decreasing use of hops to the increasing use of chemical preservatives, and it was to the same cause that they attributed the decreasing popularity of beer as the national beverage and the consequent comparative depression in the brewing industry.</membercontribution></p>
<p>A large proportion of the British public naturally imagined teat what was intended by beer was a beverage brewed from malt and hops, and he maintained that it was the duty of that House to see that the consumer obtained the article for which he asked and paid. The advertisement columns of all the brewing trade papers clearly indicated the enormous amount of chemical preservatives used by brewers in brewing, and one could only wonder what an outcry there would be throughout the country if it were discovered that there was a similar traffic in chemical preservatives by dairy farmers. If any of our farmers were discovered using chemical preservatives in milk they would at once be prosecuted by the Local Government Board. Why should there be one law for the brewers and another for the farmers? If the use of chemical preservatives in milk was an offence against the law of the country, surely it ought to be equally wrong to add chemicals to a beverage so universally consumed as beer.</p>
<p>He claimed that the use of chemical preservatives in beer should be prohibited for three reasons. First, for the protection of the consumer, who imagined that when he asked for beer he was going to be supplied with a beverage brewed from malt and hops, and who was just as much entitled to receive that which he asked for as any other consumer who purchased an article such as, for instance, butter. Secondly, on the ground of public health, for if chemical preservatives in milk were injurious to health and undesirable, surely their use should be equally undesirable in beer. Thirdly, on the ground that all
<col>878</col>
preservatives used in beer were the most important of all hop substitutes; and it had already been decided, both by the Select Committee and by their Lordships in passing the Second Reading of this Bill, that the use of all substitutes for hops should be prohibited. The attempt to allow brewers to use chemical preservatives would, if successful, make the hop-grower purely a flavourer of beer instead of, as in the past, the flavourer and preserver of beer.</p>
<p>If chemicals were allowed to take the place of hops one of the very, foundations of the hop industry would be removed. Therefore, if they were content to stand by and see this great industry practically destroyed they would be driving more and more people away from the land; whilst if, on the other hand, they did their best to resuscitate the hop industry they would be furthering the movement of bringing the people back to the land. At the same time. by stamping beer with the Government hall-mark of purity they would be rendering a great service to the brewing interest. Beer would be brought back into popular favour, and the pernicious and growing habit of dram drinking among the working-classes would be checked. It was in the best interests of all concerned that the popular drink of the British public should be a good sound malt liquor, bittered and preserved by hops and absolutely devoid of chemicals and minerals, such as was brewed and consumed in Bavaria. Bavarian beer, though made from hops, was the lightest beer brewed, and this was the answer to the contention of the brewers that the exclusive use of hops would make beer too heavy. One witness, in giving evidence before the Select Committee on the Hop Industry&#x2014;Q. 4857&#x2014;declared that&#x2014;
<quote>"Hops do not give weight to beer or colour to beer; it is the malt that gives the gravity and colour to beer."</quote>
In the interests of agriculture and of all the trades allied to the hop industry&#x2014;and there were many hundreds &#x2014;he appealed to their Lordships not to mutilate the Bill but to reject the Amendment.</p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CRANBROOK</member>, <membercontribution>while hoping that the Committee would not pass the Amendment, did not think that the Bill would be of very much advantage to the hop industry, the present position of which was such that much stronger
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0464"/>
<col>879</col>
measures would be needed to set it on its legs again. If people were to be allowed to put anything into the beer that they liked to call preservatives things would be introduced simply for the sake of their cheapness and not for the advantage of the public. It had been stated that beer could not be preserved with hops without destroying its flavour. He remembered that when he was a boy at Eton sixty years ago he used to think Bass's pale ale was the best ale to be got in the kingdom, and that ale was brewed exclusively from malt and hops. Preservatives first began to be used in the early seventies, when there was a disastrous crop of hops in Kent. Brewers then found that they could get cheaper materials than hops, and from that time the use of hops had decreased. As to the argument that this decrease was due to the public taste requiring a lighter beer, he pointed out that some of the brightest beer in the world was brewed in Bavaria, where nothing but malt and hops was allowed to be used. He knew a firm in Maidstone which had no tied houses, and yet carried on an enormous trade, their beer, brewed from malt and hops, being more popular and lighter than any beer produced in the county. Their Lordships were told that they should not interfere with the brewers and their trade. He admitted that the brewers were in a very difficult position between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the consumer, or, in the words of the old proverb, "between the devil and the deep sea." Would it not be better for them to face all their difficulties at once, and while raising their price to the consumer to say they were going to raise the quality as well and give the consumer good malt and hops? Such a course would place the brewers in a much stronger position before the country. and would give gratification both to themselves and the consumers of beer. The noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture was constantly pointing out the importance of getting small-holders on the land. They were trying to do that in the county of Kent. In Germany a very large proportion of the hops was grown on land in the occupation of small-holders. He was a strong believer in the lucrative nature of hop-growing by small-holders who could do all the work on the land themselves, and he believed hops could be largely grown by small-holders in the county of Kent. He hoped their Lordships would reject the
<col>880</col>
Amendment, and in that way do something to facilitate placing small-holders in a favourable position in this matter, and not impede their sale of hops to the brewers by allowing in brewing adulteration which was not allowed in any other trade.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HARRIS</member> <membercontribution>hoped the Committee would not accept the Amendment. It seemed to him that the proposition advanced by Lord Balfour was a very dangerous one&#x2014;namely, that provided an article was not deleterious to the public it might be utilised apparently in any quantity in a manufactured article. Surely nobody would contend&#x2014;he did not think the noble Lord him, elf would contend&#x2014;that the public when ordering beer expected to get a composition of sugar and kalium metasulphite or salicylic and boracic acids. When they ordered beer they expected to get malt and hops. The Select Committee had clearly stated that hops were used to preserve beer. It was a tradition in this country, and up to a certain date it was founded on fact, that beer was brewed from malt and hops. The Select Committee of 1899 also stated that hops were used to preserve beer. Lord Balfour, in moving his Amendment, had made some extraordinary statements. One was that foreign hops were better than English hops. They knew where that statement came from. It came from Mr. Gretton.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member>: <membercontribution>That was not what I said.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HARRIS </member>: <membercontribution>Perhaps the noble Lord will repeat what he said.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> <membercontribution>said that what he stated was that it was borne out by some parts of the evidence given before the Select Committee that, so far as their purely preservative qualities were concerned, some foreign hops were more preservative than English.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HARRIS</member> <membercontribution>did not think the noble Lord used the word "some" when he made his statement. It was quite true that there were some American and Bavarian hops which were actually better than the English for their preservative qualities, but they were grown in a very limited area; their quantity was very limited, and their price high; but for the bulk of the supply for the manufacture of beer in this country the English hop was,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0465"/>
<col>881</col>
and always had been, the best. For many decades in the last century it was the law that nothing but hops should be used as a preservative. The Act of 1816 laid down that any article or preparation used as a substitute for malt or hops could. be seized, and the brewer and retailer fined &#x00A3;200. That was the law for, he thought, seventy or eighty years until the free mash-tun was introduced. Since then preservatives had been used. He could quite understand that, from the brewer's point of view, it was a convenient exchange, as chemical preservatives were cheaper and could be handled more easily. But in giving up the use of hops brewers gave up
something which improved the aroma of beer and made it a much more popular article than it was at present. On those grounds, he submitted that there was sound argument for the contention that the Bill should contain the provision which Lord Balfour sought to delete.<lb/>
The calculation was that if about a &#x00Bc; lb. of preservative were used per barrel, it meant the total displacement of something like 78,000 cwt. of hops. That was quite a fair amount in the market sales of the year; and, having regard to the serious displacement that was taking place in the hop-growing counties as regarded labour, he trusted that the noble Earl who would be presently in charge of the Government Bill would take into serious consideration whether his Bill ought not to include this provision. He admitted that the Government were in an impartial position, because from their Budget proposals it appeared to be their desire to crush both the cultivator of hops and the producer of beer; but he suggested that if they wished to help the small cultivator and labourer as distinct from the farmer and the landowner they could do nothing better than to encourage the growth of hops. At the present moment cottages in the hop-growing districts were becoming vacant in large numbers, and families were being driven elsewhere, possibly into the towns; and, in addition, the urban population who secured healthful employment for a month or six weeks in the country each year hop-picking were finding this occupation going. On all the grounds he had stated, he appealed to their Lordships not to accept the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ADDINGTON</member> <membercontribution>failed to see any reason why England should be behind
<col>882</col>
Bavaria in this matter. An official publication dealing with the common rules concerning the statutes and customs of the Principality of Upper and Lower Bavaria, and bearing the date of 1516, contained this enactment&#x2014;
<quote>"Wheresoever in our towns, markets and rural districts, it is forbidden to employ other material beyond barley, hops, and water for the making of beer."</quote>
This was renewed in an Ordinance of Beer dated 1616. This law was reaffirmed by an Ordinance of April 25, 1811, and by the law of November 10, 1861, which was still in force. Then there was the law of May 16, 1868, which, in Article 7, after repeating that beer should be made only of hops, malt, and water, added that it was especially forbidden to use barley that had not been converted into malt, or that was mixed, partly barley, partly malt. Then, again, the Select Committee of last year came to the conclusion that no substances having at once the aromatic flavour and preservative qualities of hops were known to science. It was, therefore, ridiculous to say that Parliament could not insist upon hops only being used for this purpose.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member>, <membercontribution>in reply, expressed the hope that some information would be vouchsafed by the Government as to whether or not their Bill dealt with this point. He thought the Committee were entitled to some guidance from the Government on this matter. Lord Hardinge had stated that the figures showed that the amount of hops per barrel had greatly diminished. Nobody denied that. His suggestion, in answer to that statement, was that it was not <i>ad rein</i>. According to those who instructed him (Lord Balfour), the diminution in the amount of hops used was largely owing to a change of taste on the part of the public, who preferred a beer brewed with less hops. He did not for a moment think that that would be agreed to by persons engaged in the hop industry, but that was the opinion of those who brewed the beer, and they were entitled to have an opinion of their own.<lb/>
The question of preservatives in other articles, notably in milk, had been mentioned. He ventured to suggest that those articles stood on a different footing. Milk, after all, was not, or ought not to be, a manufactured article. The moment a preservative partook of the nature of
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0466"/>
<col>883</col>
adulteration, or was contrary to public health, or was used in undue quantities it ought to be prohibited, whether the preservative was used in milk, beer, or anything else. But it was obvious that there was a wide difference between the use of preservatives in beer and their use in an article which ought to be sold absolutely pure if they were used in any sense more than was necessary to keep the article in its pristine state until it reached the consumer. If preservatives in milk were used so as to enable the owner to delay its consumption until its constitution was changed by processes of decay, that, of course, was contrary to the public interest. If it could be proved, or even suggested, that the articles which were called preservatives by the brewers were used for any purpose of that kind he would be the last to support the practice. It was no use to say that hops were preservatives, and therefore should be the only preservative used. The point on the part of those whom he was for the moment representing was that there were other articles which were not only in themselves absolutely harmless, but were better preservatives and were more agreeable to the public taste than hops.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Lords, Lord Cranbrook and Lord Harris </member>, <membercontribution>speaking for the hop-growing section of agriculture, touched more nearly the real reasons behind this proposal. Those reasons were stated very clearly in a paper which he received the previous day from the Hopgrowers', Labourers', Pickers', and Allied Industries Defence League. That body put forward the statement that in the demand that the use of all hop substitutes, including preservatives, should be prohibited, the hop industry was supported by practically the whole of the organised bodies representing agriculture. They added that the Bill had also the warm support of very numerous and very large industries closely allied with the interests of the hop-growing section of agriculture, and that it was difficult for those not connected with hop-growing to appreciate how large and varied were the industries implicated. In its essence, their case was a plea for protection. Their Lordships were not dealing with a demand for a 40<i>s</i>. or 50<i>s</i>. duty per cwt. on foreign hops, but at the back of the minds of many noble Lords who were opposing his Amendment was the view that the Bill
<col>884</col>
as it stood would, in essence, be a measure of Protection. He hoped the Committee would accept his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD HENEAGE</member> <membercontribution>protested against the last statement of the noble Lord, and said that the measure was in no respect Protectionist in character. He had been connected in earlier years with members in the House of Commons who year after year brought in a Pure Beer Bill, and all those hon. members were Free Traders. He was not a Tariff Reformer, but was not such a hide-bound Free Trader that he could not see some value in a commonsense Bill like this. Without going again into all the questions dealt with by his noble friends behind him, he could see another reason why the Amendment should not be accepted. If their Lordships accepted the Amendment they would be reversing all that had been done in accepting the Second Reading of the Bill. In agreeing to the Second Reading I heir Lordships had accepted the principle of pure beer, but Lord Balfour's Amendment would, if adopted, make the Bill useless as a pure beer measure. Therefore he hoped, not only on the merits of the hop question itself, but in order to be consistent with their own action when they read the Bill a second time, their Lordships would reject the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member> <membercontribution>urged that the time had arrived when their Lordships should receive some indication from the Government as to their attitude with respect to the Amendment. In spite of what had been said by the noble Lord who had been said by the Noble Lord who had just sad down, personally he had never listened to a series of arguments of a more purely Protectionist character. Lord Heneage had declared that if the Amendment were adopted their Lordships would be stultifying themselves, because they had accepted the Second Reading of the Bill, the principle of which the Amendment would destroy. He did not think his noble friend could have heard the quotation read by Lord Balfour from the speech of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition on the Second Reading, because in that quotation the noble Marquess expressly reserved his opinion upon this point. It was, therefore, manifest that the noble Marquess was in no way committed to a view one way or the other on this point. Lord Lansdowne had assented to the Second
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0467"/>
<col>885</col>
Reading leaving this point quite open, and he would, therefore, have protested against the suggestion of Lord Heneage that in entertaining the point now they were stultifying what was done on Second Reading.<lb/>
Like his noble friend below him (Earl Carrington), he was unfortunately in the grip of influenza when the Second Reading of Lord Hardinge's Bill was taken, or otherwise he would have entered an emphatic protest against a Bill so thoroughly Protectionist in character. He desired to know what was the attitude of His Majesty's Government on this question. Here was an issue which nakedly raised the question, "Shall you prohibit the use of hop substitutes when the substitutes are not suggested to be deleterious?" Why should they prohibit the use of alternative preservatives in order to buttress the hop-growing industry? If it were a sufficient argument that this industry must be buttressed, then they were committing themselves to a purely Protectionist policy. Surely His Majesty's Government could not sit by and assent without a word to the determination of an issue involving that policy.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Lord</member> <membercontribution>opposite, Lord Harris, had said that what was now proposed was for many decades the law of the land, and that the law then prohibited the use of anything but malt and hops in the manufacture of beer. The fact that that prohibition had bee a removed surely raised some presumption that there was a reason for removing it&#x2014;either that the prohibition was found to be impolitic, or that there was some reason existing when it was imposed which had ceased to be operative when it was dropped. He suggested that the prohibition against the use of substitutes in earlier years was adopted on account of the Revenue. The use of substitutes was prohibited when there was a malt and hop duty, the prohibition in that way protecting the Revenue; but when the duty ceased the reason for the prohibition no longer existed. It was obvious that hops might not be the only preservative which could be used in the brewing of beer. Why, therefore, should Parliament declare that hops should be the only preservative to be used?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD HARRIS</member>: <membercontribution>Because it is the best.</membercontribution></p>
<col>886</col>
<p><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member> <membercontribution>said this was a question which could best be decided between the brewer and the consumer of beer.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD HARRIS </member>: <membercontribution>The consumer has no chance.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member> <membercontribution>said the statement had been made, in the course of the discussion, that there were still some brewers who brewed from nothing but malt and hops, so that the consumer had a chance.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>A NOBLE LORD</member>: <membercontribution>Tied houses.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member> <membercontribution>said that if the consumer to-day preferred the light, modern mixtures of beer, in the making of which hops were little used, the consumer must be left to decide that for himself. As far as he knew, no pistol was placed at the head of the consumer of beer in the matter, and, in spite of tied houses, the consumer could make his choice. If the consumer had any clear views on the subject of preservatives the brewer would soon find it necessary to consult his taste. The reasons which had been given for the prohibition of other preservatives than hops were simply in the nature of a plea to buttress and to protect the hop industry. He felt sympathy for all interests affected by changes of fashion, of taste, and of conditions of life. It was a thing they had to face. Every step forward in the progress of society involved a diminution in the demand for some industry, if not its absolute destruction. But Parliament did not have resort to an Act to say that people should use hansom cabs and should not use motor cabs, or to say that ships should be made of oak or teak and not of iron.<lb/>
There had been a growing public taste for the lighter form of beer which did not demand the use of hops, or at least which had caused a great diminution in the demand for hops, and here was an array of noble Lords&#x2014;he was very sorry to see it, because he felt that it would affect seriously the respect paid to their Lordships' House in the country&#x2014;reviving the old worn-out arguments in favour of Protection. The conduct of the debate had become a mere futility and nothing would come of it, because there were forces existing which would prevent this kind
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0468"/>
<col>887</col>
of legislation from being carried into effect. He protested against it, not only because he disbelieved utterly in the policy which lay at the root of the legislation proposed, but because he thought it derogatory to the character of their Lordships' House to go back to these old arguments. Here they had the naked issue of Protection brought before the House. Were the Government going to say nothing upon it?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD JOICEY</member> <membercontribution>said that, though he claimed to be as strong a Free Trader as there was in their Lordships' House, he took a different view of the subject from that of his noble friend Lord Courtney. He thought the subject of preservatives one well worthy of the attention of their Lordships. To-day preservatives were being used to an enormous extent in connection with our food, and he believed the question would be forced on the serious attention of Parliament before long. At breakfast they found doses of boracic acid in their ham and bacon, butter, cream, and milk; and he could not help thinking that the consumption of these preservatives among their food in constant small doses could not be otherwise than injurious to health. Individual consumers could not protect themselves, and many of them were perfectly ignorant of what they were consuming. Other countries had taken action in the matter, and Germany, he believed, would not allow bacon and ham to be imported if it had been cured by borax. He suggested that His Majesty's Government should bring in a Bill to deal with the question of preservatives as a whole.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD MARCHAMLEY</member> <membercontribution>said that, as one who knew a little about the brewing of beer, he agreed with Lord Balfour of Burleigh that there was a great deal of confusion in the minds of noble Lords in regard to this question. The effect of preservatives was to put the beer out of condition for a short time, and therefore as a preservative nobody would use chemicals if he could possibly help it. He agreed that there was at the back of the minds of noble Lords who were supporting the Bill a good deal more than the question of the preservation of beer. He saw the cloven hoof of Protection, and, that being so, he would unhesitatingly
<col>888</col>
support the Amendment if Lord Balfour went to a Division.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD DESBOROUGH</member> <membercontribution>said the Committee had listened to a most extraordinary speech from Lord Courtney. They now understood that it was impossible to be a true and genuine Free Trader unless one was at the same time a firm believer in chemical beer. Lord Courtney had taken under his wing chemical ingredients, some of which tended to increase thirst and others to interfere with digestion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member>: <membercontribution>No.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD DESBOROUGH</member> <membercontribution>said that for ages past hops had been shown to be absolutely sufficient for the preservation of beer. In old days beer was kept more than twenty years, and was preserved entirely by the hops that were in it. It was also known that the purest and best light beer could be brewed entirely from hops. Indeed, in Bavaria it was absolutely penal to use anything but malt, hops, and water in making beer. Salicylic acid, one of the preservatives mentioned, was described in Squires' Companion to the British Pharmacop&#x0153;ia as, amongst other things&#x2014;
<quote>"antiseptic and powerfully antipyretic; is rather irritating to the stomach; a good preservative of medical solutions; is very useful when applied to hard and soft corns."</quote>
What its effect might be on hard and soft corns when taken internally was not stated, but, however beneficial, it was doubtful whether those who mere not suffering from corns hard or soft would care to take a remedy of which they were not in need. This was not a question of Free Trade or Protection. The question was, "What is beer?" Beer had always been acknowledged to be brewed from malt, hops, and water, and not from salicylic acid. It would be good for the brewer and consumer alike if the confidence in British beer were restored. He admitted that the brewer was suffering now and was going to suffer more, but he believed that when he raised the price of his commodity to find the taxes for the Government, if at the same time he would improve the quality of his beer he would extend his trade.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE LORD BISHOP OF HEREFORD</member>, <membercontribution>as a convinced Free Trader, supported the Bill as it stood. He could see nothing of a
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0469"/>
<col>889</col>
Protectionist character in the Bill itself. What might be at the back of the mind of any noble Lord in voting for the Bill seemed to him to be irrelevant on the present occasion. It was the Bill itself which the Committee had to consider. He was opposed to the Amendment for two reasons. English people had hitherto understood beer to be a liquid composed of malt and hops. If the brewers were substituting other materials, he ventured to think they were stealing the name of the real beer. Just as he felt when having butter with his breakfast that he ought to have some security that it was not margarine, so with regard to beer&#x2014;though he did not drink beer himself&#x2014;he thought it only fair not to allow the name of beer to be given to a new material without properly informing the public what it was they were purchasing and drinking. He had in objection to brewers brewing whatever liquid they chose so long as they called it by another name. His other point was that if they were to forbid substitutes but to allow preservatives the attempt was perfectly futile. They could not do the two things. They must either prohibit these chemicals whether under the name of preservatives or substitutes, or else admit them freely without any restriction whatever. For those two reasons he would be compelled to vote against the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CAWDOR</member> <membercontribution>said their Lordships were placed in a somewhat unfortunate position with reference to the action of His Majesty's Government. As the appeal of Lord Courtney had had no effect on the President of the Board of Agriculture, he could not hope that any words of his would extract an opinion from the noble Earl. He asked their Lordships to recall what was said earlier in the discussion. They first of all had a statement from the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture that, as far as this Bill was concerned, His Majesty's Government proposed to take no part whatever in the discussion. But when attention was called to that statement the noble Earl the Leader of the House, who he was sorry was not now in his place, stated that, on the contrary, the Government had no intention of standing aloof from the discussion of the Bill in Committee. He did not know what Earl Carrington's opinion of standing aloof was, but the noble Earl had been making a very good attempt at
<col>890</col>
it in the course of the present discussion.<lb/>
What was the objection of His Majesty's Government to making any statement with regard to this Amendment? The Government had agreed to the Second Reading of the Bill and had stated, through their mouthpiece, that they were practically agreed on the Bill, except with regard to certain detailed Amendments. As far as he knew, the only difference between them and the Government was the question of preservatives. How did the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture deal with it in his Bill? Did he deal with it at all? Was the Bill yet in its final shape? Possibly the reticence of the noble Earl was due to his being in the same position as his colleague the Leader of the House, who had stated that he had not the slightest idea what the Bill contained. Of course, if the noble Earl did not know what was in the Bill the Committee could not press him further. But he thought they were entitled to ask whether this matter of preservatives was the fundamental difference between the Government's Bill and Lord Hardinge's, and, if so, whether the Government were going to vote for Lord Balfour's Amendment or against it. Surely this was a simple question, and one to which they were entitled to a reply.<lb/>
Hop substitutes generally in the manufacture of beer were to be prohibited by the Bill, and it was also proposed that that should extend to preservatives other than hops. If they were going to exclude all hop substitutes except a particular one for the purpose of preservation, surely they wanted a very strong case to be made out before making the exception mentioned in the Amendment. If they were to deal with this matter at all they should deal with hop substitutes right through, and so far no case had been made out for making a definite and clear difference between the preservatives and the ordinary hop substitutes. He would vote against the Amendment.<lb/>
On Question, whether the words "or preservation" should stand part of the clause?&#x2014;<lb/>

<p>Amendment negatived accordingly.</p>
<p><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member>, <membercontribution>in announcing that he should not move his other proposed Amendments to this clause, said that after long experience of their Lordships' House he ventured to say that anything less courteous to the House than the treatment of it by the Government that day he had never witnessed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member> <membercontribution>moved to amend the definition of "hop substitute," which ran&#x2014;
<quote>"The expression 'hop substitute' means any article substance or preservative other than hops capable of being used in the brewing or preservation of beer and includes any preparation of hops the use of which in brewing has not been previously sanctioned by the Commissioners for the time being having the management of the duties of Excise."</quote>
He moved to insert, after the words "The expression 'hop substitute' means any," the word "bitter." He explained that the subsection as originally drafted was open to criticism as regarded its wording. The intention was to prohibit the use of anything except hops to preserve and bitter and impart aroma to malt liquor.</membercontribution></p>
<p>Amendment moved&#x2014;

<p>On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p>Consequential Amendment agreed to.</p>
<col>892</col>
<p><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> <membercontribution>moved to amend the definition of "beer," which ran&#x2014;
<quote>"The expression 'beer' includes ale porter stout and any other description of beer and any liquor which is made or sold as a description of beer or as a substitute for beer and which on analysis of a sample thereof at any time is found to contain more than two per cent. of proof spirit,"</quote>
by inserting, after the words "and any other description of beer," the words "except black beer and spruce beer." He explained that the Amendment would not exclude porter, because beer was defined as including ale, porter, and stout. But black beer and spruce beer were always excepted in Inland Revenue Bills dealing with this subject, and the insertion of the words in the definition in this Bill was necessary from the drafting point of view.<lb/>

On Question, Amendment agreed to.<lb/>
Clause 1, as amended, agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p>Clause 2:</p>
<p><member>LORD DESBOROUGH</member> <membercontribution>had two Amendments on the Paper to subsection (1). The subsection ran&#x2014;
<quote>"No hops shall be imported into the United Kingdom except in bags or packets having marked on the outside thereof with durable ink or paint in
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0471"/>
<col>893</col>
plain and legible words and figures of not less than three inches in length and half an inch in breadth the particulars following (that is to say):&#x2014;</quote>
<ol type="a">
<li>The name of the grower of the hops;</li>
<li>The name of the country in which the hops were grown.</li>
<li>The parish or postal address of the grower;</li>
<li>The year in which the hops were grown; and</li>
<li>The gross weight of each bag or pocket; and if any hops are imported into the United Kingdom in contravention of this section the importer shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds for every such bag or pocket."</li>
</ol>
He first moved to insert, in line (b), after the word "country," the words "and district and the parish or place." The object was to make it quite clear that the importer of foreign hops should be placed in exactly the same position as the home grower.<lb/>

<section>
<title>NATIONAL DEFENCE.</title>
<p><member>THE EARL OF WEMYSS </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to move to resolve, "That in the opinion of this House the Territorial Force as at present established totally fails to give practical effect to the Resolution unanimously agreed to by the Lords
<col>898</col>
on July 10,1905; and this House is further of opinion that immediate steps should be taken by the Government to render our land defences at all times such that, in the words of the said Resolution, 'no nation would ever attempt in any form a hostile landing on our shores.'"<lb/>
I shall not, in submitting this Motion, occupy very much of your Lordships' time, as I do not feel up to making a speech. I wish, in the first place, to read to your Lordships the Resolution agreed to by this House four years ago, as it has a material bearing on the whole question of national defence. The Resolution was adopted on July 10, 1905, and runs as follows:&#x2014;
<quote>"That it would be a danger to the realm and limit the power of the Navy as an offensive force in war to trust to it alone for home defence; and inasmuch as it is admitted that the Navy cannot guarantee us against so-called hostile 'raids,' it is the more needful that our land defences should at all times be such that no nation would ever attempt, in any form, a hostile landing on our shores."</quote>
I hold that to be a very valuable asset in our defensive policy. It was very valuable at the time, for your Lordships will recollect that the blue water was then in full flood. Even the Prime Minister plunged into it and told the nation, not only as Prime Minister, but also as head of the Defence Committee, that all that we need be afraid of were raids. The Navy, he said, could defend us against anything short of raids. Therefore the commonsense view of the matter is that it is wise to avoid the element of chance. But there is this other value in the Resolution, that both sides of the House agreed to it. It was accepted without a word of opposition by both Front Benches, and it therefore amounts to an I.O.U. on their part that they should do their best to bring about such a state of things that no nation would ever dream of a hostile landing on our shores.<lb/>
Now what has been done by Government since this Resolution was adopted? They certainly have done a good deal, for they have revolutionised our whole system of national defence. The Militia has been abolished, and the Volunteers as such have ceased to exist. I know that the Secretary of State for War has said that we Volunteers did not take the matter seriously, that we looked upon it more as a club than anything else. He is welcome
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0474"/>
<col>899</col>
to say that. At any rate, the Volunteers are gone. In the place of the Militia we now have the Special Reserve, and in place of the Volunteers we have the Territorial Force. How has this revolution been brought about? It has been brought about in the main by the combined action of the two Front Benches, but also through the colonels of Militia themselves not protesting against the Militia Force, whose name is written on nearly every page of British history, being swept away. If they had put their foot down the Government would have been obliged to let the force alone, and you would still have had the old historic Militia. But that was not done, and the Militia has disappeared.<lb/>
Let us see what the country has secured in the place of the Militia. The Special Reserve differs <i>toto c&#x0153;lo</i> from the old Militia. The old Militia was a force specially for home defence, and it served abroad voluntarily. The Special Reserve is not for home defence; it is for over-sea work. The Special Reservist is bound by the terms of his enlistment to serve abroad if required. There is an interesting passage in one of Mr. Haldane's thousand and one speeches&#x2014;I do not know which&#x2014;in which he refers to over-sea enlistment. This is what he says&#x2014;
<quote>"An over-sea Army can only be got on a voluntary basis, and must be recruited from men moved by enthusiasm&#x2014;men with the virgin mind from a military point of view&#x2014;which is attracted by a sense of mystery, and would be somewhat damped by preliminary compulsory training."</quote>
What this exactly means I do not know.<lb/>
I pass to the question of the Territorials, who, as I have said, stand in the place of the Volunteers. They are specially for home defence. On April 26 I asked the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War some questions, with a view to this Motion, as to the state of the Territorial Force on April 1. Why Mr. Haldane chose April 1 for its birthday I never understood; but this is what the noble Lord the Under-Secretary stated was the condition of the Territorial Force on its natal clay. He said that they had 79 per cent. of the number of officers required, and 84 per cent. of the men; that 107,857 men had engaged to serve for one year only in 1908, and that on April 1 last 56,238 of them had re-engaged for one year or more. should be interesting to know how many
<col>900</col>
of the remaining men have signified their intention of re-engaging? The noble Lord also gave us on the same occasion the important information that out of the total number on the strength of the Territorial Force over 62,000 were under 20 years of age, and that the limit of age for men is 17 and for boys 14. That was the state of affairs when my noble friend spoke on April 26. The numbers may have increased since then. My noble friend will tell us.<lb/>
I am willing, in dealing with this question, to assume that the 313,000 men have been obtained, that they are all 25 years of age or over, that each man can hit a bull's-eye at 2,000 yards, and that they are drilled as perfectly as any soldier on the Continent. Notwithstanding all that, I maintain that what I say in this Resolution is right, and that they would even then be of practically no avail. I mean that their number is wholly insufficient when it is considered what they would have to do. Read the Duke of Wellington's letter to Sir John Burgoyne written sixty years ago. What does he show? That of your force for home defence you require half in Ireland, that you require 10,000 in the Channel Islands, and 10,000 at every fortified naval base. How many will that leave of your 313,000 men? We have it on the high authority of Lord Roberts, in the patriotic and noble speech that he made in your Lordships' House in December last, that the Territorial Force is absolutely inadequate in numbers for the purposes which it professes to serve and that you require a force of at least 1,000,000.<lb/>
I had hoped that the noble and gallant Field-Marshal would have been in his place this evening, but it is his golden wedding, and I am sure your Lordships and everyone in the country will agree in the hope that Lord and Lady Roberts may pass many more happy years together. I saw Lord Roberts last Saturday and I asked him, as he could not be present to-day, to embody his views in a letter; and my main object in speaking to-night is to read to the House the views on this subject of the greatest military authority in this country. Lord Roberts writes&#x2014;
<quote>"I much regret I cannot be in the House of Lords on Monday next to speak in support of the Resolution you are bringing forward. I therefore write these few lines to tell you that I am entirely in accord with you as to the necessity for im-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0475"/>
<col>901</col>
mediate steps being taken to ensure the security of our land defences. The extraordinary apathy with which the momentous question of home defence is viewed by both Houses of Parliament, and, as a consequence, by the country generally, is not only lamentable but difficult to understand. If the lessons we learnt during the war in South Africa had been taken to heart, some attention would have been paid to the earnest recommendation of the Elgin Commission that in order to provide a sufficient Reserve for carrying on war 'certain powers of expansion' were needed 'outside the limit of the Regular Forces of the Crown.' We have, in addition, the important conclusion arrived at by the Norfolk Commission, 'that a home defence army, capable, in the absence of the whole of the greater portion of the Regular Forces, of protecting this country against invasion, can be raised and maintained only on the principle that it is the duty of every citizen of military age and sound physique to be trained for the national defence, and to take part in it should emergency arise.' It really would seem as if we, as a nation, imagine that we are a peculiar people, exempt from the possibility of war, its dangers, and its consequences; yet less than a year ago Lord Cromer stated in the House of Lords his conviction that there is a possibility of war, and a war of a serious character, at no very distant period. How are we prepared to meet such a crisis?"</quote>
Are you prepared to meet such a crisis? I know that you hive what is called organisation, but your organisation, excellent and perfect though it may be, is like Mrs. Glasse's recipe for hare soup. The first thing is to catch your hare. Have you got your hare? You have not a seventh part of the hare Lord Roberts says you ought to have. Lord Roberts proceeds&#x2014;
<quote>"We have no Army to speak of, and we have no organisation by which we could replace the losses which must inevitably occur during the first few months of any war on a large scale. On July 10, 1905, the day on which the resolution was carried to which you propose to refer, I said that 'I have no hesitation in stating that our armed forces as a body are as absolutely unfitted and unprepared for war as they were in 1899&#x2013;1900.' Close upon four years have passed since then, and I have no hesitation in reaffirming my conviction. Moreover, as your Motion deals mainly with the supremely important matter of home defence, I would add that if the expeditionary force, or even the first four divisions of that force, were sent abroad, our land forces are, in my judgment, in such a deplorable condition that we should be at the mercy of any invader who could land any number approaching to 100,000 men on these shores."</quote>
That is Lord Roberts's opinion, and I am confident that he is supported in that opinion by every one of his brother Field-Marshals and by every soldier of note in this country. Yet we remain in this state, and apparently do nothing. It was with a view of calling attention to this state of things that I placed my Motion on the
<col>902</col>
Paper. Lord Roberts's letter says all that is necessary to be said on the subject, and I will not trespass further on your Lordships' time.<lb/>
What is the first duty of the Government to the State? It is to make the State safe, to make the Empire safe, and to make our hearths and homes safe. How are you performing that duty? Surely you do not suppose that all these Dreadnoughts in course of construction abroad are being built entirely for defence purposes? The question of invasion enters very largely into the foreign shipbuilding. As a very old man, who may never speak again in this House, I say it is the duty of the two Front Benches to put the safety of the Empire before every other consideration, and to act together to see what can be done. They laid their heads together destructively; I ask them to lay their heads together constructively. If you had the courage, the commonsense, and the justice to the country to do what ought to be done, which is to bring about such a state of things&#x2014;never mind how it is done&#x2014;that no nation would ever dream of a hostile landing upon these shores, what would be the first effect? The first effect would be that you would stop rival foreign shipbuilding. I beg to move the Resolution which stands in my name.<lb/>
<i>Moved,</i> to resolve, "That in the opinion of this House the Territorial Force as at present established totally fails to give practical effect to the Resolution unanimously agreed to by the Lords on July 10, 1905; and this House is further of opinion that immediate steps should be taken by the Government to render our land defences at all times such that, in the words of the said Resolution, 'no nation would ever attempt in any form a hostile landing on our shores.'" &#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Wemyss.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ERROLL </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I wish to say a word or two in support of what has fallen from the noble Earl who has just sat down. I should like to point out in the first instance, that the whole problem, as I see it, of national defence has entirely altered since the speeches of the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Prime Minister on March 16 in another place. If those speeches did not come as a bombshell, which might seem an exaggerated form of speech, I venture to say that they came as a very unpleasant
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0476"/>
<col>903</col>
surprise to all Englishmen. Prior to those speeches our defensive measures were based entirely on the assumption of our absolute supremacy at sea; but in consequence of the admissions of the Government that within the next three or four years the relative strength of the British and German navies would approach much more nearly to equality, I venture to say that the conditions of the defences of this country have entirely changed. Precautions which we considered sufficient as long as the two-Power standard was maintained are no longer, I contend, adequate; and I venture to think it has become essential that we should have a highly-trained and efficient land force as well as a highly-trained and efficient Navy.<lb/>
The Territorial Force as now organised does not, I think, supply this want either in numbers, in training, or in organisation. They have no horses with which to mobilise, no stores, and no reserve ammunition. If they ever reached their number of 313,000, I venture to say they would be absolutely insufficient, as it would take 200,000 men, by a calculation which Lord Roberts, I think it was, gave us, to garrison the naval bases. With regard to horses, I would like to give as an illustration the case of the London Yeomanry. There are three regiments horsed by Mr. Tilling, and I believe it is one of his conditions that these regiments should not go out at the same time, because he has only enough horses ready to mount one regiment out of the three. What, my Lords, would the result be if, in the case of a sudden surprise, the Yeomanry were ordered quickly down to the coast for reconnaissance? One regiment would be able to ride; the second, I suppose, would go down in motors or taxi-cabs, and when they got there would have to do their scouting on foot; and the third regiment would probably have to walk all the way.<lb/>
I am not saying this in any spirit of hostility to the Territorial Force. On the contrary, I have the highest admiration for the spirit in which the men have come forward voluntarily and cheerfully to do the work which should be incumbent on all men of suitable age and suitable physique. The Territorial Force, if they ever have to fight, will have to fight the very best picked troops of the Continent, and I do not think that anybody would maintain that as at present organised they are equal to the

task. As long as the Regulars are at home I admit that there is no fear of invasion, but when the Expeditionary Force goes out of the country I think that danger may arise. Your Lordships probably may remember that towards the close of the Boer War this country was very nearly entirely denuded of Regular troops. If my memory serves me, there were something like 17,000 troops only in this country, and most of those were recruits in the dep&#x00F4;ts. There were no guns at all, until we bought six batteries, I think, from Germany. I leave it to your Lordships to consider whether in the future that source of supply will be open to us. These conditions may recur in the future, but with this very important difference, that at that time we had the absolute command of the sea. Our position at sea at that time was so assured that it was absolutely unassailable and unchallenged.<lb/>
In case of foreign complications, it seems to me that one of two things would happen. Either public opinion in this country would be so strong that the Expeditionary Force would not be allowed to go abroad, or, if it did go abroad, the country would be in great danger from the want of numbers and training of the troops that were left behind. We could not rely on the Army Reserve to be of any assistance, because it is impossible for the Expeditionary Force to mobilise without absorbing the whole of the Army Reserve. The question as it appears to me then is, When is an Expeditionary Force not an Expeditionary Force? and the answer seems to be, When the sense of insecurity in the country would not allow it to go on expeditions. India might be urgently needing troops, or a force might be wanted to act in conjunction with the Fleet and to carry a war into an enemy's country. That is the <i> raison d'&#x00E9;tre</i> of an expeditionary force. I think that the suggestion of training the Territorial Force for six months after war has been declared is very dangerous. It means, in the first instance, keeping the Expeditionary Force at home when everything might depend on its being elsewhere. It must be remembered that when the Expeditionary Force had left the safety of the country would then be entrusted to the Territorial Force, who are 2,500 short in their officers, and many of whose officers have a very small amount of military experience. In addition, the noble Lord has told us that of the force 62,000 are under

<col>905</col>
twenty years of age. It is for these reasons that I venture to support the Motion of the noble Earl.</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am in some difficulty in replying to this Motion, for the reason that it reproduces the discussion which took place in your Lordships' House last session, inaugurated by Lord Roberts, whose absence to-day I should like to join in deploring, although the cause is one on which he is to be entirely congratulated. On that occasion my noble friend Lord Crewe dealt exhaustively with the proposals then put forward, and which, of course, had not come to his notice then for the first time; and he stated the views of the Government regarding the opinions as to the possibility of invasion which Lord Roberts then laid down. I do not think it is for me to repeat the views Lord Crewe then expressed. I do not propose, therefore, to take up your Lordships' time by discussing how far our preparations for home defence are adequate against invasion on the scale then suggested and repeated by the mover of the Motion now before the House and by the noble Earl who spoke last.<lb/>
It is, of course, impossible for me to detail what the exact nature of our mobilisation plans is. It has been the invariable rule that mobilisation plans should never be disclosed in detail, and I do not propose to depart from that rule. But I would point out that this scheme was not produced by Mr. Haldane until he had been for a considerable time at the War Office. Mr. Haldane had at his disposal what no other Secretary of State for War in this country has ever had at his disposal&#x2014;a General Staff to assist him in forming his plan. The fact that there was a General Staff, composed of some of the most capable officers in the British Army, enabled the Secretary of State to go into this plan in the most detailed manner, to consider it from every point of view, to consider the possibility of invasion and how far his plans would meet any possible invasion: and that was done in a far more minute and thoroughgoing manner than ever before in the history of the British Army. On that basis our schemes for home defence have been drawn up. They have satisfied, not only the General Staff and the Army Council, but they have also satisfied the Committee of Imperial Defence. It would be impos-
<col>906</col>
sible for me to reopen that whole question, and I do not propose to take up your Lordships' time by doing so.<lb/>
There is, however, one direction in which the situation has considerably changed since the discussion of last autumn. I refer to the condition of the Territorial Force as it was then and its condition now. As your Lordships are doubtless aware, the Territorial Force has improved both in size and in efficiency at an astonishing rate. The numbers have increased very largely lately. Our latest return gives the number at 254,000 men, and, with officers, about 263,000. That makes it in numbers far more formidable than was the old Force, and owing to the extraordinarily keen way in which the men have undertaken their duties during the winter it has become a far more efficient Force. It is now emerging as a Force, quite up to the standard of efficiency that we expected of it. In fact, I may say that it is far more efficient than we ever had any reason to expect it would be. With regard to the number of one-year men&#x2014;a question which was considered to be one of danger to the Territorial Force&#x2014;I am glad to say that our returns show that we are in no danger of losing any considerable number of these men. They are re-engaging in very large numbers. April was, of course, the month during which the term of most of these one-year men expired, and we had reason to believe that the total strength of the Force would drop; but during the past month, I am glad to say, this has not been the case. So few one-year men have gone out that they have been roughly counterbalanced by the number of recruits who have come in. That shows that the danger of the Force being very much depleted by the loss of one-year men was exaggerated.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Earl, Lord Erroll,</member> <membercontribution>spoke of the difficulty of mobilising the Territorial Force. Mobilisation is a difficult thing. It cannot be worked out in a hurry. We are engaged at the present moment working out the mobilisation requirements of the Territorial Force, and we hope that we shall be able to say before a very long time has elapsed that the Territorial Force is capable of being mobilised immediately. One of the most important things, as the noble Earl said, is the question of horses. The number of horses available for training purposes&#x2014;that is to say, the number you can hire for 5l. for the fortnight&#x2014;is one
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0478"/>
<col>907</col>
thing, and the number of horses available in the country is another and a very different thing; and the fact that during peace time two or three different regiments of Yeomanry train with the same horses does not in the least imply that those regiments will be expected to ride the same horses or no horses at all on mobilisation.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD SALTOUN</member>: <membercontribution>An untrained horse for a cavalryman is absolutely useless.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>The noble Lord knows what is done in the Yeomanry every year. The great majority of horses go into camp absolutely untrained, and if the men upon them know how to ride they learn their duties in a comparatively short space of time. An untrained horse for cavalry purposes is a less serious drawback than is supposed. We are making rapid progress with the horse census, which is being taken for the purpose of enabling us to lay our hands on all the required horses upon mobilisation. The census has only been taken in a certain number of counties up to the present, but we have good grounds for stating that there will be no difficulty when the time comes in securing sufficient horses for mobilising the whole of the Territorial Force, as well as the Regular Army.<lb/>
As to the number of men under twenty, I do not think that is a consideration of the first importance when you remember that this is a question of home defence. The age of twenty was laid down as the age under which a soldier should not be sent to India because of the danger to his health, and it has been taken as the age below which a soldier should not be sent on foreign service in any dangerous climate. But there is nothing whatever to prevent a man being a perfectly efficient soldier for war in this country under the age of twenty. Therefore the fact that there are a large number of men in the Territorial Force under the age of twenty does not necessarily impair its efficiency.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ERROLL </member><membercontribution>: May I inform the noble Lord that in foreign Armies they take no one at all under twenty?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>If your Lordships adopt the Resolution which has been moved by the noble Earl it will be inconsistent with the action of your Lordships' House two years ago in passing the Territorial and
<col>908</col>
Reserve Forces Act. On that occasion the whole of the schemes of the Government with regard to the Army were before your Lordships. Our proposals with regard to the Regular Army, the reductions that have taken place in the Regular Army, the proposal to convert the Militia into the Special Reserve, and the use we were going to make of it&#x2014;all those matters, as well as the composition of the new Territorial Force, were before your Lordships; and, as far as we can tell at the present time, the reorganisations that have taken place have been carried out with success. The predictions of failure with regard to the Special Reserve and the Territorial Force have not been fulfilled. What we believed at the time would take place if our schemes were carried through has occurred; and therefore, having approved the reorganisation and having allowed the Territorial and Reserve Forces Bill to become law, it would be inconsistent on the part of your Lordships to adopt a Resolution such as that on the Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LOVAT</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to make two protests, one as a Member of your Lordships' House and the other as a member of the Territorial Force. I protest, in the first place, against the charge of inconsistency, on which we have been ridden off on several occasions already. Surely because this House passed the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act it is not responsible for all the follies committed in the name of that measure. The inconsistency is entirely on the other side. We were definitely promised certain things, but we have not got them. We were definitely promised that we should have our mobilisation arrangements immediately. I ask, What mobilisation scheme for the Territorial Force has yet been arranged? I think the greatest credit is due to Mr. Haldane for the work he has done in giving us a thorough organisation of the British Army. This is undoubtedly an advance on anything done before. But the point is that Mr. Haldane has not got sufficient men, nor men with adequate training, to face the duties that may have to be performed in the event of invasion. I protest against the idea that the new Territorials are so much better than the Auxiliaries used to be. Take the Yeomanry. The Yeomanry as units have not improved because the training in many commands has been reduced while the officers' schools have been abolished. This is a direct
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0479"/>
<col>909</col>
violation of what is in the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act and of what we were promised. Then take the question of musketry. The new musketry regulations are such that a man has only to fire at a miniature target, or in a thirty-yards range, or on the open range on three occasions to figure in the Parliamentary sense as an efficient shot. This is in order to pretend that you have a larger number of efficient defenders of the country than you really have; and to state that these men are more efficient than the old Auxiliaries is to state a thing which is not necessarily true. The preliminary mobilisation arrangements are by no means completed. I do not say that we have not made an advance, but to say, as has been stated in the country by Mr. Haldane, that we have advanced to anything near thorough mobilisation, and that we are in any sense ready to take the field as a mobilised Army to-day, is to state what is not absolutely a matter of fact.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, before my noble friend the Leader of the House replies I should like to say a word on the question of horses. If I heard the noble Lord the Under-Secretary aright, we must take it that he is perfectly satisfied that on mobilisation there would be plenty of horses available and sufficient to meet the wastage which would have to be provided for. I am also willing to take it from the noble Lord that it does not matter very much whether the horses are trained or untrained. The old exercises have been done away with, and where horses have only to do the duties of scouting, or to cover an advancing Army or things of that sort in an enclosed country where they must more or less stick to roads or by-roads, the soldier, it he can ride at all, can probably get along as well on a horse that had not been through the riding school as on one that had. But though horses need not be trained in any sense in the old idea, they must, at all events, be in condition. It is no us taking one-year old or two-year old horses, or horses off grass, to do cavalry work. The noble Lord told us that some sort of registration was taking place&#x2014;I believe in compliance with an undertaking given in your Lordships' House at the instance of Lord Lovat&#x2014;and that we should very soon know what number of horses were available. We are told that, by some law of the Medes and Persians, nothing is ever to be revealed concerning mobilisation. I do not know
<col>910</col>
whether that is right or not; but I should like to ask the noble Earl the Leader of the House whether the secrecy regarding mobilisation is to apply to the question of horse supply. I take some interest in the question of horses, and I was asked by the remount authorities to endeavour in my part of the country to open up a supply of Government horses, but if we are only to be told that when the time comes sufficient horses will be forthcoming the interest of people who are trying to do their best in the matter will disappear. I think we should be told what is the number of horses really available.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as my noble friend Lord Lansdowne is unfortunately still unable to be present, perhaps I may be allowed to say a few words as to the feeling on this Bench regarding the noble Earl's Motion. I confess that many of us have felt sorry that it has been necessary at so early a moment to review the position since the passing of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act. I believe there is hardly a man on this side of the House who has not done something to press forward the operation of the Act in his own county, and I hope we shall all continue to take that step. I feel that a premature condemnation of the Territorial Force is greatly to be deprecated; on the other hand, I confess that the attitude which the noble Lord the Under-Secretary feels himself constrained to take on these occasions makes it extremely difficult for us to give that blind confidence to the Government which he requires from us.<lb/>
This is the second or even the third occasion on which the noble Lord has excused himself, I admit in the most courteous manner, from giving us information, for which it seems to us reasonable to ask, and he has done so on the ground that to give the information would be to divulge mobilisation plans. I hope I may be pardoned if, having had to deal with this question in different capacities for more than twelve years in another place, I ask your Lordships to consider for a moment whether the information which is refused is secret mobilisation information or whether it is not information which has been repeatedly given by successive Governments to successive Parliaments. Take, for instance, the question of numbers. The numbers are given in the Estimates.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0480"/>
<col>911</col>
All the strengths are known, and are given in answer to Questions. The organisation of the Field Force has been even laid down by Act of Parliament, I believe; at all events, it has been laid on the Table. We merely ask, after the Regular troops have gone abroad, what organised force will remain in this country. That is a fair question. The information has been repeatedly given before, even in We do not ask for any secret information as to where those forces are to be employed. We do not ask what Ireland will absorb, we do not ask what time it will take to mobilise them, we do not ask anything which has been understood hitherto to be secret information on mobilisation. But we do ask for plain facts.<lb/>
I am loath to go further into this matter because to-morrow evening the Duke of Bedford has a Motion on the Paper which it is our desire to press seriously on the attention of His Majesty's Government. When the noble Lord asks us to place our whole faith and confidence in the <i>ipse dixit</i> of the Secretary of State, and when he tells us that all that has to do with mobilisation and with defence has been the subject of minute and thorough-going investigation and that the General Staff have satisfied themselves, and also, I think he said, have satisfied the Government, that they have a sufficient force to resist any possible invasion, I would remind him that two or three years ago the Secretary of State stated, I think in the House of Commons, that he desired a Territorial Force of 900,000 men.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>That statement is not correct. What my right hon. friend said was this &#x2014;that he was setting up machinery for a Territorial force which could, if necessary, provide 300,000 or 600,000 or 900,000 men, but he never said that we required in this country 900,000 men.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF WEMYSS </member>: <membercontribution>He prayed for them.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>No.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member>: <membercontribution>I accept the noble Lord's statement that the Secretary of State did not ask for 900,000 men, but we known that Lord Roberts has expressed a strong opinion that 1,000,000 were
necessary. I am not endorsing that or
<col>912</col>
criticising it, but we have yet to hear from the Government what their opinion is upon that statement by the first military authority in your Lordships' House. We have never heard from the Government since that opinion was given whether they have seen any necessity to revise their Estimates, and I cannot help pressing on the Government this point. When they ask us to accept military opinion, which they do not quote, in opposition to the strong military view which has been quoted here with all the authority of Lord Roberts, I cannot help pointing out that on half a dozen different occasions within the last three years we have been assured that the opinion of the military advisers of the Secretary of State was in one direction, yet that opinion has since been revised.<lb/>
Take the question of the Artillery. In 1906 the Government announced that, contrary to all the opinion which had been given in and outside this House, they were going to reduce forty-two batteries of Royal Artillery and to substitute for them a Militia Artillery&#x2014;persons trained, as the Secretary of State phrased it, on a Militia basis, who were to fill up the larger portion of those forty-two batteries. We protested by every means in our power against that change. Your Lordships were asked over and over again to discuss it, and, speaking in this House this time last year, I implored the Government to reconsider the position. The noble Lord met me by telling me that the military advisers of the Government we absolutely satisfied with these forty-two batteries on a Militia basis. We pressed and pressed again, and obtained a promise that the Artillerymen should not be disbanded until the men trained on a Militia basis were ready to succeed them; but we were told that it was unnecessary from a military standpoint to retain those batteries. Now, after this lapse of time, the Secretary of State comes forward this year and says he is satisfied that it is necessary to reverse that policy, and to keep the forty-two batteries on a Regular basis. We have yet to learn whether in that the Secretary of State was acting upon military opinion.<lb/>
But what are we to the link of that nebulous body the Army Council, who gave such strong support to the Secretary of State in reference to this reduction, which we believed to be fatal and which was against
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0481"/>
<col>913</col>
the opinion of Lord Roberts, Lord Wolseley, Sir Evelyn Wood, and every soldier who had been at the War Office&#x2014;what are we to think of the Army Council if, having given that advice, they now come forward and say that it is necessary to overthrow the opinion they so confidently expressed for the space of three years? I have given that solitary instance, though I could give others, why I do feel that the Government are expecting your Lordships to exercise a degree of self-restraint and a degree of confidence which is unusual when they ask us to be content with the bare assurance that the General Staff are satisfied. I therefore feel that we are in a very grave difficulty in regard to the Motion of the noble Earl.<lb/>
We feel most strongly that it is necessary that there should be further inquiry into this matter. We believe that the state of the Special Reserve and the want of officers should be the subject of further inquiry, and that it is impossible to allow the matter to rest where it is at present. We press that view on the Government. If they tell us that a Royal Commission would be unacceptable, as I believe is the case, we would not press for it. We would not even press for a public inquiry. There is at this moment a private inquiry by the Defence Committee going on into the condition of the new construction for the Navy. I urge the Government to consider whether they cannot in some way allay the doubt and uncertainty which exist on these Benches and throughout the country. I have no desire to impede the Secretary of State's efforts to improve the Territorial Force, but we want to know the military value of what would remain in this country after the Regular Army had been shipped to take part in operations abroad. The mere fact that the War Office say they are satisfied is not, I submit, a sufficient argument to advance. What I urge upon the Government is this, that they should allow some outside military opinion to be brought to bear. You have men in this country who may he past the age for service but who are not past the age to enable them to give a valuable opinion. You would not find the slightest difficulty in calling to the aid of the Secretary of State three men of the highest rank, who would tell you whether what is left behind is of military value and could be placed in the forefront in an engagement against picked Continental troops. Therefore we
<col>914</col>
wish to give the Government further time to consider the matter, and we would hope that the noble Earl would see his way not to divide the House on his Motion. I confess that, personally, I should feel great difficulty in going into the Lobby against him. On the other hand, I think it is a most serious thing for your Lordships to declare, as the noble Earl asks, that the Territorial Force as at present established fails to give practical effect to the Resolution of July 10, 1905&#x2014;that is, in other words, to say that our position is absolutely unsafe.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF WEMYSS </member>: <membercontribution>Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member>: <membercontribution>That we should be unwilling to say so long as it is in the power of the Government to satisfy us on this absolutely vital matter by giving us an inquiry.</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, it is not altogether an easy task to reply on this debate, because, as always seems to happen when the Army is under discussion, the criticism levelled at His Majesty's Government, although unusually animated, is also unusually elusive. Every noble Lord who has taken part in this debate has apparently spoken from a different standpoint, and if the secrets of their hearts could be revealed I think each wants something different. I am particularly sorry that my noble and gallant friend Lord Roberts, who, of course, speaks with such unrivalled authority, is not here to-night; and I desire to join in the congratulations which have been expressed towards him on the happy event of his golden wedding, for I think we are all moved and touched when we think of the happy domestic life of one who has given so many years to the service of the country.<lb/>
I say that the criticism was elusive because the noble Earl who moved the Motion devoted himself to the shortcomings of the Territorial Army, whereas the noble Viscount who has just sat down said very little about the Territorial Army, but spoke almost entirely to the Motion of the noble Duke which is on the Paper for to-morrow. He asked for a military inquiry, saying, very truly, that there are many eminent men who might conduct an inquiry and
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0482"/>
<col>915</col>
who are not beyond the age of criticism. With that I heartily concur, because nobody, I think, ever passes the age at which criticism is possible. But I do not propose to touch on that matter now, if the noble Viscount will excuse me, because it is really relevant to the Motion which appears on the Paper for debate to-morrow.<lb/>
We have been told that the Territorial Force is insufficient. The noble Earl .said that, even though it reached its full complement of 315,000 men, and they were all active men of twenty-five years of age, yet he would not consider that the country was safe; and he quoted the opinion of the noble and gallant Field-Marshal, Lord Roberts, as to the necessity of there being 1,000,000 men. The noble Viscount has complained that we have never expressed any opinion as to the necessity of 1,000,000 men. We have never been told, when 1,000,000 is spoken of, what the 1,000,000 is to consist of. Is it to be an Army of 1,000,000 with a full complement of cavalry and guns? How many batteries of artillery go to an army of 1,000,000 men? I suppose something approaching 500 batteries. Is that what is intended? Or did Lord Roberts mean, what my impression is that he meant, that there should be at one time in the country 1,000,000 men who had undergone some form of military training in some period of their youth? Lord Roberts has always taken up the line that he is not in favour of any kind of compulsory service, but that he is in favour of compulsory military training&#x2014;that is to say, I conclude, that at some period every man in the country, or, at any rate, a very large proportion of the men in the country, should have gone through some kind of training, always, I take it, purely infantry training, and that, therefore, there would be a very large reserve for any national emergency of men who had had some sort of training to arms.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> <membercontribution>I do not like to interrupt my noble friend, but I think the opinion Lord Roberts expressed was that there should be 1,000,000 men with some kind of military organisation, not merely training&#x2014;men who were capable of being used in the military organisation at the shortest notice.</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE </member>: <membercontribution>If that is to include an Army of 1,000,000 men on the Continental model&#x2014;I do not say neces-
<col>916</col>
sarily with the full Continental training, but an Army divisible into Army corps and divisions, with full proportions of cavalry, mounted infantry, and guns&#x2014;if that is the programme, then you are embarking on a very large proposition indeed. What does that mean? If that is what you are to have, it means that we are the most unfortunately situated country, not merely in Europe, but in the world. We are bound by our insular position, which, under those circumstances, seems to be an unmitigated misfortune, to maintain a Navy upon a standard of the necessity of which we are, I understand, all agreed. In addition we are obliged to have what no other country, in the world has&#x2014;a very highly-trained Expeditionary Army, more highly trained, I suppose, than any troops in the world; and then, in addition to that, we are to have all the youth of the country under arms to resist invasion. We have always believed until now that our insular position was an advantage to us. All the poets of past ages and all the politicians of past ages have dwelt with pride and also with great comfort to themselves upon our insular position; but now it appears to be, as I say, an almost unmitigated misfortune if it compels us to maintain a Navy on a scale which nobody else does, and at the same time to maintain an Army which is to be, at any rate to a very great extent, modelled on that of the great military Powers of Europe.<lb/>
Does that really represent the position, and are we to understand that that is the position which noble Lords opposite take up? If it is so, I want to know what has happened within the last few years to create such a complete change of attitude and of policy from that which they followed when they were in office. We never had an inkling of anything of the kind. The party of noble Lords opposite went on with various schemes for remodelling and, as, of course, they believed, improving the Regular Forces. They never thought out, so far as I know, any special scheme of home defence. They did their best, no doubt, to maintain the efficiency of the Militia, the Yeomanry, and the Volunteers. But it is very hard to believe&#x2014;I should be very unwilling to believe it of them myself &#x2014;that they were so entirely devoid of foresight as not to have contemplated the possibility, supposing they believe it now to be necessary, of this stupendous change
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0483"/>
<col>917</col>
in our system of national defence. Reference is made to 100,000 and even 300,000 men landing on these shores. I quite admit that our organisation is not based on the possibility of an invasion of that kind, and certainly not so when the Expeditionary Army is withdrawn. Therefore if that risk does exist&#x2014;a risk which the noble Earl will admit we do not believe to be a real risk&#x2014;it is certainly true that we are working on the wrong lines, and, whatever the sacrifice, we should have to go to something entirely different.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF WEMYSS </member>: <membercontribution>Hear, hear. The sooner you do it the better.</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL of CREWE </member>: <membercontribution>Then the noble Lord, Lord Lovat, and also the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, spoke on the question of mobilisation. I am certain that it is not the desire of my right hon. friend or of my noble friend behind me to keep back from the House or from the country any facts and figures of a kind which have usually been publicly stated, and which can be so stated without detriment to the public interests. What my right hon. friend does not want to do is to give figures which, although they might seem harmless to give in themselves, would yet tell more than he thinks ought to be told in the public interest of his mobilisation schemes. I cannot help thinking that there must be some misunderstanding on this point between noble Lords opposite and my noble friend behind me, and I cannot help also thinking that if they would communicate with the Department which my noble friend represents here, they would have very good reasons given to them&#x2014;satisfactory reasons&#x2014;why certain information for which they ask cannot be given. I am sure that my noble friend will go as far as possible to meet them in giving such information as can properly be given.<lb/>
My noble friend behind me asked about horses. He, if he will allow me to say so, put the matter very well when he pointed out that for the purposes of the Territorial Army horses if in reasonable good condition could be used without any very great amount of riding school or previous training. I remember very well when I was in the Yeomanry myself, and when practically the whole business consisted of parade movements, it was astonishing to see how, even within the compass of a week or
<col>918</col>
ten days, quite green horses would take their places in the line and become like seasoned troopers. But now that parade movements have given way to a more useful form of drill the lessons to be learned by horses are fewer. I am quite certain that my noble friend desires to make no mystery whatever of this question of horses, and I entirely agree that it is desirable, in order to keep up the public interest in the horse supply throughout the country, that the War Office should, as far as possible, take those in the country districts into their confidence as to the number of horses available and the number which will be required. I think that noble Lords opposite have been hardly fair to my right hon. friend on the question of mobilisation. So far as I know, up to the time that my right hon. friend went to the War Office there was no scheme of any kind to mobilise the Auxiliary Forces, or, if there was, it was of the&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON </member>: <membercontribution>I beg the noble Earl's pardon for interrupting him. The noble Earl said just now that while we were in office there was no sort of scheme, he believed, for the defence of the country. I can assure the noble Earl that there was a scheme in which every regiment was placed in the division in which it was to fight. The scheme was well known and could have been put in force in twenty-four hours.</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CREWE </member>: <membercontribution>I have no doubt that when the noble Viscount was at the War Office it was settled in his own mind and in that of his advisers where each regiment or battalion should be moved to; but as to whether any scheme was thought out by which all the Volunteers and Yeomanry could have been moved with full complements for all purposes of defence, I confess I am somewhat sceptical. On that I should like to say that I think noble Lords opposite pressed my right hon. friend rather unfairly in this matter of mobilisation. I believe that his schemes, which are necessarily of an elaborate character, have been very carefully worked out, and that as much progress has been made as could reasonably be expected to have been made by any Department within the limit of time which has been at the disposal of the Secretary of State for War. I am inclined to challenge contradiction on that point, although, of course, I am not personally acquainted with the details. After all,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0484"/>
<col>919</col>
these things cannot be carried out in a day. The noble Viscount opposite was going to re-organise the Army on a system of Army Corps with short service troops. Well, how long would it have taken to mature the scheme? It would have taken something like ten or twelve years to have brought the scheme into completion; and if, supposing the noble Viscount had had an opportunity of carrying out his scheme, somebody had jumped up in your Lordships' House twice every session and attempted to pull the plant up to see how it was growing and complained that the noble Viscount was neglecting the interests of the country by not having his scheme matured, he would have had some right to complain. Similarly I think my right hon. friend has also some right to complain. It is the advantage which the preponderating strength of noble Lords opposite gives them in this House that they are able, on subjects like this, to raise debates of which I do not wish to deny the importance. When noble Lords opposite sit on this side we are not in a position to do anything of the kind. Our forces are not large enough, and consequently, therefore, we must bear it as best we can. I confess that I do not think it of serious moment whether the noble Earl goes to a Division or not. If he does, we shall, of course, be compelled to vote against him.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF WEMYSS </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I do not know what my noble friend on this side of the House proposes to do in the event of my pressing my Motion. My noble friend proposes an inquiry. I shall vote against any inquiry. We have had inquiries enough. What we want is action, not inquiry. An inquiry could tell you nothing you do not know. I shall oppose an inquiry whenever it is proposed. Four years ago both sides in this House pledged themselves to what is contained in my Motion&#x2014;namely, that this country should at all times be in that state of preparation on land, not that you could crush any enemy that came, but in that state of preparation that no enemy would dream of coming. That was the I.O.U. which Lord Crewe and my noble friends on this side of the House put their signatures to four years ago. To-day I present that I.O.U. in the interests of the country, and I ask noble Lords to fulfil the promises they then made. It is necessary to act immediately, so that in six months time the country could be in that state which this
<col>920</col>
House declared four years ago it should be in. I do not criticise in any way the quality of the Territorial Force. I pass that aside. My point is that in numbers it is quite useless as compared with the force required. Does the noble Earl the Leader of the House think that this force, if complete, will fulfil the condition contained in the Resolution of this House to which he agreed four years ago. I await an answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CREWE </member>: <membercontribution>So far as my opinion is worth anything, I say "Yes."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF WEMYSS </member>: <membercontribution>I hope the rest of the House will say "No." The view of Lord Roberts, and every soldier in this House who has not an axe to grind backs Lord Roberts in that view, is that you require 1,000,000 men to put yourselves in the position referred to in the Resolution which your Lordships accepted four years ago. I desire to see whether your Lordships draw back from the action you then took or not, and if any noble Lord will support me I shall certainly divide the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CAWDOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope the noble Earl will not divide the House on his Motion. I think your Lordships might be placed in an invidious position if a Division were taken upon it. We have had two distinct opinions expressed. The greatest military authority in your Lordships' House, who unfortunately is not present to-day, has given his opinion very clearly. On the other hand, we have the opinion of His Majesty's Government that they believe that this scheme, which has been passed through Parliament and has received the impress of Parliamentary authority, will be a success. We have many criticisms, and, I am afraid, many doubts, as to the success of the scheme, but we still wish that it should be a success, and we desire to do nothing which may hamper in the slightest degree the operations of His Majesty's Government and the work which the Secretary of State is endeavouring to do. The noble Earl the Leader of the House, in his speech to-night, has given us some ground for hoping that in the future we may get a little more information when questions of importance are asked than has been vouchsafed to us in the past. The noble Viscount behind me, Lord Hardinge, asked some questions the other day as to which he got no information at
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0485"/>
<col>921</col>
all I think, however, from the statement by the noble Earl the Leader of the House, that we are entitled to hope that when these questions are again asked we shall certainly receive a little more information than we have had up to the present time. In those circumstances, and wishing to leave His Majesty's Government free,<lb/>

<title>SMALL HOLDINGS.</title>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL of ONSLOW</member> <membercontribution>rose to call attention to the many difficulties experienced by county councils in the administration of the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1908; and to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture whether he would introduce a Bill to amend that Act so as to expedite the establishment of small holdings and the creation of a class of occupying owners of the land.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Earl said </member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that I shall not be guilty of any exaggeration if I venture to say that the Small Holdings Act which your Lordships passed three years ago is a comparative failure. I say "comparative," because I have no doubt that presently the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture will produce a number of figures showing that a great many small holdings have been created &#x2014;I say a failure by comparison with what the noble Earl led the
<col>922</col>
so far as we are concerned, from anything that may hamper them, I hope the noble Earl will not go to a Division.<lb/>
On Question&#x2014;<lb/>
Their Lordships divided:&#x2014;Contents, 24; Not-contents, 28.
country to believe would be the result of the measure. We all of us admire the cheery optimism of the noble Earl. We also admire the way in which he has managed his own estates, and we know that upon those estates he has been more than usually successful in creating small holders. We also admire the noble Earl's zeal towards his party, and his desire to do everything that he can to advance what he believes to be the interests of the Liberal Party. But perhaps I may venture to point out to him that your Lordships and the party sitting upon this side of the House were no less desirous than the noble Earl himself to create small holdings in this country.<lb/>
The result of the action of the noble Earl has been that a very large number of his friends, mostly Liberal Members for different constituencies, have gone about persuading people that all they had to do was to make an application to the county council for a particular piece of land and they would get it for rather less than was its value, and that if they did not get it
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0486"/>
<col>923</col>
their remedy was to apply to the committee rooms of the Liberal Member. That is not the duty of anybody except the Board of Agriculture and the Commissioners appointed by the Board. I noticed only the other day that a gentleman, a son of a member of your Lordships' House, addressing a meeting in Dorsetshire, said that if application were made to the county council and no reply received a representation should be made to his father's estate office when a question would be asked in Parliament as to why the Commissioners were not down there seeing that the county council did their work. I deprecate very greatly any action of that kind.<lb/>
We were told by the noble Earl not very long ago that 23,000 applicants had applied for 373,000 acres of land, as he expressed it equal to a strip of land a mile wide from the Channel to the Firth of Forth. These have now been inquired into, and the number of applicants has been reduced to 13,000. I think the reason for their falling off is that they find they cannot obtain just that little piece of land they require at a lower price than anybody else would be willing to give for it, and that even the agency of the Liberal committee rooms has not been able to supply a piece of land, the best in the farm, at the same rent as the average of the farm without throwing a burden upon the ratepayers of the locality. Of these 13,000 applicants only 2,200 have been provided with 30,000 acres, an average of about 13 acres each, leaving 10,800 to be provided for; and if the average is the same these will require not less than another 140,000 acres.<lb/>
What is the cause of this comparatively slow progress in the administration of the Act? I dare say most people will expect that the answer will be the reluctance of the landlords in the country to part with their land. Anybody reading the provisions proposed in the Budget would imagine that the scorpions of the Chancellor of the Exchequer were to be applied to the loins of the landlords of this country because of their reluctance to carry out this measure; but, so far from that being the case, one Liberal Member after another has got up in his place and said that the landlords, whether Tory or Radical, have not been obstacles in the creation of small holdings, but that, on the contrary, they have done all they could to facilitate it. Is it, then,
<col>924</col>
the county councils? My noble friend gave very good testimony himself of the work which has been done by the county councils. He stated that their local knowledge had been of the greatest possible value, and that if they had not tackled the work the Board would have had to send one Commissioner into every county in England, whereas the Board had received every possible assistance and co-operation from the county councils. I think one of the most remarkable features of English life is the enormous amount of voluntary work performed in this country. I happen to be a member of the small holdings committee of my own county. The work that has been done by that body is very much the same as that of other county councils throughout the country. They have held innumerable. meetings; they have interviewed applicants; they have made applications for farms; and they have not hesitated to ask the Board of Agriculture to put the compulsory powers into operation. Therefore, I think your Lordships will agree that the fault does not lie with the county councils. Well, whose fault is it?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Earl</member> <membercontribution>opposite said some time ago that the lion in the path was the tenant farmer. It is not the landlords, it is not the county councils, but it is those who are now in occupation of the land who are the lions in the path. In 1906 the noble Earl opposite introduced a measure into your. Lordships' House called the Land Tenure Bill, and in his speech he said a great deal about the advantages of fixity of tenure and the iniquity of anybody trying to disturb his tenant. We were asked to put some words into that Act to provide for compensation in the event of loss being suffered by a tenant having to go from one farm to another. The noble Earl expressed the hope that your Lordships would not refuse to put these words in&#x2014;and they were put in&#x2014;because otherwise it would give the impression that&#x2014;
<quote>"The House of Lords was driving a very hard bargain with the unfortunate devil who was being turned out of his farm."</quote>
Moreover, the noble Earl has upon several occasions protested that nothing of the sort could happen, and that the Act must be worked without doing injustice to the vested interests of the farmers. Well, that is the spirit in which the county councils have
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0487"/>
<col>925</col>
acted. They have been unwilling to turn men out of the farms which they were occupying, and they have waited, wherever they possibly could, until the farm came out of occupation and they had an opportunity of making an application to the landlord to let it to them for small holdings.<lb/>
About two years ago the President of the Board of Agriculture became one of three Commissioners who administer some 62,000 acres of Crown lands in fourteen different counties of England. Knowing the way in which he administers his own estates, no word was raised in this House or anywhere else against the appointment of the noble Earl as one of the Commissioners of Crown Lands. But I wish to draw your Lordships' attention to a case which I think was one of particular hardship and one which seems to go diametrically in the opposite direction to the professions which the noble Earl has made. The case is one which occurred on a Crown farm near a place called Welwick the East Riding of Yorkshire. A farmer named Clark occupied a farm of 376 acres. The East Riding County Council were of opinion that it was not specially suited for small holdings because the land was heavy, and it was some distance from a railway station; but the Board of Agriculture and the noble Earl thought otherwise and they not only urged but compelled the county council to take a lease of that farm, and, of course, as a preliminary, they had to evict the tenant. That tenant had been in possession of the farm for sixteen years. It is quite true that he occupied another farm and held two farms together; but I am informed that his son was a man approaching full age, and that his intention was to settle him on one or other of these two farms. The man himself was a good citizen, and would have commended himself to Lord Lucas and the Secretary of State for War, for he was an active member of the Yorkshire Yeomanry, had raised a troop himself, and as a shot was a prizewinner. I venture to say that, however much one may be desirous of increasing small holdings, it is, to say the least of it, an arbitrary act to evict a man solely for that purpose. So strongly did the Chairman of the East Riding County Council feel that he said that, while hoping small holdings would succeed, he thought they were in that county starting under very intolerable circumstances with regard to this particular farm. I hope the noble Earl will
<col>926</col>
be able to give us some explanation. It may be that he has been able to make compensation for the loss which that man has suffered.<lb/>
I venture to think that one of the great blots upon the Small Holdings Act is that there is not sufficient provision in it for compensation for disturbance. All the time that the Land Tenure Bill was passing through Parliament the noble Earl, while he was very insistent on compensation being paid to a man who suffered loss through being turned out of his farm, always safeguarded that by saying that it should not be paid in cases where he was evicted for purposes of good estate management, and he was equally careful always to tell your Lordships that he considered the creation of small holdings good estate management. The noble Earl may say that the man had no claim&#x2014;as, indeed, he has not&#x2014;under the law as it stands. At the same time, I think your Lordships will agree with me that it is an exceptionally hard case and not one that you would seek to imitate on your own estates. There is a very considerable fund at the disposal of the noble Earl, a fund about which, I think, there has been a certain amount of misunderstanding. Some thought it was to be &#x00A3;100,000 a year, others &#x00A3;100,000 a quarter, but we now learn that the sum of &#x00A3;100,000 placed to the credit of the Small Holdings Account is to remain there until it is exhausted&#x2014;that is to say, until the noble Earl has drawn upon it; and not until that takes place will application be made to the Treasury for a further sum to be paid to the credit of the Board of Agriculture. I venture to say that it would be a fair and equitable charge to put upon that fund that where a tenant is turned out of his farm for the purpose of cutting it up into small holdings, or where a portion is taken away for small holdings, he should be entitled to receive from it compensation, to be fixed by arbitration.<lb/>
In many cases landlords who would willingly have given up land for this purpose have said to the county council, "No, I will not turn my tenant out. If you want that land you must use the compulsory powers which the law gives." I have done it myself. When the Act first came into operation I said I would not do anything to compel any one of my tenants to quit his farm. I stated that if any portion of the land was wanted for
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0488"/>
<col>927</col>
small holdings and a written declaration was produced from the tenant that he was willing to give up that part, I would be willing to treat with the local authorities at once, but that I was not going to be a party to turning a man out of his farm. That, I said, was work which Parliament had placed upon the county councils, and if it had to be done it should be done by the county councils. My noble friend describes the county councils which have not been so forward as he would have wished as "lame ducks," and amongst those lame ducks he classed the County Council of Surrey, with which I am more closely connected, and the council of the adjoining county of Sussex. I do not think that that can be from any rooted Toryism in the composition of those two particular councils, because I find that in some of the Welsh counties&#x2014;in Flintshire and in Cardiganshire, neither of which can be accused of want of sympathy with noble Lords opposite&#x2014;there have been even fewer small holdings provided than in Surrey and Sussex.<lb/>
The County Council of Surrey&#x2014;I am bound to say a few words in its defence&#x2014;has spent upon the acquisition of small holdings &#x00A3;730. The result so far has been one holding of thirteen acres, not a very great showing; but the small holdings committee has held sixty-one meetings, there have been twenty-five local inquiries, and 244 applications have been received, of which only 104 were approved. Out of that 104, fifty-four of the applicants wanted 550 acres in the immediate neighbourhood of Kingston, Reigate, and Woking. I venture to ask your Lordships whether you think it is easy near such populous places to buy land at a price which could be let to small holders at a rent that they could make it pay. And not more than ten per cent. of those who applied in Surrey have been willing to leave their immediate neighbourhood. They want land at their very doors; otherwise the county council would have had no difficulty in providing them with small holdings in other parts of the county. We were told by the representative of the Board of Agriculture in the other House that the average price which the county councils have paid for land for small holdings has been from twenty to thirty years purchase of the agricultural rent. There are very few acres in the county of rrey that you could buy at twenty or
<col>928</col>
thirty years purchase of the agricultural rent; and, therefore, if the noble Earl thinks the county of Surrey more backward than some of the other counties, may I tell him the reason is that we cannot get land at the price at which it would pay small holders to cultivate it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Earl</member> <membercontribution>has said that if peaceful persuasion fails some more stringent measures will have to be adopted by the Board of Agriculture. In Surrey we have had a good deal of criticism within our own borders and we are inviting on our committee, as we are able to do under the Small Holdings Act, our most vigorous critics. We hope when they get there they will be able to show us how to do the business which apparently they think is so easy to I would say the same to the noble Earl. If the noble Earl thinks that the county of Surrey is not doing its duty, and that it ought to provide small holdings more rapidly, then he has the remedy in his hands. Let the Board of Agriculture step in and provide small holdings themselves. The County Council of Surrey will not be in the least annoyed with the action of the noble Earl, particularly if, as I would not doubt, he is willing to put upon the shoulders of the Treasury the loss which in all probability would accrue from the operation.<lb/>
But what I think we really want to know from the noble Earl is what is the policy of the Board. Commissioners are being sent into every part of the country, and are reporting, I believe, to the Board. Does the Board want to create small holders who will live on their holdings, cultivate them, and live by them? If so, that is a policy upon which we are all agreed. But if it is their policy to provide a man with a tiny plot of land and build a house upon it, I say that is not a small holding policy but a housing policy, and one which it has been shown cannot be carried out without throwing a charge upon the rates. As your Lordships are perfectly well aware, in Wales most of the land is already held in small holdings, and where it is not held in small holdings in the technical sense of the word&#x2014;that is, holdings of fifty acres or under&#x2014;it is held in small farms. The cost of equipping the land with farmhouse and farm buildings on every 100 acres or so is necessarily very much greater than in putting up house and farm buildings on 1,000 acres, and therefore the Welsh county
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0489"/>
<col>929</col>
councils are unable to provide land at a price which the small holders can afford to pay.<lb/>
There are many other difficulties in the working of the Act which have been experienced by county councils. Some time ago I ventured to put a list of Questions on the Paper, but I was met with the observation that it occupied a good deal of space, and, therefore, I have contented myself on the present occasion with giving private notice to my noble friend the President of the Board of Agriculture upon the points on which we are desirous of the guidance of the Board. In the first place, I should like to ask the noble Earl how we are to deal with the question of compensation for the utilisation of the small holding as a market garden. It constantly happens that the small holder wishes to use the land for market gardening, and the land can be obtained by the county council from the landlord, who invariably guards himself against being compelled to compensate for the cost of planting fruit trees, bushes, and so forth; but the county council has to pay that compensation to the tenant, whereas it cannot recover it from the landlord, and consequently the burden falls upon the ratepayers.<lb/>
Then, again, I should like to ask the noble Earl what is a county council to do when it applies to rent land which may become available some day for building purposes. If the council expend any money upon it all that they can do when the landlord calls upon them to give it up at twelve months notice for building purposes is to require compensation from the landlord for the expenditure so far as it is of value to the landlord. I need hardly say that pigstyes and cowsheds are not much use to building land, and the consequence is that the county con acids are left to meet the cost of equipping the land for small holdings. Then many councils have land which has been appropriated for other purposes, such as asylums and burial grounds, but the Board have decided, I understand, that they are not allowed under the Act to make use of those lands for the purpose of small holdings, nor may they acquire land in the rough and expend money in breaking it up for small holdings. There is also another difficulty which has confronted many county councils. County councils who have issued Stock are not allowed to borrow money for any subse-
<col>930</col>
quent purpose for more than five years, and consequently if a county council has issued county Stock it is in the peculiar position of being unable to borrow money and spread repayment over a period of thirty-five years or eighty years, as the case may be, for the purpose of purchasing and equipping land for small holdings.<lb/>
Then there is a further difficulty which arises in connection with the provision of land for allotments. Allotments are to be provided only for the labouring population. It is very difficult to define labouring population. Small holdings may be provided for anybody who is willing himself to cultivate the land, and I suggest to the noble Earl, if he contemplates an amending Act, that the definition of those who may have land for allotments should be assimilated to that of those who may have land for small holdings. There are other difficulties, but these are the principal ones. One is in ascertaining whether the applicant for a small holding has sufficient capital. There has been much difficulty felt in the county of Worcester, in the neighbourhood of Birmingham, where a small holder who made a profit last year of &#x00A3;150 had to borrow money which, with the interest, amounted to &#x00A3;115. County councils are also bound to register the land which they purchase, and I would venture to appeal to the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture whether registration of the land is not a charge which might properly be paid out of the Small Holdings Account. The Act provides that the land must be registered, although neither the county council nor anybody else wants to do it. I venture to suggest that it increases the cost of acquiring the land, and that the noble Earl might very well meet us with a grant out of the Small Holdings Fund.<lb/>
One very great grievance is felt by those who become tenants of county councils&#x2014;namely, that they are required not only to pay the rent, but also the proportion of sinking fund to repay the cost to the county council of the purchase of the land&#x2014;in other words, tenants have not only to pay the rent but they have also to pay the capital value, and at the end of that time the land is not theirs, but is the property of the county council. I have gone somewhat carefully into the relative cost of purchase and of renting. I will give the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0490"/>
<col>931</col>
noble Earl the figures if he likes in greater detail than I would care to trouble your Lordships with, but I would give very briefly an example. Taking a farm of forty acres and dividing it into two portions, assuming the capital value to be &#x00A3;1,000, and the interest &#x00A3;40 a year, you sell one-half of it to A and let the other half to B. The annual charge to A, who will ultimately become the purchaser, will be &#x00A3;23 ls. 3<i>d</i>., and the annual charge to B, who will never acquire the freehold will be &#x00A3;22 12<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. If the Government had accepted the suggestion that was made in the Report of the Committee over which I had the honour to preside&#x2014;namely, instead of requiring the small holder who wanted to purchase to pay down one-fifth only to require one-eighth, it would be possible for the small holder to pay a smaller sum annually than he now has to pay in rent and yet at the end of the period he would own the freehold of the land. If it were known that the land could be thus acquired for rather less than is now paid to the county council, the noble Earl would find that the disinclination to become purchasers of the land would very soon disappear. That was one of the recommendations made by the Committee over which I presided; and there was another one which the noble Earl did not think fit to embody in the Bill, but which, I venture to think, would have done more to accelerate the creation of small holdings than any of the provisions of the Act, and that is that loans should be made to landowners to put up buildings to equip small holdings on terms equally favourable to those on which they are advanced to the county council. I observe that Lord Harrowby is about to deal with that point. If the noble Earl really wishes to accelerate the creation of small holdings all over the country, I can assure him that the landlords are only too anxious to do it, but they cannot afford it at the present rates for loans to equip their holdings. If those rates were lower, I believe there would be a very great extension of small holdings throughout the country.<lb/>
In conclusion, I can only say that I do hope the noble Earl will not press county councils to evict sitting tenants from their holdings, but that they will wait until there are changes of tenancies. If the noble Earl wants to further accelerate the creation of small holdings, he has it in his Power to provide proper compensation
<col>932</col>
where tenants are evicted from their holdings; and I think until they receive proper compensation neither landlords nor county councils will be prepared to sacrifice sitting tenants even for the purpose of creating small holdings.</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF HARROWBY </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture, whether he is aware that landowners providing cottages or equipment for small holdings, under the Lands Improvement Acts, are subjected to heavy preliminary expenses by way of commission for the negotiation of loans under those Acts, and of fees for visits of inspectors; and whether, with a view to facilitate such improvements being made, His Majesty's Government are prepared, in approved cases&#x2014;(a) to remit the charges at present made for the visits of Government Inspectors in connection with advances or loans; and (b) to make advances or loans for the purposes mentioned to landowners direct on terms similar to those on which advances can be made to local authorities and co-operative societies; and whether, if necessary, His Majesty's Government will bring forward this session proposals for legislation with these objects.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Earl</member> <membercontribution>has kindly given me permission to put my Questions now. I put them down because I felt that the matter was of the greatest importance to the landowners and farmers of this country, and also affected the question of the development of small holdings and estates. I think the noble Earl will be the first to recognise that English landlords&#x2014;I say English because I know nothing about Scotland&#x2014;have been ready to do what they can to extend small holdings. I am not concerned this afternoon with the large landowners of the country, but I do want to make a plea for the small landowners. It may be said by the man in the street that the land is held largely by members of your Lordships' House. That may have been true thirty or forty years ago, but I do not think it is true to-day. Unfortunately I find that there is no Return of landowners in England. The last Return was, I think, made in 1860; but if a Return could be got out it would prove that the average holding of the landowners of this country only amounts to 2,000 or 3,000 acres. This class of landowner in England as a rule consists of men who live entirely by their rent. I am also not concerned with land-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0491"/>
<col>933</col>
owners who have private means, but only with those who look to their rents for their income, and we have been told recently in the Press that the landowners have a very small margin upon which to live. An excellent letter by Mr. Pretyman has opened, I hope, the eyes of the country to that fact; and I would ask your Lordships how the landowner who has a very small margin of profit to live upon can face the calls which will be made upon him in these days.<lb/>
May I take the case of an owner of land who has succeeded to a property and has paid considerable death duties? His agents or tenants may ask him for a cowshed or a new set of buildings to cost &#x00A3;300 or &#x00A3;400. The landlord may say "I should like to do it, but I cannot." The farmer, if he has any grit in him, leaves, and that is the first deterioration of the farm. What happens next? The farm is let to an inferior tenant. It may be that the landlord spends &#x00A3;20 or &#x00A3;30 to patch up the buildings, but that does not meet the requirements of a good tenant. The second tenant takes what he can out of the land and leaves it. The third state of deterioration, as noble Lords will see, is that the farm is afterwards let as a sheep run, and you see all the fences tumbling down and the buildings going to rack and ruin. What is the position of the landlord who cannot put down the necessary capital to meet the requirements of the local authority? He lets the farm go at a lower rental for some other purpose.<lb/>
Now I will paint the other side of the picture. The other day a landlord succeeded to a property where chaos reigned and where the tenants shot where they liked, grazed where they liked, and farmed as they liked, and paid when they liked. This landlord immediately discharged the tenants. He was not a very rich man, but he had access to capital. He cut up the large farms, created small holdings, and built cottages, and to-day the farm is a credit to the district, the landlord and the tenants. To-day there is no better set of tenants in the whole county than on that particular estate of about 5,000 or 6,000 acres. You must have noticed, travelling through the country by train, acre upon acre of land not properly cultivated, fields undrained, and bushes and thistles growing in them. The reason is that the landlord has not sufficient money to put
<col>934</col>
up the necessary buildings for good farming. What agriculture is suffering from to-day is the want of access to capital.<lb/>
I should like to urge upon my noble friend that he should do something for English farmers as has been done for Irish farmers. I believe the Irish tenant has means, through his credit banks, of getting capital at a low rate of interest. That is not so in England, and I do feel that by the establishment of these credit banks a great deal might be done to meet the difficulty of want of capital. What is the position of the tenant who desires to develop his estate? He is driven to some land company, and there I quarrel with the terms which he has to pay. If a small landowner wishes to build a cottage on a few acres of land he has to pay in initial expenses no less than ten per cent. If a landlord is allowed to spread his borrowing over a term of years he cannot do so as advantageously as a county council; but the great drawback to my mind to owners of land is that if they go to these companies they are unable to repay. It has come to my notice that many owners are quite prepared to borrow money from the Government or a land company if they could repay by instalments. When they borrow from land companies they have to charge their estate from twenty-five to forty years. I feel convinced that if there were some means by which a landlord could spend &#x00A3;200 or &#x00A3;300 and repay by instalments you would find the appearance of the country different from what it is to-day with regard to buildings.<lb/>
Let me quote figures showing the difference between county council borrowing powers and those of land companies. A county council can borrow at 3&#x00BD; per cent. for fifty years on new buildings, which means &#x00A3;4 5s. 3d. per year for interest and redemption. The land company can only borrow for forty years and the annual sum amounts to &#x00A3;4 16s. 11d. It may be said that is a small difference, but when you are dealing with small landowners it is a considerable item. With regard to alterations of existing buildings the term is twenty-five years, both for county councils and land improvement companies, and the premiums are &#x00A3;61s. 4d. and &#x00A3;6 4s. respectively. In connection with these improvement companies I
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0492"/>
<col>935</col>
should like to urge the noble Earl if he could see his way to allow them to lend money for the erection of village clubs. We all know what an important place village clubs occupy in our country life, and I know that several owners of land have applied to these companies for powers to borrow for this purpose, and they have been told that the Government would not allow it. What I ask the noble Earl to do is to create a department in the Board of Agriculture where landowners could go direct and borrow money on the same terms as county councils. If the noble Earl tells me he would require a special Act of Parliament, there is another way which I would like to suggest. I see several chairmen of county councils present this afternoon. I should like county councils to lend the money and charge one per cent. for the initial expenses as against six per cent. or seven per cent. at present charged. I think the security is good, as it would be a first charge on the property before all the mortgages. I am not asking the Government or the local authorities to run any risk in granting these loans. Failing these two plans I would ask the noble Earl if he could see his way to waive the fee of six guineas charged for inspection. It might very fairly, to my mind, come out of the &#x00A3;100,000 grant to the Board of Agriculture for the development of small holdings.<lb/>
I think the advantages of my suggestion would be considerable to the country, because I have no doubt that if the noble Earl could see his way to carry out the suggestion a large number of small holdings would spring up all over the country. It is admitted that landowners can create these holdings much better, much cheaper, and much more satisfactorily than can county councils. I admit that the landowners of this country, or at any rate the great bulk of them, at present do not realise the possibilities of small holdings. I have always contended, in this House and outside, that small holdings can be created so as to pay the landlord, and I think the noble Earl will agree with me in that. Whom else would the adoption of my suggestion benefit? It would benefit a large number of men, principally labourers and small farmers, who want these small holdings but do not care to rent under a public body. Only to-day three or four men have told me that they would not rent under a public body but would much prefer to rent under a landlord.
<col>936</col>
In conclusion, I should like to say a word as to the administration of the Small Holdings Act by the noble Earl. It has worked well in some cases, but I do not like the ginger which is being administered to county councils. There is a danger of forcing county councils to buy and rent land where it is not necessary. A case came before me the other day in which a small holdings committee of a county council sitting round a table said "We must buy this farm although we think the price high; if we do not do something, the Board of Agriculture will come down upon us." What was the consequence? They bought this farm of 120 acres, turned off the tenant, and put two other families on the farm. For those two families they spent &#x00A3;6,000. Now, I do not think it was the intention of the noble Earl or of the Act that county councils should incur this enormous liability for the sake of creating small holdings. To my mind I think it ought to be left to landowners to create the small farms. What the county council should do is to buy land near towns in small quantities to meet the demand in the villages or outskirts of the town. I hope that the noble Earl will be able to give us a few words of encouragement in this direction.</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I think it may be for the convenience of the House if I take the noble Earl's point first, and I wish to congratulate him on being one of the greatest friends that the small holdings movement has. As we all know, the noble Earl has more than 3,000 acres under small holdings, and all his tenants are happy and doing well. But he has rather sprung, if I may be permitted to say so, an important question on me at a moment's notice. These new proposals involve the most important financial consideration. So far as public money is concerned, of course it is a question for the Treasury; so far as county council money is concerned, it is a question for the Local Government Board; but, so far as my own Department is concerned, we are, of course, all in favour of economy and cheapness in the matter of agricultural development. If my noble friend would permit me, we might talk the matter over and see whether in any way we could remedy what I admit are some great difficulties that exist at present.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0493"/>
<col>937</col>
As regards the question which has been brought before the House by Lord Onslow, I must admit that I have nothing whatever with which to find fault, except perhaps that his speech was rather too much about Lord Carrington, and too little about small holdings. That is the only criticism I make of his speech, though I think he really honestly looked at the question through his pince-nez with rather too grey glasses, for he conjured up the most hideous obstacles in working the Small Holdings Act. I venture to submit that what appeared to him in some counties to be high and inaccessible mountains, in other counties are very small mole-hills indeed. In his own county&#x2014;the great historical county of Surrey, in which he is so well known and highly respected&#x2014;there are ten acres under small holdings. One holding I believe belongs to the noble Earl. I congratulate him sincerely upon being a great exception in Surrey in having one small holding. Look at Sussex&#x2014;sleepy Sussex, as I believe it is called. There are two county councils in Sussex. One has been successful and I suppose they are very proud of it. They have two acres under small holdings. That is in East Sussex. In West Sussex they have done better because they have three acres. Compare Surrey and East and West Sussex with Cambridgeshire, which has got 1,595 acres, Northumberland 1,635, Somerset 1,757, and Norfolk 2,217. How is it that this is possible in one county, and impossible in another? I really think that in some counties there is, perhaps, a more hearty desire to carry out the Act, and, if I may say so without offence, perhaps a more reasonable amount of intelligence.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member>: <membercontribution>Can the noble Earl tell us what is the average price paid for the land in the counties he has enumerated?</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member>: <membercontribution>I will have them looked out and sent to the noble Earl. My noble friend said there was a great difference between Cambridgeshire and Surrey. No doubt there is, but there is not such a great difference between Surrey and Kent. Owing very much, I think, to the great work Lord Darnley has done in Kent, that county has got 718 acres, and the conditions are very much the same as in Surrey. Therefore I really do not see why Surrey should not, if I may use a vulgar expression, "buck up,"
<col>938</col>
and do a little better than it has done up to the present.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl asked what is our policy. If he will kindly go down to our new colony in Norfolk he will see what the policy is. He will find there a colony of small holdings with allotments, a village hall, a fruit farm, and twelve or fourteen houses with fifty acres apiece, occupied by people not only able to pay their way but doing very well. That is our policy, and if the noble Earl will take the trouble to visit the colony I think he will be pleased with the result. With one of the noble Earl's contentions I quite agree. I quite recognise that very much could be done if county councils could let land to parish councils for allotments. As regards money spent on equipping small holdings which will be lost if land is resumed for building purposes, the whole of that question is a theoretical rather than a practical one, and I do not intend to detain the House on the point. Then as to the question of market gardens, and whether county councils will have to compensate their tenants but cannot recover from superior landlords. The Board have suggested a form of lease to safeguard county councils against loss in relation to market gardens. We have a form of lease of which I shall be happy to send the noble Earl a copy.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Then the noble Earl</member> <membercontribution>came to the old question of the "magic of property." I am really not going to detain the House about that, because it is absolutely flogging a dead horse. The House will remember that the great Tory Act of 1892 was in force fifteen years, and at the end of that time there was the magnificent result that 800 acres of land were positively acquired. Last week under the present Act new schemes and orders embracing 1,256 acres of land were sent in, so that in six working days under our Act we secured fifty per cent. more land than the "magic of property" Act could obtain in fifteen years. Mr. Austen Chamberlain was good enough at Durham to make a speech on the subject, and he asked for &#x00A3;250,000 to support his pet subject. I do not think he is very likely to get that in this time of storm and stress. Then he wrote to <i> The Times</i> in February, but he was very neatly put on his back by Miss Jebb, and ever since we have not heard a word on the subject. I should like to point out that only one per cent. of the English applicants
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0494"/>
<col>939</col>
have asked to purchase. In Cambridgeshire, which is one of the most go-ahead counties, only one man out of 1,013 applicants has asked to purchase his holding, and that man is an uncertificated bankrupt. As to the difficulty in regard to counties which have issued Stock, the Local Government Board are introducing a Bill to dispose of this difficulty.<lb/>
That leaves me, mercifully, only two more questions to deal with. One is the difficulty, we are told, in obtaining land without eviction. What an extraordinary change has come over the spirit of the dream in two years! Two years ago the Benches opposite were filled with noble Lords who quoted the opinions of agricultural correspondents, chosen with much care, who told them that it was the most dishonest cry ever known; that there was plenty of land&#x2014;more land, in fact, than applicants. We all remember the opprobrium that was hurled at the head of the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman when he said that in some cases there was a blank denial given to the people who wanted land. Practically speaking, there is a difficulty, no doubt, but it is not a serious difficulty. We have the offer of a great many vacant farms, and we most gratefully acknowledge the help we have received and are receiving from landowners who were not very friendly to the Act. Three names come to my mind. There is the Duke of Northumberland, who was not very friendly to the Act during its passage through this House, but who has behaved extremely generously in giving three or four farms in splendid condition and not charging the county council for putting them into tiptop repair. The same thing can be said of the Duke of Portland, who was an antagonist of the Act. Then the Duke of Marlborough has set a most glorious example. He has gone further than anybody, and has taken away from his biggest farms without interfering with the farmers' livelihood. He has taken 600 acres of land from different parts of his great estate and offered it to the county council in the most generous way, and I commend, with great respect, the example of the Duke of Marlborough to my noble friend who said that nothing on earth would induce him to take any land under any circumstances from tenants on his estate. There may have been some difficulty, but where there is a difficulty in getting land we have the remedy in our
<col>940</col>
own hands. We can take it by compulsion, and the county councils are waking up to the necessity of that, as already fifty compulsory order schemes have been sent in to the Board of Agriculture.<lb/>
I admit that some of the farmers are very sore on the subject. I allude to a meeting of the Farmers' League, a most worthy body of men without whose help I do not think I could have got the Land Tenure Bill through both Houses of Parliament. And what do they say? They say that Mr. Armstrong, of Selby, complained that several farmers had had notice to give up 20 or 30 acres of land for small holdings on large farms of 800 to 1,000 acres. I do not think that is a great demand to make, but Mr. Armstrong went on to say that this was a great injustice and that a more abominable Act was never passed through Parliament. In support of that the noble Earl brought forward a case of what he called particular hardship with regard to a certain Mr. Clark, of Welwick, who farms under the Crown. He told us that Mr. Clark had raised a troop of Yeomanry and was a very patriotic and excellent person I believe that is true in every particular, but I must say that the noble Earl did not do justice to his case. He did not even put the case as strongly as it has been put by a farmer's wife, who, in a letter to <i>The Times,</i> used language concerning myself and the Government which I think would hardly have been used by the most enthusiastic suffragette who ever hit a policeman. She went on to ask were our rulers children, idiots, or daft adults; and why should one raise troops to defend a country in which one had no stake. Now, that question ought properly to have been addressed to the Under-Secretary for War, and I think it would almost have puzzled my noble friend Lord Portsmouth in his best days. But Mr. Clark still has a stake in the country, and still has a stake in the Empire. He lives at Winstead on a farm of 367 acres.<lb/>
Let me explain to the House the real story of the case with regard to Mr. Clark. The farm was bought in 1906, and Mr. Clark held the greater part of it under a yearly tenancy; another portion of the farm was under no agreement whatever, and as to another part the rent was regulated by the amount of stock which was kept. I ask, as a practical man, whether that was not an extraordinary arrangement. That sort of agreement, I admit, might have
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0495"/>
<col>941</col>
been very useful for the sort of patriarchal management of the friends of the Duke of Montrose and Mr. Pretyman, M.P., who, we are told, invest 75 per cent. of the net income in fructifying improvements and in bricks, mortar, and wages so as to retain unimpaired the heritage which they hold in trust for their successors; but I venture to submit that is hardly a business arrangement. As there was a great demand for small holdings, Mr. Clark received notice in April, 1908, that the whole farm was required for small holdings. Mr. Clark had no legal right to compensation, as we all know, but the Crown receivers advised me to send to the Treasury for compensation. I have not had an answer from the Treasury, although I think that compensation, which is quite right under these circumstances, will be paid to Mr. Clark.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY </member>: <membercontribution>I should like to ask the noble Earl whether it has been the custom with regard to Crown lands in the past, when taken over for small holdings, for the Crown to take them over themselves; and why, in those circumstances, the county council was compelled to take these holdings from Mr. Clark, against, as I gather, the wish of the county council?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member>: <membercontribution>That is one of those extraordinary stories that get about. There was never this compulsion upon the county council. If they did wrong they are <i>particeps criminis</i> with me. I can assure your Lordships that there has been no compulsion of any sort or description. To think that there has been is entirely a mistake.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I had hoped that the chairman of the county council, Lord Wenlock, would have been here to say something as to the attitude of that body. In his absence perhaps I may be allowed to observe in regard to the point in question, that the view of the county council does not appear to agree at all with the statement made by the noble Earl. I do not know if the noble Earl has read a report in the <i>Yorkshire Herald</i> of the meeting at which this subject was brought forward. If not, I hope he will allow me to draw his attention to it. Alderman Sticknell deprecated very much the action taken by the Board of Agriculture as against the county council. He said, with regard to the land
<col>942</col>
at Welwick, that the Government stepped in and insisted upon the small holdings committee taking over that farm. Then he went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"Considering the courtesy the committee had shown to the Board of Agriculture, he thought that Department wanting in courtesy to send down their inspectors in the way they did and give the committee no option in the matter."</quote>
He went on afterwards to say if that was the course which was going to be pursued by the Board of Agriculture he would advise the committee, of which he was one, to refuse to act in future. I think your Lordships will agree that that does not look as if the county council supported the action of the noble Earl.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member>: <membercontribution>I quite accept what the noble Marquess says; but, of course, I cannot be responsible for Alderman Sticknell's remarks. He says that the county council were not treated with courtesy by the Board of Agriculture. But what did Lord Wenlock, the chairman of the county council, say?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY </member>: <membercontribution>I have his speech here.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member>: <membercontribution>Quite so. He said every possible assistance had been given by the Commissioners to the county council. Some other members of the county council said that this unfortunate man, Mr. Clark, had been turned out of his home. There was, however, not a word of truth in that statement. He was never turned out of his home, and I really cannot, as your Lordships will see, be held responsible for statements made by independent members of the East Riding County Council.<lb/>
I hope your Lordships will not think I am detaining you too long if I now say a few words on the question of compensation It is, as your Lordships will agree, an important question. I was twitted in the course of the debate about the Land Tenure Act, 1906. What really happened then was this. I thought that under the Compensation for Disturbance Clause we ought to bring in compensation under certain circumstances for farmers whose land was taken away for small holdings. I consulted the best opinion in England on the subject and asked, What had we better do? Shall we bring it into the clause or
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0496"/>
<col>943</col>
not? My friend said "No," and he did so for two reasons. The House of Lords, he said, is dead against the compensation clause as it stands; it will be a wonderful thing if it is allowed to go through the House of Lords, and I do not think it will be should it be overloaded with compensation for farmers. That was one of the opinions expressed to me. The second reason given was that landlords would raise the rents of small holders to an impossible height in order to recoup themselves for the amount paid in compensation to the farmers. A provision to afford such compensation was not, therefore, put into the Land Tenure Bill.<lb/>
When the Small Holdings Bill of 1907 was under consideration by a Standing Committee of the other House a proposal was made by a Liberal member, Mr. Soares, to give compensation for tenant farmers who had land taken from them to be converted into small holdings, and that proposal was backed up by the whole of the Unionist members. It was pointed out, however, that it would be impossible&#x2014;it would not have been right and it could not have been justified&#x2014;to compensate farmers out of the public purse when landlords had not been asked, and would probably have refused, to pay the same compensation out of their private purse. A Division was taken on the subject in Committee, but the Unionist members saw the force of that contention. The result was that the whole question of compensation was at the time dropped like a hot potato, and we heard nothing more about it.<lb/>
Perhaps I may be permitted to say that, whatever are the equities of the case as between a private landlord and a tenant, there is great force in the argument that a tenant has special ground for compensation where land is acquired for small holdings by county councils under the Act. In furtherance of a great national policy, which we hope will keep the people on the land, machinery has been set up which must inevitably bring prematurely to an end tenancies which must otherwise have existed for years to the satisfaction of owner and occupier. It is said&#x2014;and I will admit the truth of it&#x2014;that we have introduced a new and disturbing element into rural life. I repeat that I believe that is perfectly true; but, at the same time, I am convinced that what we have done
<col>944</col>
will stir up the sluggish waters of rural life and convert them into living streams. This, of course, may entail changes and movements which may put farmers to some inconvenience and expense. It follows, therefore, that this class are the strongest critics of the Small Holdings Act. They are reluctant to see it put into force, not only on their own farms, but on the farms of their neighbours; and, naturally, they enlist the sympathy of the landlords, some of whom are unwilling to bring tenancies to an end for the sake of what they probably consider to be a problematic advantage to themselves and others.<lb/>
I am glad to be able to say that this question has been raised in the Commons House of Parliament by Mr. Corrie Grant, a Liberal member, who was one of the great protagonists of the small holdings movement in days gone by. The Bill which he has introduced has been backed not only by Mr. Soares and other Liberal members, but by persons on all sides of the House. including the chairman of the Central Chamber of Agriculture. I think I may go so far as to say that the Government should approach the consideration of that Bill at any rate with sympathy, and with a full recognition of the strength of the case as it is presented to them. But, of course this must naturally be a question of degree, as it would obviously be ridiculous to compensate a man who has more land than he can manage, or the tenant of a large holding of which he is only asked to give up a few acres.<lb/>
May I say that I honestly think the criticisms of the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, are not very damaging after all. The Small Holdings Act, as everybody knows, came into force sixteen months ago&#x2014;that is, on January 1, 1908. The first six months, of course, was nothing more than a period of preparation and investigation. The county councils formed committees to work the Act, and they received in round figures 23,000 applications. Of that number 13,000 have been approved as suitable to be given small holdings, and up to the present 2,200 applicants have been provided for; 500 persons are in actual possession of 11,346 acres, besides which there are the small holdings provided by co-operative societies&#x2014;about 200 on a thousand acres&#x2014;and those provided by the landlords direct. The total amount of land
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0497"/>
<col>945</col>
acquired voluntarily is 31,663 acres, and the compulsory orders applied for have reference to 4,853 acres. The total amount of land comprised in the schemes and orders submitted is, therefore, 36,516 acres. The value of the land the county councils have purchased is &#x00A3;370,000, and the estimated value of the leased land together with the purchased land is three-quarters of a million. The county councils, as is well known, have a right to renew a lease at the end of whatever term it runs for, subject to the decision of a valuer appointed by the Board of Agriculture.<lb/>
All that I have stated to your Lordships regarding the present results of the operations of the Act has been accomplished in pratically ten months. I do not want to boast or to swagger in any way whatsoever, but I really do not think this a bad record for ten months work. The noble Earl who brought forward this matter should remember that if you throw this small holdings legislation into the melting pot again his amendments would not be the only ones that would have to be considered; but other amendments might be submitted to which possibly he would have the greatest objection. It now only remains for me to thank your Lordships for the kind way in which you have listened to&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH </member>: <membercontribution>I hope the noble Earl will pardon my interrupting him, but I should be glad if, before he concludes his observations, he would deal with one point in which I think everybody is most interested. I refer to the relative amount of rent which the small holder is asked to pay as compared with the sitting tenant. Can the noble Earl give your Lordships his view as to what rent the small holder should pay for land on which he is being placed and which is being taken away from the sitting tenant? As I understand, in many cases, county councils charge 3s. or 4s. an acre for administration, and the landlord, I believe, in some cases is increasing his rent as well. Consequently it seems is to me you will get a whole series of small tenures throughout the country at a higher rate per acre than the sitting tenant has been paying.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member>: <membercontribution>A higher rent than the sitting farm tenants are paying?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH </member>: <membercontribution>Yes.

Can the noble Earl inform your Lordships what he thinks should be the relative position between the rent the sitting tenant now pays and the rent which the small holder will be asked to pay by the county council? I am sure we shall be glad to hear the noble Earl's views on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member>: <membercontribution>That is a very difficult question to answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH </member>: <membercontribution>It is a most important one.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member>: <membercontribution>It is a question which is almost impossible of answer off-hand, because&#x2014;and nobody knows it better than the noble Duke&#x2014;the value of land varies in different parts of the country. I must say, however, that while the world is as it is there is one law for the rich and one for the poor; and when a man has a small piece of land I am afraid we shall never be able to get the present condition of affairs altered, but the small holder will always have to pay more than the large holder.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH </member>: <membercontribution>Does the noble Earl think that fair?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member>: <membercontribution>I do not. I think it is extremely unfair. If a man has a small piece of land and wants a house you build him a house on that land, but you charge him four per cent. on the outlay. What, on the other hand, do you do with the farmer? You give him a house together with stiles, ditches, ponds, barns, and every possible convenience for carrying on the operations of his farm. You throw those things in, as it were. I think landowners may take this to themselves. If it is proved&#x2014;and I think it will be able to be proved&#x2014;that men can work small pieces of land and pay their way, and that they and their families can live while paying a rent for the house in addition to the cost of the land they till, then landlords might very well say to farmers, "What can be done in the green tree can be done in the dry "; and they could increase their rents by charging farmers what would be the proper letting value of the house in addition to the letting of the land, whereas at the present moment, as I have pointed out, the house is thrown in. I think there is a great deal in what the noble Duke says, but how any suitable adjustment is to be made in the conditions as between the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0498"/>
<col>947</col>
two classes of tenants I confess I am at the moment unable to say. Only one word more. I wish to thank your Lordships for having listened to me for half an hour on this subject, and to express the gratitude I feel to you. I do ask the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, most respectfully, not to try to throw this legislation into the melting pot again, but to allow us to go on with our work and endeavour, without undue haste, to try to satisfy the requirements of those who only ask to be allowed to make a living on the land of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I should like to endorse what fell from my noble friend Lord Harrowby with regard to the important question of loans to owners of property, and, through them, to occupiers of small holdings. One of the points on which everything turns is, I believe, the facilities which are available for obtaining money for improvements. I have had practical experience myself, as no doubt many of your Lordships have, of cases which show the great difficulty there is for a poor man who has no capital of his own to borrow money on anything like favourable terms. There is a great deal of trouble about it, a great deal of red-tape; and many charges are made on him which do not help the situation, but simply put money into the pockets of this or that official. I daresay this state of things is rather inevitable under the present system, but if the noble Earl could give the House some idea that he would assist in solving this important point it would be a matter of great satisfaction to a large number of people. If greater facilities for obtaining loans, such as exist in Ireland, were given in this country, I am sure that much of the difficulty now experienced by small holders would disappear.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am quite sure that at this late hour your Lordships do not desire that this discussion should be prolonged; but there are a few words I should like to say on the subject. I wish to thank the noble Earl opposite for the very interesting speech he has made and to assure him that it was not one bit too long. On the contrary, there were several points which, if the discussion had come on at a more suitable period, we should have desired to have seen elaborated. I think I may respectfully complain of the closing remarks in
<col>948</col>
the noble Earl's speech when he took to task my noble friend Lord Onslow for what he described as "throwing into the melting pot" the whole of the small holdings question. I am quite certain that was not the intention of my noble friend, neither was it the effect of his observations. All he did was to ask for certain information on various specific points. I made a list of those points&#x2014;I am not going to read it&#x2014;and I am not quite sure whether the noble Earl opposite answered two or three of them. In fact, I believe he did not answer more than two of the questions put to him. I think that is a pity.<lb/>
In my opinion it would have been far better had the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture devoted his great knowledge of this subject to solving some of the very difficult points of administration to which my noble friend called attention. The truth of the matter is, they all resolve themselves into the financial difficulty. When the noble Earl opposite complains of some counties because they are not so forward as other counties, he ought, I think, in justice to those counties, to realise fully that the backward counties shrink from the great expense which would be thrown not only on the county councils themselves, but on the small holders as well, if they were to carry out the Act with any precipitancy. It is quite evident that a county like Surrey differs from a county like Norfolk, and, if I may say so, it is a waste of the noble Earl's breath to ask that as Norfolk is able to carry out a particular policy why does not Surrey do the same.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I suggested Kent.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY </member>: <membercontribution>Kent, no doubt, is a little better county to take as an illustration. The truth, however, is that when small holders ask, as they do, to have holdings in the near neighbourhood of towns, the financial difficulties are almost insuperable. I am a member of the small holdings committee of my own county, and I know that what I say is the case. Take the large rising urban community of Watford. The County Council of Hertfordshire are face to face with a great difficulty in respect to Watford because land in the neighbourhood of that town is extremely valuable. Even if land is not bought out and out in such a neighbourhood
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0499"/>
<col>949</col>
as that, its occupation value is very high. It is land which is valuable for all sorts of purposes, and the fact that it is in the neighbourhood of a town necessarily raises its price. If the small holder is to be asked to pay a rent based on the value of land of that description, all I can say is that his enterprise, no matter how well he cultivates the land, cannot pay. That is the difficulty which meets us in all directions. I hope the noble Earl opposite will use his authority in the Department over which he presides in order to prevent any undue addition to the expenditure which is necessarily thrown upon county councils.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member>: <membercontribution>Certainly.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY </member>: <membercontribution>I am glad to hear that, because I saw a letter from the Board of Agriculture not long ago finding fault with some plans submitted to that Department on the ground that some of the houses were not sufficiently elaborate. A policy of that kind is fatal. If the Board of Agriculture are going to behave like other Government Departments and force unnecessary expenditure on the localities in respect of the buildings provided for the small holders they will make the experiment fail. The noble Earl just now quoted a very great authority on the subject, Miss Jebb. If he reads her book thoroughly he will see that in her opinion small holdings can only be made to pay if expenditure on buildings, and so forth, is cut down to the lowest possible figure. I hope he will see that this lady's advice in that respect is carried out, as it is in other matters, and will take care that his Department do not try to force county councils to spend more money than they ought to do.<lb/>
There is one question I should like to put to the noble Earl opposite. My noble friend asked him what the policy of the Government was, but the noble Earl did not say much about it. I desire to ask him, for the guidance of county councils, what kind of persons he wishes to see established on the land in possession of small holdings. I think my noble friend put the question to him&#x2014;it was one of the many questions which, if I may say so, he did not reply to&#x2014;Are they to be persons who are really intending to make their living by agriculture, or is the acquisition of a small holding to be an additional enterprise for people engaged in other work
<col>950</col>
and whose income comes from sources other than the cultivation of the land&#x2014;people, that is to say, to whom a small holding would be only a pleasureable addition to their lives, an amenity which they would not otherwise possess? I can assure the noble Earl that we have had difficulties of this kind in Hertfordshire. Persons have come before us saying that they want small holdings, and it has turned out that they belonged, if not to the upper class, at any rate to the higher middle class, to whom small holdings are not a means of gaining a livelihood, but merely an amenity to their lives.<lb/>
I trust that a suitable opportunity will be found&#x2014;perhaps to-night would not be thought a fitting occasion&#x2014;for the noble Earl to state, for the guidance of county councils, whether the Government expect small holdings to be provided for persons of that kind, or whether they really intend them to be devoted to the use of people engaged in agriculture. Perhaps the noble Earl would like to say something on the subject now.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member>: <membercontribution>If I am not wearying the House I will say a word on the subject. The answer, I think, is that of course the ideal people to be put in possession of small holdings would be persons absolutely and entirely connected with the land. Your Lordships will no doubt agree with me in that. But at the same time, while they would be the ideal small holders, you must not rule out a lot of other people to whom the possession of a piece of land would be the greatest possible convenience. I do not mean fashionable, upper-class people who are friends of the noble Marquess; but why should you rule out the village higgler, the village butcher, or the village baker? Why should the a village butcher's wife not have a place where she can rear a few fowls and keep a cow? The Act is a beneficial Act, and we ought to bring under its operation as far as we reasonably can all the people who want land. What is the object of refusing land? What would do more to make a man stay, say, in a country town and give him an interest in the place than to provide him with a little piece of land where he could grow flowers or vegetables? I wish to say very plainly that land ought not to be, and must not be, refused to people who live in the villages simply because they are not absolutely and
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0500"/>
<col>951</col>
entirely connected with agricultural pursuits. It ought to be for everybody.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY </member>: <membercontribution>I quite agree with what the noble Earl has said as regards the village higgler, the butcher, and the baker, but I do not think the same rule should apply in the case, say, of a clerk&#x2014;whose business is in London or in a large country town. Does the noble Earl say that a person of that description ought to have a small holding?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member>: <membercontribution>He might not have an objection to keeping a horse or a pony.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member>: <membercontribution>Probably others of His Majesty's subjects would not object to doing so either; but the question is whether these drastic powers under an Act of Parliament ought to be put in force to secure land for a man of that class. The noble Earl has not only defended compulsion, but the eviction of tenant farmers. Can you be surprised if a tenant farmer who is evicted in order that a clerk in a country town may have a small holding resents it very much indeed? I venture to say to the noble Earl that if he goes about urging county councils to evict tenant farmers for purposes of that kind he will incur an amount of unpopularity which even his good humour will not be able to face.<lb/>
For my own part I have always used my influence, such as I have, in my own county in the direction of reducing the application of the powers of compulsion to the smallest possible dimensions. I believe it is far better to wait a few months or even a year or two, in order to get the land by voluntary arrangement and in a good-natured manner than to apply the compulsory powers given under the Act. The dedication of the land which is so taken is of the highest importance. In that connection I repeat that to evict a tenant farmer who is really engaged in agriculture and is living by agriculture in order to put into a small holding a person who only looks on it as an addition or even an amenity to a life and career otherwise disposed of would create hardship and would be bitterly resented. I think my noble friend Lord Onslow will be satisfied with having raised the discussion; but I am sure &#x2014;though I have no authority from him to say it&#x2014;he would have been
<col>952</col>
better pleased if the noble Earl had answered his Questions.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I should like to offer one observation, though, of course, not from an official standpoint, because I have no authority to speak for the Board of Agriculture. The noble Marquess has raised a very important point, but it is one which I suggest the county council itself ought to decide. The council has to satisfy itself, in the first place, that people who apply for the land are likely to farm it well and to a profit, and pay rent. I suppose that would rule out a great many of the poor of the urban class. It seems to me, however, that one ought to approach the matter not only from the standpoint of the man himself, but to realise that what we hope to see arising out of the movement is a new generation of small holders. I think one ought also to take into consideration not only whether a man himself will benefit the declining years of his life, or rather the later period of his life, but whether the result of his possession of a small holding will be to produce in his family a taste for the land, a knowledge of how to till it, and a desire to stay on it. If that effect is produced, and, after all, that is our object, I should have thought the county councils, having the possibility of such a result in mind, would use their discrimination wisely in letting, small holdings to the kind of people through whom that result was likely to be produced. I thank your Lordships for allowing me to say these few words.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE NEW SPIRIT AND TOBACCO DUTIES.</title>
<p><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government if it is a fact that the Excise are charging all traders taking spirits and tobacco out of bond the proposed extra duties; if so, is it legal for the Excise to do so, and what authority have they for such action; and, if it is not legal, will the Government direct the extra duties to be refunded at once on application of the payees?<lb/>
I hope to get from His Majesty's Government some information on a point of constitutional law. I have always understood, and I think most people would agree with me, that no tax could be levied on the people of this country except under the authority of an Act of Parliament; that
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0501"/>
<col>953</col>
is to say, that the proposals for new taxes should come before both Houses of Parliament, should receive the Royal assent, and should be published in the <i>Gazette</i> before they took effect. I am informed, however, that the authority under which the Excise at the present moment are demanding the new duties proposed in the Budget, and now under discussion, is a Resolution of the House of Commons, and that immediately the Chancellor of the Exchequer introduces the Budget the new taxes which he proposes in that Budget come into effect. But surely, my Lords, no Resolution of either House of Parliament can override the constitutional law of the land. If I am right in that, then surely the Excise in demanding these duties are acting illegally. In Sir William Harcourt's Budget, which was defeated at a later period, the extra impost there proposed was refunded, but, of course, that refund was only made to those traders who had dealt direct with the Excise and paid the impost to them. The customer, the man in the street, who had to pay extra money for the things he required had no possible chance of ever being repaid. I am rather astonished if what I have stated is true, that it is only a Resolution that authorises this charge being made. The fact that such a Resolution has been passed should not be allowed to infringe the constitutional rights of the people of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the Leader of the House has asked me to reply to the noble Lord. The noble Lord is quite right in assuming that the proposed new duties are being charged on all traders taking spirits and tobacco out of bond.</membercontribution></p>
<col>954</col>
<p><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member>: <membercontribution>It applies to some banking transactions also, I believe.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND</member>: <membercontribution>So be it. I assume it does. But all this is being done in accordance with an established practice by which the Treasury authorises the Commissioners of Customs and Excise to levy new duties from the date of the passing of the relative Resolution in Committee of the House of Commons. This is the information which I am authorised to convey to the noble Lord. I may refer him for further information to the note on page 589 of the 1906 edition of Sir Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice, where he will find fuller details on the point.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member>: <membercontribution>Can the noble Lord tell me whether these duties must be authorised by an Act of Parliament?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND</member>: <membercontribution>The new duty is subsequently legalised. This is the established practice by which all these duties are levied as from the date of the passing of the Resolution. As the noble Lord knows, the passing of the Resolution is a preliminary stage and is followed by the introduction into the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the Finance Bill. The assent given by the House to the Finance Bill is the machinery by which the practice to which the noble Lord alludes is legalised.<lb/>

<title>BOARD OF EDUCATION SCHEME (CHESHUNT COLLEGE) CONFIRMATION BILL. [H.L]</title>
<p>Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p>*<membercontribution>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT WOLVERHAMPTON)</membercontribution>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have to ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading to this Bill, the reasons for which formed the subject of an elaborate Report of February 5, 1909, presented by the Board of Education in the matter of this charity known as Cheshunt College. The scheme has been prepared at the request of the governors of the charity, and is now submitted for confirmation by Parliament. All the notices have been given which Parliament requires in legislation of this description. Every opportunity has been afforded for lodging objections, but there has been no opposition, and this is practically an unopposed Bill having the approval of the Charity Commissioners and the Board of Education. The college was founded in 1768 by the Countess of Huntingdon and the trust of the foundation is contained in a deed dated 1793, which was altered in 1866 and in 1884 by the Charity Commissioners and in 1906 by a scheme of the Board of Education. There are, however, some restrictions of a rather rigid character affecting the trustees, teaching staff and students of the college which it is desired to remove. The authorities,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0503"/>
<col>957</col>
after the most careful consideration, are of opinion that the charity is very much impeded by one or two restrictions, and this Bill proposes to deal with that question. I beg to move that the Bill be read a second time.<lb/>

<p>Order of the Day for the House to be put into Committee, read.</p>
<p>Moved, "That the House do resolve itself into Committee."&#x2014;(<i>Lord Alverstone</i>.)</p>
<p>On Question, Motion agreed to.</p>
<p>House in Committee accordingly.</p>
<p>[The EARL of ONSLOW in the CHAIR.]</p>
<p>Clause 1:</p>
<p><member>LORD JAMES OF HEREFORD</member> <membercontribution>had two Amendments on the Paper, the effect of which was that where a woman was charged with the murder of her infant child and the Court was of opinion that at the time the offence was committed the woman had not fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child, the Judge might direct the jury that they might acquit the prisoner on the charge of murder and convict her of manslaughter. He reminded their Lordships that when the Bill was read a second time there was not only a very strong feeling in its favour,
<col>958</col>
but the wish was expressed that the Bill should be extended. In the cause of humanity no woman who had been sentenced to death for the murder of her infant child during the past sixty or seventy years had been executed, and it was desired to avoid what might almost be called the farce of the solemn sentence of death being passed with the knowledge that it would never be carried into effect. The point was that if the sentence was so barbarous that it ought never to be carried out, it was too barbarous to be passed. In his opinion the Judge and the jury were better persons in the face of the public than the Home Secretary to determine what the sentence should be. The Judge and the jury had a great advantage, for in these cases much depended upon the appearance and demeanour of the accused. That which might represent one thing in a brazen woman represented another in a fragile broken down woman; and he suggested that, in the circumstances described in the clause, the Judge should be empowered to direct the jury that they might acquit the prisoner on the charge of murder and convict her of manslaughter. His Amendment was somewhat in rivalry with an Amendment standing on the Paper in the name of the Lord Steward, who proposed to move that in lieu of passing a sentence of death the Judge should sentence the woman to penal servitude for life or for a term of not less than three years. He (Lord James) could not give way to the Lord Steward, because he did not think this Amendment merciful enough. There were cases in which the unfortunate woman ought not to receive a sentence of three years penal servitude, and he therefore hoped the Committee would agree that the punishment should be in the discretion of the Judge. There was also an Amendment on the Paper in the name of Lord Ashbourne. He did not desire to anticipate his noble and learned friend's Amendment, but wished to assure him of his hearty support. He (Lord James), would now move his first Amendment.<lb/>
Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 1, line 5, to leave out the words 'convicted of' and to insert the words 'charged with.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord James of Hereford.</i>)</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT CROSS</member>, <membercontribution>as a former Home Secretary who had had a large experience of these cases, thanked the Lord Chief Justice for bringing forward the Bill, and
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0504"/>
<col>959</col>
hoped he would see no objection to Lord James of Hereford's Amendment. He thought the alteration which Lord James proposed would very much improve the Bill, as it brought in the Judge and the jury in place of the Home Secretary to determine what the sentence should be.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> <membercontribution>accepted the view that it would be better if the Judge and jury could reduce the conviction to manslaughter in the limited number of cases which he thought ought to be brought within the purview of the Bill. He was, therefore, prepared to accept the Amendment; but it would be impossible for him to accept the subsequent Amendment to be moved by Lord Ashbourne. If Lord James's Amendment were agreed to the clause would require a further Amendment making it clear that the conviction of manslaughter should be the result of evidence given at the trial. He would, therefore, suggest that instead of employing the words "the court is of opinion," which were inappropriate in view of Lord James's Amendment, the words "upon the trial evidence is given" should be substituted. The provision would then read&#x2014;
<quote>"Where a woman is charged with the murder of her infant child and upon the trial evidence is given that at the time the offence was committed the woman had not fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child" etc.</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member> <membercontribution>said that the course taken in regard to this subject was a very happy augury for law reform. He hoped that noble and learned Lords would at all times try and meet one another in regard to these subjects, which touched the interests of the community very closely although they did not excite great public interest. He accepted the view which seemed to prevail in the Committee that Lord James's Amendment should be adopted in lieu of that which appeared on the Paper in the name of the Lord Steward, and in that Lord Beauchamp agreed. He firmly believed that Lord James's Amendment would constitute a very real and substantial advance. Instead of providing that there should be a record in lieu of pronouncement of sentence, the Amendment proposed that it should be competent, in certain circumstances, for the Judge to direct the jury that they might find a verdict of manslaughter which excluded the death penalty altogether. He heartily supported the Amendment, but his approbation was not
<col>960</col>
conditional upon the refusal of the Amendment to be moved later by Lord Ashbourne, which he (the Lord Chancellor) also supported.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> <membercontribution>said the reason he could not accept the Home Office Amendment standing in the name of Lord Beauchamp was that he had himself not infrequently in cases of manslaughter inflicted a penalty of only six months. He would be very sorry to have to sentence some of these poor people to penal servitude for a term of not less than three years.<lb/>
On Question, Amendment agreed to.<lb/>
Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 1, line 6, to leave out the words 'the court is of opinion' and to insert the words 'upon the trial evidence is given.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Alverstone</i>.)</quote><lb/>
On Question, Amendment agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> <membercontribution>moved to further amend the clause so that the court might, "having regard to all the circumstances of the case," adopt the course proposed in the clause. The question dealt with was, he said, an exceedingly difficult one. It was by no means as easy as a person looking at it superficially would suppose. It was desirable to retain every possible safeguard for the preservation of infant life, and not by any suggestion in legislation or speech to indicate that the life of a little child was not to be regarded as worthy of every protection. This Bill sought to obviate what had grown into almost a scandal in the passing of sentences of death which it was known would never be carried out. He agreed with the Lord Chief Justice as far as he had gone, but was afraid that if the clause stood in its present form without some addition it would have but a very slender operation. lie words were&#x2014;
<quote>"Where the court is of opinion that at the time the offence was committed the woman had not fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child."</quote><lb/>
If, therefore, the mother had recovered from the effects of giving birth to the child she would get no protection at all from this measure. A strong and healthy young woman might in a very short time recover from the effects of childbirth and be physically restored to health. But the time of her difficulties would not be over. It might be that after that she would
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0505"/>
<col>961</col>
have to face desertion by the man who should have most protected her, or she might be cast off by her family or be thrown out of employment, or sickness and destitution might reach her and she might be subjected to tremendous temptation. He did not think it desirable that in such a case it should be impossible to give the woman the protection of this measure. Unless some such Amendment as he proposed were adopted the old formula would have to be gone through, and the woman convicted of murder and sentenced to death, followed by an appeal to the Home Office for the exercise of the prerogative of mercy. He had sought to deal with this point by adding the words, "or having regard to all the circumstances of the case." He admitted that these words were, perhaps, rather too general, and might be not sufficiently precise; and he would be very glad to consider whether other words could not be found that would widen somewhat the wording of the provision in the Bill without making it too elastic. The Lord Chief Justice had declared that he could not accept the proposed words, and that if the Amendment were carried it would be fatal to the Bill. As that was the view of his noble and learned friend he thought the matter might be allowed to stand over till the next stage, and in the meantime he would endeavour to present the Amendment in a form which would be free from objection.<lb/>
Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"In page 1, line 8, to leave out the word 'and,' and to insert the words 'or having regard to all the circumstances of the case.'"&#x2014;(<i>Lord Ashbourne.</i>)</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> <membercontribution>could not accept the Amendment because it would place the most dangerous responsibility upon the Judge of deciding whether he ought to direct a verdict of murder or of manslaughter. There were many cases of the death of children between the ages of six months and a year, after the mother had quite recovered and where there was strong ground for thinking that the child had been got rid of. If the Amendment were adopted it would be open to the Judge in all cases to direct the jury that they might bring in a verdict of manslaughter instead of murder. That would be done before the verdict was given, and the considerations which would influence the Judge in making his recommendations to the Home Secretary were to influence his mind as to what direction should
<col>962</col>
be given to the jury. It amounted to this, that whenever an infant child was murdered by the mother the Judge had to consider before he directed the jury whether or not he might tell them that they could bring in a verdict of manslaughter. That went further than anything that had been hitherto proposed. His objection to it was that it placed upon the Judge in all cases of the murder of a child by the mother the responsibility of deciding whether he ought to direct a verdict of murder or of manslaugther. He asked their Lordships to say that they would not break down the principle that the death sentence should not depend upon any discretion of the learned Judge, but would define the cases in which they wished the jury to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter. He could not take responsibility for the Bill if the words proposed were inserted.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD JAMES OF HEREFORD</member> <membercontribution>still hoped they might convert the Lord Chief Justice to seeing that they were not imposing too great a burden upon Judges by this Amendment. His noble and learned friend had pictured the great responsibility that would rest upon a Judge if this Amendment were carried. Every Judge who had to try a case of murder now bore that responsibility. In cases of murder it was the Judge's duty now to tell the jury that they might bring in a verdict of manslaughter. The responsibility which it was proposed by the Amendment to cast upon the Judge and jury now rested upon the Home Secretary, who might not be a lawyer and who altered a sentence according to information brought to him behind the scenes. Why was it better to give this power to the Home Secretary in preference to giving it to the learned Judge? The Judge would act with the additional safeguard that the jury would see that sentimentality did not prevail. The Judge was capable of bearing this responsibility to a much greater extent than any Home Secretary. Whilst he felt strongly that the Amendment was a wise and merciful one, and one that, in the cause of humanity, ought to be accepted, still they must be practical in the matter; and he suggested that the Amendment might be withdrawn with a view to arriving at a form of words which would meet with general agreement.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member> <membercontribution>said the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0506"/>
<col>963</col>
Amendment moved by Lord Ashbourne would, in his opinion, be a very useful addition to the Bill. It was now agreed that in cases where the woman at the time the offence was committed had not fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child the jury should find a verdict of manslaughter; but there ought to be something further than that. Whether that something further was expressed properly in the words of Lord Ashbourne's Amendment might be open to question, and he thought it would be desirable, in the circumstances to postpone the consideration of the Amendment to the Report stage. Without the Amendment he was afraid the Bill would amount to uncommonly little. He could not understand the curious objection of the Lord Chief Justice to taking responsibility for the Bill with this Amendment incorporated. He thought it would become the noble and learned Lord better than his ermine, because he would not only then have the power of punishing but also the power of mercy.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member> <membercontribution>said his opinion remained absolutely unchanged that the Bill as it stood was inadequate. So far as it went he approved of it, but it was obvious that it left unredressed and undealt with a number of cases that required consideration. He agreed that his proposed words might be considered too vague and general. He therefore asked permission to withdraw the Amendment with a view to seeing whether before the Report stage a form of words could not be arrived at which would be free from objection and at the same time give that widening to the Bill which he thought it required.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> <membercontribution>asked the Lord Chancellor to take the case of a servant girl who, nine months after the birth of her child, when she had perfectly recovered, strangled the child and threw the body into the river. On what ground could it be suggested that the Judge ought to direct the jury that that might be a case in which the sentence could be reduced? He was thankful to say that every Home Secretary he had known had always adopted the suggestion of the Judges as to mercy. He constantly sent to the Home Secretary a recommendation as to the alteration of a sentence and the exercise of mercy, and therefore there was no shirking on his part from that responsibility. He opposed the Amendment because he was unwilling that
<col>964</col>
there should be any power in the Judge to say whether the punishment was to be one of death or not.<lb/>

<p><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member> <membercontribution>asked the Committee to consider whether the Amendments were in order. The Bill as read a second time was a Bill to enable sentence of death to be recorded without being actually pronounced in cases of child murder where the Judge was satisfied that the sentence was not likely to be carried out. That was the substance of the Bill then. But now it was proposed to alter the law of England. It seemed to him that the Amendments were absolutely out of order.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member> <membercontribution>said he had handed in Amendments both to Clause 2 and to the Title of the Bill which had been rendered necessary in consequence of the adoption of Lord James's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member> <membercontribution>said that would not put the Amendments in order. After a Bill had been read a second time only its machinery could be altered. They could only put things into the Bill which were applicable to its purpose and object. As amended in Committee, this became a Bill to alter the law of England.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member> <membercontribution>said it was quite true that the Title was not large enough after the adoption of Lord James's Amendment, but he understood that that was to be put right by an Amendment to the Title.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE.</title>
<p><member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE rose</member> <membercontribution>to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War (1) What is the total (<i>a</i>) combatant (<i>b</i>) non-combatant establishment of the Expeditionary Force; what number of officers and men of the Regular Army at present available will be included in this force; (2) what number of officers and men will be drawn from the Special Reserve (<i>a</i>) combatant (<i>b</i>) non-combatant; what number of men, if any, will be sent abroad under twenty years of age; (4) what number of officers and men over twenty years of age at present on the strength of the Regular Army will remain in this country to replace the wastage of war after the Expeditionary Force has left (<i>a</i>) combatant (<i>b</i>) non-combatant; (5) what force could be mobilised at home of men of not less than one year's service after the Expeditionary Force has been despatched, dividing (<i>a</i>) Regulars from (<i>b</i>) Special Reserve, as the existing strength of these forces.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Viscount said </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, in putting again to the noble Lord who represents the War Office in your Lordships' House the Questions which stand in my name on the Paper, I trust that I may find him in a more communicative mood than on the last occasion. I can assure the noble Lord that in putting these Questions I do not desire him to disclose any mobilisation secrets. What I wish to know is whether
<col>966</col>
we are right in understanding that the strength of the Expeditionary Force is, as has been stated, 160,000 men, and whether these 160,000 men are made up in the following way: 60,000 Regulars serving with the Colours, 70,000 Reservists, and 30,000 Special Reservists; and, if so, whether the noble Lord thinks that in the event of mobilisation this number is likely to be forthcoming complete in every detail. What we want to know is, after the Expeditionary Force has left this country, what would remain in the country for its defence. That, generally, is the main purport of the Questions that I wish to put to the noble Lord. I venture to think that every foreign attach&#x00E9; in London at the present time could give us the information involved in these Questions, and I therefore fail to see why it should be considered against the public interest that a full answer should be given. If, however, we are to infer that it would be contrary to the interests of the War Office that this information should be forthcoming so that the real truth of the matter should be made known, I trust that the noble Lord will tell us that that is so.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am afraid I have very little to add to what I said last week when the noble Viscount first put these Questions. Since last week we have been very carefully into the matter, and the result of the close investigations which we have made into the question of how far it is desirable to give information of this nature is this. We find that already we give far more information in this country with regard to what our plans would be in case of war than any other country in the world. But even we do not give the information which the noble Viscount asks for in these Questions, and in no country that I can think of would they dream of giving answers to questions of this kind.<lb/>
We are always prepared to give establishments when they are asked for; and, with regard to establishments, the noble Viscount will find the answer to that part of his first Question in the Government publication known as War Establishments. The rest of these Questions do deal with our position on mobilisation, and if they were fully answered they undoubtedly would reveal our strength on mobilisation
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0508"/>
<col>967</col>
and our weaknesses. For I fully admit that until the present scheme has had time to mature, until it has reached the normal, until the men we are proposing to find under the new categories have had time to accumulate, there are certain to be weaknesses. We have always said that it will take a certain number of years before any Army scheme can become anything near perfection. Whilst those gaps which we are filling, and filling rapidly, exist, it would not be expedient to state publicly what they are. For that reason I regret it is impossible to give the noble Viscount the information for which he has asked. I would only repeat the invitation I gave him last week. We have no desire to conceal from noble Lords what the position is, and we shall be only too glad, if the noble Viscount cares to come across to the War Office, to put the figures before him; but we do not propose to make them public.<lb/>
When I gave this refusal last week the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, said that I ought to have quoted precedent in this matter. He quoted as a precedent for his point of view the fact that Lord Lansdowne, whose absence to-night we particularly deplore, gave in January, 1900, the strength of the troops that were then in this country; and that he himself gave the strength of the troops forming his six Army Corps. Neither of those cases is any precedent for the giving of the information asked for by Viscount Hardinge. Lord Midleton's Return was in no sense a mobilisation plan. It was simply a statement of the contemporary peace strength of the units concerned, and that is all the world apart from what the noble Viscount is asking for. As the noble Viscount wishes for precedents I will give him two. On March 29, 1900, the noble Earl, Lord Wemyss, asked, in your Lordships' House, for a Return showing the state and organisation of our home defensive force on February 20, 1900; and Lord Lansdowne, in reply, said&#x2014;
<quote>"I can assure the noble Earl that I am most anxious not to withhold from him or from your Lordships' House any information upon such points as those which are referred to in the Motion of which the noble Earl has given notice; but I must add that I believe it would be contrary to usage and not in the public interest that the Return should be given, and if the noble Earl moves for it I shall, with much regret, be obliged to ask the House not to give it to him."</quote>
I can give your Lordships another precedent. On July 17, 1905, Lord Wemyss
<col>968</col>
asked the Under-Secretary of State for War&#x2014;
<quote>"What is the present district or divisional organisation of the Army Militia and Volunteers in the matter of commands, transport and armaments including big movable guns of position, and as regards their readiness in all ways to take the field and be transported at shortest notice and within what time to the point on the East coast nearest to their district or divisional headquarters."</quote>
In reply, Lord Donoughmore said&#x2014;
<quote>"I confess at once that I have some difficulty in understanding this Question, but I gather that the noble Earl wishes a great deal of detailed information as to our present mobilisation scheme. It is obvious that it would not be in the public interest that we should give details of our mobilisation scheme. All the information concerning the organisation of the military forces at home and abroad which it is considered desirable to make public is contained in the monthly Army List."</quote><lb/>
With that sentiment I heartily concur. We are, therefore, following the best precedent in this matter. These details revealing mobilisation plans never have been given in the past, and I hope they never will be given in the future. But, as have said, we are perfectly prepared to give the information to the noble Viscount confidentially if he will apply at the War Office for it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD NEWTON</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I trust that this question will not be allowed to remain where it now stands. As far as I am able to gather, the noble Lord who represents the War Office declines to give the information because he says it is contrary to the public interest to do so. At the same time, any Peer who chooses to take the trouble to go to the War Office will have the information supplied to him. Suppose I go to the War Office and ask the noble Lord for these details, will he give them to me?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS </member>: <membercontribution>Yes, if the noble Lord gives us an undertaking that he will not make them public.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD NEWTON</member>: <membercontribution>I am extremely flattered at this mark of confidence. At the same time I really do not see why I, or any other member of this House, should be placed in a more advantageous position than any taxpayer in the United Kingdom. The noble Lord has endeavoured to show that there are no precedents for giving this information. The obvious precedent is what occurred during the Boer War, when Lord Lansdowne was Secretary of State for War. On that occasion Lord
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0509"/>
<col>969</col>
Lansdowne not only gave the figures as to the men, but volunteered the additional information that those men constituted in no sense a Field Army&#x2014;that, in other words, they were of very little value. It is no use for the noble Lord to cite the example of foreign countries. The cases are totally different. In any foreign country there are hundreds of thousands of men really and actually at the disposal of their Government, and the whole course of a campaign might possibly be decided by the speed with which these men could be brought into the fighting line and directed upon a given point. It stands to reason that if they were to disclose their plans it would be of considerable advantage to their possible opponents. But our case is totally different.<lb/>
What on earth is there to conceal? What is there that any human being can fail to understand with regard to our military potentiality. It does not require even a foreign military attach&#x00E9; to discover that behind the Regular Army we have got the Special Reserve and the Territorial Force, and no potential enemy is likely either to be encouraged to attack us or to be dissuaded from that purpose by any information disclosed in answer to these Questions regarding the number of boys who are masquerading as men at the present moment. The only persons who are under any delusion whatever as regards our military position are those simple-minded persons who are still bewildered by what I can only call the blazen claptrap of the present Secretary of State for War. I own that I am a person absolutely devoid of imagination, and all these fine phrases about "clear thinking" and "nations in arms" and all the rest of it make absolutely no impression upon me and do not convey any sort of comfort to me. I look at facts, and the facts that I am able to realise are that the present Secretary of State for War has reduced the Regular Army and its Reserves to an enormous extent, and that he has invented a new name for the old Volunteers and Yeomanry. These are the bare facts of the situation, and no amount of rhetoric ought to divert our attention from them.<lb/>
It is quite natural that, in these circumstances, the Government should be anxious to conceal the situation as much as possible. You can present a very fine figure as long as you confine yourselves to rhetorical images and to eloquent perorations, and
<col>970</col>
are not obliged to produce statistics in plain black and white. I can well understand the reluctance of the noble Lord opposite to give the information we are endeavouring to obtain. Nevertheless, I hope my noble friend and others who take an interest in this matter will persevere until we get this plain statement of facts out of the Government. And when we do get it we shall realise that our position is in no sense better than it was a few years ago, that the Secretary of State for War's Reserves consist largely of paper soldiers, and even these paper men will turn out in many instances to be merely boys. I hope that my noble friend will not be discouraged by his failure this afternoon, but will persevere until he obtains an answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member>: <membercontribution>I do not rise to continue this discussion in view of the very important Motion standing in the name of the Duke of Bedford, but I would ask the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War whether he would kindly tell us&#x2014;and I do not think this would come within the category of excluded subjects&#x2014;what is the total combatant and non-combatant establishment of the Expeditionary Force. That has already been given by the Secretary of State on various occasions. I understand that it is to be something between 150,000 and 160,000, and we should be glad to know whether the Force is to be maintained at that figure or whether there is any change in the policy of the Government in that particular.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>I have said that the noble Viscount will find that information in the Government publication called War Establishments.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member>: <membercontribution>May I ask whether the intention of sending abroad six divisions is still maintained. [<i>No answer</i>.] I crave pardon, but the whole discussion to be raised by the noble Duke depends on that question. We have had the statement in public that six divisions are intended to be sent abroad. I only ask if there is any change in that intention.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>The noble Viscount's question does not seem to me a reasonable one. Precisely how many divisions will go abroad must depend on the exigencies of the occasion.</membercontribution></p>

<section>
<title>THE ARMY.&#x2014;MOTION FOR INQUIRY.</title>
<p>*<member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to call attention to (1) the reductions in the Regular Army and in the Regular Reserve; (2) the deficiency of officers now serving in the Regular Army and in the Special Reserve; (3) the state of the Special Reserve; and to move "That in the opinion of the House, a special inquiry should be instituted into the condition of the Special Reserve, and as to the extent to which officers, non-commissioned officers and men of that force are fitted to discharge the duties of the Regular Reserve which devolve upon them in time of war."<lb/>
We cannot understand what the Government really mean by the Special Reserve or the purpose for which it is created, unless we consider their recent dealings with the Regular Army and the Regular Reserve. The numbers of the Regular Reserve on mobilisation for the South African war failed to complete all the Regiments required for service to war strength. Many, therefore, embarked short of their full establishment. At the conclusion of the war the first care of the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, then at the War Office, was to guard against the recurrence of any such deficiency in the future by at once establishing an amply sufficient Regular Reserve. The Government certainly have good reason to be thankful to the noble Viscount for his success. It is the existence of Lord Midleton's Reserve, now numbering 135,000 men, which alone justifies the present Secretary of State for War in his assertion that by his superior organisation, whilst reducing the Regular Army, he can yet place a stronger force in the field than any of his predecessors. The policy adopted by the noble Viscount was completely successful in creating an ample Regular Reserve. But the periods of service, which suited the formation of a strong Regular Reserve, were not equally suited for the provision of drafts for India.<lb/>
The noble Viscount's successor, Mr. Arnold-Forster, endeavoured to solve the double problem of creating an ample Reserve and at the same time of supplying the Indian drafts by establishing concurrent long and short service enlistment in the Regular Army. His Majesty's Government abolished that system without allowing it a trial. For them the double problem does not exist, because they do not want
<col>972</col>
a large Regular Reserve. They have succeeded to one which to their thinking was unduly inflated. All they had to do was to revert to the same system which, as experience proved, furnished an insufficient Reserve in war, but met the difficulty of the Indian drafts. First, the Government exhibits with pride a Regular Reserve which they have inherited but had not created. Then they reduce its numbers, and end, as I will show you, by substituting for the matured soldiers of the Regular Reserve, immature seventeen-year old boys whose military training consists of six months of squad drill at the dep&#x00F4;t, and whom they describe as Special Reservists. The term "Special" is aptly chosen, for never before have seventeen-year old boys been numbered among the Reserve of a foreign service Army.<lb/>
As your Lordships are aware, nine Reserve-creating <i>cadres</i> of the Regular Army have been disbanded. The number of men actually serving in the home battalions has been diminished giving a diminished Reserve-creating power in the <i>cadre</i> and necessitating an increased number of Reservists to complete Regiments on mobilisation. Then the immaturity of the men serving with the Colours has been augmented owing to boys of seventeen being passed into the Army through the Special Reserve. This means more boys unfit for service, and, again, more men needed from the Reserve on mobilisation. The Army Council must know the ultimate result of disbanding nine Reserve-creating <i>cadres</i> of the Regular Infantry, of decreasing the Reserve-making power of the Army, and of increasing the immaturity of the boys with the Colours. They must know that to substitute the Special Reserve for the Regular Reserve is to rely on untrained boys in the first fighting line in place of trained soldiers. But, regardless of the future, they have given this policy their united and unqualified support.<lb/>
In 1906, it was rumoured that the Government intended to first reduce the Regular Army in order to create new Auxiliary Forces. The soundness of that policy was questioned, and on March 8, 1906, in explaining the Army Estimates, the Secretary of State for War said&#x2014;
<quote>"There was a rumour the other day in the papers that I had decided to recommend the abolition of
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0511"/>
<col>973</col>
ten home battalions of the Line, and I tried to I describe that rumour correctly as a <i>nidus equinus</i>, I which is a polite and classic way of calling it a mare's-nest. If I had decided to do anything of that kind it would have been in military eyes tantamount to insanity."</quote>
A few months passed, and, with the full approval of the Army Council, eight battalions of the Line and one of the Guards were disbanded, and the 3rd Battalion Coldstream Guards sent to Egypt pending disbandment. More recently, last November, in referring to the reductions in the Regular Army, the Secretary of State for War, speaking at Guildford, is reported to have said&#x2014;
<quote>"So far from the Regular Army having been cut down, we are to-day 90,000 stronger than we were three years ago, and yet the Army cost two and a-half millions less."</quote>
That number of 90,000 represents the total establishment of all branches, combatant and non-combatant, of the Special Reserve. I propose to show your Lordships that these 90,000 men are not there, and that, even if the numbers were there, in no sense ought Special Reservists to be counted as equivalent to Regular Reservists.<lb/>
It has been represented that the Special Reserve is the Militia under another name. It is nothing of the kind. To represent it as such was a fiction useful at the moment for the purpose of reconciling Militia officers to the destruction of their force, and of persuading them to transfer to the new force, and to bring their men over with them. Since 1905, the year previous to the commencement of these changes, some 500 officers and 30,000 men have left the Militia Infantry. The partial transfer of the remainder of the Infantry Militia has taken place at a cost of &#x00A3;75,000 in bounties to the men. The purpose served, the fiction is abandoned. The Secretary of State for War, in introducing the Army Estimates this year announces that&#x2014;
<quote>"Of course the Militia has gone."</quote>
The total abolition of the Militia, always intended, is at length acknowledged. The Special Reserve was from the very first meant to be a substitute for the reductions in the Reserve of the Regular Army. A. very sorry substitute for the Reserve of the Regular Army it may be, but it can never carry out the duties of the old Militia force abolished. The Militia has gone, and whatever use the Militia system has
<col>974</col>
been to the country in the past, this is lost now and evermore.<lb/>
The Secretary of State for War, in explaining the Army Estimates this year, informs us&#x2014;
<quote>"Of course the Regular Reserve will come down when we reach the normal, but on the other hand the Special Reserve will go up, and you will get over 200,000."</quote>
We know that the Regular Army has been reduced by 22,000 men, and we see, according to the last Returns, that the Regular Reserve will be diminished by about 20,000 men. As to the amount of the future reductions in the Regular Reserve, I must call your Lordships' attention to the fact that calculations made by the War Office concerning the future strength of the Reserve give very contradictory and very extraordinary results. Their calculation in 1905 made 156 battalions with an establishment of 750 men produce a total Reserve of 55,645. Their calculation in 1907 gave the Reserve produced by 148 battalions with an establishment of 720 as 63,370&#x2014;an excess of product of the smaller number of units with the smaller establishment over the larger number of units with the larger establishment of 7,725 men. I believe that the Army Council can easily prove, in calculating the Army Reserve, that the less is more than equal to the greater, but I am not open to conviction on this point. Bearing in mind the extent to which the Reserve-creating power of the Army has been diminished I fear that the future decrease in the Regular Reserve will be much greater than the Government anticipate&#x2014;namely, 20,000 men. Anyhow, the Special Reserve are to make good 22,000 men gone from the Colours of the Army and all reductions in the Regular Reserve, plus the total loss of the Militia system. The compensation is most misleading. Even if all branches of the Special Reserve stood at their full establishment nothing like that number of men would be available to undertake the duties of the Regular Reservists whom we have lost. In the Regular Reserve every man has completed his term of Colour service, and consequently must be of an age to serve abroad. In the Special Reserve, on the contrary, boys of 17 are enlisted and are returned from the date of enlistment as being of the same value and efficiency as the matured Regular Reservists for active service abroad.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0512"/>

Now let us consider the present and the future conditions of this new substitute for the Regular Infantry Reserve. Up to October 1 last less than 4,000 recruits had been obtained for the Special Reserve Infantry. So the Army Council decided to make a special appeal&#x2014;they are always making special appeals to somebody&#x2014;in this case not to the employer but to the unemployed, setting forth the advantages of the Special Reserve as a winter refuge for men out of work. The appeal was published in the Press on October 31, 1908. For instance, in the <i>Daily Mail</i> a notice appeared that the War Office wished through the <i>Daily Mail</i> to call attention to the advantages which the Special Reserve offered. The terms of service were then set out, but neither in that notice nor in any other which appeared at that moment is any mention made of the liability of Special Reservists to be drafted abroad to any Regiment of the Line&#x2014;by far the most serious liability which is put on them.<lb/>
Then followed the conditions of pay. I was astonished at reading in the notice to which I refer that pay varies from 7s. to 13s. 9&#x00BD;d. per week, and it is expressly stated that the War Office have made this amount clear pocket money. I do not know the class of soldier who is going to get 13s. 9&#x00BD;d. a week clear, so I do not consider him, but he is a useful man for advertisement purposes. As a matter of fact, the rate of pay in the Infantry is not 7s. but 4s. 11&#x00BD;d. clear per week. Even so, I think that the terms offered by the Government to the unemployed are very generous. The man serves for twenty-four weeks at 4s. 11&#x00BD;d. a week and receives &#x00A3;6. At the end of his twenty-four weeks he receives, in addition, a bounty of 30s., which makes &#x00A3;7 10s. The Army Council then say, "We have fed you, and housed you, and tended you for six winter months. If you hand us back 60s. out of the 150s. which we have given to you, we will give you your discharge. You are a free man to go your way rejoicing with &#x00A3;4 10s. in your pocket, a walking advertisement of our generosity to the unemployed at the taxpayers' expense and of the success of our plan for using regimental dep&#x00F4;ts as temporary asylums for the destitute."<lb/>
In connection with this new semi-military force there are several other points which call for careful inquiry, and which have received none. Enlistment
<col>976</col>
into the Special Reserve enables a man to desert his wife and family and leave them a charge on the rates. It frees him from the burden of supporting his parents. It lends itself readily and safely to fraudulent enlistment. It promises to create a class of men who will go from dep&#x00F4;t to dep&#x00F4;t doing six months when they cannot otherwise avoid starvation, loafing for the rest of the year, and effecting many separate enlistments in different parts of the United Kingdom, adding thereby to the paper strength of the Special Reserve. These special opportunities of these Special Reservists are bad for the good name of the Army among the working classes.<lb/>
The state of the Special Reserve Infantry on February 1 last was given by the Secretary of State for War as follows: Establishment, 58 500; total strength on February 1, 1909, 55,301. According to the Return&#x2014;but the Return does not prove itself&#x2014;that number is made up of 37,799 men who have transferred from the Militia Infantry and of 25,488 recruits enlisted up to February 1 last. Observe that those 25,488 recruits are reckoned for active service as the equal of Regular Reservists who have done seven years Colour service. In practice this is the way in which the plan worked out last year. Of these 25,488,recruits, 6,150 passed to the Navy or Regular Army and did not remain in the Special Reserve. Of the remaining 19,338, there were discharged as unfit and for other reasons 2,287. There remain 17,051; of these 11,055 were still under training at the dep&#x00F4;ts on February 1, each recruit counting as a Regular Reservist. The number of Special Infantry Reservists dismissed to their homes on completion of five or six months training in the first year of the Special Reserve is 7,681. This figure represents one year's intake into the Special Reserve. Some of these 7,681 men have been rejected as physically unfit in time of peace for the Army of which they are to be the backbone in time of war. The question is how many?<lb/>
When the scheme of the Special Reserve was first explained some two years ago, critics, and among them the late Mr. Arnold-Forster, pointed out that the Special Reserve would be largely composed of rejections from the Line. Until June, 1908, all Special Reserve recruits were re-measured on completion of their six months drill on enlistment. On the attestation
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0513"/>
<col>977</col>
form of every Special Reserve recruit there were comparative columns, the one giving the height, weight, and chest measurement on enlistment, the other after six months service and gymnastic course. In July, 1908, a War Office letter was issued notifying that&#x2014;
<quote>"The Army Council no longer consider the measurement of Special Reserve recruits on conclusion of six months drill necessary."</quote>
I asked the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War before Easter how many of the 7,681 men who had passed to the Special Reserve had previously been rejected for the Line. The noble Lord was not able to give me an answer, because of the cancelling of the remeasurement of recruits on completion of six months drill on enlistment. But at the same time the noble Lord kindly said he would inquire if any information on the point was available. As a result of those inquiries, for which I am very much obliged, he gives me as an approximate figure, but approximate only, the number of 744. Now I should have given as an approximate figure 3,840 or fifty per cent. If the contention that the Special Reserve is largely composed of men physically unfit for the Regular Army is correct, then the unsoundness of such a Reserve system for our first line needs no further demonstration. On the other hand, if the critics are wrong, why do the Army Council deprive themselves of the means of proving these critics beyond all question to be in error?<lb/>
There is a lower standard of physical fitness for the Special Reserve than for the Regular Army. For the Army the age is eighteen years. During last winter, height 5 feet 3 inches, chest, 34&#x00BD; inches. For the Special Reserve, age seventeen, height 5 feet 2 inches, chest 32&#x00BD; inches. The standard has just been raised for both forces by one inch. Now on the attestation form of Special Reserve recruits there is a certificate of medical examination which certifies the recruit "to be fit for the Army Reserve." No mention is made of Special Reserve; the words used are Army Reserve. You cannot get away from the fact that you are rejecting men as unfit for the Line in time of peace, and yet certifying them fit in time of war.<lb/>
On the point of age, I am not in a position to give the exact number of these 7,681 men who are under twenty years of age, and, therefore, not fit for foreign service. But
<col>978</col>
a very good line can be obtained by referring to the Army Annual Return for the previous year&#x2014;that is, 1908. A return is there shown of 15,267 Special Infantry Reserve recruits, among whom 2,458 were twenty years of age and over. By a proportion sum the 7,681 recruits passed to the Special Reserve up to February last would give 1,236 men of an age for foreign service. Allowing for absentees and physical unfitness, the total year's recruiting for the Special Infantry Reserve represents 1,000 men of an age and physically fit for immediate service in the Regular Reserve, provided you are prepared to accept six months squad drill at a dep&#x00F4;t as sufficient training for a reserve soldier of the Regular Army.<lb/>
Special Reserve recruits will not be fit for foreign service for some four years after the date of first enlistment. I say about four years, because it is necessary to remember that the boy who is accepted for the Army will develop physically much quicker than the boy who is rejected for the Line and consequently is left in the Special Reserve. The Special Reservist is of inferior physique to start with, and is dismissed from barracks at the end of six months to contend with cold, hunger, and want in the midst of unsanitary surroundings, whereas the boy in the Line is fed, tended, and cared for, and lives under the eye of the surgeon. You enlist boys for a period of six years, and for upwards of four of those years humanity prevents you from using them for the only purpose for which you have enlisted them&#x2014;namely foreign service. The 11,055 recruits who were drilling at the dep&#x00F4;ts on February 1 are indeed invaluable as paper soldiers. Every one of them from the first moment he enlists into the Special Reserve whether he ends by going to the Army or Navy, or is discharged as medically unfit, or passes to the Special Reserve four years before he is of age to go abroad, is counted as equal to a Regular Reservist for the purposes of war.<lb/>
Moreover, every man who passes through the Special Reserve into the Regular Army records two separate enlistments and is counted twice over. The manager of a stage army could learn a good deal from the Army Council in the art of making one man appear as several. For instance, by the Army Order of December, 1907, men were told that they could enlist into
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0514"/>
<col>979</col>
the Special Reserve, pass on into the Line at the end of three months, and receive a bounty of 30s. on transfer. On account of the bounty this was becoming a very popular way of joining the Line. That order was cancelled last March. Men who joined on and after January 1 must now do six months drill before being allowed to pass into the Line. This is the object of the change. A great many Special Reserve battalions train in June. The Army Council will now be able to show all those boys who are really Line recruits and who joined on the promise of being transferred to the Army at the end of three months with a bounty training this summer as Special Reservists. Thus some 10,000 men will be shown training with the Special Reserve battalions who never meant to serve in the Special Reserve at all. When these 10,000 men are transferred to the Line we shall have a paper return of 20,000 men, 10,000 training in the Special Reserve battalions and 10,000 joining the Line. But they are the same men twice counted. Methods of this kind may serve to obscure the true state of the Special Reserve during this summer, but they cannot conceal it permanently.<lb/>
I now pass to the 37,799 Militiamen upon whom you have spent &#x00A3;75,000 in order to induce them to transfer to the Special Reserve. Of this number 9,709 will be time-expired by September, 1910. The annual transfer from the Militia to the Army used to be upwards of 12,000 men. But all those Militiamen who took the bounty of &#x00A3;2 to transfer to the Special Reserve were not allowed to enlist in the Army for one year. The Army Council, in short, spent &#x00A3;20,000 in keeping 10,000 out of the Regular Army for one year, just to show what a substantial force the Special Reserve really was. Of course, these men are only waiting to join the Army as soon as they are free to do so. Thus we must count on 10,000 men transferring to the Army and 9,709 becoming time-expired by September year, total 19,709. Further, we must allow for men purchasing their discharge. This they could not do in 1908, except by refunding the &#x00A3;2 bounty, which of course they had spent, and that made purchase impossible for them for the time. During this year they will be able to purchase and a good many will do so. In addition there is the unavoidable loss due to death, invaliding, desertion, and emigration. You cannot put the waste
<col>980</col>
from all these causes at less than 3,000 men. Thus, by September year at least 22,000 transferred Militiamen will be lost to the Special Reserve&#x2014;that is, more than half the balance of the men transferred gone.<lb/>
The last of the transferred Militiamen will not become time-expired till 1913. But the collapse of the Special Reserve Infantry will occur from 1911 to 1912. By then, 20,000 transferred Militiamen will have become time-expired and 10,000 will have transferred to the Army, and all the ordinary causes of waste suspended as far as possible by Army Order for the first year, will have been in operation. The remainder of the transferred Militia will be a negligible quantity. You have, therefore, become dependent entirely upon recruits. Of these, at the present annual rate of intake&#x2014;namely, 7,600 men&#x2014;you will have passed 30,000 into the Special Reserve. That number represents your gross income for four years. But it is not your net income. Your balance must be subject to waste during these four years, and will not stand at more than 25,000. Again, at the end of four years, as boys of seventeen are enlisted, only a proportion of the first year's intake of 7,681, say 4,000, will have matured and become of an age fit for foreign service. In 1913, then, the Special Infantry Reserve will consist of less than 5,000 men fit for foreign service.<lb/>
By the end of 1913 the Reserve of all arms of the Regular Army is given in the Return of March 31 as 106,372. Will the Under-Secretary of State for War explain, in face of those facts, the statement that as the Regular Reserve diminishes so the Special Reserve will increase till finally you have a Reserve Army of 200,000 men. If that is going to become true, then in 1913 you will need a Special Reserve of 95,000 men, every man of an age and physically fit to serve abroad. The whole establishment of the Special Reserve of all branches is shown on the Estimates as 91,952, but as boys of seventeen are enlisted a great proportion cannot be fit to serve abroad. At present, in round numbers, you have a total strength of 70,000 Special Reserve of all ranks, out of which 20,000 are too young for foreign service. The immaturity of the Special Reserve will increase as the balance of transferred Militiamen become time-expired. Except the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War is pre
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0515"/>
<col>981</col>
pared to show us where these 95,000 matured men, not boys, are to come from, the Reserve Army of 200,000 is a paper Army and nothing more. So much for the quantity of the Special Reserve. Let us now look at its quality.<lb/>
The Secretary of State for War, in introducing the Army Estimates, commented upon the&#x2014;
<quote>"good work which had been done in bringing up the training of the new force, that is the Special Reserve, to the pitch of efficiency he believed it had attained."</quote>
What does that pitch of efficiency really mean? In the first place, the Special Reserve has never yet done a training. Secondly, the new short rifle has only been issued to the Special Reserve last month; therefore the transferred men have never yet fired with the rifle they are to carry on service. Thirdly, the Line officers transferred to the Special Reserve have never yet seen their men. Militiamen are very different from Linesmen, and the line officers are as yet complete strangers to the Militiamen. Fourthly, the greater part of the recruits have not yet fired a recruit's course of musketry owing to lack of range accommodation. Fifthly, few of the recruits are of an age fit for foreign service, the only purpose for which they are enlisted, and will not be fit for some four years from now. Sixthly, a proportion have been rejected as unfit for the Line in time of peace, and therefore more unfit in time of war; and, finally, the Force is 1,360 subalterns short of its establishment. It is most interesting to know that the military members of the Army Council have advised the Secretary of State for War that he may express himself as thoroughly satisfied with this pitch of efficiency in his new force.<lb/>
In the last Report of the Director of Recruiting the recruits of the Special Reserve are very favourably reported upon as being of a superior class to Militia recruits. But the fact that in round numbers you have discharged 2,000 recruits as medically unfit out of 25,000 in the first few months of their service tells a very different story. From all I know, and from all I have heard from others well qualified to judge, the Special Reserve recruits impress the ordinary observer, not with feelings of pride, but of pity. I perceive that the Army Council judges
<col>982</col>
the Special Reserve by special standards. But the Special Reserve is an important part of our first line, and I will ask your Lordships to judge it not by special standards but by common sense.<lb/>
The Special Reserve is intended by the Government to be the backbone of the British Army on the field of battle. To understand the fighting efficiency of the Special Reserve it is necessary to follow the story of a lad from the day he joins that general drafting pool till the moment when he takes his place in the line of battle. He enlists at seventeen or younger, not because he is anxious to make soldiering his profession, but because he is hungry and cold, and a "dead-beat" in civilian life. He joins a dep&#x00F4;t during the winter and commences squad drill. There is no possibility of forming a class of progressive instruction, because recruits come dribbling in at different intervals all the year round, and consequently there will be many squads composed of boys some of whom have been at the dep&#x00F4;t two days and some four months. It is precisely the same as if you tried to carry on a school or college without having any fixed term time. If you look at a squad of Special Reserve recruits when they are beginning arm drill, you will notice many cannot hold the rifle to the shoulder without the muzzle dipping down and the whole body of the boy dropping forward from sheer weakness. These boys, and of such are composed the recruits of the Special Reserve, are too feeble to do military training for at least three months after coming into barracks. The first three months must be devoted to physical training, which is admirable but it is not soldiering. Now, a lad who does his last three months of recruit training in November, December, or January will do so under very adverse circumstances. The number of possible outdoor working days are few, and the hours of daylight short; and as for musketry instruction on the range, if there happens to be one available, which, by the way, is not always the case, that is impossible. At the end of his six months a boy will remain in the Special Reserve for two reasons&#x2014;first, because he is physically unfit for the Line; and, secondly, because although he cannot buy his discharge he hates soldiering so much that he will not join the Army. At the end of his six months drill on enlistment he is discharged into the street more hopelessly out of touch than ever with
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0516"/>
<col>983</col>
civilian employment and all physical and moral benefit he may have received must rapidly vanish. He does an annual training including musketry, of twenty days, five of which must be non-working days. If the commanding officer gets four clear days for company and battalion training he may consider himself a lucky man. Such, then, will be the peace preparation for the ordeal of war of the new Special Reserve.<lb/>
The Special Reservist is a first Line soldier and enlisted for foreign service. Let us, therefore, consider him for a moment when sent on active service abroad. He has spent six months in barracks some years previous to mobilisation under officers and non-commissioned officers whom he will never see on service. Some weeks after the Expeditionary Force has taken the field abroad a draft of 300 Special Reservists are sent to reinforce a regiment at the front. They are drawn from the general drafting pool and collected from twenty different dep&#x00F4;ts. They are strangers to each other, strangers to their non-commissioned officers and to their officers. The only time they have been together will be the time spent on board ship. They land and are sent up by rail to the front. No modern Army can maintain itself remote from the rail head. Within forty-eight hours of disembarkation the draft joins the regiment, which they have never seen, and of which they do not even know the name, when it is in actual contact with the enemy. The unfortunate commanding officer who must take over this draft knows only too well the risk entailed by the arrival of this reinforcement. He cannot refuse to accept it, and the moment it joins his command he, and not the eminent soldiers who invented the Special Reserve, is solely responsible for any subsequent disaster. Battles are fought not by machines but by men, in whom the human element in the theatre of war plays an all-important part, a fact which the Government in creating the Special Reserve appear entirely to ignore. Men will die for a regiment and all that the regiment means and stands for to the soldier. Can you expect them to sacrifice their lives for the sake of a dreary dep&#x00F4;t, where they once spent six melancholy months, and for the sake of a regiment of which they have scarcely had time to learn the name?<lb/>
In the Special Infantry Reserve there are
<col>984</col>
twenty-seven fourth battalions known as Extra Special Reserve Battalions. We were always assured by the Government that these fourth battalions, although subject to the same regulations as the general drafting pool, would be used for the purpose of the expansion of the Line abroad by battalion units. A Return showing the strength of these twenty-seven battalions was laid upon the Table before Easter. From that Return I perceive that there would be four battalions out of the twenty-seven of over 500 strong for foreign service, eliminating men under twenty and deducting fifteen per cent. on account of medical unfitness. We must remember that if a force is recruited from rejections from the Line in time of peace the percentage of unfit for foreign service in time of war will be extraordinarily high. I see that these four battalions would each form a half battalion of about 500 men for foreign service if they had officers to take them abroad, but they have not. I note that one of these battalions has only fourteen officers out of an establishment of twenty-eight, a second has four subalterns out of nineteen required, a third has five subalterns out of nineteen required, a fourth&#x2014;a long way the best&#x2014;has ten subalterns out of nineteen required.<lb/>
The remainder of these twenty-seven battalions are numerically so weak after the necessary deductions for active service that it would be useless to send them abroad, especially as they have no Reserve. They would not be battalions at all, but would represent parties of 300 or 400 men greatly under-officered. Fourteen battalions out of the twenty-seven would, after making the necessary deductions, be 300 strong and under for foreign service. One would be 187. Of course they are available for the general drafting pool, but the duties assigned to them by the Government&#x2014;namely, those of relieving Line regiments in foreign garrisons and doing duty on lines of communication&#x2014;they can never perform. The strength of these battalions will shortly decrease, because men who transferred from the Militia were not allowed to join the Army without refunding &#x00A3;2 bounty, nor could they purchase their discharge for a year except for &#x00A3;5. They will be free to join the Army at the end of this summer and to purchase their discharge at the ordinary rate, and there will be a two years outflow in the next twelve months. More
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0517"/>
<col>985</col>
than 1,500 men are in their last year of service. Transferred Militiamen are not likely to re-engage at the end of their present term of service. They were obtained by the bounty of &#x00A3;2. No bounty is offered on re-engagement; on the contrary, they will get a less annual training bounty than they do now, and the conditions of service on re-engagement as regards general drafting will be much more distasteful to them than the ones under which they now serve.<lb/>
As regards officers, 108&#x2014;that is, fifty-four captains and fifty-four subalterns&#x2014;should have been transferred to these twenty-seven Extra Special Reserve battalions, a year and a-half ago, from the Line by the Army Order of December, 1907. Up to the present only twenty-seven Regular officers have been transferred out of 108 due. That is a shortage of eighty-one Regular officers. We see then that the Regular officers whose presence was going to make such a difference to the efficiency of these battalions are not there. In addition to the shortage of eighty-one Regular officers, there is a shortage of 371 Special Reserve officers, making a total of 452 officers short in twenty-seven battalions. Six of these battalions, which are reckoned as available to relieve Line battalions at a moment's notice, have no senior lieutenants. Three battalions have no junior lieutenants, and six battalions have only two subalterns apiece. We were distinctly told that these twenty-seven battalions would expand the Line abroad in time of war, but they can only do so in imagination. There is no force now which can give expansion by units abroad to our reduced Regular Army.<lb/>
The officers of the Special Reserve constitute a perfect puzzle. How are they to rank with Line officers? By the Army Order of December 23, 1907, all Special Reserve officers were at first to be always junior of their rank. But as it was found that Militia officers would not readily transfer on those terms to the Special Reserve, and that if the officers would not transfer the men would not do so, they were allowed to rank with the Line officers at the dep&#x00F4;t and during training according to the dates of their commissions. The real difficulty arises on service. I cannot see how any officers from the Special Reserve can be brought into a Line regiment
<col>986</col>
in any other place except at the bottom of the list, the same as a recruit officer on first joining, without interfering with promotion. This is a matter upon which the Line officers feel very strongly. On service when regular Officers, and especially junior officers, hope for rapid advancement, are they to find their promotion blocked by officers brought in from the Special Reserve over their heads, and filling places into which they ought to have stepped? If so, there is an end of the Regular Army as a profession.<lb/>
Take this case as an illustration. Two boys go up for the Army examination, one able and industrious and the other idle and stupid. The able boy passes a good examinaton and goes to Sandhurst. He does well at Sandhurst, passes all his examinations, goes through many courses of instruction, and serves at home and abroad, and qualifies in the Line for the rank of captain. Meantime the other boy having failed for the Army, lapses into the Special Reserve and manages to attain the rank of captain in that force whilst his competitor in the first Army examination is yet a subaltern in the Line with active service to his credit. As a Special Reserve captain he takes out a draft and joins the Line regiment on service. For a short time he is supernumerary captain, but the command of a company becoming vacant, he steps in and gets the company over the head of the Line subaltern. That is to say, that a man who was not able to pass into the Army, and has spent an occasional fortnight in camp, ends by depriving in the field an able and experienced officer in the Line of the promotion due to him&#x2014;an arrangement which cannot be acceptable to Regular officers. For the efficiency of the Line and from the point of view of fairness to Line officers, Special Reserve officers must join on service at the bottom of the list of officers, whether they are captains or subalterns, and there they must stay, because the moment you put them over the head of a Line officer you block promotion. The difficulty is that on those terms officers will not join the Special Reserve, but that is part of the impracticability inseparable from the whole scheme of the Special Reserve.<lb/>
The Special Infantry Reserve as a whole is at present in sorry case as regards officers. By the Army Order of December 23, 1907, 772 Regular officers ought
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0518"/>
<col>987</col>
to have been transferred from the Line to the Special Reserve Infantry battalions; 150 more should be found from the reserve of officers on mobilisation. But whether they are likely to be available or not we are forbidden to inquire, as it is a question affecting mobilisation. Before Easter, the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War informed me that 107 officers had been transferred from the Line to the Special Reserve battalions. If you look at the Army List you will find that the names of those officers appear as serving both with the Line battalion and with the Special Reserve battalion. Their names, with the exception of those of adjutants of Special Reserve battalions are not printed in italics, which denotes the seconded officer. They are counted both with the Line battalions and Special Reserve battalions of their regiments in the Army List. They are included in the grand total of officers now serving in the Regular Army and again in the total of officers now serving in the Special Infantry Reserve. It is clear that if you take 772 officers from the first and second battalions and transfer them to the third and fourth, you must either appoint 772 extra officers from the Line or there will be a shortage. Where are these 772 extra officers for the Line to come from?<lb/>
For that we must look to the supply of Army candidates. There seems to be a lack of qualified candidates for commissions in the Army. In June, 1908, the names of 232 candidates were published as having passed the qualification examination for the Army; there were only eighty-one who failed to qualify. But all these failures were taken with the successful into Sandhurst in September, 1908. The admission of the failures was made without further examination or publicity. Again, in November, 1908, the names of 135 successful candidates were published, and again fifty-five, who had failed to qualify, were, without further examination or publicity, taken with the successful into Sandhurst in February, 1909. The practice seems to be to announce some months before the examination that there will be so many vacancies offered but invariably to state a much smaller number of vacancies than it is the intention to fill after the examination, the object being to be in a position to say, "We have never had more commissions to offer than qualified candidates
<col>988</col>
to fill them." I believe it is admitted that there have been occasions when there were more cavalry commissions offered than candidates to fill them. Again, is it not the case that you have not transferred the 772 officers from the Line to the Special Reserve Infantry because if you did so you would not have got the candidates, qualified or unqualified, to fill the vacant places in the Line? It is certain that you will never get a better class of Army candidates by merely raising the standard of the examination and then quietly letting in the failures. If you want candidates superior in quality and quantity you must offer better pay and better professional prospects. You will certainly not do the latter by blocking promotion of the junior ranks when on service by bringing in Special Reserve officers over their heads.<lb/>
For the Special Infantry Reserve fifty subalterns have been obtained since its formation up to Easter. Of these, thirty-two are candidates for commissions in the Army and eighteen intend to remain in the Special Reserve so we have a deficiency of 1,360 subalterns and an intake of eighteen. Practically, all the junior subalterns who transferred from the Militia to the Special Reserve did so because they were Army candidates. They intend passing out of the Special Reserve as soon as they can. That is all right for the Army? But it shows the impossibility of getting permanent officers for the Special Reserve. At the examination held last October for commissions in the Army from the Special Reserve and Yeomanry, eighty commissions were offered and sixty-six candidates presented themselves for competition, so that the competition is not severe.<lb/>
The Government, however, are confident of meeting this appalling deficiency of officers in the course of this summer by means of a mysterious body lately summoned into existence and called the "Officers' Training Corps." It seems that the Volunteer Corps of many Universities and the Cadet Corps of many large public schools have their names changed from Volunteers and Cadet Corps to "Officers' Training Corps." The Government have thus, by a stroke of the pen, created an Officers' Training Corps of some 20,000 members, but they are precisely the same as the University Volunteer Corps and the Public Schools Cadet Corps whom we
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0519"/>

have had with us for so long. I cannot understand why this change of name should induce lads to join our military forces from the University and School Corps in any greater numbers in the future than they have done in the past, except that I believe they are to receive a <i>solatium</i> of &#x2014;35 if they pass some military examination. If they do so then the Special Reserve officer from the public school Cadet Corps and the University Rifle Corps is to be attached to a Line regiment for four months, and after that he goes out for a fortnight each year with a Special Reserve battalion. How can these Spacial Reserve officers have any knowedge of the duties which fall upon officers in peace and war with an experience of a Colour service of four months after leaving school, and of two weeks in camp each year? Do you ask us to believe that when war breaks out these officers will be fit to lead and command men and train non-commissioned officers, and at a moment's notice to discharge all the duties of a first Line officer on service?<lb/>
On the point of numbers, however, leaving out of sight efficiency, can the Under-Secretary of State for War give any information as to the number of officers we may expect from the Officers' Training Corps this summer? Will any train with the Special Reserve this year? I notice that the Secretary of State for War, in answer to a Question addressed to him, has expressed himself as satisfied with the recruiting of Special Reserve officers&#x2014;
<quote>"Because he is not dependent wholly upon officers of the old class, but upon contingents from the new Officers' Training Corps, the fruits of which will begin to be seen this summer."</quote>
Can the Under-Secretary of State for War tell us how many of these 20,000 members of the Officers' Training Corps have entered into any engagement to join the Special Reserve? I read in a speech made by the Secretary of State for War in London on May 1 that&#x2014;
<quote>"The way in which the young Territorial Engineer officers and the young Special Reserve officers were taking to their work and coming forward in large numbers resembled only the way in which young ducklings from the egg took to the water."</quote>
The Special Reserve officers are then coming forward in large numbers. Is any information available as to their magnitude, because you want officers not by the hundred but by the thousand. The total
<col>990</col>
deficiency of officers for the Special Reserve is 2,220.<lb/>
I know it is always said the Militia was short of officers. It was deficient of 600 officers on the outbreak of the South African war, but then its establishment was much higher than that of the Special Reserve. The position to-day is that you have got rid of 500 Infantry Militia officers since 1905, that you should, unless the great Army Order of December, 1907, was never meant to have any meaning, have drawn on the Line for 772 officers who ought to have been replaced at once, but this it is not possible to do. In the end you show a total deficit of 1,360 subalterns in the Special Infantry Reserve. I hope the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War will explain the advantages of the present position.<lb/>
Now, as regards the non-commissioned officers of the Special Reserve. Is it the intention to put the non-commissioned officers of the Special Reserve on their arrival at the front in charge of old soldiers with actual field experience, of which the Special Reserve non-commissioned officesr are totally devoid? That amounts to putting the untrained and inexperienced in command of the trained and experienced, a proceeding which in the presence of the enemy can have but one result. Are you going to say to the future non-commissioned officers of the Special Reserve that they must rank as privates when on service? That would be sound, but loss of rank and pay when on service would be a great deterrent to men trying to qualify in peace time as non-commissioned officers for your Special Reserve. How do you propose to find non-commissioned officers for your Special Reserve? I know what will be done in peace time. You will sew stripes on to the sleeves of private soldiers and call them non-commissioned officers, but that is not the solution of the problem.<lb/>
There are and were to be other branches of the Special Reserve besides Infantry&#x2014;for instance, the Special Reserve Artillery; but this I understand has already been abandoned as unworkable as far as the Special Reserve is concerned, and that the whole question is being reconsidered. I hope I may be able to obtain some information from the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War on this point. There are two Cavalry Regiments in the Special
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0520"/>
<col>991</col>
Reserve&#x2014;the Irish Horse. There is no Territorial Army yet in Ireland, consequently the Irish Yeomanry were transferred to the Special Reserve. The Irish Horse appears on the Return as eleven officers and 370 men short of establishment.<lb/>
I now come to the non-combatant branch of the Special Reserve. Some time ago this was the great triumph and discovery of the present War Office. The subsidiary services of an army in the field were to be simply revolutionised. There were to be extra Army Service Corps men, extra Army Medical Corps men, vandrivers, engineers, mechanicians, and electricians, and butchers and bakers and candlestick-makers, and a crowd of others, all serving upon a Militia basis. But where are all these people now? It is certain that they are not among the non-combatant branches of the Special Reserve. They form part of the phantom forces of the Army Council? From answers the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War kindly gave me before Easter, I understand that as far as the Army Service Corps Special Reserve is concerned, in category (<i>a</i>) the establishment of men is 1,000 and the strength is fifty; the establishment of officers 134, and the strength two. In category (<i>b</i>) the establishment of men is 2,500 and the strength is five. But, to use the words of the noble Lord when he kindly gave these figures&#x2014;
<quote>"The thing is not yet in working order."</quote>
As regards the Veterinary Corps, there should be eighty-six officers and there are none at all. The Army Medical Corps Special Reserve is divided into two categories. In category (<i>a</i>) the establishment is 2,000 according to the Army Estimates, and the strength is 657. In category (<i>b</i>), Army Medical Corps Special Reserve supernumerary, the establishment of men is 3,000 and the strength 183; the establishment of officers 489, and strength twenty-five. This category (<i>b</i>) of the Army Medical Corps Special Reserve supernumerary are officers and men who belong to the Territorial Army but who have undertaken an engagement to serve with the Special Reserve abroad on mobilisation. These figures have an important bearing on the Expeditionary Force about which we have heard so much. According to an Army Memorandum issued in 1907 a full establishment of these non-combatant branches is essential to complete the Expeditionary Force. A note is added to the table saying&#x2014;
<col>992</col>
<quote>"The numbers here shown are those required to mobilise the Field Force according to the latest tables, exclusive of any provision for waste in the field or home employment."</quote>
Well, those numbers are not likely to be there, and it is clear that the Expeditionary Force is not yet complete in some of its most essential parts.<lb/>
I desire to draw special attention to the fact that the Expeditionary Force, about which we used to hear so much, would, as matters now stand, be sent on service with an insufficient medical equipment. In the South African war, owing to the fact that we put into the field a much larger force than it had ever been contemplated to send abroad, there was an insufficent supply of medical officers and staff. This occasioned much popular indignation. But now we have a case of an Expeditionary Force planned two years ago which has not yet been provided with anything approaching a sufficient medical equipment for its numbers when on active service.<lb/>
I am well aware that the Special Reserve has the entire approval of the Army Council. I gather from the work on the British Army written by the late Mr. Arnold-Forster that the Army Council advised him, when Secretary of State, that nothing short of two years continuous training with the Colours would fit a man for a first line soldier. Upon that opinion was based the proposal for the short service Army. Now on July 30, 1906, in an Army Memorandum issued by the present Secretary of State for War, the proposed short service Army was condemned on the score of insufficient training in the following terms&#x2014;
<quote>"The Cardwell system makes the training battalion serve two purposes. It provides drafts in peace, and the same battalion can on mobilisation by means of Reservists be transformed into a first-class fighting unit. Where world-wide duties have to be performed, battalions mobilised in this fashion appear to the great majority of the expert military advisers of the Government to be greatly preferable to the battalions of an independent short service Army composed largely of inexperienced and partially-trained Reservists, who must necessarily be quite inferior to seasoned men who have already gone through a substantial period of service abroad."</quote>
That condemns, on the authority of the expert military advisers, the proposed short service Army of the late Government on the score that two years of Colour service was an inadequate period for
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0521"/>
<col>993</col>
a Regular Reservist's training. But now we have, in 1907, an Army Order issued by the same expert military advisers for the purpose of creating a Special Reserve which is to be a substitute for the Reserve of the Regular Army with six months of squad training at the dep&#x00F4;t, and no Colour service at all. I submit, my Lords, that this fluid opinion of the Army Council greatly strengthens the request for a special inquiry. It is clear that the military members of the Army Council conceive their duty to their country as far as the Special Reserve is concerned to be summed up in Tennyson's famous line, "Theirs not to reason why." "Schemes may come and schemes may go, but we sit on for ever."<lb/>
Finally, we are told in an Army Memorandum dated February 25, 1907, that to supply the waste for the first six months of a war 3,500 officers will be required and 75,000 men from the Special Reserve. We know that you are 2,220 officers deficient in the Special Reserve and that you have 20,000 men too young for foreign service. The question I should like to ascertain by special inquiry is, what is the balance fit for foreign service? This is the position. The Regular Army and its Reserve have been reduced by 40,000 men. The Reserve-making power of the Regular Army has been diminished to an extent which cannot be accurately estimated. The Militia has been absolutely abolished, and nothing has been put in its place. For all compensation we are told to put our trust in the Special Reserve. Are we justified in so doing? I urge an inquiry into that point before and not after the test of war has been applied. You may refuse in time of peace to inquire into the true condition of the Special Reserve upon which you must now rely as a substitute for the Regular Reserve; but remember that nothing can save you from being taught the truth in time of war, when the lesson learnt may mean your country's ruin.<lb/>
Moved to resolve, "That in the opinion of the House, a special inquiry should be instituted into the condition of the Special Reserve, and as to the extent to which officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of that force are fitted to discharge the duties of the Regular Reserve which devolve upon them in time of war."&#x2014;(<i>The Duke of Bedford</i>.)</membercontribution></p>
<col>994</col>
<p><member>THE EARL OF WEMYSS</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have only two words to say. I think your Lordships who have listened to the facts and figures contained in the speech of my noble friend must be fully convinced of the desirability, nay, of the necessity, of the Motion which he has moved. In the course of the debate which took place yesterday on my Motion the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, also suggested an inquiry, but I gathered from what he said that he wished a general inquiry and not one into the state of the Special Reserve only.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member>: <membercontribution>I hoped I had made it clear that what I intended was an inquiry into the state of the Special Reserve and the shortage of officers, and that I was averse to a general inquiry, which would necessitate delay.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF WEMYSS</member>: <membercontribution>I am glad to hear my noble friend say that. He will probably, therefore, second the Amendment which I propose to move, and which is to add, at the end of the Motion, these words, "And that the said inquiry be confined to the Special Reserve." My noble friend cannot object to that after what he has just said. It is to insure the confining of this inquiry to the Special Reserve. We do not want an inquiry into the Territorial Army. The noble Earl the Leader of the House said last night, in answer to a question from me, that in his opinion the Territorial Force as at present existing did all that my Motion asked for. What did my Motion ask for? It asked that your Lordships should fulfil the I.O.U. that you gave to the nation four years ago, and that the home defence of the country should always be in that state, not that if a nation came you would succeed in driving the invading force away, but that no nation would ever attempt in any form a hostile landing on our shores. My noble friend feels perfectly happy that the Territorial Force will do that, and that no country will ever dream of a hostile landing on our shores. We have in the House to-day two Field-Marshals&#x2014;Lord Roberts and Lord Grenfell. I should like to know whether they agree with the noble Earl the Leader of the House in his view of the Territorial Force, and that nothing more is required. I believe that a great deal more is required, and that a great deal more should be done. I believe, with my noble and gallant friend Lord Roberts, that you want at least
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0522"/>
<col>995</col>
1,000,000 men to place the country in the state I refer to. I therefore hope that Lord Roberts and Lord Grenfell will state their views to the House. Meanwhile, to make sure that the inquiry is confined to what it professes to be, I propose to add at the end of the Motion the words I have read.<lb/>
Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"To add to the Motion the following words, 'and that the inquiry be confined to the Special Reserve.'"&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Wemyss.</i>)</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: <membercontribution>I rise to a point of order. The Motion of the Duke of Bedford proposes a special inquiry into the condition of the Special Reserve. The Amendment says that the inquiry shall be limited to the Special Reserve. Surely that is the same thing. The Amendment, therefore, is superfluous.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>EARL ROBERTS</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am entirely in accord with what the noble Duke has said about the condition of the Special Reserve, and our lamentable want of officers. What the noble Duke has told the House quite corroborates the opinion which I myself expressed in my letter yesterday to Lord Wemyss as to the deplorable condition of our Army generally. I feel utterly amazed at the question of the Army being considered, as it is in both Houses, a party question. Whenever anything about the Army is brought forward one side or the other takes a partisan view of it. I noticed that the Division last night on the Motion of Lord Wemyss was entirely a party division&#x2014;one side voting in favour of the Motion and the other side against it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF WEMYSS</member>: <membercontribution>They all ran away.</membercontribution></p>
<p>E<member>ARL ROBERTS</member>: <membercontribution>I noticed that, too. But I cannot conceive how anybody could suppose that we can have an Army at all if the Army is to be made a party question. The Navy most fortunately, some years ago, was by consent made a non-party question; and thanks to that attitude we have got the Navy up to a certain standard of efficiency. Lately some fear has arisen that the Navy may again become a party question. I earnestly hope that will not be the case. But if we are to have an Army at all, it is essential that it must be one that is believed in by both sides in Parliament and also by the nation.
<col>996</col>
The nation do not believe in the Army in the very least. In the first place they look upon the Regular Army as something with which they have got nothing to do and that the less they see of it the better. They do not like soldiers to come into their neighbourhood. They think that soldiers are only fit to go abroad and fight their battles. That is a most unfortunate mistake on their part, because soldiers nowadays are not what they were fifty or sixty years ago. They are well-conducted men and temperate in all respects. But unfortunately the nation do not think so, and so long as that is the opinion of the nation so long shall we never have an army worthy of the defence of this country.<lb/>
It is the same with the Territorial Army. They think the Territorial Army is not wanted. They look upon it as a plaything. And I do not wonder at that, for they are told by their leaders that there is no need to be anxious on account of invasion. The people are never taken into the confidence of those who know better. I am well aware that the leaders in both Houses are themselves anxious about the future. But they dare not tell the country so. What is the use of having an army at all when some of. them think&#x2014;as Lord Crewe says he thinks&#x2014;that an army of 315,000 men would suffice? What would it suffice for? Would it suffice to prevent a foreign army from invading this country, or would it suffice to meet such an army, if they landed here? I fail to understand the idea of what the Territorial Army is intended for. A noble Lord on the Opposition benches said you must give it a test. But what test? There is no test in the world, but one, and that is war. Are you going to wait till war comes to test the Territorial Army?<lb/>
It is most extraordinary the position we are in at this moment. We have no Army. The noble Duke has shown that we have no Army. We have neither an Army to send abroad nor an Army to defend the country at home. While we are all sitting here and taking it easily and comfortably the danger is coming nearer and nearer to us every day; and unless you determine to make some inquiry, and not let the people believe they are living in safety and that we have an Army fit to deal with any enemy which may invade us, we shall some day come to such utter grief that you will regret your inaction now. It is to me a perfect marvel how anybody can see what
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0523"/>
<col>997</col>
is going on throughout Europe and be content with the condition of the Army. If we were to attempt to send even an Expeditionary Force of four divisions abroad, what would be left? The noble Lord the Under-Secretary for War says it takes some years to make an Army. A few days ago I was talking to a member of the other House, who said&#x2014;
<quote>"We are so near getting the 315,000 men that we are thinking of proposing to double the number."</quote>
But what is the use of talking about doubling the number? They cannot even get the limited number they have asked for. Men will not do. Men in numbers are weakness. You must have trained men. No country in the world would attempt to defend itself with the paucity of men and the untrained men which we have got.<lb/>
I cannot understand how you can all sit quiet and think we are making an Army, when we are doing nothing of the sort. We have men marching before the Lord Mayor of London. But that will not make an Army. War is not a sham, but our Army is a sham, and you will never have a real Army until you take the nation into your confidence and tell them what the danger is. If the nation came forward there would be no difficulty in getting an Army. Men would then have to come and join the Army because the nation would insist upon it. 'But that will not happen so long as you choose to believe that we are going on the right lines and that Mr. Haldane's army must have a longer test. Are we going to wait years for that test? The noble Duke has put the matter clearly before you. We are thousands upon thousands of officers short. I pointed that out in 1905, but nothing has been done to improve matters. These training colleges will not alter it. They existed before under another name. They will make no difference whatever.<lb/>
The only way to improve the situation is to take into your serious consideration the fact that there is danger in front, and let the country know it. So long as you tell the country there is no danger, or that 315,000 men will suffice, you will never have a proper Army. When I saw the placards on the walls saying, "Men wanted for the Territorial Army," I thought of the passage from Bacon&#x2014;
<col>998</col>
"Nay, number itself in armies importeth not much where the people is of weak courage; for as Virgil saith, 'It never troubles a wolf how many the sheep be.'"
That is exactly what would be the case with an untrained army. You may double the strength of the Territorial Army, but so long as it is untrained and so long as it has not got officers who know their duty, it will be of no use. You must have Regular officers and Regular non-commissioned officers. If you want to get an army sufficient to save the country, and an army with potential reserves to help an expeditionary force which goes abroad, you must adopt other steps.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I ought, perhaps, to apologise for intervening in the debate at this stage, but I am anxious to get away to a public engagement of some importance and of long standing. It is impossible not to feel, as one listens to this debate, that of all the thankless offices which a man can fill that of Secretary of State for War in this country is probably the most thankless. My right hon. friend Mr. Haldane has, I think it would be generally agreed, given to the office which he holds a degree of hard work and of thought such as men very seldom give to the work in which they are engaged. But on an occasion of this kind no reference is made or, I suppose, can be made to such facts as those. My right hon. friend is made the target for the very considerable powers of sarcasm of the noble Duke, and the delighted cheers of noble Lords opposite followed each sentence which seemed to show this or that point of the weakness of the armour.<lb/>
The comment of the noble and gallant Earl who has just sat down is very significant, and, I think, is very true. The Army is made a party question, and nowhere more, I think, than in your Lordships' House. It is a very regrettable fact that it should be so. My right hon. friend, it is true, is not the first Secretary of State who has been made the target for attacks of this kind. Nobody knows better than the noble Viscount who sits opposite how the Secretary of State for War may be attacked. He himself was made the target for a number of attacks, many of which, I venture to think, were not more fair than those which are made on my right hon. friend. Mr. Arnold-Forster was similarly treated, and if we go back to the days of
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0524"/>
<col>999</col>
the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, who I am sorry has not yet been able to return to the House, attacks of a very similar kind were made. While I am sure that my right hon. friend, whose shoulders are broad, would desire to profit by any criticism that contains real substance&#x2014;and I am far from saying that the criticism of the noble Duke was altogether without substance&#x2014;yet at the same time I think I might venture to claim that criticism on a serious national subject of this kind might be couched in somewhat more businesslike and in rather less ironical terms.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, we are again confronted by what I ventured to describe yesterday as the somewhat elusive quality of criticism on this subject. The noble Duke introduces what is a perfectly fair subject for argument&#x2014;namely, whether what he terms the failure of the Special Reserve instituted by my right hon. friend is so complete and abject that after barely two years since the matter was before Parliament a special inquiry is demanded. That Motion is supported and even reduplicated by my noble friend Lord Wemyss. On the other hand, the noble Viscount opposite desires, I think, a somewhat more extended inquiry. He desires&#x2014;he will, of course, correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;to inquire into the general shortage of officers as affecting the Regular Army and the Special Reserve, and also, for all that I know, the Territorial Force. Now the noble and gallant Field-Marshal on the Cross-benches takes a different view. I think I am not misrepresenting him when I say that he does not very much care about the inquiry in connection with the Special Reserve. What the noble and gallant Field-Marshal wants, as he has often told us, is compulsory military training.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL ROBERTS</member>: <membercontribution>I said by all means have an inquiry into the Special Reserve; but I trusted it would not stop there.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member>: <membercontribution>I hope I do not misrepresent the noble and gallant Field-Marshal. He would be glad, I gather, to have an inquiry, but we all know what is at the back of my noble friend's mind, and he would not, I think, anticipate that this inquiry, whatever its result, would lead to the placing of the country in what he would consider a position of safety. The noble Duke's Motion is one which, of course deals mainly, as his speech did, with matters of detail, which should be
<col>1000</col>
replied to and will be replied to by my noble friend behind me, the Under-Secretary for War. But for a few minutes I should like to draw attention to one or two general principles and facts concerned with the question.<lb/>
As regards the Special Reserve, upon which the question is mainly concentrated, the noble Duke appears to me to have couched his Motion in a form which is not strictly accurate. He desires his inquiry to deal with the extent to which the officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of that force are fitted to discharge the duties of the Regular Reserve&#x2014;the duties, that is to say, which devolve upon the Regular Reserve in time of war. I do not think the War Office will admit that that is an accurate description of the duties of the Special Reserve. As I understand the position it remains what it always has been since the Cardwell system was first started&#x2014;that the Regular Reserves fill up the Regular battalions to their war strength, and that for the further purposes of the wastage of war you must always depend, not upon the Regular Reserve, but upon a force which, if I may use the phrase which the noble Duke dislikes, but which is, I think, a generally descriptive phrase, is constituted on a Militia basis. It has never been contemplated, or, if it has been, it was only contemplated once, that it would be possible in this country, first for reasons of expense and then for reasons connected with recruiting, to make your Regular Army a purely self-supporting force&#x2014;that is to say, to get a system of Reserves which would enable you through a prolonged campaign to fill up the gaps caused by the wastage of war with fully trained men. That has been, I take it, the guiding principle of our military system; and the fact that some system of that kind is the only one suited to our peculiar needs was laid down, as I say, by Lord Cardwell, though not even for the first time by him, because it has always been the actual practice in time of war. It was repeated again by Lord Wantage's Committee, which, if I remember aright, reported about the year 1891, though I am not absolutely certain of the year.<lb/>
The fact is that the Militia has always been the feeder of the Regular Army. We only had to sit through the discussion on the Army Bill to know that that side of the Militia duties was always unpalatable
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0525"/>
<col>1001</col>
to the noble Duke. I think the noble Duke never concealed his distaste for the depletion of the Militia in acting as feeders to the Regular Army. It is true, I think, speaking generally, that if the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, had been able to carry out to the full his Army scheme the Militia would have been organised on a different plan. The noble Viscount's plan&#x2014;again he will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;was, if I remember aright, a plan for a three-line Army. It was to be a short service Army with an enormous Reserve, and behind that there was to be an interdependent Militia, a second Army, with a Reserve of its own. Behind that, again, there was to be looming a force of Volunteers. That, of course, would commend itself to the noble Duke, and I suppose he would like to see something of the kind re-established. But the noble Viscount's scheme broke down, partly, as I think the noble Duke himself said, in relation to the Indian drafts, but also because if any scheme of that kind were to be carried out the prospect of the cost to the country was one which no Government would wish to face, and further because it is a very difficult thing in this country to recruit for two similar forces of that kind, one fully trained, the foreign service Army, and the other the interdependent Militia army. Consequently the noble Viscount's scheme was not proceeded with, and was not proceeded with, of course, by his own Government.<lb/>
The noble Duke, in the midst of all his criticism, did not tell us how he conceives that the Special Reserve, and the Special Reserve, of course, in relation to the whole Army, could be improved or amended. He made a great many criticisms of detail with which my noble friend behind me, Lord Lucas, will no doubt endeavour to deal; but he did not state how what he considers to be the shortage of men or the shortage of officers was to be dealt with, except on one point, a point on which we can all, indeed, agree with him&#x2014;namely, that if you are prepared to pay more either for officers or men you will find it infinitely easier to get what you want. That is almost a truism. I can imagine four or five ways of organising the British Army any one of which might be satisfactory and effective if you had an unlimited purse at your back. But what is the use of blinking the extreme difficulties which surround the whole subject of carry
<col>1002</col>
ing out our Imperial duties with a foreign service Army and at the same time keeping up a sufficient and sufficiently well trained force at home? Of course, the panacea of my noble and gallant friend Lord Roberts is a simple one, and might in its way be an effective one, although to be really effective I should have thought also it would entail an enormous cost. But that is not the panacea of noble Lords opposite, and therefore I hope that if they adopt and join in with the criticisms of the noble Duke they will, at any rate, indicate the lines on which they think some improvement in the present system could be conducted.<lb/>
I will only say one word about the shortage of officers, which, no doubt, is a serious question and not a party question. The noble Duke dealt rather lightly with my right hon. friend's attempts, which I hope will be more successful than the noble Duke seems to indicate, to establish the Officers' Training Corps. I should have thought that the practical difference between the Officers' Training Corps and the former Cadet Corps and University Volunteer battalions with which the noble Duke maintained they were identical was that now a more serious spirit has entered into the training. In former days&#x2014;I cannot answer for quite recent times&#x2014;I do not think that either a school or a University rifle corps was taken very seriously; and I should have hoped that the establishment of these Officers' Training Corps, followed, as I hope they will be, and certainly ought to be, by the establishment of courses all over the country at all possible centres for these young officers, would have the desired effect. We all know that it is not possible for a great many of these young men to give a long time to military study, and it is also a fact that even though they may be able to give a considerable time it may have to be given intermittently, but I am sure my right hon. friend and the Army Council are fully aware that every effort must be made to improve and make as serious as possible the training of such of those young officers as join either the Special Reserve or the Territorial Army.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, only one word on the question of the utility of an inquiry. I am at a disadvantage because the noble Duke did not indicate exactly what kind of inquiry he desired, and I have not, of course, had the advantage of hearing the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0526"/>
<col>1003</col>
opinion of noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite. But I confess it does seem to be premature to hold an inquiry into this subject at once. If the noble Duke were able to prove his case, the case which, I think, he desires to make&#x2014;namely, that the Special Reserve and the Territorial Army together are representing a national going down hill as compared with the Militia and Volunteers&#x2014;if he were able to prove that case I admit there would be a very strong <i>prim&#x00E2; facie</i> case for an immediate inquiry. But I do not believe that that can for a moment be the case; and, in those circumstances&#x2014;of course, my noble friend behind me will develop the matter infinitely more in detail than I can&#x2014;we are unable to say, and I do not think we shall be convinced in the course of the debate, that a case is made out for an inquiry into this system, which, if your Lordships will remember, was authorised, I will not put it higher than that, by your Lordships' House after full consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member>: <membercontribution>I must say, my Lords, that we take no responsibility for it.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member>: <membercontribution>Of course not. I did not say that; but noble Lords opposite were in a position to throw it out if they chose. I do not say they adopted it, but I think I am entitled to say that noble Lords opposite authorised the inception of the system; and unless in the course of the debate, which I am afraid I shall not hear, some infinitely more cogent reasons are advanced for at once at this very early stage embarking on an inquiry of this kind, the precise objects of which have not been disclosed, and which I confess myself unable to understand, I do not think it could be possible for my noble friend behind me who will represent the Government to agree to the Motion made by the noble Duke.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD GRENFELL</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I do not intend to detain your Lordships more than a few minutes, but after the appeal of my noble friend Lord Wemyss, and after my long service in the Army, I felt that I could not sit silent while this debate is proceeding. One of the leading questions raised by the noble Duke is the efficiency of officers, and any General Officers who, like myself, have had experience in campaigns must know that on the question of a proper supply of officers to the Army
<col>1004</col>
very much depends the success or otherwise of the campaign. You have a constantly diminishing number. You have a very large number of casualties, and when we hear, as we have done from the noble Duke, of the very large number of officers who are now deficient in this force it makes one think very seriously as to the efficiency of the whole force.<lb/>
I think the experience of the last war in South Africa may have taught many of us how difficult it is to carry out a campaign under these circumstances, not only at the seat of war but also in England. In England we had a large number of young men to train. I know of one case where there were as many as 1,100 recruits and only two officers with them to administer the whole dep&#x00F4;t. We have known, at least all of us who have served abroad have known, the sort of difficulties which arise when the efficient officers decrease at the end of a campaign, and though officers are supplied to take their place they are frequently of a very indifferent quality. I remember that at the close of the Zulu war we had the greatest possible difficulty. And not only is it a matter of difficulty for the General commanding; it is a matter of importance for the country also, because the large waste of money and the want of economy in the Army are very frequently caused by officers in the category I have mentioned. I will only name one single instance, which I think will show the curious kind of officers sometimes sent out.<lb/>
During the war in South Africa I was, unfortunately, Governor in Malta, and was unable to take part in that struggle. I dismissed an officer from his regiment and from the Army, and I thought I should hear no more about him. Well, my Lords, will you believe it the next time I heard of him he was in command of a rather important post in South Africa? That, I think, shows the absolute necessity of having not only a full supply of officers, but officers of the right sort. As regards the Special Reserve, the other question which has been occupying your Lordships, there is no doubt that this Reserve is too young. You cannot form youths of seventeen into soldiers under less than three or even four years to do what this Special Reserve is expected to do immediately&#x2014;namely, to take the place of the Regular Army at the front. I as an old Inspector-General of Recruiting know how almost impossible it
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0527"/>

<col>1005</col>
is to provide recruits unless you go down to the low age of seventeen. Unless you catch the man at seventeen you never catch him at all. I know many instances, and I think you will find the same in the Special Reserve, where youths who were supposed to be seventeen were of a very much younger age. When I was Inspector-General of Recruiting I enlisted a youth who proved to be fifteen years of age. General Buller, who was at the War Office, called my attention to this, and I was rather severely dealt with. The youth, of course, was returned to his family, and within two months he had re-enlisted. Then I sent for him to the War Office, and physically he certainly was up to the age of seventeen. That is the case with a large number of recruits that you will find in the Special Reserve.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Earl, Lord Wemyss</member>, <membercontribution>asked me my opinion as to the whole question. I do not, my Lords, intend to trouble you with that; but there is a report of a short debate which took place in this House last night, and I wish rather to call attention to one sentence in it which was spoken by the noble Lord who represents the War Office. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"The scheme for home defence has satisfied not only the General Staff and the Army Council, but also the Committee of Imperial Defence."</quote>
I cannot, of course, speak for the Committee of Imperial Defence or for any officer in the War Office, but when the noble Lord says that the scheme for home defence has satisfied the officers of the General Staff, out of the War Office I conclude he means, I can assure him that the officers of the General Staff who are not employed in the War Office are not, as regards the period of training, satisfied with this scheme. As regards the officers in the War Office, though, of course, I do not speak for them, I think that the fairest thing to say would be that they had accepted the scheme. I cannot believe that they are satisfied with it.<lb/>
I will not go into the question the noble Earl has asked me, but I am anxious to impress on noble Lords the fact that the scheme when it first appeared was carefully criticised outside the War Office by the officers of the Army. I was commanding in Ireland at that time. The officers of the present day are different as regards their military education from what they were some years ago. Every important question
<col>1006</col>
is carefully gone into during the winter months, when officers study these great problems and write essays upon them. I can tell noble Lords what the opinion of the officers of the Army was upon the scheme. Their opinion was that as regards the organisation it was a great advance, a most excellent scheme, and it was hoped that it might be of great advantage to the Army and the country. But I think it was almost entirely the opinion of the officers with whom I was then associated that there were two great blots in the scheme. One was that it would be almost impossible to educate your Horse and Field Artillery in the time given; the other was that the short period of training was a mistake. As a matter of fact it was held by the whole of the officers to be a most impracticable and impossible proposition.<lb/>
As regards the Artillery, when the scheme first came out I was at the practice camp at a place in Kildare. The new organisation had just arrived, and I consulted the officers of the Artillery. I spoke to the instructors, the commanders of batteries, and even to the intelligent subalterns, and there was not one man of that force who believed that in the time given it would be possible, under any circumstances, to produce real Horse or Field Artillery and drill them into such a state of efficiency that they could possibly hope to meet a foreign foe. An inquiry has been asked for. There has already been an inquiry on very much the same subject. On the Norfolk Commission we took up the question of the want of officers and that of the inefficiency of the men, and I believe that the verdict of that Commission is the only solution for this great question.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the debate on which we are engaged to-night has covered too much ground for me to hope to deal with the whole of it in a single speech, and, therefore, as the hour is growing late, I propose to confine myself entirely to that part of the subject which is dealt with in the Motion of the noble Duke. If I may say so, there seems to be pervading this debate a feeling produced possibly by the idea into which, perhaps, noble Lords opposite have been lulled by the successive schemes of Army reform which have preceded that of my right hon. friend. That feeling is that you have only to put your scheme down on paper and before the printer's ink is dry on it
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0528"/>
<col>1007</col>
the scheme springs into existence. If that were to be said of any Army reform scheme my only remark about such a scheme would be that it would not be worth the paper on which it was written. When you are dealing with an organisation like an Army, when you have to wait six, twelve, or even sixteen years to get the full effect of any change you make in it&#x2014;because that is really what happens&#x2014;it is, of course, perfectly obvious that reforms do not spring into life the instant the scheme is produced, but, on the contrary, are a matter of very slow, steady, and patient growth.<lb/>
I want to put before your Lordships what our position is in this matter; and though I know it is, after all, the most barren form of political controversy to expatiate on the shortcomings of your predecessors in office, yet I intend to put before you the position when the present Government took office and the difficulties with which we had to contend in grappling with the question of Army reforms. At that time the scheme which held the field was, practically speaking, the scheme known as the Six Army Corps of the noble Viscount on the Front Bench opposite. It was quite true it had undergone certain slight modifications which we need not enter into now, but that was, to all intents and purposes, the scheme which we found. When the noble Viscount introduced that scheme he knew there was only one thing which would make it possible, and that was the three years system. For reasons which, I think, your Lordships know, the three years system had to be given up. It was not done, of course, by the present Government, but by Mr. Balfour's Government. I have here the Paper which the noble Viscount laid on the Table presenting the state of the six Army Corps. Three of them were to be considered, I understand, as an Expeditionary Force, and, roughly speaking, were the equivalent of our six divisions. The other three Army Corps were for home defence.<lb/>
From the moment the three years system had to be abandoned the Return I am speaking of, as showing what the British Army could do on mobilisation, was not worth the paper it was written on. I say that fully realising the importance of making a statement of that kind. It would only have been possible to have found the necessary men to mobilise all
<col>1008</col>
those units if you had the large Reserve it was possible to build up under the partial three years system of service which the noble Viscount inaugurated. There were besides the three Army Corps which were practically entirely composed of Regulars, a certain number of Regulars strengthening the other three. There were, I think, to be fourteen battalions of Infantry and thirty-six batteries of Artillery. Under any system which would provide the drafts for India you might possibly have been able to have mobilised your Infantry battalions; but, especially taking into account the provision of the new gun, I do not believe it would have been possible to have mobilised one of those thirty-six batteries of Artillery. Therefore when it is said that we have so weakened the home defence Army in this country that if we send our six divisions abroad we shall have no Regulars left here, one can only ask when it would have been possible at any other time to have had Regulars in this country after the equivalent of those six divisions had been sent abroad. But there was something more than that. If you had mobilised as much as you could of those six Army Corps you would have employed in doing so practically the whole of your Regular Reserve.<lb/>
The noble Viscount went out of his way to abolish the Militia Reserve&#x2014;a very useful force who had proved to the full their efficiency in the South African War. There was nothing to take their place, and, in spite of the chaos which reigned at home during the period of the South African war and the impossibility of giving proper training for drafts, nothing was done to set up any kind of training machinery. After all there were so few drafts to train that perhaps it was not thought worth while to do it. That was the position&#x2014;a position of absolute and complete breakdown. We have met it chiefly by means of the Special Reserve system. We have from the beginning set before ourselves two objects, and they are so elementary that one feels one ought to apologise to the House for stating that the British Army required these elementary things done for it in the year 1905. The thing we set ourselves to do was simply this&#x2014;to make it possible to mobilise our service units, a thing which, I say without hesitation, you could never have done before. Our object in the second place, was to build up and train some sort of
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0529"/>
<col>1009</col>
Reserve for the purpose of maintaining that Army in the field. By degrees we are working towards that, and I will come to details later. We are very far from having succeeded, but we are within measureable distance of completing the first of those two duties, and at the end of the present season the Army Service Corps will be the only big deficiency left.<lb/>
Now I come to that astounding passage in the speech of the noble Duke in which he dealt with the Regular Reserve. I say astounding, because, if I understood him aright, it seems to me the noble Duke is under a complete misapprehension as to the object and intention of the Cardwell system. As your Lordships know, you have two entirely conflicting things to satisfy in your Army. One is to provide the drafts for India and the other is to build up a reserve. As the result of repeated experiments in all kinds of service you can lay it down as an absolute fact that, broadly speaking, all the Reserve you can build up under the Cardwell system is only sufficient to mobilise the units. I am talking now of the Infantry, because that is the chief question we have to deal with, and the case is plainer with regard to it. It was Lord Erroll, I think, who quite rightly pointed that out in the course of his speech yesterday afternoon. Various expedients have been tried, but, broadly speaking, the Reserve is only just about enough to mobilise the home battalions. Mr. Cardwell knew this, and he laid it down in 1872 that you must have something behind and beyond your Regular Reserve in order to maintain your Army in the field. The noble Duke raises the point about our Regular Reserve. As I say, the only thing you can hope to do is to mobilise your battalions on the peace establishment. Yon may have a few hundred or a few thousand men over, but, practically speaking, in view of the great requirements you have in the matter of wastage, whatever is left over is a negligible quantity.<lb/>
What, my Lords, is our position in regard to the Reserve? During the period from 1892 to 1898 the average strength of the Reserve was 45,000. In the year 1899, when there was not sufficient Reserve to mobilise the Regular Army for South Africa owing to the fact that the War Office had allowed 4,700 Reservists to rejoin the Colours&#x2014;in that year sections A, B, and C,
<col>1010</col>
which corresponded to sections A and B now, dropped to 37,000. Section D had only been open a very short time and was much below its normal strength. Therefore, as your Lordships will see, the position was very much out of the ordinary. Well, my Lords, to come to the present, our position is that we have an effective strength of 5,000 more than in 1898. We shall have, under sections A and B, 46,000 men; we shall have, under section D, 17,000 men, giving us a total of 63,000. Those are the figures we submitted nearly two years ago to the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, and I take it, as we have heard nothing more from him on the question, that he acknowledges the correctness of them. The position of the Reserve, as I have stated it to you, enables us to mobilise the Regular Army with a few thousands over. That is, I think you will agree, a highly satisfactory result, and all you can expect from the Cardwell system.<lb/>
Reference has been made to the reductions. It is perfectly true that reductions have been effected, and it is perfectly true also that as you reduce each of these units so the Reserve which goes to mobilise the units disappears. But I would point out that nothing plays so much mischief with the Regular Reserves as having units the establishments of which are not full. The reduction of establishments has given us much more consistently full units, and our only difficulty at the present time is to keep within the number of men voted by Parliament. Now, my Lords, to refer to what the noble Duke said about a paper Army, I may point out that the actual strength of the Regular Army is absolutely right up to its establishment, although this is the time of the year when there is the most drain upon it. The Special Reserve of Infantry is within 2,000 of its establishment, and the whole of the Special Reserve is within 5,000. That, at any rate, shows that there is something more than a paper Army.<lb/>
Now I come to the question of the Special Reserve. When you are estimating the value of the Special Reserve the true thing to compare it with is not necessarily the Militia whose place it has taken, but any other force you can think of which performs the functions that the Special Reserve is called upon to perform; because, after all, the value of any force or any individual entirely depends on what functions you
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0530"/>
<col>1011</col>
expect that force or individual to perform. Just as one fireman may be more useful to you than two gardeners if your house happens to catch fire, so, in our opinion, the duties we are asking the Special Reserve to undertake are infinitely more valuable to the Army as a whole than the functions which the Militia had to carry out before. I go further and say that even if it could be shown that it is a less efficient body of men&#x2014;I do not for a moment admit that it is&#x2014;than the Militia was it would not necessarily prove that we had done a bad thing by converting the Militia into the Special Reserve. After all, the principle of having a Reserve behind the Regular Army to maintain it in the field is one that is accepted and acted upon by every civilised country which has anything that can pretend to be called an Army. You have only to turn to the pages of history to realise that the country which cannot maintain its Army in the field but sees it dwindle after every engagement does not stand a chance against a country which can maintain the fighting strength of its Army. That is what we have done with the Special Reserve. We had to have something to maintain the Regular Army at its fighting strength in the field, and we have converted the Militia into the Special Reserve for that purpose.<lb/>
The noble Duke spoke as if we were going to replace the Regular Reservists by Special Reservists. That is not our intention at all. We put the Special Reserve into a place which there was nothing to fill before, and therefore, to that extent, you are all to the good. I hope I have made this point plain, because it is the basic principle of the system of reorganisation which we have carried out in the Army. You are adding on something over and above your Regular Reserve, and that Special Reserve is necessary in order to maintain your Army in the field. Your Lordships know that in South Africa if it had not been for the Militia Reserve, since swept away, there would have been nothing behind the Army; and even in that war, which dragged its weary length over a number of years, but in which the casualties, as compared with those of battles on the European scale, were ridiculously small, we had the utmost difficulty in finding the necessary Reserve. With that lesson before us we have set ourselves to work to find a Reserve, and I think we have gone forward on right lines.
<col>1012</col>
Then there is the question which the noble Duke went into very deeply as to the kind of man who is coming into the Special Reserve, and the value of the Special Reserve for the duties it is going to be called upon to perform. I will deal with this item by item. First of all, there is the question of the class of man who is coming into the Special Reserve, and that, I think your Lordships will agree, is a matter of some importance. We have had reports from all the recruiting centres, reports, that is to say, from those people who are engaged every day in supervising and training these men, and, with all due deference to the great knowledge the noble Duke has of this question, he cannot, if I may say so, know so much about it as these Regular officers whose work it is to handle these men every day of their lives. On the whole the reports to which I refer are extremely good. The recruits for this force are generally well reported on, and in several instances it is stated that a class of recruit is coming in who would not have enlisted in the Militia. In many districts the standard of education is considered higher than that of the Militia recruit, and Special Reserve recruits are readily availing themselves of the facilities afforded them of attending school at the dep&#x00F4;ts. We have had a considerable number of reports saying that there is a better class of men coming in; we have had a considerable number saying they do not see very much change; but we have had no reports that there is a worse class of men coming in.<lb/>
There is another extremely important point, and that is the question of the physical standard of the men. It is a great test of the class of men we are getting for the Special Reserve. I may tell your Lordships in this connection that we have been able to raise the standard of height and chest measurement for the Special Reserve. The standard of height has been raised from five feet two inches, which was the old Militia standard, to five feet three inches, but in one or two cases it has since been brought down. For gunners of the Reserve Field Artillery the standard has been increased from five feet five inches to five feet six inches. Then there is the question, and it is a very important one, of the efficiency of these men, of how far the training they receive adapts them for their duties. The unanimous opinion of everybody who has had to deal with these men is that the system produces better
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0531"/>
<col>1013</col>
and more efficient men than the old system, and if you consider how well men trained under Militia conditions did when they went out to South Africa in the Militia Reserve I do not see that there is any ground for saying that these men will be incapable of taking their places in the ranks of a seasoned battalion. The reports say that the recruits have reached a marked degree of efficiency, have improved both physically and mentally during their six months, training, and are altogether better than they were before.<lb/>
As regards other questions relating to efficiency, you have to take into account the very largely increased number of Regular officers we are giving to these units, and that number we hope to fill up shortly to the full total. I can understand the noble Duke's impatience, but he should remember that we cannot do everything by a stroke of the pen. We know quite well that there are units which are short of their officers, but we are adopting speedy methods to provide them, and in due time we expect to have the number complete. I next come to the question of efficiency of the new Special Reserve officer as compared with the old Militia officer. We are asking considerably more from, and imposing a much higher test upon, the new Special Reserve officer than anything that was expected from the old Militia officer. So that you not only have your large establishment of Regular officers there, but you have men who fill the place of the old Militia officer better.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member>: <membercontribution>Have you not done away with all educational tests for the Special Reserve officer?</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>The scheme under which we are working is only just beginning to come into force. It is not true to say that there will be no educational test. All officers have to possess certificate A and B, and have to do their four months attachment. There is another important question to which I must refer. The noble Duke spoke of the Special Reserve as if it simply acted as a force for passing men into the Line. The first thing you have to consider is the question of recruiting, and I remember that last year the noble Duke foretold a great fall] in recruiting owing to the lack of recruiting officers. That, however, has not been borne out by subsequent events. The Militia recruits during
<col>1014</col>
the year 1907 numbered 27,775. Recruiting opened for the Special Reserve on January 16, 1908, and from that date to the last week of the year we took 26,078. If you add the number of Militiamen&#x2014;1,811&#x2014;who enlisted between January 1 and January 15, 1908, knowing that they were going to become Special Reservists you get a total of 27,889 as compared with 27,755, or actually more recruits.<lb/>
The noble Duke raises the question&#x2014;and I quite agree it is one of the important questions with regard to the Special Reserve&#x2014;of how many men who join that force are going to manage to arrive at maturity in the Special Reserve, or merely use it as a half-way house to enter the Army. What is the system which has gone on in the Militia and is going on in the Special Reserve? It is this, that every year a considerable number of recruits are taken for this force and a considerable number pass on as soon as they are able to do so into the Regular Army. The result is that a certain sediment&#x2014;I do not use the word in a disparaging sense&#x2014;remains. That sediment is what used to be called the true Militiaman type. He joins in order to remain in the Special Reserve. When the system is working in the normal way, your Special Reserve contains six years sediment, and very likely when men re-engage for a further period you have the equivalent of the sediment of eight or possibly ten years. You cannot judge the efficiency of the force, therefore, by the recruits of a single year.<lb/>
There is this further consideration. The man who simply proposes to use the Special Reserve as a means for getting into the Regular Army is not affected by the kind of conditions imposed on him in the Special Reserve. He knows he will simply pass through it and go into the Regular Army. On the other hand, the man who means to stay in the Special Reserve is very much affected by the conditions which attach to his service. We have experience in every arm and branch of the service that whenever there is a change in the terms of recruiting the first effect of altering the terms of service is to put off the man who is thinking of joining. He is suspicious; he waits; and it is some time before he makes up his mind to come in. I do not know whether the men of the old Militia type are men who read the newspapers, but if they are, I think there has been a great
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0532"/>
<col>1015</col>
deal said&#x2014;a great deal, I may add, said in this House&#x2014;which will make them all the more cautious before they join the Special Reserve.<lb/>
You cannot, therefore, judge what the percentage of these men is going to be until the thing has gone on for a little time, and until they know the new conditions and get accustomed to them. Then you can judge. But even so, the percentage of men who have transferred from the Special Reserve into the Regular Army has been smaller than it was in the case of the Militia. That is to say, of the recruits joining the average in the Militia who transferred was forty-three per cent. and the average of the Special Reserve from April 1, 1908, to March 31, 1909, was forty-one per cent. I should like to explain that recruiting opened for the Special Reserve at the beginning of January, but no man could transfer into the Regular Army until he had undergone three months training; and recruiting from the Special Reserve into the Regular Army did not begin until April. Therefore we have taken that period as showing the figures. Of course it is quite true that recruiting has been so good all round that we have up to a certain point very slightly affected the total by closing recruiting for some of the men from three months, when they would have been entitled to transfer, up to possibly five or six months, but the number affected by that is inappreciable. If you take the figures, with 10,000 Special Reservists transferring as against 12,000 in the old Militia it means that the percentage of the Militia who used to transfer was 14&#x00B7;7 per cent. and that of the Special Reserve 15&#x00B7;7 per cent., a difference of one per cent. in favour of the Militia. That, I think, is an extremely satisfactory result for the first year, the year of change, the year when undoubtedly the Militia type of man wanted in the Special Reserve has been to a certain extent deterred; and we have every reason to believe that this force, better trained and in which a better quality of man will be obtained, will produce a higher percentage of men of mature age fit and ready to go abroad as drafts.<lb/>
There is one other point in regard to that Noble Lords have spoken of the Special Reserve as if only the men who were of the age of twenty on the outbreak of war were going to be available. In the
<col>1016</col>
first place, we do not require to mobilise a single one of our service units in the field entirely from these Special Reservists. We require them for divisional ammunition columns, for the Royal Army Medical Corps and other purposes, but we do not require them in Regular service. So you will not begin in the case of the fighting arms to send out your Special Reservists until some time has elapsed, and in the meantime you will have a number of men steadily maturing, and you will have the inestimable advantage of a training machine supported by and taking on young recruits.<lb/>
I come now to the question of officers, and I quite agree that this is, perhaps, one of the most important questions of the whole lot. After all, it is a question the importance of which you can hardly exaggerate. Nor can one fail to be astonished at the way in which we have systematically disregarded what other countries are doing to face the problem, which is just as acute in other countries, of how to get the necessary officers on mobilisation. It is quite true, I think, that there is a certain amount of drying up of the sources of supply, but I do not think it is half so serious as at first sight it seems, and certainly not half so serious as the figures supplied by the noble Duke would convey. I say that for the reason that these cadets have to pass two examinations, first of all the qualifying examination which is taking the place of the old Army preliminary, and then the entrance examination to Sandhurst or Woolwich. We have very much tightened up the Army qualifying examination. The Army preliminary was a very easy first fence. We have now made the first fence stiff and the second easy.<lb/>
A great number of candidates are thrown out at the Army qualifying examination, and therefore never appear in the figures supplied to the noble Duke as those who come up for the second examination. It is quite true we have to deal with this question of officers. We have to deal with it not from the point of view of whether you are or are not getting sufficient officers to come up for Woolwich or Sandhurst each year, because, as far as we can see, that is a thing for which we are perfectly safe for some years to come. It is a much bigger problem than this. The question is what are you going to do to meet the enormous
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0533"/>
<col>1017</col>
demand for officers which you have on mobilisation. Every army in the world, I would remind your Lordships, has the same demand. In some cases they have half as many again, and in some cases double the number of officers they have on their peace establishments, when they mobilise. Actually there are countries which have to have two Reserve officers for one serving in peace time. Of course, our requirements are not as big as that, because there is not so much difference between our peace establishment and our war establishment. The figure of 5,000 was quoted some time ago as representing our requirements, but that was a thoroughly Utopian estimate. I must apologise to the noble Viscount opposite because I informed him that it included six months wastage. It included sufficient officers to supply all the requirements for twelve months. In that figure also was contemplated a thing we have never done before but which it was quite conceivable it might be of the highest military necessity to do&#x2014;that is, to mobilise all our Colonial garrisons; so that the thing was taken from the very highest possible standpoint. Of course, we now have a great deal of that wastage supplied by the Special Reserve, and our present position is that we can, practically speaking, in officers, mobilise the Expeditionary Force, and we have sufficient for six months wastage in the fighting arms. For this we have all the officers on the peace establishment, the reserve of officers, and the officers of the Special Reserve.<lb/>
We have made an entirely new departure in the matter of finding officers. In what we have done I think we cannot claim to have created the system, but Sir Edward Ward's committee worked out the details and produced a very serviceable Report. Lord Lovat was interested keenly in the matter, and we have to thank him for the assistance he has given us. But, after all, there is nothing particularly novel about it. We are simply doing what other countries do. I may remind your Lordships that Germany has a system closely akin to the system started here. She requires 22,000 out of a total of 45,000 officers on mobilisation from the Special Reserve, and she gets them to a great extent on the lines we propose. I am surprised that the noble Duke should have talked of this thing as a mysterious system of which he and his friends apparently had
<col>1018</col>
little or no working knowledge. After all, here is a thing going to be started which will produce the kind of officer that will be wanted for his unit. I should have thought if there was one class of men in, this country who would have made themselves cognisant of the whole details it was those men who are connected with the units of the Special Reserve. I am not going to detain your Lordships with the details of the Officers' Training Corps. It is quite true that they are simply the reorganised Volunteer corps of the schools and the Universities, but a large number of schools and Universities have formed units of the Officers' Training Corps who did not have Volunteer corps before.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>Mr. Haldane</member> <membercontribution>was perfectly right in saying that it has been taken up with the utmost keenness in all those big reservoirs of the officer class, our schools and Universities, and that, so far as one can tell at the present moment, the corps has made an extremely good start. After only ten months existence, there are in the corps 16,608 members, of whom 13,480 are in the junior division, and 3,128 in the senior, or University division. We ask them to pass two examinations and to obtain two certificates, A and B, the former being for the examination for a lieutenant, and the latter for a captain. We consider that to qualify an officer ought to put in a year's training with the Regular unit or its equivalent. We take certificate A as an equivalent to four months and B as an equivalent of another four months. We think that normally a boy ought to be two years in his training corps before taking certificate A, but although the corps has only been in existence ten months there are going up this month for the first examination no fewer than 1,500 boys, and I believe the number is approaching 2,000. You cannot predict about these things. If there were a little less prediction in this matter of Army reform I think we should get on better.<lb/>
This is a movement which, as I say, has taken on in foreign countries and we believe it is going to take on here. You can only wait, watch, and see. To dig up this young and tender plant by a commission of inquiry to see how it is getting on after only ten months existence seems to me to be altogether premature. We hope to complete the establishment of the Special
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0534"/>
<col>1019</col>
Reserve, and we hope also to have another class of officer&#x2014;the officer on the supplementary list who will not necessarily belong to a Special Reserve unit but will go out and do his training with the Line battalion of the Territorial regiment which he chooses to join, at any time that suits himself. There is always a difficulty for a man to give up a certain fortnight at a given date. To make it easier for these people we propose that the supplementary class shall be allowed to do it with the Regular unit at any time which suits themselves. We hope that in that way we shall tap a busy class of man who is never quite certain when he is going to get his holidays. At any rate, it is an experiment. There is one other point. The noble Duke gave vent to what I understand was a complaint about the position of the Special Reserve officer and the Regular officer on mobilisation. I think we are following precedent abroad in that matter, and I was surprised to hear the remarks of the noble Duke because I understand it was the decision arrived at by the Committee of which the noble Duke was a distinguished member.<lb/>
We have been discussing to-night two particular matters. One is the question of the Special Reserve and the other the question of the shortage of officers. I have endeavoured to show that in both we have made a new start, and what promises to be a very real and useful start, in providing something which did not exist in the organisation of the Army before, and therefore I must say I am at a loss to see why these two particular things, which this Government is the very first to tackle, should be singled out for a special inquiry. We are, as regards a Reserve for the Army, all to the good by the Special Reserve. With regard to the Officers' Training Corps, we are all to the good. If we only get two officers&#x2014;and I have no reason to believe we shall not get 1,000&#x2014;we are so much to the good. Therefore while you have these two plants growing vigorously I cannot understand why they should be selected for the purpose of inquiry. We know that this commission of inquiry will never sit. I am equally convinced that if it did sit it would be more likely to demand the heads of Ministers of the party opposite, who neglected to provide these two essential requirements, than to censure the Government which has made a very successful attempt to supply them.
<col>1020</col>
 [<i>The sitting was suspended at eight o'clock, and resumed at half-past nine o'clock.</i>]</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD RAGLAN</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, my noble friend who initiated this debate has gone very thoroughly into all the points we have raised with regard to the Special Reserve. Therefore, there is no general question about which I desire to address your Lordships, with the exception of the question of officers' training. The noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War has told us a good deal about the Training Corps, but I cannot help thinking that one fact has been forgotten by those whose business it is to arrange for these matters. It is that the duties of an officer of all things in the world can only be learned by actually performing those duties. It is no use calling boys in a public school Volunteer corps officers, because, however good the examination they may pass, these young gentlemen can by no stretch of the imagination be called officers. The noble Lord has not shown in any way what number of these young gentlemen intend to join any of the new classes of this Special Reserve and how they will do their training.<lb/>
The whole question of the officering of a force such as the Special Reserve is, to my mind, a very important matter. It is possible within limits to improvise private soldiers, and even to a certain extent, possibly, to improvise non-commissioned officers, although it is not easy; but it is perfectly impossible to improvise officers, and no man can be asked to do the duties of an officer who has never performed them except through the medium of examination. That, to my mind, is one of the most serious points to which the noble Duke drew attention. I said some time ago in this House that I thought the question of officering the Special Reserve was one which the War Office had taken on with a very light heart and was a much greater affair than either the Secretary of State for War or the noble Lord the Under-Secretary seemed to imagine, and I ventured to add that no steps beyond those before taken had been adopted by the War Office. There is no addition to any particular branch of the War Office whose business it is to hunt up these young gentlemen, and I can assure the noble Lord that the work of keeping one regiment tolerably well sup-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0535"/>
<col>1021</col>
plied with officers is beyond anything of which he knows. When I commanded a Militia regiment the correspondence I had with young men and their friends and relatives in the course of a year was something extraordinary. Out of forty or fifty applicants perhaps I collected four or five, and if the War Office hope to collect 300 or 400 officers a year, the correspondence and trouble they will be involved in will be something colossal. That is a point which appears never to have been faced by the War Office, the Army Council, or anybody connected with them.<lb/>
There is another point with regard to the Special Reserve which, to my mind, is an exceedingly serious matter. The noble Lord tells us that the Special Reserve was founded for two reasons. The first was to provide a force for home defence, and the second to form a means of extension from the Expeditionary Force. What the noble Duke and myself, and others who think with us, believe is that the War Office has not succeeded, and will not succeed, in getting its Special Reserve to perform either of these functions. The old Militia had its faults, and no one knew them better than I did. But the old Militia did provide a force which was comparatively efficient for home defence, and by means of the Militia Reserve it provided a very efficient means of strengthening your Expeditionary Force. Surely if it is only a question of providing men for the Expeditionary Force, it would have been wiser to return to the old system of the Militia Reserve, with all its abuses, rather than to destroy that force and proceed on the off-chance of getting something else. What has been done be the War Office is like burning your house to roast a pig. The Militia was swept away in the hope that something would replace it which is certainly not yet the case.<lb/>
I come now to the question of the general efficiency of these particular units. You have infinitely fewer officers than you ever had before. You have far fewer non-commissioned officers, and besides the short training must militate most seriously against the efficiency of the Militia non-commissioned officers. The one great difficulty in the old Militia was the question of the non-commissioned officers, and it must stand to reason that men who are non-com
<col>1022</col>
missioned officers for only three weeks in the year must be worse than men who were non-commissioned officers for twenty-seven days. And, again, no provision seems to be made to call up non-commissioned officers to do duty and train in musketry with their dep&#x00F4;ts. As regards the men, I cannot conceive that anybody with any knowledge of training as administered at the dep&#x00F4;ts can consider that the present force is anything like so good as the old Militia. We all know what happened at the dep&#x00F4;ts. The Militia recruit was a nuisance, was disliked, and was bullied by everyone to join the Regular Army. If he did not, nobody took any further notice of him; and I cannot understand that you can alter the position of the unhappy man by calling him a Special Reservist, except that he will do fatigue duty for six months, and will be bullied for that length of time instead of for forty-nine days as under the old system. I have had very large numbers of recruits who had been for forty-nine days at the dep&#x00F4;ts who could not form fours when they joined my regiment. These men had never done any soldiering at all, but only carried coal boxes, and I cannot imagine that the Special Reservists will have any better treatment. The Special Reservists have the further great disadvantage in that they are going to have twenty days training instead of twenty-seven, which the old Militiamen got. That is the only period of the year when you get your units together as a unit, and train them as a unit, and in which the officers and non-commissioned officers can get to know their men and the men can get to know their comrades. Therefore, to my mind, the efficiency of the Special Reserve cannot be very much more than half that of the Old Militia. That is the general question, and now I come to one or two points of detail.<lb/>
I will first take the question of the Artillery. Last year when we were discussing the question in this House I ventured to express the opinion that the Artillery never would he trained. I think my words have come true; in fact, as far as I can make out, the Artillery have been abolished altogether. The noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War assures us that everything they have done has been so much to the good. Well, the Militia Artillery to all intents and purposes have disappeared, and I should like to ask
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0536"/>
<col>1023</col>
the noble Lord what arrangement has been made for fulfilling the duties for which this Artillery existed. I will take my own part of the country, South Wales. There were four Militia Artillery regiments in South Wales, all of whom to the best of my knowledge were assigned stations for mobilisation at the forts round Pembroke Dock. These four regiments have, to all intents and purposes, been swept away. What is to happen to the forts at Pembroke Dock? Are there to be no men there?</membercontribution></p>
<p>LORD LUCAS: Territorials.</p>
<p>*<member>LORD RAGLAN</member>: <membercontribution>Perhaps the noble Lord will tell me whether they will train at Pembroke Dock? I do not think the regiments will have many men because the training there is conducted at very out-of-the-way places. The noble Earl, Lord Cawdor, who commanded one of these regiments for a very long time, probably knows that after a Territorial regiment has had a short training round these forts there are not likely to be many men another year.<lb/>
I now come to that Arm of the service with which I was so long connected&#x2014;namely, the Engineers. I should like to point out the present remarkable state of things with regard to the Special Reserve Engineers. They are apparently not to have six months preliminary training, which is supposed to turn any one into anything, but are to go to war at once, if necessary, after a fortnight's training in the year. It seems to me to be perfectly unimaginable to think that men who have only seen their officers and non-commissioned officers a fortnight in the year are to be sent into trenches, close to the enemy, with rifles they may not have fired for years. It seems to me that is sheer madness combined with murder, and if these men declined to go into the trenches I think they would be perfectly justified. I must appeal once again to the War Office to look facts in the face, and not be led away by thinking that Engineers are a sort of non-combatant force. How can they expect these men to go into trenches and work under the hottest possible fire, armed with rifles they do not know how to use.<lb/>
The whole question of the Engineers is a most serious one. A very large reduc
<col>1024</col>
tion has been made in the number of Regular Engineers. The old bridging battalion has been abolished, and no provision whatever has been made for moving pontoons. My own belief is that the British Army when it goes on the expedition we hear so much about will suffer. While every other country is constantly largely increasing its Engineer force, this country is enormously reducing it, not only in regard to the Regular Forces but also the Special Reserve. Instead of the old Militia Engineers, with 1,600 men, the present Special Reserve, I think, has 1,100. You had a most useful force. For physique there was nothing to touch them, and they have been more than decimated. The noble Lord has alluded to the question of the true Militiaman, for whom those of us who served in that force had so much regard.<lb/>
It has been effectively arranged that no such thing as the old Militiamen can exist, In the part of the world in which my own regiment was, South Wales, the men consisted almost entirely of miners and iron-workers&#x2014;men who receive very large wages and who come out for soldiering because they like it. In no conceivable circumstances will these men come out for six months. You can get them for three months because they are glad to get above ground in the summer. But you will not get that class of man for six months of the year. You do not want to get them to begin with, because you have swept away four Artillery regiments and reduced the Infantry and Engineers. Therefore, several thousands of South Wales miners have been deprived of any opportunity of serving their country.<lb/>
The noble Lord, the Under-Secretary for War, in his eloquent speech adjured us to wait. He said this took time. No one knows better than the noble Duke and those who act with him that these things do take time, and that was one of the chief reasons why those who have served in the Militia implored His Majesty's Government to leave one force intact when putting all the other forces into the melting pot. The noble Lord now says these things take time, and he asks us to wait. He says they hope this, trust that, and believe the other. We have waited a considerable time, and the longer we wait the less we like it. We see the Militia officer disappearing before our very eyes, and also the Militiaman, and we see
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0537"/>
<col>1025</col>
nothing created to take their place. The noble Lord said. "Oh, but we have the Special Reserve, so much to the front, which nobody ever had before." I cannot follow the noble Lord's arithmetic. His Majesty's Government have reduced the Regular Army and the Army Reserve by something like 40,000 men, and they have abolished the Militia, which, at the very worst times, consisted of 90,000 men&#x2014;that is 130,000 altogether. As against that they put 90,000 so-called Special Reserves. It is very long since I was at school, and I am not very good at figures, but taking 90,000 from 130,000 appears to me to leave 40,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>The establishment of the Militia may have been 130,000, but the strength was 82,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD RAGLAN</member>: <membercontribution>The noble Lord does not follow me. You have reduced the Regular Army and the Army Reserve by 40,000 men, and you have abolished the Militia, which consisted of 90,000 men&#x2014;that is, 130,000 altogether. Given that you get your 90,000 Special Reservists, you have still got a deficit of 40,000, and our belief is that not only have you got this number less but we know that the men you may get cannot by any possibility be equal to the 40,000 Regulars and Army Reserves, and that they will be infinitely inferior to the old Militia. There is only one other point with which I should like to deal, and that is with regard to the training machine. The noble Lord said that we never had it before, and that the Special Reserve is going to be a specially-trained machine. I was always under the impression that the old Militia did that very well. During the South African war the Militia was mobilised and the details of the Line battalion were attached to the Militia battalion, and I venture to think that the joint result was as efficient as, if not a great deal more efficient than, this new Special Reserve force. I look upon the abolition of the Militia as something which the country will regret in blood and tears, and I look upon the fact that you have no force to replace it and are absolutely unable to get officers as a most serious matter. I trust, therefore, that this inquiry will bring forth some result.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CAWDOR</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I had no intention of taking part in this debate, and I should not have done so but for one
<col>1026</col>
word which fell from the noble Lord the Under-Secretary for War in answer to something that was said by my noble friend. My noble friend who has just sat down asked what had been done with reference to the mobilisation scheme for certain forts in Milford Haven, which used to be the mobilisation station for certain Militia regiments, one of which I had the honour of commanding for many years. The noble Lord's answer across the Table was, "Territorials." I should like to follow that up, because I happen to know the story. The noble Lord says these forts are to be garrisoned by Territorials. In 1907 there were some 2,000 men representing four South Wales regiments of Garrison Artillery, and those 2,000 men were mobilised with modern guns. Those regiments have disappeared. I will not discuss whether they should or should not have been abolished, but the noble Lord said airily that their place has been taken by Territorials.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>To be taken. The thing is not yet complete.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CAWDOR</member>: <membercontribution>Still, the only provision made for taking the place of these troops, consisting of 2,000 Militiamen, is by the future Territorials. That is exactly the point with which I wish to deal. The Government's scheme of Territorials has been to transform some Infantry regiments into Garrison Artillery, and to form other Garrison Artillery companies to be utilised for mobilisation purposes in those forts. Those forts lie near no centre of population, but are miles away down the Haven, and I should say the nearest place to the nearest of those troops would be from twelve to sixteen miles by sea. Is it credible, or is it supposed to be practicable, that Territorials who are really Volunteers, who must be trained in the evenings after their work, living miles away from those forts, can possibly take the place of troops trained with guns and in those forts? The noble Lord knows perfectly well that it is impossible, and it is proved out of their own mouths. They have asked us to raise in the county of Pembroke four companies of Garrison Artillery, and we have done our best to do so, although I am bound to say without any help from the War Office. We had no help in guns, and, when we had guns, we had no sights and no appliances, and, last of all, we are told that the War Office have grave doubts
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0538"/>
<col>1027</col>
as to the possibility of making these men efficient. Although the position of affairs has been the same for the last four years, the War Office are now considering whether or not they should disband some of the garrison gunners raised during the past few years. I believe that is correct.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>I beg the noble Earl's pardon. All that we are asking you to consider is the disbandment of certain companies which are very much further from those forts than need be, and we are proposing that they should be raised at a near point&#x2014;at Pembroke Dock itself.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CAWDOR</member>: <membercontribution>Where we already have a company, and it is almost impossible to get any more men. But of the four companies that have been raised under instructions from the War Office, it is under consideraton whether two of them should be abolished or raised somewhere else, where there is no population from which they can be raised. These forts are too far distant to be efficiently garrisoned by Territorials. What are the future arrangements? Whereas before you had a force of 2,000 for the garrisoning of these forts, these companies consist of some 400 men. Are you going to try to draw the others from the county of Glamorgan? If so, it is fifty or sixty miles further off the base. Are you going to tell us you propose to mobilise in the future men further off to take the place of men who are nearer the base?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>We are anxious to raise these Territorial companies as close as possible to the forts at the mouth of the harbour. It will rest very much upon what the County Association says as to where they can best be raised. Our only object is to raise a Garrison Artillery as close as possible to the forts they have to man.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CAWDOR</member>: <membercontribution>Yes, but you are proposing to disband those which are quite close to the Haven in the County of Pembroke and to raise them in Glamorganshire, which is further off. Then, do you propose only 200 men to garrison the forts in lieu of 2,000?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>We certainly should not disband men nearer the forts. If it proved impossible to get men we might have to raise men further away, but we certainly
<col>1028</col>
should not disband men nearer the forts and raise men further away.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CAWDOR</member>: <membercontribution>I was not suggesting that. But you have already suggested that you were going to Glamorganshire for the purpose of raising these men.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>I am not so well acquainted with the locality as the noble Earl. It is principally because Pembroke cannot raise the men.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CAWDOR</member>: <membercontribution>But we have raised all the men asked for. We have not been asked to raise more men than we are raising, but we are told that even those we have raised are too far away from the base. You cannot raise men nearer than the County of Pembroke, and therefore you would have to take them from a further distance, and so make it impossible to get Territorials to take the place of the men disbanded. I only raise the question because it is one of which I have personal knowledge. For the noble Lord airily to say that the 2,000 men are to be replaced by Territorials is not to set the case fairly before your Lordships, because the system, by the Government's own showing, has absolutely failed.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I wish to speak in support of the Motion so ably expounded by my noble friend the Duke of Bedford. I think your Lordships will agree that in initiating this debate this afternoon the noble Duke has rendered a service to the national interest by bringing to the notice of your Lordships' House the very serious shortage at the present time in the first line of His Majesty's forces. I think my noble friend has very clearly shown the absolute necessity of a special inquiry into the condition of this new force, which, in my opinion, does not secure in any way the organisation of what it was originally proposed. I have always been led to understand, rightly or wrongly, that the Special Reserve was formed for two purposes&#x2014;first, in order to supplement on mobilisation His Majesty's Regular Forces, not only as regards men but also as regards officers; and, secondly, to make good wastage in time of war that must necessarily occur among the Regular forces. If I am right in that contention I trust that the noble Lord who will respond for the Government will say if the Army Council have considered
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0539"/>
<col>1029</col>
whether the Special Reserve meets these requirements. If he cannot do so I can fully understand why the noble Lord who represents the War Office in this House has given an evasive answer with regard to the mobilisation of the Expeditionary Force, a force which your Lordships have been led to believe is the result of clear thinking, and which the general public are told is supposed at the present time to be stronger in numbers and more efficient than has ever been known in this country before&#x2014;in fact, we are told that it is fit and ready to go anywhere on the pressing of a button.<lb/>
I believe it is well known that George IV. laboured under the delusion that he was not only at the Battle of Waterloo but that he took a prominent part in it. It has also been related that on a certain occasion His Majesty asked the Duke of Wellington to confirm that assertion, to which the Iron Duke replied, "I have often heard your Majesty say so." Is it possible that the Secretary of State for War may be suffering under a similar delusion, and that this Expeditionary Force is nothing more or less than the army of a dream? I venture to hope your Lordships will agree that from the fact that at the present time I have the honour to command a unit of the Special Reserve and previously commanded a Militia battalion for over ten years, I am entitled to speak with some knowledge of the Special Reserve. If so, I have no hesitation in saying, though I say it most reluctantly, that with everything that has emanated from the Duke of Bedford with regard to the force I agree entirely, for I do not consider it fulfils any of the functions for which it was originally organised&#x2014;namely, as a Regular Reserve for the Regular Army. In my opinion the Special Reserve at the present time is nothing more or less than a recruiting agency for the line battalion, and for that reason I consider the noble Duke is fully justified in making a plea for a special inquiry which I trust His Majesty's Government will concede.<lb/>
As the noble Duke and others have so exhaustively touched on many points with regard to the Regular Army, I will, with your indulgence, confine my remarks to that force with which I am closely associated, and to which I have already referred. No one with any knowledge of this force can doubt that the most crucial
<col>1030</col>
problem to be solved at the present time is the officer question, more especially in regard to the junior rank, without which no force can be expected to be carried on. It has always appeared to me that what applies to the officer question in the Special Reserve applies equally to the officer question in the Territorial Army, and it has always struck me that one of the great mistakes which men of the County Association make is that they confine their attention far too much to the endeavour to secure men rather than officers and non-commissioned officers. It must be apparent to anyone with any military knowledge that a regiment of men without good officers and non-commissioned officers to instruct and lead them must be useless. Therefore, to recruit men without officers and non-commissioned officers appears to be like putting the cart before the horse.<lb/>
The difficulty at the present time with regard to obtaining officers for the Special Reserve appears to be due to two causes&#x2014;first, the length of the probationary period is far too long and therefore far too expensive for the young man starting a military career; secondly, the old privilege of obtaining admission from the Militia into the Army has now been extended, to my mind most injuriously, to the Territorial Army, in which force, as your Lordships are aware, the duties are far lighter. It is quite evident, therefore, that in order to get officers for the Special Reserve a commission for the Special Reserve must carry with it some extra inducement, otherwise it is extremely improbable that Special Reserve officers will be forthcoming. It is upon His Majesty's Government that this duty of finding a solution must eventually devolve. Whatever inducement is found necessary in order to find officers must in some other way apply equally to the non-commissioned officers, upon whom primarily the discipline and the efficiency of the regiment must chiefly depend. One of the greatest difficulties in the Militia, which is now the Special Reserve, is to a very large extent dependent on the fact that if a non-commissioned officer is a really good disciplinarian and does his duty well during the training period, when he goes back to civil life he very often suffers. Therefore I would like to make the suggestion that in order to overcome this difficulty non-commissioned officers of the Special Reserve should be
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0540"/>
<col>1031</col>
liable to military law in a non-training period. Personally I have little fear that if some scheme could be devised to get good officers and non-commissioned officers for the Special Reserve, really good men would very soon be available, provided, of course, more consideration were shown to that Force than has hitherto been the case.<lb/>
I agree with the noble Duke that using the Special Reserve as a machine for outdoor relief during the winter months is not a good way to make it popular. When the Special Reserve was first brought into being we were told that officers of different rank were to be transferred to it from the Line battalion. Although many months have elapsed since that order took place the promise has not been wholly carried out, but one of the most extraordinary anomalies during the time I have been in the service is that of officers belonging to two regiments at the same time. I presume that in the event of mobilisation those Regular officers would go back to their Line regiment, and the Special Reserve would be deprived of their services. Who, I ask, is going to fill their place? We are told, I believe, that the Officers' Training Corps will supply their place. If such is the case, is it possible that in the event of mobilisation those officers would be of any use to the Special Reserve or any other force? I regret that the noble Earl the Leader of your Lordships' House could have thought that by introducing this discussion we were introducing anything of a party nature. Personally, whenever I have spoken in a military debate I have always endeavoured to avoid party politics, and, in ventilating any opinions as to the shortcomings of the Special Reserve to-night, I can assure your Lordships I have done so in the best interests, not only of the Regular Army, but of the Special Reserve to which I have the honour to belong.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LOVAT</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I should like to make a few remarks on the officer question. I do so rather from the point of view of pointing out another side of the question from that which has been dealt with by certain noble Lords who sit on this side of the House. I think it is very important that a scheme like that of the Officers' Training Corps, which has only just started work, should have no undue amount of cold water turned upon it until has been given a trial. If noble Lords
<col>1032</col>
had studied a Report made to both Houses they would hardly, I think, have come to the conclusion that the Militia was being merely called by another name, or that no opportunity was given of handling men. The officer scheme, whether good or bad, at all events breaks entirely fresh ground.<lb/>
Previously at the public schools and Universities men were trained simply as privates. Now regular education and opportunities are given to the masters themselves to qualify for proper instruction. The staff of the Universities has been much increased, and there is a regular sequence which follows the schoolboy from the time he joins his school corps up to the moment he leaves the University. That the scheme is complete I do not say, but that it is a great advance on anything that has gone before I fully believe. What the training is&#x2014;whether it is considered sufficient or not&#x2014;will remain a matter of opinion. I can only say that the matter was gone into most thoroughly, not merely by teachers in public schools, but by qualified officers of the Territorial Force and of His Majesty's Regular Army, and the opinion was expressed that the training is expected to be equal to the German and French Reserve of officers by the passing of the qualifying examinations A and B, and by the four months attachment to the Regular Service. Although much progress has been made, I do not for a moment think that all the work that could be done has been done, and I think it is necessary to make certain inquiry to see if the scheme cannot be perfected. I may mention, among other facts, that when the scheme was drawn up the special service section did not exist, and therefore the regulations which were framed for that particular branch of what was the Militia referred to the Militia and not to the special service section. Then, again, the scheme cannot possibly provide the number of men for a period of years, and I think it would certainly be a question worthy of inquiry whether a further extension of the system could not be devised in order to get your men more quickly. Furthermore, there were questions of pay suggested by Sir Edward Ward's Committee which have been cut out by His Majesty's Government. I consider these points must be taken up to make the scheme, which I believe is on the way to being a success, a
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0541"/>
<col>1033</col>
more rapid success than it would otherwise be.<lb/>
But there is a further reason for which I would go into the Lobby with the noble Duke. We have been told by the noble Lord the Under-Secretary that we ought not to criticise the Secretary of State's plants, because they are mere tender plants. That hardly corresponds with what Mr. Haldane has been saying throughout the country. He has told us that they are most magnificent plants producing flowers, and it would seem as if beginnings have been exaggerated into actually achieved results. The point is whether&#x2014;and it is a matter, I think, which this inquiry can take up&#x2014;these tender plants have had long enough time to grow. It may be said that they have not had time. But are foreign nations going to allow a number of years for these schemes to bear fruit?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ABINGER</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I venture to claim your attention for a few moments in order to support the Motion of the noble Duke, and I do so perhaps with less reason than the noble Viscount, Lord Hardinge, because I am not a Special Reservist, nor an extra-Special Reservist. Presumably, according to the War Office, I am deceased, for I received a letter from Mr. Haldane when I retired some time ago in which I was informed that I was to report myself on June 1 or otherwise my name would be removed from the Army List. Following the instructions of the noble Lord the Under-Secretary for War I have studied the Army List and cannot find my name in it. I belong to no Reserve, and for one very good reason, because when the time for war does come one who volunteers for service will be accepted; and I do not intend to do subaltern duty in some remount dep&#x00F4;t where there are no horses.<lb/>
I only propose to touch for a moment on the subject of the Special Reserve, and, in doing so, may I congratulate the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War on his fluency in defending what so many of us consider to be rather a bad case. I know the noble Lord has had great experience in expounding the scheme. I remember being at a meeting in Portsmouth at which the noble Lord explained the scheme to the County Association.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>That was a different scheme&#x2014;the Territorial.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1034</col>
<p><member>LORD ABINGER</member>: <membercontribution>But I think the Special Reserve has also a bearing on the whole question, because I believe the noble Lord dealt with it as a whole. The noble Earl who leads the House said this afternoon that we had indicated no remedy for the state of things which we allege against the Special Reserve, and that we had made no suggestions for the betterment of the Special Reserve. I think a plain answer to that is that the policy of the Secretary of State for War and of the noble Lord the Under-Secretary is a destructive policy. They have destroyed the old Militia force, and we deny that the Special Reserve is any efficient substitute for it. The reason for this, I should think, is also plain, for the force which trains for twenty one days cannot be so efficiently trained as one which trains for twenty-eight days. The regiment to which I had the honour to belong trained its recruits during the past two years, before this scheme took root, for six months, and afterwards we had an extended period of training. The officers of the new force cannot know their men in the same way that the Militia officers knew theirs, and the junior officers are only now learning to know their men, and not so well as they did formerly when their period of training was extended. It is said that the period of training is not too short for efficiency. Not too short! In this scheme you have reduced the period of training and economised both in money and in men, and the result claimed is that you have secured increased efficiency. That, my Lords, we deny, and that is why I support the noble Duke in his demand for an inquiry.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*V<member>ISCOUNT MIDLETON</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I think it must be evident to every one who has listened to this debate that there is a case made out which has not yet been entirely answered by the Government. I recognise fully that in the speeches from the Government Bench to-night we have been favoured more than has been the custom in the past with a real consideration of the gravity of the case which we have endeavoured to present to your Lordships, and I really should be ungrateful if I did not join in what was said by my noble friend behind me a moment ago in thanking the Under-Secretary for the efforts he has made with the most difficult case put before him by the noble Duke who opened the discussion.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0542"/>
<col>1035</col>
Now, my Lords, nothing would be easier than to enter at considerable length into the speech of the Under-Secretary. I saw in him that glimmering of the old Parliamentary hand which we were quick to recognise in the attempts to throw us off the present and to take us back to previous schemes, and to induce those of us who had been connected with those previous schemes to enter into a prolonged discussion of them, and so to distract your Lordships' attention from the difficulties in which we now stand. Well, that is an inducement which is a great one to myself. I do not, however, intend to enter upon it. I will only say this, that there are two fallacies which underlie the speech of my noble friend the Under-Secretary. In the first place, he argues the whole of his case without remembering that he and those with whom he is associated have made large reductions in the Regular Army. Large reductions never disturbed him from one single half sentence in the not too lengthy, but still full, oration which he addressed to your. Lordships to-night. When you have lost from 30,000 to 40,000 Regular troops and the Reserves which are incident to them you must give that due weight in your own accounts before you begin to square accounts with those who preceded you. That is the first point.<lb/>
The second point is one which the noble Lord has made against me on many occasions. It is that with the three years system we could not provide our drafts for India, and therefore he goes on to say we could not mobilise the Army. Now there the noble Lord falls into error. The three years system failed in peace because you could not send your drafts abroad. But it was an absolute safeguard and stand-by in war, because you had a great Reserve on which you could draw for your emergency; and the thing which makes the Guards, who, alas! have been reduced, the dearest force in peace but the cheapest force in war is the very fact which the noble Lord always ignores when he comes to discuss the difference between the two parties and the two policies.<lb/>
I do feel very strongly that you have in two ways produced this crisis, which the noble Earl the Leader of the House told us it astonished him that we should always be bringing before your Lordships' notice. You have done it by reducing your Regular force and by bringing your Reserve down
<col>1036</col>
to a condition which hardly enables you to mobilise what Regular force is left. Your Lordships are bound to consider what you have between that force which you can hardly mobilise and the Territorial Army which alone remains to encounter an Army that may land on these shores. That is really a serious matter. When I am asked why this was not an acute crisis in 1905 I answer, first, because we had more Regulars; and, secondly, because we had a policy which gave a greater Reserve. Moreover the whole substratum on which the undoubted supremacy of our Navy rested has been to a large extent wrought away, by the confession of the Government, in the last few months.<lb/>
When I come to the question of inquiry I will take two issues which have appeared to-night, neither of which I will undertake to say was known to your Lordships when you came down to this House. Up to this moment we have been led to believe that the Government were in a position to send six divisions abroad. That is a mobilisation policy announced over and over again, and on which every farthing received for the Army Estimates has hitherto depended. It was re-asserted as late as March 4 of this year by the Secretary of State for War in the House of Commons. Mr. Haldane said&#x2014;
<quote>"In the Estimates for the coming year we make provision for three more service corps than will be sufficient to equip the six divisions of the Expeditionary Force."</quote>
We were entitled to believe that the six divisions still constituted the policy of His Majesty's Government. When Lord Hardinge addressed his question to the Under-Secretary to-night, you will remember that I endeavoured to extract from the Government whether that which was their policy on March 4 is still their policy, and I may say I failed&#x2014;though I would gladly at this moment resume my seat if I could obtain it&#x2014;I failed to obtain corroboration of that policy.<lb/>
I ask the House, What is the position of this Government? Is there no case for inquiry into the whole question? Apparently, by the confession of His Majesty's Government, if we are organised to send six divisions abroad, we can fulfil what for ten years past has been the accepted policy and creed of the War Office, of the Government, and of the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0543"/>
<col>1037</col>
country. If we cannot do so we have fallen back. Why have we fallen back? The answer, if there is an answer, lies in the speech of the noble Duke to-night, that we have not got enough behind these six divisions to enable us to send them out of the country. I feel very deeply on this subject, and I venture to say that, if nothing else has been obtained by this debate, the very fact that that doubt has been made patent and will have to be cleared up is in itself important. A few moments ago the case of Milford Haven was referred to. We were told that Milford Haven had hitherto been defended by Militia Artillery, and the Government were asked what would be the substitute for the Militia Artillery. My noble friend endeavoured to extract an answer from the Under-Secretary, and we were told the Territorial Army. The Territorial Force, as my noble friend proved half an hour ago, is quite incompetent to undertake that particular charge. So far as I could gather from the serious observations which fell from my noble friend, Lord Raglan, the fact was made known to the War Office for the first time. That, again, in a minor degree furnishes a considerable element of doubt.<lb/>
The noble Earl the Leader of the House endeavoured to drive a wedge in between those who are moving for this inquiry by asking us what was the precise inquiry we desired. He said that Lord Wemyss desired a limited inquiry. He credited him with desiring an inquiry simply into the Special Reserve. He said also that in the speech of Lord Roberts there was evidence that the noble and gallant Field-Marshal looked to an inquiry solely with the view of establishing the necessity for compulsory service. So far as I and those who act with me here are concerned we accept the Duke of Bedford's Motion. We desire to confine the inquiry to the smallest and narrowest possible limit, in order that we may have a reply with as little delay as possible. We want to know whether there are sufficient trained officers for the Regular force; but the mere fact of the enormous deficit, shown by the noble Duke to amount to very nearly 2,000 officers, in the Special Reserve, in itself shows how difficult and dangerous our condition is in case of mobilisation. Therefore we do not desire a long, rambling inquiry. What we ask for is to have in the shortest and most concise manner an inquiry into
<col>1038</col>
the military position and the military value of the troops who will remain in this country when the troops whom His Majesty's Government intend to send out of the country have left.<lb/>
I protest again, as I have protested before in this place, against the language of the Secretary of State when he tells the country that we never shall send our troops abroad unless we are free from the danger of invasion at home. A man might just as well say he will never mount his horse unless he is satisfied there is no danger of an accident. You cannot know, you cannot be certain, and I make this statement with absolute conviction. If there should, unfortunately, be trouble on the Afghan frontier to-morrow and if there should at the same time be unrest in India, His Majesty's present Government, or any Government in office, would send every horse and man they had in this country within the six divisions to reinforce our troops in India. That being so, it is absurd for the Secretary of State to tell the country, it is playing on the credulity of men who have not been trained to think on this subject&#x2014;that he will never send our troops abroad unless we are clear of all danger of invasion at home. When we ask for this inquiry the question is raised as to why we are not content with the opinion of the Army Council. I feel very deeply the reproach levelled against us that we want to pull up the plants to see how they are growing before they have had time to take root. The noble Earl the Leader of the House asked me how I should have liked that to have been done with regard to the schemes I submitted to Parliament in the year 1901. If I were disposed to repartee, I might say it was done every week, I might almost say every day, and one of my noble friend's most distinguished colleagues spent a whole session pulling up the roots of the scheme and urging that returns should be made, even before the troops had returned from South Africa, in order to show our weakness at home. But these are not the lines on which we are arguing to-night. We do not want to make a party question of this business at all. What we want to point out is that the country has a serious and dangerous difficulty to meet. Why are we not satisfied with the views of the Army Council? It is not we who are responsible for the constant change of the schemes. They
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0544"/>
<col>1039</col>
have never had any coherence from first to last. There is hardly a point in them that has not been changed since first introduced, and that has been done under the authority and with the consent of the Army Council. The Militia, the Special Reserve as it is now, was originally to be massed with the Volunteers and the Yeomanry. That has been abandoned. The Militia was to be administered by the County Associations. That has been abandoned. The substitution of Militia Artillery for Regular Artillery, which was an absolute tenet, has been abandoned, The statement that they would largely reduce the whole cost of the Army, which was abundantly put forward for the first two years, has been abandoned. The denial that was made of your Lordships' protest as to money being taken from the Regulars, from the professional troops, simply to be used, if I may use the term, for the amateur troops&#x2014;that denial has been abandoned. The sum of &#x00A3;2,000,000 has been taken off the Regular troops, largely by reductions of men and the remainder by the reduction of troops in South Africa, but not one farthing, so far as I know, by an economy made in the Army by Mr. Haldane. There were reductions of charge; you can always reduce charge by reducing numbers and reducing the service. The sum of &#x00A3;2,000,000 has been taken off the Regulars. Where is that &#x00A3;2,000,000 now? A sum of &#x00A3;170,000 has been devoted to the Special Reserve in excess of the old Militia, although there are 30,000 fewer troops than the old Militia numbered. A sum of &#x00A3;500,000 has been devoted to the Territorial Army in excess of what was spent on the old Yeomanry and Volunteers, although the Territorial Army is 25,000 fewer than those two forces were five years ago. There is also the fact, which I believe will be a matter of astonishment to every member of this House and to every man in the country, because I do not think it has ever been discovered before, that out of that &#x00A3;2,000,000, &#x00A3;500,000 has gone in excess in staffing the War Office and with staffing the commands, the very item of expenditure on which Secretaries of State since the year 1885 have done their best to economise. But &#x00A3;500,000 has gone, raising an Estimate which was about &#x00A3;950,000 in 1904 to &#x00A3;1,450,000 in the present year. This is the Government of economy! This is the War Office which claims&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>I can only say the enormous number of gaps left in the organisation have required this money to be spent on them. It is simply filling up the chinks.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member>: <membercontribution>I should like to hear the nature of those gaps. I will reply to each one in turn.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>The General Staff to begin with.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member>: <membercontribution>The noble Lord seems to think that this Government framed the General Staff. It was framed by Mr. Arnold-Forster.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>It was not in existence. until this Government came in.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member>: <membercontribution>The noble Lord said the Reserve was not in existence a few years ago, and I have yet to learn that he added a single man to that Reserve. He took credit to himself for being able to mobilise troops with a Reserve which was not in existence when we left office. The only thing this Government has done has been to reduce the Reserve. But the point I am on is that they have added very nearly fifty per cent. to the charge for administration, which would have paid for the whole eight battalions of the Line which this Government have abandoned, notwithstanding that they have been demanded by every military authority who sat at the War Office before they came there. We are in some difficulty in accepting the views of the Army Council under these conditions. The Army Council have vouched for every successive change. They vouched first for the Militia being only fit to be classed with the Territorial Force. They equally vouched for men of the same age, same height, same chest measurement, and of the same training as the Militia being used as a Reserve for the Regular Army. They vouched for the efficiency of the forty-two Artillery batteries which were to be reduced as Militia. They now vouch for the necessity of reconstituting those batteries as a Regular force at a very large increase of expenditure and after a number of men who belonged to them have been sent to the Reserve. The Army Council stated in 1905&#x2014;and this is one of the most remarkable things and one of the things that has shaken my confidence as much as anything
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0545"/>
<col>1041</col>
else&#x2014;that the Infantry Reserve, under Mr. Arnold-Forster, from 156 battalions with 750 men each, with seven years service, would produce a Reserve of 55,000 men; and to-night, as also in 1907, the same Army Council vouch that 148 battalions, eight having gone, of 720 men, thirty having gone from each battalion, would produce, after seven years service&#x2014;the same service&#x2014;a Reserve of 63,000 men, an increase of 8,000 men by the reduction! I cannot for the life of me reconcile the extraordinary statements of the present Army Council with those of the Councils with whom I personally had the honour to serve; and I cannot help feeling that many of these changes in the Army system savour more of the hasty expedient of the Parliamentarian than of the matured policy of the military man who has to fight the battle with the troops he brings into the field.<lb/>
I have never more regretted than in these debates the loss of the Commander-in-Chief. The Commander-in-Chief represented the Army before the country. For the last fifty years the Commander-in-Chief has had a seat in this House, until that office was abolished. At a moment of crisis he could be relied upon to inform your Lordships of his real opinion of military matters, and to represent the Army and the views of the Army. We now have the views of the Army Council filtered to us through the Secretary of State. I often wonder whether the noble Lord opposite has ever reversed those views. Will your Lordships allow me to do that for one moment? What soldier will tell you that you are stronger without eight battalions of foot&#x2014;the kernel of the Army as Lord Wolseley called them&#x2014;than you were when you had them? What soldier will tell you that to reduce the regiment of Guards, the cheapest in time of war and producing the largest Reserve, adds to your military strength? What soldier will tell you that it is better to have Artillery manned partially by men trained for three months in the year than by men who are trained for the whole year? What soldier will tell you that we are stronger in these days, when, as the Under-Secretary said, some nations abroad have two officers in reserve for every officer employed in the field, by reducing 500 Regular officers, as has been done in the last three years? What soldier will tell you that he goes into the field with a lighter
<col>1042</col>
heart when he knows that after we have mobilised the Regular Army we have only partially-trained officers to encounter the best trained troops in the world? I put these questions because I should like to know what member of the Army Council would stand up in your Lordships' House and give his verdict in favour of any one of these changes against the speeches we have heard to-night from Lord Roberts and Lord Grenfell.<lb/>
One word more before I sit down as to the loss of officers. The noble Lord has said a great deal about the Officers' Training Corps, but when you have got these officers nobody pretends they will be anything better than supplements for the Regular Army. I will draw one parallel for a moment showing the advantage of a coherent policy as against what the noble Duke called the fluid view of the Army Council. Lord Kitchener went to India at the end of 1902. He found there a deficiency of 600 officers. By his scheme he increased that deficiency from 600 to about 1,000, as he mobilised nine divisions instead of four. That deficiency of officers has been reduced by from 450 to 500 in the last five years. I suggest that the fact that in this country, where our needs have increased, we have reduced our officers by between 500 and 1,000 in the same period is very serious. I do not wish to go into details as to the state of the Special Reserve, but nobody who heard the noble Duke could doubt that while you have taken away from the Army between 30,000 and 40,000 Regulars and the Reserve accompanying them, you will, indeed, be lucky if out of the partially-trained men who have been enlisted as Special Reserves you can even replace those you have taken away, much less get the large number whom the Under-Secretary admitted we require to keep the troops in the field.<lb/>
The noble Earl the Leader of the House seemed to hold out some hope that, if we could make a sufficient case, he would not turn a deaf ear to our desire that there should be some further re-assurance than we have yet received. I do not think he asked us what kind of inquiry we should like. I would suggest two, neither of which could possibly have the disadvantage of revealing any mobilisation scheme. The Defence Committee of the Cabinet is at this moment engaged in investigating the particular needs of the Navy. Will the noble Lord promise us an inquiry by
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0546"/>
<col>1043</col>
the Sub-Committee of the Defence Committee of the Cabinet into the arguments which Lord Roberts and others will bring before them as to the military value of this Special Reserve? If he will not do that, I would suggest a course which has been taken over and over again by Secretaries of State. If I may venture to say so, I have done it myself. I have asked three distinguished officers to report to me on the military value or the military effect of a particular measure. I ask the Government to-night to do that. I ask them, for their information, for the information of the Secretary of State, to invite three officers who are not now serving, who are not now involved in all these plans and schemes, to tell them simply whether, when our forces have gone abroad, there is a sufficient military value left in the troops who are to be enlisted under the circumstances mentioned in the Motion of the noble Duke. Surely that is a fair request, and there can be no party colour about a request of that kind.<lb/>
It is not merely that we have the great authority of Lord Roberts. It is not merely that Lord Grenfell agrees with us. I served with Lord Wolseley and most of those distinguished officers of that band who supported Lord Wolseley and who are still alive. I would like to see Sir Evelyn Wood, Sir Henry Brackenbury, Sir Frederick Maurice, or Sir William Butler, if it could be done, brought to the Bar and asked if they could give an opinion in favour of the military value of that force of which we have heard so much from the noble Duke to-night. That is my case. That is the reason why, with the greatest reluctance and not wishing to make out our position to be weaker than it really is, I am asking the Government to hearken to the warning we address to them, to see, in the words of the noble Field-Marshal, "the writing on the wall," and to endeavour to secure the country against what may be an overwhelming danger.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I regret that it does not fall to one who could speak with more authority on this subject to address some observations in reply to what has just fallen from the noble Viscount opposite. In this debate opinion of great weight and authority has, I willingly admit, been revealed among critics of the Government. There may, however, be
<col>1044</col>
some compensation for not having held the office of Secretary for War or Under-Secretary for War in that I am not tempted to stray, as did the noble Viscount, I think, in spite of his own caution, in defence of any particular scheme of my own.<lb/>
The noble Viscount covered a very wide ground. His remarks ranged from recruiting to the abolition of the Commander-in-Chief, for which, let me say in passing, this Government, or the party which this Government represents, was not responsible. I will deal, first, with the question of the shortage of officers, which has been criticised by various noble Lords. It is perfectly true that there is a shortage of officers. It is none the less true that there was an equal shortage of officers in the time of the Administration of the noble Viscount opposite. It is none the less true that there is a shortage of officers in every country according to the circumstances. In every country there is a shortage of officers when mobilisation takes place, and I believe that the real sense of the House will be found to be not in accord with the more vehement critics of the Government in this respect, but rather with Lord Lovat, who expressed his belief that time should he given for the trial of the experiment of my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for War in this respect. Whatever may be said against the experiment there is this to be said, that Mr. Haldane is the first Secretary for War who has endeavoured from the bottom to organise an Officers' Training Corps into which shall enter, from the various sources mentioned during this debate, all the youth of the country who wish to take up arms as a profession. I would plead time, not, only for this part of the scheme, but for every part of the whole scheme, which has been in operation but a very short while.<lb/>
We have been told that the scheme is too rigid, that it does not fit places like Pembroke Dock, and different places and regiments and corps in the country. On the other hand, we are told by other critics that the Secretary of State for War has gone too far in trying to meet the objections to and criticism of his scheme, and he has thereby laid himself open to the charge of having modified, altered, and changed the scheme in various details. As a matter of fact, it is no disparagement of the scheme to say that it has produced
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0547"/>
<col>1045</col>
difficulties in different parts of the country. I myself am acquainted with a case in Scotland very similar to that brought forward by the noble Earl, Lord Cawdor, in respect of the Corps at Pembroke Dock. But if you are to have an organisation you are bound to meet these difficulties. If you are to introduce an organisation which shall gather up into a connected whole the military forces of the country you are bound to meet in particular instances with difficulties which can be overcome. The real truth is that this was not an organisation which sprang spontaneously from the brain of my right hon. friend or from that of the Government. It was forced upon the Government by circumstances. The first step towards this scheme was taken in the abolition of the Militia Reserve which took place in the time of the late Government, in the time of the noble Viscount opposite. That rendered it imperatively necessary to take the next step, which was the reduction of the period of active service with the Colours to three years. We all know that that scheme, produced in absolute good faith, with every intention that it should work for the good of the country, completely broke down. It is beside the question to compare the present position as if it were a matter of sending an Expeditionary Force abroad or the number of troops you have at home in time of war. The truth is that under that system the Army organisation broke down in time of peace. It could not discharge the functions of our Army in time of peace, because it was not equal to staffing the Indian drafts which have to go every year to make up the battalions and regiments in India.<lb/>
It therefore became absolutely necessary to reconsider the position, and in reconsidering the position the question was, What scheme should be adopted? The noble and gallant Field-Marshal, Lord Roberts, speaking this afternoon, appealed to your Lordships not to regard this question from a party point of view. He hoped the country, too, would regard this question of Army organisation not from a party point of view. I believe myself that ever since the South African war the feeling in that direction has been strengthened. There is a tendency everywhere to avoid regarding Army matters from a strictly party point of view. When the noble Viscount abolished the Militia Reserve, and when the period of active
<col>1046</col>
service with the Colours was reduced, the change was treated from a non-party point of view. The noble Viscount will remember that the Leader of the then Opposition in the House of Commons, who was afterwards Prime Minister, guarding himself only on the question of the Indian drafts, concurred in the change. It was not actively opposed by the party opposite to the noble Viscount on that occasion and my right hon. friend, in carrying out this scheme of organisation now, whether in regard to the Territorial Army, whether in regard to the Special Reserve, or whether in regard to any other part of the scheme, has been at the utmost pains to consult with opinion from every part of the country, and from every class of society. He has done everything, I think, a man could do to bring in counsel with himself on every conceivable subject, not only with regard to the component parts of the forces but with regard to every part of War Office organisation; he has been at the greatest pains, by the appointment of committees, by the appointment of commissions, and by personal conferences and otherwise, to bring together the opinion of the country, and not to regard this question from a party point of view.<lb/>
I would ask the noble Viscount what he would do if he took office to-morrow. Would he change the scheme? Would he pull up the scheme by the roots? After the experience which the country has gone through in the last ten years, I doubt very much whether any Secretary of State for War coming into office now would have the temerity to pull everything up by the roots, and undo the work of the last two years. The one characteristic which, if I may respectfully say so, I have noticed in this debate is that there has not been one single suggestion. There have been criticisms in plenty, but there has not been one single suggestion of improvement, or any indication of any alternative which might be adopted in one direction or another. It is not enough to disavow party intention. To invite and press the Government to appoint a commission of inquiry is in itself a condemnation of the present condition of the Army. The words of the noble Earl, Lord Roberts, lent colour of a most brilliant description, if any colour were needed, to support that view. What is the object, what can be the object of such criticism of the present system? In the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0548"/>
<col>1047</col>
first place, is there any ground for thinking that those who have criticised on this occasion have any alternative to propose? Is there any alternative which can be proposed, save possibly that which may be lurking in the minds of some critics&#x2014;that of compulsion? I say with regard to compulsion that it is not a question which we could discuss on this occasion, and I will not weary your Lordships by entering into it.<lb/>
What is the situation? Broadly stated, what grounds are there for shaking the confidence of the country in the present administration of the Army? I do not make any comparison with very recent years, because everybody knows that the South African war was a great disturbance to our Army system. It was a very abnormal occurrence, but it gave the country most signal proof of the soundness of the Cardwell system. The Army organisation stood the strain of the South African war in the number of troops which we wer able to land in South Africa and in other respects in a manner which surprised even its warmest friends. My right hon. friend has taken the Cardwell system a step further, and, by the institution of the Special Reserve, has supplied what was originally a part of the Cardwell system, but what we had never been able to supply to the system before. Therefore, as a matter of fact, our system as a system is stronger than it ever was before. In the first place, the Expeditionary Force in future will have what it never had before to the same degree&#x2014;the Special Reserve, whose sole function is to provide a second line in support of the Expeditionary Force. When criticisms are made as to the number of men who are now on the establishment of the Army, and the precise number of men five or ten years ago, it must always be taken into consideration that there is now, as there never was before, an organisation which has the duty of providing every Line regiment in time of war with the drafts, officers and men, who are required to keep up the strength in view of the wastage of war. The balance of battalions at home and abroad has been redressed, and steps have been taken to put the Cavalry on the same footing, so that Cavalry regiments abroad on this Expeditionary Force will have Cavalry at home to support them. On all these facts I think it is indisputable that as an organised fighting force the Expeditionary
<col>1048</col>
Force now is at a strength it never was before. Then take the question of the Special Reserve. I will not dwell upon that just now, because so much has been said upon it to-night; but the Special Reserve is there as a support to the Regular regiment, and not only are the seventy-four battalions linked and identified with the Regular regiment for this duty, but there are also the battalions of the Special Reserve which are not organised to supply drafts but to go out as units and support the Army in the field.<lb/>
Then I come to the home defence Army. It certainly is the view of the Government, and I think it may be successfully maintained in argument, that the home defence Army, represented as it is now by the Territorial Force, is organised as it never was before. I do not mean to say that the organisation is complete. It requires time to complete it, and, possibly, variation in detail, but all this is incidental to the completing of any great undertaking, and these are early days, I think, to condemn any part of the new scheme for not showing perfection in all its branches. I maintain, therefore, that the Army of to-day as compared with the military forces of the Crown some years ago is larger as an effective force and more powerful as a striking instrument.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member>: <membercontribution>What we ask the noble Lord to let us have is the military value of this largeness. That is the point on which we are pressing the noble Lord. Will he quote any military authority on the value of this largeness?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND</member>: <membercontribution>There is an authority now in the country represented by the Secretary of State for War and the Army Council. Surely they count for something. I cannot go on the hypothesis of the noble Viscount that the Secretary of State for War is neglecting all the best advice in the country. I do not think that can possibly be maintained. I say that this is the best organised and most capable force to be sent abroad that the country has ever had, but I do not take credit to my right hon. friend or to the Government for it. The credit for all this is due, not to one Government, but to several Governments, not to one Secretary of State but to several Secretaries of State for War and to nobody more than the noble Viscount opposite.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0549"/>
<col>1049</col>
Nobody has worked harder for the Army than the noble Viscount. Everybody knows that, and I say it most frankly and sincerely. The Army is not only larger; in my opinion it is better. It is formed of much better material&#x2014;infinitely better material.<lb/>
The Army has, I think, more than kept pace with the improvement in the condition of our people during the last ten years. The old school of critics of Army reform used to say it was no use raising the pay of the soldier, as we should get the same man whether we gave him a shilling or one shilling and sixpence a day. That state of things has passed away, and ever since the days when Mr. Edward Stanhope was Secretary of State for War there has been a persistent and consistent endeavour to improve the condition, comfort, pay, and surroundings of the soldier, and so appeal to a better class of the population. Army circular after circular has been issued all with the same purpose. The people of this country, however, do not read and do not believe Army circulars. What they do believe is practical experience, and what is beginning to tell in the country, I am informed on good authority, is the actual, visible, tangible, improvement in the condition under which the soldier lives and does his soldiering. He is better paid, more temperate, more thrifty, intelligent, and educated. There are plenty of men in the Army now, as I am told, who do not even spend their five shillings a week, and that is a very long way from the days which some of us can remember, not so very long ago. This all shows that the Army is improving in public esteem and becoming more popular. You are getting into the Army a finer and better class of men. This is working in two ways. In the first place, your recruit is a better man, and at the other end of the scale the wastage is not so considerable from disease, misconduct, desertion, and Court-martial, which always created a great blank that had to be filled by recruits of the next year. Therefore, I believe
<col>1050</col>
at both ends the condition of the Army has greatly improved in recent years. If that be so, what possible ground is there for this inquiry? This debate has produced complaints in great number, and the inquiry is put forward as being more reasonable because it is addressed to a limited part of the subject. Any inquiry addressed to the Special Reserve would, I am afraid, lead much further than the limits of the Special Reserve. It would range, as this debate has ranged, over the whole question of Army organisation. The noble Viscount is under some misapprehension if he thinks that the noble Earl who leads the House intended to convey that the Government would favour the notion of any inquiry. For my part, I hope most sincerely that this scheme which, after all, is the only scheme of organisation which at present holds the field, may be allowed to operate, to be worked out, developed, and made as perfect as human hands can make it before there is any attempt to revise or criticise, or, as has been said during this debate, to pull it up by the roots. It is only after prolonged efforts that the country has been brought to support the present scheme of organisation, and I trust nothing may be done by your Lordships' House to shake the confidence of the country in that scheme.<lb/>
On Question, Amendment agreed to and added to the Motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member> <membercontribution>then put the Motion, as amended&#x2014;
"That in the opinion of the House, a special inquiry should be instituted into the condition of the Special Reserve, and as to the extent to which officers, non-commissioned officers and men of that force are fitted to discharge the duties of the Regular Reserve which devolve upon them in time of war, and that the said inquiry be confined to the Special Reserve."<lb/>

<title>VATERSAY.</title>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> <membercontribution>rose to call attention to the Vatersay correspondence recently presented and to the present condition of the Island of Vatersay. The noble Earl said: My Lords, I much regret for every reason that I am obliged to call your Lordships' attention once more to the affairs of the Island of Vatersay. Recent occurrences in that island, however, and the consequences which have flowed from the action and from the inaction of the Government, and also the present condition of that island, are so grave and so prejudicial, in my opinion, to law and order that I must again ask your Lordships to give me your indulgence for a short time.<lb/>
Your Lordships will remember that early in the year 1907 the Island of Vatersay was raided, and it has been occupied from then to the present time. The noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland laid down this proposition, that when property is seized, even though it be without any claim, it is no part of the duty of the Government to do anything in support of law and order. He went further, for he told the proprietor that she must defend herself and that she must incur all the loss of time and expense and trouble necessitated by a civil action. Not only did he do that, but he told her that in his opinion the proper course for her to pursue was to take the raiders as her tenants; and not merely that, but he told her that the Government had no responsibility or part in the matter, and that it was for her to compensate her tenant and to incur all the expense which that entailed. Lady Cathcart, as your Lordships may remember, adopted quite a different view. She apprehended&#x2014;she has always apprehended&#x2014;that this course was not only rather wanting in courage, but that it was bound to fail.<lb/>
After a time, however, Lady Cathcart was so unwilling to act in contradiction to the wishes of the Government that she said that under certain conditions she would fall in with the wishes of the noble Lord. But she made this condition, that the noble Lord should pay to the tenant all the expenses which were due on account of his giving up his lease. The noble Lord entirely declined to do that, and the consequence was that the negotiations broke off on that point. That takes us up to the end of the year 1907, and brings us to the period em
<col>1056</col>
braced in the present correspondence. In April, 1907, Lady Cathcart had obtained an interdict against the raiders, taking the course in pursuance of the advice given to her from the Scottish Office. In June the interdict was disobeyed, and in the spring of 1908 she applied to the Court to enforce their interdict. About the 2nd or 3rd of June, I think it was, the raiders appeared in Court and were sentenced to two months imprisonment in respect of their disobedience of the interdict of the Court.<lb/>
The attitude of the Scottish Office now entirely changed. They had been unwilling to do anything in support of the law, but as soon as the raiders were imprisoned the noble Lord developed a keen anxiety on their behalf to get them out of prison. A long debate took place in the House of Commons in which the conduct of the noble Lord was severely attacked and criticised, and at the end of that debate the noble Lord went back to his room and a letter was written to Lady Cathcart which ought to have been the first letter in the printed correspondence. The noble Lord told us the other night that this letter was a private one&#x2014;a mere note asking Lady Cathcart to receive Sir Reginald MacLeod. I ventured to take exception to that statement at the time, and I think when your Lordships have heard the letter you will be of opinion that it was a great deal more than a mere request to Lady Cathcart to see the Under-Secretary for Scotland. The letter runs thus:
<quote>"My DEAR LADY CATHCART,
A seven hours debate has just concluded on Vatersay. Mr. Sinclair definitely invited negotiations on the basis of arranging compensation to the tenant, and I think from private conversations as well, the Government are prepared to meet you some distance with a view to getting the settlement of Vatersay arranged on fair terms, with release, on your motion, of the prisoners. Could I see you? I would come down early Saturday. The matter is urgent. Please send me a wire to Dover House.
Yours very sincerely,
REGINALD MACLEOD."</quote>
I do not understand how the noble Lord could say that that was a simple request to Lady Cathcart to see Sir Reginald MacLeod. In the first place a long debate had just concluded, and Mr. Sinclair, as he was at that time, had agreed to pay compensation to the tenant, the very thing on which he had broken off the negotiations only a few months before. This letter indicated that, for whatever reason, a complete change had come over
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0553"/>
<col>1057</col>
Mr. Sinclair, and the reason is stated in the letter&#x2014;
<quote>"with release, on your motion, of the prisoners."</quote>
The noble Lord told us the other day that that letter, of which he did not keep a copy, was written in his own Private room, and therefore presumably it was read to him at the time. But at all events, if it were not, how could Sir Reginald MacLeod have become aware of this change in the mind of the noble Lord if it had not been told to him at the time? The correspondence continued, and on July 8 Lady Cathcart was asked to accept these raiders as her tenants, She was told&#x2014;
<quote>"Your interests will In safeguarded in every practicable way."</quote>
Lady Cathcart declined. She said that she would only sell; that those were the only terms on which she would deal.<lb/>
But on July 14 the Secretary for Scotland pressed his views on Lady Cathcart, and the result was that she consented to her agent coming to London and seeing the noble Lord. The agent came up on July 17, and two meetings took place on that day. The first was a meeting between the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland, Mr. Ure, who was at that time Solicitor-General, and Lady Cathcart and her agent. The second was a meeting between Mr. Ure and Lady Cathcart and her agent. The result was that in return for promises which were made to her Lady Cathcart agreed to apply for the release of the prisoners. Lady Cathcart herself has a private note of what occurred, but there was no time to make a formal note, Mr. Garson, her agent, being compelled to return to Edinburgh that night because the following day was the last day on which application could be made to the Court, the Court being just about to adjourn for the recess. On July 20 Mr. Garson sent to the Scottish Office a summary of the agreement as he conceived it. In that letter he stated&#x2014;
<quote>"It will be convenient that we should summarise the arrangement: come to at the meetings on the 17th instant as follows."</quote>
Then follow three paragraphs which I will not read, but paragraph 4 of this letter was as follows:&#x2014;
<quote>"The Government, through the Congested Districts Board, will make good to Lady Cathcart any loss of rent that may be sustained by the
<col>1058</col>
change. The Government will also make good to Lady Cathcart any subsequent reductions of rent and will assume responsibility for the rents of any crofts that may be given up or abandoned, rents being valued at the same number of years purchase as in Kilbride."</quote>
And later, in the same letter, he says&#x2014;
<quote>"The basis of the whole arrangement was that the whole pecuniary responsibility was to be borne by the Government."</quote><lb/>
That letter was answered on July 27. The reply began in this way&#x2014;
<quote>"I am desired by Mr. Sinclair to refer to your letter of the 20th instant and to say that it will probably be a sufficient reply thereto if he states his understanding of the arrangements made;"</quote>
and then, with regard to paragraph 4, the letter proceeds&#x2014;
<quote>"Mr. Sinclair agrees generally to this, but he is not prepared to agree to a proposal to lay down any rigid rule <i>ab ante</i> as to the manner in which compensation shall be assessed for loss of rent due to the occupation of the farm by small holders."</quote>
That is a mere matter of terms; but the Secretary for Scotland agreed generally to paragraph 4. Towards the end of the letter from the Scottish Office occur these words&#x2014;
<quote>"A copy of a reply given by Mr. Sinclair to Sir John Dewar, M.P., in the House of Commons to-day is enclosed herewith."</quote>
What was that reply? It ran as follows
<quote>"The Government have made additional proposals on the lines generally of the procedure laid down in the Small Landholders (Scotland) Bill, which safeguard the proprietor from possible loss. These proposals which have been accepted by Lady Cathcart provide for compensation to the tenant for surrender of his lease, and to the proprietor for loss directly attributable to the occupation of the farm by small holders."</quote>
Lady Cathcart had maintained that she thought it unlikely that rent would be paid by these small holders, and it seems to me, at all events, that a guarantee of her rent naturally included any loss directly attributable to the occupation of the farm by the small holders. But that was not all, because Mr. Garson, in order that there should be no mistake, wrote to the Under-Secretary for Scotland on July 30 as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"Lady Cathcart desires us to say that her understanding of the arrangement come to at the meeting with Mr. Ure on the 17th instant was that the Government were to undertake the whole pecuniary responsibilities arising out of the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0554"/>
<col>1059</col>
scheme for settling Vatersay with small holders, and that this would cover any loss through non-payment of rent by the settlers. From the terms of your letter in which you accept the principle that compensation is to be assessed for loss of rent due to the occupation of the farm by small holders, and from Mr. Sinclair's reply to Sir John Dewar's question which bears that the proposals made to Lady Cathcart safeguard her from possible loss, and that these proposals provide for compensation to the proprietor for loss directly attributable to the occupation of the farm by small holders, Lady Cathcart is satisfied that her understanding of the effect of the arrangement is shared by the Government."</quote>
That letter remained unanswered for five weeks, and then it seems to have occurred to the noble Lord that he had said something definite, something which was hardly capable of being misunderstood; for at the end of five weeks the Under-Secretary wrote, with reference to this matter, that&#x2014;
<quote>"In order to prevent any possible misunderstanding, Mr. Sinclair desires me to offer the following observations. . . . In your letter of July 30, you assume that the Government will undertake 'the whole pecuniary responsibilities arising out of the scheme, and that this would cover any loss through the non-payment of rent by the settlers' (i.e.,guarantee to the landlord the rents of the settlers), and you hold the Government to have agreed at this stage to be bound to the number of years purchase paid at Kilbride. It occurs to Mr. Sinclair that some misunderstanding may have arisen from the general language of his reply to Sir John Dewar's question in the House of Commons, and from the general character of the assent expressed in the Scottish Office letter of July 27. At the same time he wishes me to remind you he is at a loss to know how this can be the case, for the reason that what you propose upon these points, excepting as to the responsibilities to be undertaken by the Government, would change the whole basis of the scheme, the foundation of which is and has been throughout that Lady Cathcart is not to cease to be proprietor of her land; while the tenants are to be her tenants under the Crofters Act, and bound by the statutory conditions inserted in it for the protection of the landlord."</quote>
What in the world had any possible state of relations which might exist between Lady Cathcart and her tenants to do with an undertaking which had been given by the Secretary for Scotland? He had given undertakings not only in general language, but, as I say, on two or three ocasions it had been explained to him what the meaning of the arrangement was, and, as I have said. it took him five weeks to consider the matter and to discover at the end that he must write and question what had occurred.<lb/>
Your Lordships will not be surprised to hear that four days later Lady Cathcart's
<col>1060</col>
agent wrote a rather indignant letter. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Your letter, although the language is somewhat veiled, amounts to a proposal on the part of the Secretary for Scotland to repudiate arrangements definitely and specifically come to and obligations expressly agreed to on behalf of the Government on the faith of which Lady Cathcart applied to the Court for and obtained the liberation of the raiders under sentence for breach of interdict. Lady Cathcart has since the arrangements were come to acted throughout on the faith of these constituting a concluded agreement, and she is not prepared now to discuss the entirely different proposals made by you, to which if the matter had been still open for discussion, she never would have agreed."</quote>
The noble Lord had attained his object. He wished to obtain the liberation of the raiders.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND (LORD PENTLAND)</member>: I do not wish to interrupt the noble Earl, but he has repeatedly said<membercontribution> that my sole and single object throughout was to obtain the release of the raiders. I must ask him to substantiate that from the public Papers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: <membercontribution>I can only refer the noble Lord to the first letter. I will read it again:&#x2014;
<quote>"I think from private conversations as well, the Government are prepared to meet you some distance with a view to getting the settlement of Vatersay arranged on fair terms, with release, on your motion, of the prisoners."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND</member>: <membercontribution>I regret having to interrupt the noble Earl, but I was obliged to call attention to the point because it distorts his whole view of the case. As regards what he has quoted, in the first place it was not an official letter; and, in the second place, its text does not bear the interpretation that a condition of compensation of the tenant was to be the release of these prisoners. Nor in the debate which took place on the day on the evening of which the letter was written was any mention made of the release of the prisoners as a condition of any further advance towards agreement on the part of the Government with Lady Cathcart.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: <membercontribution>I must leave this matter to the judgment of the House. Your Lordships have heard the letter, and I can add. nothing more. But this I can say, that when the noble Lord states that the letter was not an official letter but a private letter he is saying what
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0555"/>
<col>1061</col>
is contrary to the fact&#x2014;I do not use the term in any offensive sense. He seems to have forgotten that his own Under-Secretary wrote to Lady Cathcart and said that he proposed to make the correspondence official, and that Lady Cathcart replied to him that she had no objection provided he printed this letter.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND</member>: <membercontribution>I do not in the least wish to disavow full responsibility for the letter&#x2014;not in the least.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: <membercontribution>Then why say that the letter is not official?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND</member>: <membercontribution>Because that is the fact.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: <membercontribution>May I point this out, that it is impossible to write a private letter on a public matter from a public office and signed by a public official. This letter was written, as the noble Lord admits, in his own room, and I have no doubt in his own presence.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND</member>: <membercontribution>I can only give the noble Earl my assurance, which I had thought he would accept, that at no time, either in this letter or in any other letter, was the release of the prisoners made a condition of compensation to the tenant.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: <membercontribution>Then may I ask what was the reason for the great hurry and haste on July 17?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND</member>: <membercontribution>If the noble Earl wishes, I can give the full explanation in one sentence. Under the scheme of the Government the tenants of Vatersay were to be the tenants of Lady Cathcart as the proprietor. It was thought that it would greatly facilitate and mollify the relations between those tenants and the proprietor if, through Lady Cathcart's own agency and on her own initiative, for she was the only person who could apply to the Court to do so, the prisoners were released from serving the remainder of their sentence. The Courts would adjourn for the summer vacation on the following day, and it was in order to make way for this proceeding on the initiative of Lady Cathcart, of her own free will and in her own interests as proprietor, that the suggestion was made that she might, if she chose, take that step. Only she
<col>1062</col>
could take it, and it was, therefore, on the part of the Government only an act of goodwill to make it possible for her to take that step.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: <membercontribution>Does the noble Lord mean to tell us that the anxiety to release the prisoners arose with Lady Cathcart? The noble Lord pressed her to bring her agent up to see him with special reference to this question of the liberation of the prisoners. But I will leave that point. The noble Lord, when he received the indignant letter from Mr. Garson, said on September 17 that there was a misapprehension, and that he hoped it might be removed by an explanation, and he added that he had referred the matter to Sir Henry Cook. Now Sir Henry Cook is at the present time a sort of whipping boy of the Scottish Office. Whenever there is anything disagreeable it seems to me he is always called in to do it. Sir Henry Cook had had no part in these negotiations whatever. He was not present on July 17, and the instructions which he received fettered him and bound him to act solely according to the interpretation which was given of this agreement in Mr. Sinclair's letter of September 5. I would ask your Lordships to listen to the instructions, which are given in the correspondence though they do not form part of it&#x2014;
<quote>"Mr. Sinclair desires that the terms of compensation in respect of loss of letting value, of surrender of the lease, and of the sheep stock, shall be submitted to him before they are finally agreed upon&#x2014;</quote>
He does not leave it to Sir Henry Cook&#x2014;
<quote>"I am to add for Sir Henry Cook's guidance that the limits of the responsibilities, financial and other, already undertaken by the Government, and of their policy as now defined, are not to be exceeded, and that if any situation arises in which it is difficult to carry out this instruction the matter should be referred to the Secretary for Scotland."</quote>
Acting on this, Sir Henry Cook, when he came to arrange a draft agreement with Mr. Garson, pointed out that he was limited to the terms of Mr. Sinclair's letter of September 5. Mr. Garson replied that Lady Cathcart entirely disputed the accuracy of that letter, and that she would only deal on the terms of her letters of July 20 and 30. The consequence was that they could come to no arrangement and separated, and Mr. Garson, after re-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0556"/>
<col>1063</col>
capitulating in another letter his statement of the whole case, said this at the end&#x2014;
<quote>"Unless Mr. Sinclair is to carry out his part of the agreement made, Lady Cathcart must appeal to Parliament and to the public, and she may also find it necessary to appeal to the Court. In the meantime the tenant of the farm is being deprived of the use of his holding, the persons who were liberated from prison by Mr. Sinclair's request, or some of them, are back on Vatersay in breach of the interdicts,&#x2014;</quote>
for the raiders, the moment they were released, went back to Vatersay and there they are now, raiders still&#x2014;
<quote>
"the scheme of settlement, which if it was to be entered upon at all ought to have been carried through at once, is in abeyance, and the position locally is rendered infinitely more difficult. For all these things Mr. Sinclair is responsible. and we must ask you to say finally whether he is to carry out his undertakings or not."</quote>
In answer to that letter Sir Henry Cook said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Government cannot agree to the conditions which you now seek to import into the arrangements."</quote>
He said that both Mr. Sinclair and the Solicitor-General disagreed in their recollections with Mr. Garson; and he added&#x2014;
<quote>"If you are not prepared to agree to what was proposed in my letter to you of the 13th instant, it is plainly impossible to continue negotiations on the lines of the arrangement. The Government can accept no responsibility for this unhappy result. At the same time they recognise their obligation, after what has taken place&#x2014;</quote>
at last they begin to see that they have some responsibility in the matter&#x2014;
<quote>"and in the interests of the people concerned, to secure a settlement if possible. If that object is to be attained the only alternative seems to be for the Congested District Board to&#x2014;</quote>
to do what?&#x2014;
<quote>"to purchase the farm of Vatersay at its fair market price."</quote>
This they had said over and over again to be absolutely impossible. But now they were prepared to purchase the farm of Vatersay at its fair market price. Sir Henry Cook concluded&#x2014;
<quote>"I shall be glad to receive from you a formal offer containing the terms upon which Lady Cathcart is prepared to sell, so that I may submit it to the Secretary for Scotland for his consideration."</quote>
The noble Lord turned round again. Whether it was the threat of this action
<col>1064</col>
I do not know, but he now discovered for the first time that it was perfectly possible to purchase&#x2014;the very thing he ought to have done at the first. I need not trouble your Lordships any further with the correspondence, and I do not think I need comment upon it. I must confess that in reading this correspondence it occurred to me, and I daresay it will occur to some of your Lordships, that from the style of the correspondence, from the position which is taken up by each of the two parties, from the arguments with which the position of each of the two parties is supported, I certainly should have said that the Minister of the Crown was the lady and that the lady was the Minister of the Crown. So much for the correspondence. I now leave it and come to the present state of the island.<lb/>
Ever since these raiders seized the island it had begun to go back and it has gone from bad to worse. They have cultivated little patches here and there, and the wind has already blown over the pasture the sand stirred up by their cultivation. I will read to your Lordships an extract from an official letter showing what the agent of the tenant saw. He visited the island on October 28 last year in connection with the valuation of the stock for the tenant, and this is what he says in a letter addressed to Sir Henry Cook&#x2014;
<quote>"In consequence of the serious position of matters one of the members of our firm, accompanied by practical men went to Vatersay last week and looked into matters on the spot. The state of matters which we found to exist is startling and surprising, and we do not think that any parallel exists even in the worst parts of Ireland. There are on the farm a large number of squatters. We did not ascertain the exact number, but there must be somewhere between 150 and 200 souls. The squatters have on the farm about 200 cattle and fifty horses and a number of native sheep. The grazing on the farm is just sufficient to maintain the ordinary stock of the farm, and is altogether inadequate to maintain the tenant's stock and the stock put on by the squatters. The farm consists partly of links and partly of hilly ground, with a few fields on which Mr. Macdonald has been in the habit of growing hay and potatoes. In the management of the farm the hilly ground is grazing in summer, and the grazing on the links and the green ground is reserved for winter keep for the stock. The squatters have kept their stock on the links during the summer, with the result that the grass is all eaten down, and when the writer was in Vatersay the links were as bare as a tennis lawn. There is no winter keep for the tenant's stock, or, for that matter, for the squatters' stock, and unless the tenant's sheep are at once removed to some place where they can get proper wintering a great many of them will die."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0557"/>
<col>1065</col>
This gentleman states that most of the squatters had put up trumpery and insanitary wooden shanties in front of Mr. Macdonald's house, and he proceeds&#x2014;
<quote>"These shanties are erected without any regard to water supply or sanitation, and it seems to us that there is a great danger of an outbreak of an epidemic owing to the insanitary conditions. When the writer was in Vatersay the squatters were cutting and appropriating Mr. Macdonald's hay, and we noted that they had planted potatoes in one of the fields where he ought to have crop next season. They had boldly and openly siezed his land and his crop, and neither the Government nor the police have lifted a finger to protect him."</quote>
The writer continues&#x2014;
<quote>"The squatters have turned their ill-bred weedy native sheep, including tups, among Mr. Macdonald's well-bred black-laced stock, and unless the tups are at once removed the quality of the stock will be ruined. Mr. Macdonald is powerless to protect himself; indeed, he would incur serious personal risk if he were to meddle with the squatters' stock. It is essential that the links, which consist of sandy soil, should be carefully looked after, and that every opening that appears should be closed up as otherwise the sand gets blown very quickly and the pasture would soon be destroyed. We noticed while going over the land that the surface had been broken in many parts by the squatters' cattle and horses, and that sand-drifting had begun. If that is not dealt with at once the injury to the pasture will soon be very serious."</quote>
That was the state of things at the end on October. What has happened since? If the first place with regard to the stock, that has been taken over by the noble Lord. For the first time I think in his life, at least so far as I know, he will have some practical acquaintance with land.<lb/>
Let me tell the noble Lord what has occurred. He took those sheep over as from May 15, 1908. As I read to your Lordships just now, during the summer of 1908 the whole pasture was eaten up. Therefore for the winter grazing there was nothing&#x2014;not a blade of grass for the squatters' stock, and not a blade of grass for the noble Lord's sheep; and there is not a blade of grass now. What has been the consequence? The sheep have died in large numbers, and when the noble Lord sent to take them over and to have them valued, many of them were so weak that they had to be carried, and, moreover, many of them were either dying or dead. There are, I may say, in addition to other not very valuable stock in the island, some fifty dogs belonging to the squatters. These dogs are unfed, and they occupy themselves eating up the dead sheep, and
<col>1066</col>
I am not quite certain that they will have much more respect for the noble Lord's sheep than their masters have for him. Fifteen hundred sheep were taken over, and I learn from the ex-tenant that no fewer than eighty of these sheep have died since March 1 this year on one side of the island. The noble Lord says he is going to sell them next November. I think he will find that his pockets will not be very full when be returns home. I regret to say that this is one of those good bargains which are made for the taxpayer. We all know that the noble Lord intended that it should be Lady Cathcart or the ex-tenant; but I am thankful to say that the Scottish Office have at last been obliged to discharge their obligations, with which I do not think the Chancellor of the Exchequer will be pleased.<lb/>
Now a word with regard to the settlement of Vatersay. The noble Lord acquired this island at the end of the year, and I think the money was paid on February 1. What has been done with regard to the settlement of the island? It is known that this was urgent. For two years these raiders had been on the place, and the noble Lord on several occasions pointed out that the matter was very urgent. What did the noble Lord do? He did nothing until April 5, and on that day the Congested Districts Board issued a Circular in which they said that, having purchased the farm at Vatersay, they proposed to form about fifty-eight or sixty holdings, but that as the sheep were on the ground and could not be disposed of until October&#x2014;I am not quite so certain about that&#x2014;possession of the new holdings could not be given until Martinmas next, but in the meantime applications for the new holdings were invited. It was added&#x2014;
<quote>"The Congested Districts Board desire to make it clear that none of the squatters presently on the farm are to he held as having thereby acquired a preferable claim to holdings."</quote>
What do you suppose occurred next? The squatters on the island had something to say here. They immediately replied to the noble Lord through their solicitor, the same man who defended them in Edinburgh, who wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"I am instructed also to direct your attention to the terms of the enclosed circular, dated seventh instant, copies of which, my clients inform me, have been distributed by the Congested Districts Board throughout Castlebay and other parts of the mainland of Barra, inviting applications from land-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0558"/>
<col>1067</col>
less cottars for the fifty-eight or sixty holdings into which the Board propose to divide the island. The circular sets forth that 'the Congested Districts Board desire to make it clear that none of the squatters presently on the farm are to be held as having thereby acquired a preferable claim to holdings.' My clients inform me that there are some hundreds of people on the mainland of Barra and its neighbourhood who will probably make application in response to this invitation. As my clients have been in possession of a number of these holdings for the past two years or more, and have built their homes upon them, they do not consider that after the sufferings they have undergone they ought to be called upon to take their chance of allotment with such an overwhelming number of newcomers. The holdings they are in possession of are none too large for their requirements, and they instruct me to say that, so far as these are concerned, it is needless for the Board to invite applications from outsiders unless it is proposed to remove some or all of the present occupants, and to repeat the painful judicial proceedings which have already entailed so much hardship upon them. They are willing, as they have all along been, to pay a fair rent for the land possessed&#x2014;</quote>
Not one farthing, by the way, have they paid&#x2014;
<quote>"In these circumstances, they instruct me to say that they must not be held responsible for any breach of the law which may result from an attempt by the Board to place newcomers upon these holdings."</quote>
So that the squatters have thrown down the gauntlet to the noble Lord. The noble Lord has become the owner. Now we shall see what he will do. I wonder whether he will content himself with another application to the Court and the reimprisonment of the raiders; and, if the raiders are imprisoned, will he help them out? We must wait and see what happens.<lb/>
What I said to your Lordships just now is all the more amusing when you contrast it with the noble Lord's prophecies. The noble Lord has all along looked on these raiders as a set of most innocent men, and he was never tired of telling Lady Cathcart that if she would only divide up the land among them, those for whom there was not room would go peacefully away. Let me read an extract from his letter of July 27&#x2014;
<quote>"The Secretary of Scotland would again express his belief that when the farm is divided up so far as possible into small holdings, those who have illegally occupied the lands of the farm will not persist in their illegal action."</quote>
After what I have read your Lordships will see what the noble Lord's prophecies, in this respect at all events, are worth.
<col>1068</col>
I do not think I need trouble your Lordships further.<lb/>
These events which have happened in the Island of Vatersay have a consequence and an importance far greater than could attach to the island itself. They are only a single instance which shows what may result from the policy of the Government, who are either unable or unwilling to enforce the law. Evil communications spread apace, and they spread far. Since I spoke to your Lordships some weeks ago the farm of Dalbeg has been. raided in the Lews, and also the farm of Milton which I mentioned to the noble Lord, and which at that time I think he thought was not raided. On the last-named farm a public meeting was held and a resolution passed declaring that at the expiry of the lease of the farm next year, they would not allow it to be let again, but would divide it among themselves. There are several noble Lords present who know these islands better than I do. One of them, Lord Lovat, told me yesterday that he had been informed that the contagion had spread to the mainland. I venture to hope that, the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland will summon up a little courage. I hope he will take some steps to enforce the law, because if he continues his present hopeless and helpless policy of merely endeavouring to persuade landowners to give out uneconomic &#x00A3;3 holdings to persons who cannot possibly get a living out of them, he will bring upon Scotland very great evils, and much greater evils than he can at present imagine.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, there is one point I should like to emphasise which Lord Camperdown has touched upon&#x2014;namely, the unfortunate position now resulting from the action or rather the inaction of the Government in regard to this matter. Last year the noble Lord expressed his firm conviction that as soon as it came to dividing up the land these people who had illegally occupied it would no doubt be willing to quit&#x2014;an optimistic view of the situation which I am afraid is not going to be realised. But there is something, I think, to be said from the point of view of the people who are occupying this land. Some noble Lords will no doubt remember the injudicious remarks made by the Lord Advocate in the House of Commons in 1907 on this subject&#x2014;remarks which I have every reason to
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0559"/>
<col>1069</col>
believe were widely circulated amongst these people. I am afraid also that the policy adopted by the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland has helped to confirm these people in their belief that the Government sympathised in their illegal action. If the Government had acted with firmness and enforced law and order in the first instance, I think they would have been in a better position to deal with any grievances which may exist among these people. I do not know why it is so difficult to maintain law and order in this country. We see the Secretary of State for India introducing his reforms in that country and at the same time not afraid to deal with a firm hand with, and, if necessary, to frame new laws to put down, anarchy and crime. I would recommend this statesmanlike policy to the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland, and I think it might with some advantage be adopted in Scotland and perhaps in Ireland also. As it is, I am afraid the noble Lord is now reduced to the unfortunate choice of either punishing the offenders, who I think have some cause to think they have been encouraged to commit the offence, or of establishing a precedent for the future policy of these islands in which raiding farms would become the favourite occupation of the cottar population.</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>LORD REDESDALE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I should like to call attention to one remark which fell from the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland. He alluded to a letter written by Sir Reginald MacLeod, and stated that it was a private letter. I submit that there can be no private letter passing between an Under-Secretary and a member of the general public upon the business of his Office. Letters are occasionally marked "Private," but, as I understand it, having had a tolerably long experience&#x2014;something like half-a century's&#x2014;of public official life in this country, the marking of letters with the word " Private" simply means that they are not to be published. It does not mean that they are at all private in the sense that we use the word when we talk of letters between two private individuals. If the Under-Secretary for Scotland were a private individual, no such letter could have been written at all. It is written because he is a public official, the official representative of the Secretary for Scotland. There can be no controversy in the matter, and this is the first time I have ever known
<col>1070</col>
a Minister get up in Parliament and screen himself behind the word private and say that he is not responsible because a letter written by his subordinate was so marked. Moreover, Sir Reginald MacLeod when he addressed Lady Cathcart addressed her distinctly upon the business aspect of the transaction, and dated his letter from his office. Indeed, we are told by my noble friend Lord Camperdown that the letter was written in the noble Lord's own room, presumably in his presence, and presumably, also, having been seen by him. Sir Reginald MacLeod wrote to Lady Cathcart saying&#x2014;
<quote>
"I propose, with your permission, to treat your letter of June 30&#x2014;</quote>
the letter in answer to this letter of June 25&#x2014;
<quote>
"and this reply, though unofficial in form, as forming part of the correspondence available for official reference."</quote>
It was, therefore, in the highest sense of the word official. Again, Lady Cathcart, in her letter of July 7, says&#x2014;
<quote>
"You say that you propose to treat my letter of June 30 and yours of July 4, though unofficial in form, as forming part of the correspondence available for official reference, and I presume you intend your note of June 25 also to be included."</quote>
The thing is as distinct as it can be. The whole correspondence was official, and it is perfectly idle and futile for any Minister of State to screen himself behind the mere fact that one letter in a correspondence of that kind was marked private. It is not for me to interpose in the general subject of this debate&#x2014;I am not a Scotsman&#x2014;but I do venture to protest most strongly against an innovation which is dangerous to the public service and certainly not for the good of the kingdom at large.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, in regard to the remarks which have just fallen from Lord Redesdale, I do not think he was present the other day when we discussed this matter, and when Lord Camperdown drew attention to this correspondence. I do not think the noble Lord can fairly charge me with wishing to screen myself and my responsibility behind this particular letter. I can assure him that was not the case. It has never been my desire to screen myself or to reserve the publication of this letter. What I wished to make clear to the House and to the noble
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0560"/>
<col>1071</col>
Earl by my interruption was that the inference which the noble Earl drew from the letter was an erroneous inference, and to that statement I adhere. I entirely agree with the noble Lord as to what he says regarding the undesirability&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD REDESDALE</member>: <membercontribution>The noble Lord did not agree just now.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND</member>: <membercontribution>On the contrary, this letter would have been published had it been in my possession and could I have found it. I would have kept the undertaking to include it in the Correspondence ; but, as I explained to the House the other day, I could not find the letter. It was not in my possession, and it was not, therefore, in my power to publish it. This question of Vatersay has been laid before your Lordships by Lord Camperdown in full detail. In one part of his speech his sympathies seemed to be with the late proprietor of the island, and in the other part his sympathies seemed to be with the Government. But I should like to be allowed to say that this discussion, which I have not invited and which takes place at the instance of the noble Earl, comes at a time when the Government are engaged in a carrying out matters of very great difficulty and delicacy in regard to the settlement of this island, and I should greatly have preferred if the noble Lord could have restrained himself from raising this question at all, because, after all, it is in the interests of the whole country that this matter should be carried through having proceeded so far; and I cannot help believing that a debate in this House, however guarded and reserved the language which may be used, will greatly increase the difficulties of administration in that island.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: I may observe that the noble Lord did not ask me to defer the matter, and the Notice had been on the Paper a long time.</p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND</member>: <membercontribution>That is true, but I think I suggested, in reply to a question to me by the noble Earl for Papers on this subject, that I thought no Papers ought to be published with regard to the settling of the people on this island until the settling was complete. This debate takes place on the published Papers. Looking at that part of the transaction, it is very easy, of course, to make fun of this business. It is very easy to ignore the misery and
<col>1072</col>
wretchedness of the whole transaction, and the sufferings of the people concerned. It is very easy to show that what the noble Earl is pleased to call my prophecies, though I do not know where he finds them, have not come true.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: <membercontribution>They are in the Correspondence.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND</member>: <membercontribution>I doubt if the noble Earl can show any prophecies there which have yet been falsified by events. It is very easy also to point out the difficulties of the Government. They are very real difficulties, and they are difficulties not of the Government's own creation in large part. In the first place, the Government are charged with not enforcing the law. I ask, what law? What law have the Government not enforced? The noble Earl at the beginning of his remarks said that I had once stated&#x2014;I do not know when or where&#x2014;that when land is seized it is no part of the duty of the Government to do anything to protect the proprietor. I do not know that I ever used that language. What I said was this, that in the case of trespass the only remedy at law, in Scotland at any rate, is the purely civil preventative process of interdict.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: <membercontribution>Can the police do nothing?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND</member>: <membercontribution>The police have nothing to do in the first stages of civil proceedings.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member>: <membercontribution>Could not the sheriff have instructed the police to act?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND</member>: <membercontribution>Perhaps the noble Earl will allow me to explain. I am not a lawyer, and, therefore, must explain the matter in the best way I can. The only remedy at law in Scotland for trespass is, as I say, the civil process of applying to the Courts for interdict. The whole mischief of this controversy began by an attempt on the part of Lady Cathcart's agents to insist upon the Government applying the criminal procedure of the Trespass Act. That Act was devised for a purely different purpose, and for that reason the Government could not comply with the request of Lady Cathcart to put in force that special mode of pro-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0561"/>
<col>1073</col>
cedure. Lady Cathcart was informed of that within three weeks of her application for information on the subject, and knowing the view of the Government, she allowed nine months to elapse, during which time more cattle were ferried over to the island, more people went there, houses were built, and potato patches planted. The Government had no authority and no power to intervene; and the proprietor chose to ignore her responsibilities and her obligations to her tenants and to leave the island to the mercy of these raiders. Those are the facts&#x2014;they can be verified from the Papers&#x2014;and that was the beginning of the whole mischief. It was in accordance with the consistent policy of Lady Cathcart&#x2014;a policy founded, I have no doubt with the best of intentions, on the theory that the people of Barra should prosecute the fishing industry for their livelihood and not cultivate the land. It was her policy not to give land for crofters&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD SALTOUN</member>: <membercontribution>Does the noble Lord blame Lady Cathcart for not having put these people in prison at once? Her hesitation to enforce the law was due to her kindness of heart.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND</member>: <membercontribution>I am endeavouring to give the narrative of events.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LOVAT</member>: <membercontribution>I think I heard the noble Lord say that Lady Cathcart had not divided up land for small tenants. May I ask how many thousands of acres she divided up in Barra?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD PENTLAND</member>: <membercontribution>Lady Cathcart had divided up something like 4,400 acres, and she divided up that land for the purpose of establishing Barra and Castlebay as a fishing centre. It was an elaborate scheme. Lady Cathcart's view. expressed over and over again, is that it is hopeless for the people of Barra to look to the land for their livelihood, and that it is to the fishing industry that they must look. Guided very largely by her experience on the shores of the Moray Firth, where fishermen have a simple house and garden and where they had given up plots of land they had previously cultivated, Lady Cathcart endeavoured to apply that system to Barra when she succeeded to the estates. I make no question of her motives and her desire to benefit the people, but with those East-coast ideas she endeavoured to establish
<col>1074</col>
Barra as a fishing centre. She improved the pier; there is an excellent natural harbour, and excellent herring fishing there; and with fishing near she thought this the place where a large fishing industry could be established. The fishermen were to live at Castlebay, and the farmers around were to supply them with milky vegetables, etc. In pursuance of this policy a large acreage of land was divided up, some in small lots, and some in considerable farms which were let on lease; but, as Lady Cathcart herself says in her printed publications, the scheme failed because the circumstances of the Barra fishermen were different from those of the fishermen of the East coast. These men still sought to get their livelihood from the land. Lady Cathcart believes they acted wrongly in their own interests. But that was what happened, and since then, as she says herself, applications have been repeatedly sent to her for land, and she has, as she believes in the interests of the people themselves, refused them; and amongst other applications which were sent to her so far back as 1883 was an application for the land of this very Island of Vatersay. I do not know that I need trouble your Lordships with that. In fact, I had not intended to weary your Lordships with these details until I was challenged upon the point, but I shall be glad to place at at the disposal of the noble Earl the whole of the correspondence which I have here, and the whole of the facts on which I founded the statement that I have just made to your Lordships.<lb/>
The difficulty in regard to Vatersay grew as the months went on. No action was taken by the proprietor to stop it, and the Government had no authority to act. In September of 1907 I laid before the proprietor the suggestion that in this case, as in other cases throughout the islands, it was for her to consider the breaking up of the farm of Vatersay into crofter tenancies, and that if she so acted the financial assistance of the Congested Districts Board would be at her disposal as it had been at the disposal of other proprietors in Scotland for a similar purpose. Then came a long correspondence, which was published in the first Paper laid before Parliament and which the noble Earl has criticised, and which, unless your Lordships express a desire for me to enter into it, I propose to pass by. It has already been discussed in
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0562"/>
<col>1075</col>
both Houses of Parliament, and I am perfectly ready to answer any question or challenge in regard to it. That correspondence terminated, I think, last summer.<lb/>
Then came the second chapter of the controversy, which opens with the semiprivate letter to which attention has been drawn this evening; and the whole of that correspondence is published in the second White Paper which has been laid before Parliament. I do not propose to enter into any detailed defence of that correspondence. It is there for those interested to read, and I do not know that I can add anything to your Lordships' information in regard to it. I had thought that negotiations had been successfully brought to a point when Lady Cathcart would have consented to remain proprietor of the island. Highland people have great loyalty to their lairds. The difficulties of the Government in becoming a landlord are very great; the cost to the taxpayer is greatly in excess, I think, of the advantage gained; and, therefore, on all these grounds I had hoped to induce the proprietor to make this land available for occupation by crofter tenants. That was the policy of the Government from beginning to end. There could have been no mistake about it, that the Government intended that their assistance should be given to a scheme and only to a scheme for placing tenants on that island under the crofter tenure.<lb/>
Lady Cathcart took another view. First of all we very nearly came to a point of agreement. Interviews took place, as are recounted in the Papers. Unfortunately, a precise note of what took place at those interviews was not made at the time. It was a grave omission. I regret, perhaps more than anybody else, that no note was made and no agreement definitely come to on those occasions; but it was not come to. There were reasons, as the noble Earl has mentioned for haste, but, whatever the reasons were, there was no formal note of the agreement come to. When a difference of opinion was disclosed, Lady Cathcart's agents did not hesitate to charge myself and those who acted with me and advised me in the matter with a breach of faith. I preferred to regard the whole matter as a misunderstanding, and there I leave it to your Lordships to judge.<lb/>
The position of the Government has been practically consistent throughout.
<col>1076</col>
The position of the proprietor has been perfectly clear throughout. But when matters came to a deadlock in this way I was obliged to consider, not only the position of the Government, but the position of the Island of Vatersay. The population there had increased to something like 150 people, stock had been sent over by various people, and the island was eaten bare. The hands of the Government were forced by these circumstances, and I caused the letter to be written which proposed to Lady Cathcart that the island should be purchased by the Government, as only in that way did I see any possible means of endeavouring to put this wretched business in order. That is the whole story, and I can only say to your Lordships that I have nothing to aid to it. I have nothing to withdraw, and have nothing to apologise for. I do not wish in any way to do more than defend the position I have taken up, because it has been attacked.<lb/>
It is a very difficult business, this. The present Secretary for Scotland is not in an absolutely novel position in having been obliged to buy land in the parish of Barra, in which Vatersay lies. Eight years ago Lord Balfour of Burleigh was obliged, by the multiplication of population on the island, to do an exactly similar thing&#x2014;to buy from Lady Cathcart land, for which the Government then paid &#x00A3;7,500, in order to place upon it the surplus population of cottars on that island. The Government have, in purchasing the Island of Vatersay, endeavoured to meet the difficulty which has presented itself by precisely the method used by their predecessors. The difficulty is not yet over. Those of your Lordships who know the circumstances of the islands, and those of you especially who know the circumstances of these outer islands, will know that they present conditions of peculiar difficulty. This parish of Barra alone among the parishes of the outer islands, if we disregard Lewis, shows an increase of population in recent years, and we are still faced with the difficulty which is presented by the fact that these people are increasing faster than the means of subsistence.<lb/>
Even now, after purchasing the island of Vatersay, the Government have received applications for more land to satisfy the demand of the cottars and crofters who are at present without land in the parish of Barra. If all the available land of the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0563"/>
<col>1077</col>
estate were applied to these purposes, there would not be enough land to go round. There would be still a considerable number of these men and their families for whom there would be no land. The Government have no land of their own for this purpose, and the present proprietors are not willing to devote any more lard to it. Therefore the difficulty, which, is I have said, is a growing one, is extremely serious. Barra is an exceptional place. There is rich herring fishing near it and considerable revenue is brought to the island by that herring fishing, but it is quite impossible for this island to bear any greater increase of population and the Government have declined to make any more land available or to take any steps to make more land available for the purpose of settling the remaining cottars who are without land in that island. The Barra people are a pleasant Highland people, and they do as well as other Highland people when they go afield and abroad to seek a livelihood and a career; but they must realise that the capacity of the island for maintaining a population is at present taxed to its utmost. Herring fishing is a productive industry, but the herring is a capricious fish, and to base the prosperity of a large population on herring fishing is attended by very serious risks. The capacity of the island is, as I say, taxed to its utmost, and therefore it is not possible to make more land available for this purpose.<lb/>
On the other hand, I must again remind the House that the Government cannot accept the view that it is their duty to step in, in advance of the action of proprietors themselves, to protect them from what have been described as these raids. I have already mentioned that the true remedy is the civil remedy of interdict, and it is not until a breach of interdict has taken place and a complaint of that breach has been lodged and until there is actual violence or disorder or the officer serving the interdict has been deforced&#x2014;it is not until then that the Government have the authority of interfering actively in the matter. That, as I am advised, is the law, and that is the law as the Government intend to interpret it. I do not know whether I can add more to what I have said.<lb/>
The Government are doing their best to mitigate the difficulties of the people on these islands by administrative means&#x2014;in
<col>1078</col>
the first case by increasing the facilities for education and training, so that the people may have equal opportunities with those elsewhere of seeking and pursuing a successful career in other parts of the country and of the British Empire. They are doing their best, by administrative means, to improve the farm stock of the people, to develop the fisheries, and to cultivate the resources of the country so that the earnings of the people may increase and their obligations may be discharged; and I would remind your Lordships that the Government have by other means, by introducing legislation which your Lordships have vetoed, endeavoured to obtain powers the exercise of which, when advisable and under approved circumstances, would greatly have mitigated the difficulties of the situation. I thank your Lordships for your indulgence in hearing me on this matter, and if I have omitted to give information on any points in which your Lordships take an interest I shall be glad to endeavour to supply that omission.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LOVAT</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I should like to take advantage of the noble Lord's concluding sentence by asking him if he is absolutely certain on the point that Lady Cathcart was against the principle of breaking up land for small holdings. It is definitely stated in the letter of July 20 to the Scottish Office that Lady Cathcart broke up 4,500 acres in Barra in the year 1883 and settled 115 families of cottars and fishermen upon it. A person who does that voluntarily can hardly be said to be opposed to the policy of small holdings. Furthermore, although opposed to the policy, this lady had sold to the Government a further 3,000 acres which were also divided. I hardly think that a proprietrix who gives up 7,500 acres in a few years to be divided among small holders is a person who has fixed East-coast ideas which she wishes to apply to the West.<lb/>
This policy of misrepresentation against Lady Cathcart, both in this House and in another place, has been most marked. When the Vatersay question first came up Lady Cathcart was described by Lord Shaw, who I am sorry is not in his place to-night, as a lady who was most unfortunate in her dealings with her tenants. Of all proprietors, that could with the least justice be said of Lady Cathcart. She has constructed piers, built houses. and divided
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0564"/>
<col>1079</col>
land for her tenants and has lost money over every single one of these undertakings; and now to be held up by His Majesty's Government as opposed to small holdings is nothing less than scandalous. The noble Lord stated that Lady Cathcart would not give the land of Vatersay. She was perfectly prepared to do so provided that compensation was paid. She was certainly opposed to giving the land of Vatersay for division. Why? Because it was reported that the land was not sufficiently watered; and in the report of the medical officer for the County of Inverness for last month is a further statement to that effect.<lb/>
In these circumstances I do not see how it can be said that a lady who has divided three-quarters of the whole of her farm land in Barra amongst the crofters has not played her part in wishing to meet the undoubted overcrowding. As to the astounding claim which the noble Lord now brings forward of consistency of action on the part of the Government, I must say I can trace no consistency whatever. In the correspondence they first declined to give compensation, and then they give compensation. They first declined to buy the farm, and then they buy it. Personally, I cannot trace consistency in one single act of the Scottish Office in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD SALTOUN</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the noble Lord the Secretary for Scotland endeavoured to explain the course of action to be taken by a proprietor in the event of land being raided. I do not know whether the noble Lord remembers that about the year 1890 a raid took place in the Lews, and on that occasion the sheriff was applied to and a strong force of police sent over, with the result that order was quickly restored in that island. I note the noble Lord's statement that that is not the way in which the law is interpreted by His Majesty's present Government. There is not much more to be said in this discussion, but we can hardly close it without your Lordships joining with me in congratulating the Secretary for Scotland on the glorious state of chaos to which he has reduced the island of Vatersay. I have the honour to know Lady Cathcart well, and can testify to the fact that she is one of the kindest and most generous of landlords. I do not believe there is one landlord in Scotland, or, indeed, in the whole of the United Kingdom, more beloved than she is by tenants or who has
<col>1080</col>
done more for them. The accusations against Lady Cathcart contained in this correspondence are absolutely uncalled for and in discordance with the real facts. The whole of the details of the case regarding Vatersay have been amply and fully explained by my noble friend Lord Camperdown, and it would be superfluous for me to enter into them. The whole policy of the Secretary for Scotland from the commencement of the matter was that he would not purchase the island. I am glad to say that that policy has been defeated, and that the island has been purchased. I wish the noble Lord joy of it, and I think it is a matter for congratulation to Lady Cathcart that she is now free of the island. It is now the work of the Government to do what they can with it, and to see if they can make it a success. I cannot resume my seat without saying that I, and, I believe, many noble Lords, condemn most emphatically the whole policy and correspondence of the Secretary for Scotland in this connection during the last two years. What has occurred is absolutely, entirely, and solely due to him and to his policy.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE OVERFACING OF HORSES.</title>
<p><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member> <membercontribution>had a Notice on the Paper, "to call attention to the overtaxing of contractors' horses in the streets of London." The noble Lord said: My Lords, as there is a great deal of important business before the House this evening I will get through what I have to say as quickly as possible. I do not altogether like the wording of the Notice as it appears on the Paper. The word "overtaxing" just now has a rather sinister sound. The word I had suggested was "overfacing," which I thought was fairly well understood, but I was informed at the Table that if I used that word hardly anybody in your Lordships' House would understand what I meant. I therefore altered it to overtaxing.<lb/>
I was led to put this Notice on the Paper by what has been going on now for some time on the site of the old War Office, which building is being removed for the new premises of the Automobile Club. The site belonged to the Woods and Forests Department, and the old buildings were sold, I believe, to Mr. Trollope, who I suppose is the builder for the Automobile Club, and Mr. Trollope let the sub-contract
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0565"/>
<col>1081</col>
for carrying away the materials to Mr. Henry Boyer. That introduces your Lordships to the locality where I say this is going on, for although the Notice is drawn rather broadly, I do not in any way wish to enter upon a sort of roving commission against all the contractors of London. On June 3 last year, just outside Brooks's Club, two or three of Mr. Boyer's carts got into very considerable confusion. One horse was down through not being equal to its load; it was a game horse and did its best, but it fell. There were one or two other carts following, drawn by over-faced horses.<lb/>
There were a good many people in the club at the time, and. we were all much displeased and disquieted about it. I myself spoke to the carter in charge of the horse which seemed least able to get up the hill&#x2014;not the horse that was down, but an overfaced horse which was quite unable to pull the load up the steep hill. I have been watching Mr. Boyer's operations ever since that time, and have spoken to several of his carters; and I should here like to pay a high tribute to those carters. I never met a carter in charge of one of Mr. Boyer's carts who was not anxious to do his best for his horse, and I never saw one of those men strike a horse. One carter said that if they only had trace horses they could get up the hill, but as it was they had to depend. on people putting their shoulders to the wheel and helping them. I believe that is not altogether due to the affectionate regard and respect which everybody feels for the splendid strength and docility of the English cart horse. It may have something to do with that, but I think it is mainly due to the increased consideration and improved attitude in all these matters which have come about during the last twenty years. I have noticed it in connection with hansom cabs. The hansom cab horse is not so good an animal now as he used to be, and the living of the cabdriver is net so easy to get, but the whips which the drivers use are much shorter, less pliant, and much less active than they used to be. Indeed, I can say for all the drivers in London that they now realise what a horse can do and what it cannot do.<lb/>
On the occasion to which I have referred three or four of us in the club were very much upset. I myself went round at once
<col>1082</col>
to the offices of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, where I was most kindly received. One of their officers, a very capable man he seemed, came round to the club, and I was able to show him three or four of these carts anchored in more or less unbecoming positions in St. James's Street and the streets leading out of St. James's Street. The society took the matter up. They at once wrote to Mr. Boyer, and I have seen the correspondence that passed. It does credit to all parties. Mr. Boyer accepted all the chastenings he received at the hands of the society in a very kindly spirit, and promised amendment. He also promised that trace horses would be supplied. Things certainly got a good;deal better, but I kept my eye more or less on what was going on, and I saw that horses occasionally found a difficulty with their loads. But you will see that anywhere. The class of horse which Mr. Boyer employed for this work improved very much. Previously the horses were poor, overfaced animals, but now good carthorses are used.<lb/>
But on Saturday, the 8th instant, which happened to be a hot day, we again had two or three carts stuck just outside Brooks's. I at once went to the site where these operations were going on to try and find whether trace horses were there to help the cart horses up the hill. I found thirty or forty carts, with excellent high-class cart horses attached, being loaded, but Mr. Boyer had not a single man there to regulate the loading of the carts, although the horses were of a different weight and different power. I saw Mr. Trollope's foreman, who seemed to me a very good type of Englishman of this class. He told me he had nothing to do with the carts but that they were all loaded on the contractor's rule, which amounted to a load of something between 24 cwt. and 30 cwt. I inquired if that was an inexorable rule whether the load was to be drawn along Pall Mall or the Strand or whether it had to go up St. James's Street or Notting Hill. I asked if an old horse was put to the same work as a five-year-old or six-year-old horse, which could pull two or three tons. The foreman replied that the rule was an inexorable one, and that all the horses had to pull this load. I inquired where the trace horses were, and he said he would telephone to Trollope's and inquire. It turned out that no trace
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0566"/>
<col>1083</col>
horses were being allowed on that day&#x2014;a Saturday&#x2014;until 2.30.<lb/>
Then I went again to my old friend the society. I got to the society's office at 12 o'clock, but found only a clerk and a messenger there. I was informed that all the officers and everybody connected with the society were away at the Crystal Palace. I was under the impression that some atrocity against the animal world was being organised at the Crystal Palace and that consequently all the officers had gone there to see what they could do about it. But it turned out that this Saturday was a particular day in the history of the society of which we are all proud, and the officials had gone to the Crystal Palace to a gathering I believe of a semi-convivial character. I then had to consider what should be done next. I thought that if I could make the Government responsible I should very much like to do it, and I had a sort of idea that it was possible that part of the contract with Mr. Trollope was that the Government should remove some of the materials. So I rushed off to the War Office to see Lord Lucas, as I thought it might have something to do with him. I also went to the Department of Woods and Forests. But it turned out that the whole of the responsibility came back to Mr. Boyer.<lb/>
As the Government cannot be harassed upon this it may be asked what is the use of bringing this sort of question before the House of Lords, when, as a matter of fact there is no one to give a reply. That is a perfectly fair and businesslike view to take, but it is not the view I take myself. I think this is just the kind of case where we can occasionally do a little good by appealing to public opinion. I desire to be fair to everybody. In what I am urging I do not contend that there is any actual cruelty. The carters avoid that. The carts do ultimately get up the hill even if over-loaded, but that is due, I am afraid, not to the provision made by the contractor, but to the good-natured people who render assistance. It seems to me that this particular contractor, at all events, and I daresay a good many more, in their resolution to get the maximum of work out of the minimum of horseflesh, are not so amenable to those general considerations of clemency and fair treatment to which I alluded just now, and which, as I say, agreeably distinguish the present
<col>1084</col>
day from, say, twenty years ago. I think that in all these cases trace horses should be provided as in Paris, where they are not supposed to be quite so particular about horses as we are; and if anything of that sort is done as the result of what I have said in your Lordships' House this afternoon I shall be very pleased.</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ABERDARE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, although there has been no censure on the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, yet I think, as a member of the executive body of that society, I ought to give a few words of explanation. The noble Lord complained to the society regarding the horses of Mr. Boyer being overfaced, and from that day the officers of the society have been carefully watching the loading on the site of the old War Office; and the veterinary officer has also been there and looked at the horses. We all know that there is no better judge of horses than Lord Ribblesdale, and therefore we felt quite sure that when the noble Lord told us that the horses he saw were unequal to their work he was stating what was the fact. Our officers have been down there regularly ever since, and they state that they cannot substantiate any case of cruelty. Therefore the assumption is that the action of the noble Lord in making this complaint has been completely successful, and that all the horses that were unable to do their work have been eliminated.<lb/>
With regard to the horse that fell in front of Brooks's Club, I suppose, as is often the case, there was a check in the traffic at the time, and a horse that is obliged to stand still with a heavy load often, on making a fresh start, falls. I am assured that the loads have lately not been more than twenty-four hundredweight, which is not too much for an, ordinary contractor's horse to manage. At the same time I should like to say that the society are only too glad when people in the position of Lord Ribblesdale come forward with these complaints and so help the society. As to all the officers being away on the particular Saturday and also to what Lord Ribblesdale said about the conviviality on that occasion, I may say that this is the hardest day's work the men have in the year. A prize is given to every school in and near London for the best essay on kindness to animals, and the result on this Saturday
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0567"/>
<col>1085</col>
was that 1,620 schools competed; that number of prizes were awarded and also a similar number of certificates were given to other children. These 3,000 odd children had to be marshalled in the Crystal Palace, and, in addition, over 20,000 adults and children were there to witness the scene. Unless the very greatest care was taken on these occasions there might be a catastrophe, and although we withdrew all our men on that day we had not sufficient and had to fall back on the police pensioners for assistance. I hope this thoroughly explains the absence of any inspectors at the society's offices on the occasion to which the noble Lord inferred.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member>: <membercontribution>I should like to explain that by the word convivial I meant that it was a pleasant gathering. With regard to this matter, I hope the society will insist that trace horses are provided. Mr. Boyer promises that, if full loads were put on, trace horses should be used to pull the carts up St. James's Street. What I complain of is that the trace horses are not there.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD STEWARD (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I only rise to say that the Home Office will, of course, note the noble Lord's complaint and will take steps to see that contractors' horses are watched. I am sure the noble Lord realises that action can only be taken if definite cruelty is caused, and he himself has admitted that even in his opinion there was no real cruelty. I am sure we all feel glad that the horses of London have a friend so ready to take trouble on their behalf as the noble Lord, and we wish him success in his efforts.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MEAT MARKING BILL. [H. L.]</title>
<p>[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p>Order of the day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, a Bill on this subject was introduced by Lord Lamington in your Lordships' House in 1888. Another Bill was brought in in the House of Commons in 1890, and in 1893 there were no fewer than three Bills introduced one by the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees. The last-mentioned Bill led to the appointment of a Committee of your Lordships' House,
<col>1086</col>
who recommended that every person dealing in imported meat should be com- pelled to register as such and have a notice plainly exhibited over his shop that he was registered as a dealer in imported meat. Most of the Bills dealt with the question of placing labels upon foreign meat, licensing the places where it was sold and insisting upon a notice being placed over a shop where it was for sale. In 1894 and 1895 there were two further Bills.<lb/>
I may say that these various measures were not confined to one side of the House, but were brought forward by a variety of Members representing every shade of political opinion. In 1896 there were other Bills, and in 1897 the House of Commons appointed a Committee to inquire into the subject. The last Bill that I can find was introduced in the House of Commons in 1903. These measures were all more or less of the same nature. They contained the simple principle of this Bill, and in asking your Lordships to give my Bill a Second Reading I ask you in no way to commit yourselves beyond the principle that it is fair that the buyer should have an opportunity of knowing what he is buying. In the Reports of both of the Committees to which I have referred there is ample evidence to show that it is almost impossible for anyone except an expert to say whether the meat displayed in butchers' shops is foreign or home grown. At the same time it is admitted that there is no difficulty at all on the part of the wholesale dealer in ascertaining whether he is buying foreign or British meat.<lb/>
It may be said that this Bill savours of Protection. I entirely fail to see it, and I disclaim that there is anything at the back of my mind which leans towards this Bill on the score of Protection. In numerous places in the Reports of the Committees that have considered this question it is stated that the only desire of those interested in this legislation is that it shall be perfectly clear to the consumer what he is buying. In addition, it was frequently asserted by witnesses that the exact effect which this marking would have upon foreign and home-grown produce was extremely doubtful. Many people contend that the effect might very possibly be to place the best of the foreign and imported meat above some of the second-class English meat, though as a general rule it is admitted that the best English meat is
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0568"/>
<col>1087</col>
superior to anything which is imported into this country.<lb/>
When the Committee of your Lordships' House sat in 1893, it was estimated that the proportion of home-grown meat to foreign imported meat was two-thirds of the total consumption. In 1900 the percentage of home-grown to foreign was fifty-six, in 1906 it was fifty-three, and in 1908, fifty-four. The places of origin were chiefly the United States, New Zealand, and the Argentine Republic. There has been this curious change. The imports from America had been more or less stationary for many years, but in the last year of which I have any figures&#x2014;1908&#x2014;the importation from the United States had decreased by very nearly half, while the importation from Argentina had been rapidly increasing. That this is likely to continue is rather evidenced by the fact that the great American shippers have been making active inquiries and have in some cases developed considerable interest in the meat shipping companies of Argentina.<lb/>
Marking, which is the chief method proposed in this Bill for identifying foreign produce, is a system which obtains in a large number of other countries. I believe it was asserted by one witness before the Committee that the only Continental country that does not mark its meat in some form or another is France. The Canadian Board of Agriculture have promoted a Bill by which all dairy produce has to be marked, and we are told that all meat imported from the United States into Canada has also to be marked. The evidence with regard to New Zealand is rather interesting. The Agent-General for New Zealand stated before the Committee of your Lordships' House that he did not think that in New Zealand at that time there was any strong feeling in favour of marking meat; whereas in 1907 evidence was given before the Committee of the House of Commons that the feeling in New Zealand in favour of marking meat had grown considerably, and that there was a proposal to bring in a Bill for this purpose.<lb/>
As to the necessity for this marking, I am very far from asserting that it is occasioned by anything which could strictly be called fraud, except in minor cases, but there is a large amount of deception. When we consider the small number of
<col>1088</col>
traders in London who profess to sell imported meat, whereas it is known that by far the larger portion of it is sold in the principal towns, and particularly in London, there can be very little doubt that a large amount of foreign meat is shown and sold in shops together with British meat, and as the same price is charged for the meat from both sources the consumer is apt to conclude that it is of the same origin. It is true that there are very few authenticated cases where when the question is asked the seller actually gives false information. The object of the Bill is to put the consumer on his guard, to warn him of the places in which foreign meat is sold, and to give him an opportunity of asking the question as to exactly what he is buying and of exercising his own discretion as to whether he will buy this meat or not.<lb/>
There is, to a certain extent, fraud underlying this, because the meat for which, under this misconception, the consumer is giving full price would have to be sold at a very much lower rate if retailed, with the same profit, at its market price. We are told that one of the methods of the trade is that large traders, like Eastmans and others, who deal openly and almost exclusively in foreign meat, deal very largely in the inferior joints, the superior joints, the sirloins, &amp;c., being sold to other shops where they are disposed of with the British produce, and in this way customers are deceived. The method of marking is a matter of detail on which I do not profess to be able to enlighten your Lordships very much. The object of the Bill is that every part of the carcase which can form a joint as a joint is ordinarily cut, should bear some part of the mark. If only a letter it would be sufficient to make it perfectly clear that the meat was foreign and not home-grown. The Bill makes no profession to being able to secure the marking of every slice and every chop that may be cut. Nor do I think it at all necessary, because once the consumer was put on his guard, as he could not fail to be if the carcases hanging in the shop were marked, that meat of foreign extraction was being sold there, he would then have a very large portion of the protection necessary.<lb/>
There is no question, from the evidence given before both Committees and also from our experience of the Merchandise Marks Act, that the proper place where
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0569"/>
<col>1089</col>
this marking should be done is the country of export. In nearly every country from which meat is exported it is, for various trade reasons and for purposes of inspection, very of ten marked under any circumstances, and the requirement that it shall be marked in a certain way would give very little trouble indeed to the exporter, whereas it would obviously give a great deal of trouble if it bad to be done when the cargo was being landed at the wharf here. In many of the earlier Bills cattle imported into this country alive and ,slaughtered here were regarded as being home-bred animals. As time progressed, and as this habit of importing animals and killing them on their landing in this country grew, animals that were killed within a limited time&#x2014;ten days or so&#x2014;after arrival came to be inserted in proposed legislation as animals of foreign origin. Considerable reluctance was shown before both Committees on the part of our Colonies to their meat being classed, as foreign meat. For that reason the suggestion in the Bill is that all meat imported dead should be marked in the country of origin with the word " Foreign" or "Colonial" in printed capital letters, and that in the case of animals imported alive for slaughter every carcase is to be similarly marked before removal from the abattoir. Many of the Colonies think that, in addition to their meat being described under the general term. of" Colonial," each Colony should have a distinguishing mark, but this is rather a matter for the Colonies themselves to arrange.<lb/>
There is a provision in Clause 4 making it the duty of the Commissioners of Customs to see that the meat is marked in the way described. It has been pointed out that this might entail a very large body of inspectors, but I do not see that that is absolutely necessary. It would be necessary if the marking had to be done in this country, because it would then be necessary for inspectors to inspect every single carcase; but when there is a general rule that every carcass of meat imported has to be marked, it is quite easy to check whether that has been done by examining a certain percentage of the carcases. Those that escape examination of that kind are probably not likely to be many. In conclusion. I wish to say that in asking your Lordships to read this Bill a second time I by no means wish you to in any way pledge yourselves to the machinery to be
<col>1090</col>
used to meet the end in view. As I have pointed out, throughout the whole history of this question the machinery recommended has been more or less of the same kind, but many who support the Bill are not necessarily agreed upon every detail as to the methods in which its object ought to be achieved. I hope that some agreement may be come to upon these particular points when the Bill reaches the Committee stage. All that I ask your Lordships in this instance to affirm by reading the Bill a second time is that it is desirable in some way to differentiate foreign and colonial from home-grown meat.<lb/>
Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>&#x2014;.(<i>Lord Clifford of Chudleigh.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, this Bill is more or less an extension of the principle of the Merchandise Marks Act, and a casual observer might suppose that it was not a very important extension. I have observed, in looking back at the debates on some of the Bills to which the noble Lord has alluded, that the Bill of 1893, which was introduced by the noble Earl opposite, was actually called the Merchandise Marks Act (Amendment) Bill. That Bill, as your Lordships know, was withdrawn after a speech delivered by my noble friend behind me, Lord Ribblesdale, in which he offered to refer the whole question to a Select Committee of your Lordships' House. That Committee was presided over by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, and if their Report is studied it will be found that they were much impressed with the great difficulties in the way of organising any system of meat marking. They also seem to have been very much impressed with the extremely doubtful nature of the benefits to be derived from that process. I further notice that during the succeeding years and during the time when the noble Earl himself was President of the Board of Agriculture no legislation on these lines was introduced by him. The natural inference is, I think, that he had been convinced, and that the leaders of the Party opposite had been convinced, that this was not a practical or desirable thing to do; and I hope that in opposing this Bill we may, for that reason, have the support of the Front Bench opposite.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0570"/>
<col>1091</col>
This Bill, as I have said, extends the Merchandise Marks Act, but it does so in an entirely new direction. I ask your Lordships to consider for a moment what the Merchandise Marks Act does and what it does not do. I know that there is a sort of popular supposition that under the Merchandise Marks Act all foreign-made goods imported into this country have to be marked "Made in Germany," or "Made in France," as the case may be. I need not remind the House that the Merchandise Marks Act does nothing of the kind. What that Act does is this. It lays down that where there is any writing or any mark or anything on the article which might cause a reasonable idea that it had been made in this country, that mistaken idea must be corrected. Whether there is fraud or not makes no difference, but the mistaken idea must be corrected by printing on the article the words "Made in Germany," "Made in France," or whatever the country may be.<lb/>
It may be interesting to mention the extreme length to which that Act has been held to go. There was the case of certain Christmas cards which were printed in Germany and on which the greetings or good wishes were in the English language. It was contended that that fact might arouse a reasonable supposition that the cards had been printed in this country, and therefore it was held to be necessary that they should bear the words "Printed in Germany" upon them. I mention that in order to show the extreme point to which the Merchandise Marks Act carries us, and in order that your Lordships may see how very much further the proposal of the noble Lord would go. That proposal would go to a point entirely new, and it is a proposal to which, on behalf of the Board of Trade, the Department to which is entrusted the administration of the Merchandise Marks Act, I have to say that the Government cannot assent.<lb/>
Then it may be said&#x2014;and I understand the noble Lord to make this point in his speech&#x2014;that even if the Government cannot consent to all foreign meat being marked, we might at all events consent to legislation which would make it impossible for foreign or colonial meat to be sold as British. That would be a reasonable, I think a very reasonable, request were it not for the fact that the law as it stands already deals with that point most com-
<col>1092</col>
pletely. Under various Acts of Parliament any one perpetrating a fraud of that kind would be liable to prosecution. I do not think I need remind the House of a case which occurred only the other day, and which shows how very dangerous it is to sell anything in this country under a false description. It is within the recollection of everyone that a Bond Street art dealer was recently heavily cast in damages because he had given a false description to some china ornaments; and I need not remind the House that the law which applies in the case of a Dresden china shepherdess applies equally in the case of a pound of frozen Australian mutton. We consider that from that point of view the Bill is unnecessary. Besides those general objections there are certain practical difficulties which evidently suggested themselves to the Select Committee of 1893, the Committee whose Report I have quoted; and I think those difficulties must suggest themselves to everyone who considers this matter.<lb/>
In the first place, I would mention the great difficulties of identifying. The noble Lord seemed to suggest that it would be sufficient if the carcases were marked in the country from which they came, but I do not think that would be any protection whatever to the small consumer; and if it is desired to protect the small consumer in the way the noble Lord suggests I think it is clear that, in addition to the heavy duties which would be laid on the Custom House officials, an army of trained inspectors would be necessary all over the country in order to see that every little piece of meat was marked. For I would call your Lordships' attention to Clause 5 of the Bill, which provides that&#x2014;
<quote>"Every person who either by himself or herself or by his or her agent servant or other person employed for that purpose sells or exposes for sale or who hawks or offers for sale any foreign or colonial meat which does not bear such mark shall cause to be attached to each carcase or piece of such foreign or colonial meat a label or mark containing in printed capital letters the words 'foreign' or 'colonial in such manner as to be clearly visible to the purchaser and any persons not complying with this requisition shall be guilty of an offence under this Act."</quote>
That shows that the Bill is not only intended to apply to carcases, but to the smallest possible portion of meat sold on any stall. Again, to quote from the Report of the Select Committee, I notice that it is said that in Liverpool the average
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0571"/>
<col>1093</col>
purchases at certain large shops did not exceed 2&#x00BD;d. Under this clause each of these would have to be marked.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, I think a very great expense and inconvenience and restraint would be put upon the trade of vendors of meat if they had to be licensed and had to go through the other formalities suggested in the Bill. There is one other practical difficulty which I would suggest. It is said in the Bill that all this meat must be labelled as being either Colonial or Foreign. That would entail still another difficulty, because these salesmen would not only have to differentiate between British and foreign meat, which to a skilled man might be comparatively easy, but they would also have to differentiate between Argentine meat and meat coming from any British Colony, which would be extremely difficult. My Lords, I have stated the general objections to the Bill and a few of the practical difficulties which seem to arise; and on those grounds I must ask your Lordships not to agree to the Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF ONSLOW</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the noble Lord has referred very frequently to the Report of the Committee over which I had the honour to preside many years ago, and the recollection of it makes me feel very old indeed. Although I am not aware that there have been any material changes in the meat trade since that time, I have no doubt what ever that the Report of that Committee is not up to date, and if further inquiry were held into the matter now it is possible that some of the opinions expressed in 1893, might be found capable of modification. I think every member of your Lordships' House sympathises with the object of the noble Lord who has introduced this Bill. There is an old form of advertisement which runs, "When you ask for it, see that you get it"; and that, I think, describes the object of my noble friend in introducing this Bill.<lb/>
There can be no doubt whatever, if there is a practical way of doing it, that the purchaser of what he believes to be genuine home-grown home-fed English meat ought to be assured that he gets it. Your Lordships are well aware that the price of English meat is, always has been, and, I hope, always will remain, materially higher than the price of meat of a similar kind which has been imported from abroad;
<col>1094</col>
and it certainly is a great hardship if, as I believe to be the case, a great many people who purchase meat believing they are buying best English are palmed off with beef which has been sent over the Atlantic in refrigerators and is nearly indistinguishable, except by experts, from meat raised and killed in this country. The noble Lord opposite pointed out a great many difficulties which he said would arise in the administration of the Bill if it became an Act, difficulties regarding the manner in which the marking could be done and the provision of the army of inspectors which would be necessary. But he did not touch at all on what, to my mind, is one of the most important clauses of the Bill, the clause which embodies one of the recommendations made by the Committee of 1893&#x2014;that is, that if a man chooses to sell foreign meat he should at least put up over his shop window an announcement that he is, in fact, a vendor of foreign or colonial meat. That would not require an army of inspectors or any great interference of Government officials, and it would not be a very difficult matter to accomplish.<lb/>
That part of the Bill of my noble friend I heartily welcome. I believe it would be practicable and have a large measure of efficiency. I have been told that the effect of it might be that every dealer in meat&#x2014;that is to say, every butcher in the country&#x2014;would put up such a notice in order to save trouble. I venture to think, however, that such is the prejudice of the consumer of English meat in this country that a great many people in towns where they have an opportunity of choosing between one butcher and another would certainly elect to deal with a man who had no such notice over his door rather than with a man who had. The noble Lord referred at considerable length to the Merchandise Marks Act, and pointed out that the Bill of my noble friend was more or less an extension of that principle. I am bound to say that I do not think the Merchandise Marks Act has obtained the measure of success which its framers intended; it certainly has not prevented the consumption of a great many things which are made abroad&#x2014;although those things are marked with a notice patent to all the world that they are made in foreign countries. On the contrary, I believe the fact that an article made in Germany is known to be cheap has very often created a demand
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0572"/>
<col>1095</col>
for that particular article, because people say that if it is made in Germany it will be cheap and if it is made in England it will be dearer. That is one of the respects in which the Merchandise Marks Act has not fulfilled the expectations of those who framed it.<lb/>
I do not propose to touch upon that part of the Bill by which my noble friend seeks to prevent fraud. The noble Lord opposite says that all that is already provided for. He says that if you sell as Dresden china something which is not Dresden, if you sell modern china as very ancient china you are liable to prosecution, and he called attention to a recent case with which your Lordships are familiar. What I would point out is this. You can find out the fraud in the case of spurious china, but how are you to find it out in the case of meat unless there is some means of identifying the place from which the meat originally came? After hearing the evidence of the witnesses we examined before the Committee I venture to say, without fear of contradiction, that a very large quantity of meat is sold in this country as English which comes into the country from abroad. I do not think anybody will challenge that statement. I am not going to say whether I think the effect of my noble friend's Bill would be entirely to prevent that. All I say, is, if that is his object, and if that object can be obtained by his Bill, I for one will certainly agree with a measure of that kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CHICHESTER</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have never ventured to address your Lordships before, and it is only because of my connection with the Central Chamber of Agriculture that I ask your indulgence to-night. You will hardly be surprised to hear that the members of the Central Chamber and the affiliated societies look with favour on the marking of foreign meat and also regard with approval this Bill. But, my Lords, great as the advantage may be to British agriculture, I think the advantage of a Bill of this kind would be far greater to the consumer, because, as has already been stated, there is very little doubt that a great deal of foreign meat is now sold to the consumer as British meat, and at British prices. I do not think any one could be so foolish as to wish that foreign meat should be prohibited or in any way stopped from coming into this country, because if it were there would
<col>1096</col>
be, in the first place, a shortage of meat, and, in the second place, the poor would in a great measure be prevented from eating meat at all. There is no question about that.<lb/>
There is no question either that people who buy meat are deceived. I do not say that this is done by absolutely fraudulent misrepresentation, but inferior foreign meat is constantly bought at a high price. With your Lordships' permission I will give an illustration of that. At a certain West End institution some weeks ago&#x2014;an institution to which many members of your Lordships' House belong&#x2014;a butcher was found fault with for providing inferior beef. It was suspected that the meat he was supplying was foreign, so the butcher's man was accosted one day by an official of that institution and was challenged as to a certain joint. Being asked if it was foreign, he replied, most indignantly, "That joint of beef foreign? Why, it is the best Danish."Of course, this was in no way an attempt at fraud; it was clearly a geographical inexactitude. But the profits of that inexactitude go into the butcher's pocket and the loss is to the consumer. There are other vague terms in the trade which we know lead to fraud, or rather to deception. Take, for instance, one notice frequently seen over shops&#x2014;that of "home-killed meat." That is perfectly legal, but what does it mean? Merely that meat is imported on the hoof&#x2014;that is to say, it is taken to Deptford, or some other port of entry, and, after ten days, is killed and sold anywhere in England as home-killed meat. You must, I venture to say, have some technical knowledge to know what home-killed meat really is. Then there is our old friend, "Canterbury Lamb." Many people think the lamb is brought up on Romney Marsh or some other pasture in Kent, but, as a matter of fact, it has never seen any country but New Zealand.<lb/>
There is one other point which is very important to the consumer, and that is the case of tuberculous meat. In this country if a carcase is proved to have any particle of tubercular disease, practically the whole of it is destroyed. But there is no guarantee that this happens in the case of foreign meat imported into this country. I believe the custom in the case of foreign meat is merely just to cut away the affected parts and send the rest of the carcase
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0573"/>
<col>1097</col>
forward. I do not know whether it is in the least true that this is likely to do any harm. Scientific opinions seem to differ very much as to whether tuberculous meat when cooked is or is not fit for food. But very many people in the country believe it is injurious, and if it is not marked they cannot be certain that they are not buying foreign meat which is tainted with this disease. There is one other person to whom this Bill would bring great relief. His case is a very cruel one. It is the case of the honest retailer. He has to meet the most cruel competition, and I cannot imagine a man in a more difficult position than the retailer of meat who means to keep honest, for he has to see his acquaintances on each side of the street making profits which he denies to himself.<lb/>
There are two objections urged against this Bill. It is said that you can bring in a Bill but you cannot mark the meat, I do not believe that a practical objection at all. I believe that after Lord Onslow's Committee reported a gentleman who lived in Leicester brought out, a patent electrical machine which he said would mark meat satisfactorily. An experiment was tried. Two carcases of mutton were marked, were put into the frozen chamber&#x2014;if that is the right phrase&#x2014;in the Central Market, and were left there for six weeks. At the end of that time they were thawed to see whether the mark had run. Not only was the mark found to be perfectly satisfactory, but it had been put on in such a way that each joint was marked. On that occasion there was an episode at the Central Market which has such a bearing on the Bill that I should like to relate it your Lordships. A representative of one of the largest export dealers in Argentine meat was greatly interested in the experiment, and he said&#x2014;
<quote>"I have been looking at that," pointing to the carcases. "What do you think you are going to do with that? If you get that taken up it will be a bad day's work for us. You ought to make it easier, not more difficult, for us to sell our meat as English. We depend upon that for our trade."</quote>
This was an unsolicited testimony that even the sanguine inventor had never expected. Another objection which has been urged more than once this evening has to do with the case of the Merchandise Marks Act. I do not believe the British farmer is afraid that because you mark foreign meat he will have to go out of busi-
<col>1098</col>
ness. If he loses his trade because foreign meat is advertised by marking it, I think he ought to go out of business. I believe you will find his view is this, that if retailers are willing to sell foreign and colonial meat on its merits and use the right description it will have no terrors for the farmer, because the superior freshness and quality of the meat which English farmers produce will always secure for it a market. It is for these reasons that I should very much like to see the Bill read a second time.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, as I do not happen to belong to the Central Chamber of Agriculture or any of the affiliated societies which the noble Earl on this side of the House has represented so ably to-night, I should like to say a word on this subject from the personal point of view. The noble Earl opposite, Lord Onslow, will remember that at the time he brought in his Bill I had something to do with it, and I sat on the Committee which has been alluded to. Of course, noble Lords opposite disavow any Protectionist flavour about the proposal, and as I am a quite unrepentant Free Trader I find myself in rather a difficult position, because I oppose the Bill on what may be called a Protectionist ground.<lb/>
I quite agree with all that the noble Earl on this side of the House said just now as to the possible advantage which a Bill of this sort, assuming it were carried out, might have for the consumer, but when he tells me that the ordinary English grazier who raises cattle to sell to meat salesmen need not be afraid of it I cannot agree with him. I am much afraid of it on that very ground. I believe it is possible, if you get foreign meat really properly marked in the way proposed, that the English producers, not of the best meat, but of the second quality meat, which is the sort of meat from various circumstances of my own land I am obliged to produce myself, would be placed at a distinct disadvantage, and the advertisement of the very close race which the best class foreign meat runs with the second class English meat would be fatal to an enormous number of English producers in the North who do not raise the very best quality of home-grown meat. I certainly, under those circumstances, should not go out of business and I farm 600 or 700 acres myself all under grass, but I should suffer very much from it.
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0574"/>
<col>1099</col>
The noble Lord who brought in the Bill skated very lightly over the Report of the 1893 Committee, but he said there was some doubt in the mind of the Committee as to the possible effect on prices of this meat marking. Let me tell your Lordships exactly what the Committee found. The noble Lord did allude to it, but not in the way I want the House to hear. The Committee found that the ultimate result of meat marking would be that meat would come to be divided into four general classes, with considerable variation of price: first, best home-grown meat; secondly, best imported meat; thirdly, second-class home-grown meat; and, lastly, inferior meat. Whereas the third class (the second-class home-grown meat) now stands not subordinate in price to the second-class (the best imported meat) the indication of the country of origin might transpose their values in the market. Therefore as regards the second class English, which is at present in the second position and can get a good market, to mark the best foreign meat and give it that advertisement which perhaps it would deserve would mean to put our own home grown stuff behind it. That, I think, would be distinctly unfortunate, though I admit it was very generally asserted before the Committee that the average excellence of imported meat was higher than of home-grown meat. There are one or two other points on which I should have liked to have said a word, but I will not do so at this late hour. As a grazier and meat salesman, however, I enter the strongest possible protest against the Bill. I believe if people who follow the industry think they are going to gain by these proposals they are mistaken, and that they will in the long run prove to be very considerable losers.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have listened with very great care to the speeches delivered on both sides of the House on the proposals of my noble friend. I confess, it has been brought home to me that, speaking quite roughly, the contention of the noble Lord who has just sat down is probably founded in fact; that is to say, if we meddle too much in a matter of this kind instead of conferring any advantage on the British farmer we may do him an injury. I found that opinion partly, of course, on the authority of my noble friend opposite, but also upon the Report of the Committee
<col>1100</col>
to which he referred, and to which my attention has been called. I do not think we can ignore the Report of a Committee of your Lordships' House. It was a Committee manned by Peers of great influence, and as far as I know there was no division of opinion upon that particular issue. That does not conclude the matter, because my noble friend, Lord Clifford, has brought forward this Bill in the interests of the consumer. Surely it is wrong, he said, that a man who buys what he believes to be English meat, and pays the price of English meat, should be palmed off with foreign or colonial meat, which if not inferior in quality ought certainly to be lower in price. I do not suppose there is any member of your Lordships' House who would not agree with him that it is objectionable and wrong that a man who asks for one thing should get another, and should pay the actual price for the article he receives which he would do for the one he expected to get. It amounts, of course, to a species of fraud.<lb/>
But, my Lords, if these two conclusions to which I have come are both true I am placed in a difficult position, because there are the interests of the British farmer against the Bill and the claims of honesty in favour of it. As a conscientious man I suppose I ought to resolve the doubt in favour of the claims of honesty. Luckily, however, it appears that the difficulties of the machinery are so great that the Bill is unworkable. Cannot we take refuge from the exigencies of our conscience in that consideration? Although we are in favour of resisting to the best of our ability fraudulent practices, yet Finding that the proposal for achieving that end is not workable, may we not adopt that as a plea for not proceeding with the matter in this form and so avoid inflicting an injury on the British farmer? In those circumstances I hope my noble friend will take account of the implied views of the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, who understands the subject far better than I do and was a member of the Select Committee. The noble Earl practically told my noble friend that he did not think the Bill workable as regards a large part of its provisions, but there was one particular provision of which he approved. Might I therefore suggest to my noble friend that he should not press the Bill, but should reconsider the subject and bring up a much shorter Bill dealing with the point my noble friend
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0575"/>
<col>1101</col>
the Lord Chairman has indicated. Then your Lordships might, perhaps, be willing favourably to consider it. I do not know if my noble friend will take this course, but in the difficulties in which we find ourselves as between the interests of the British farmer and the dictates of our consciences I almost hope he will.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I should like to add just one word in support of the plea of the noble Marquess opposite. The noble Marquess suggested that a short Bill should be brought in embodying that portion of the present Bill of which the noble Earl opposite, Lord Onslow, approves. Is it necessary? Clause 6 says that every person dealing in, selling, offering, or exposing or keeping for sale, or having in his possession for the purpose of sale, foreign or colonial meat, shall always exhibit in a prominent place in his establishment a placard bearing in large letters the words, "Dealer in foreign and colonial meat." The reason it is said that ought to be done is that everybody anxious to have home-grown meat would immediately go to a shop where this placard was not exhibited. What I should like to ask is, cannot that be done now? If people are so anxious to buy English meat why should not butchers who deal in such meat alone put up placards saying, "Nothing but English meat sold in this establishment," or something to the same effect ? I believe if t hat were done everybody would flock to these particular shops, and the result the noble Lord aims at would be achieved. I was glad to hear the noble Marquess opposite say something about the difficulty of the machinery of the Bill. If your Lordships read Clause 7 you will see that it is curiously worded. It says&#x2014;
<quote>"Every person who shall deal in sell offer expose or keep for sale or have in his possession for the purpose of sale any foreign or colonial meat as or for British or Irish meat shall be guilty of an offence under this Act."</quote>
What is the punishment for the offence? If your Lordships look at Clause 15 you will see that for the first offence it is a fine not exceeding &#x00A3;10, and for the second a fine not exceeding &#x00A3;25, or&#x2014;
<quote>"if the offence in the opinion of the Court was committed by the personal act default or culpable negligence of the person accused that person shall
<col>1102</col>
be liable (at the option of the court) to imprisonment with or without hard labour for a period not exceeding six months."</quote>
I really think to say a man should get six months imprisonment with hard labour for selling under these conditions colonial meat is a very curious proposal to come from those who are very anxious to bind the Colonies to the mother country.<lb/>
I really think that the law as it stands now is sufficient for the purpose, because we know that if it can possibly be proved that a butcher knowingly palms off colonial or foreign meat as home-grown, we can get at him under the present law, and I should not hesitate for one moment to apply the law under those circumstances. But I must say, in fairness, that these cases, although we are told they occur so extremely often, are very rarely proved up to the hilt. In these circumstances I do join in the request of noble Lords opposite, and I hope the noble Lord will not press the Bill, but will be satisfied with having brought the matter to the notice of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member>: <membercontribution>Before answering the request of the noble Lord, there are one or two points to which I wish to allude. One is the question of fraud and misrepresentation being able to be dealt with under the existing law, which matter, I think, has been hardly fairly represented. The kind of thing that happens, and happens with great frequency, is this: a retailer who deals, I will say, habitually in home-grown meat is from time to time short of a supply, and he fills the vacancy in his shop with foreign or colonial meat. He makes no representation direct to the customer, who has for the last week, fortnight, or for a longer period, been buying English meat, but he suddenly substitutes an entirely different article and leaves the customer under the impression that he is still getting the same. Although that is not a fraud which you can bring the existing law to bear upon, it is in itself a misrepresentation. It is <i>suppressio veri</i>, which certainly defrauds the customer. Those who speak in the interest of the producers have over and over again&#x2014;though not, perhaps, so much in the Report of 1903&#x2014;borne testimony to the fact that it is their own fault if the meat they grow is not superior to the meat imported. They do appeal&#x2014;and it appears to be common justice&#x2014;that they should
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0576"/>
<col>1103</col>
stand on their own footing. This view is equally shared in other parts of the Empire. Consumers also wish that English meat should not be sold as colonial meat, and that appears to me to be an appeal based on simple justice. It is admitted&#x2014;at least, nobody undertakes to deny it&#x2014;that possibly the effect of this may be to alter the classification of meat; but in that case we say the classification should be fairly stated. It is within the knowledge of all importers of meat that whereas the importations of Argentine meat were in the early stages extremely inferior they are rapidly improving, and the result may be that what is called second-class English meat may material improve under the stimulus of having a fair field and no favour. With regard to the Bill, I will take the encouragement that the noble Marquess has given me, and I hope if ever I bring in the Bill again in an amended form I shall have more cordial support from him than I have had to-night. In the circumstances, considering the smallness of the House, I will not trouble your Lordships by pressing the Bill to a division.<lb/>

<title>"MISSING" SAILING SHIPS.</title>
<p><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member> <membercontribution>rose to move for a Return "showing how many British foreign-going sailing ships are recorded as 'missing' during each of the past five years; the tonnage of those vessels; what number of certificated officers they were carrying on leaving port, and the number of men composing their crews, with their respective ratings and nationality in each case."</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Lord said </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, to refer briefly to the subject of this Motion, I may say that of late there seems to have been an alarming frequency of cases where British foreign-going sailing ships have been posted at Lloyd's as missing. Only this year there was one missing in February, one in March, and one last month. It is well known the sorry way in which most sailing ships are manned. Quite usually fifty per cent. or more of their crews are men of any nationality but our own. But, putting nationality apart, I am firmly convinced that the actual numerical strength of the crews of our sailing ships is one which demands searching investigation. I under-
<col>1104</col>
stand that this question of manning has lately been before the Advisory Committee of the Board of Trade, and that as a result of this the Board have now issued instructions to their principal officers, superintendents, and surveyors, providing that steamers of certain sizes and lengths should carry a stipulated number of efficient deck hands.<lb/>
But I notice that foreign-going sailing ships appear not to have been considered in connection with manning, and there is no real standard to which they must conform if only as a minimum. Therefore, I seek information so that we may see exactly how British sailing ships are manned&#x2014;at least, in the case of those vessels which, within the last five years, have been posted as missing. There is, of course, the deeper loading of British ships which is now permissible, which possibly may account for some of these disasters. But I have made no mention of this in my Question, simply because the new regulations only came into vogue comparatively recently, whereas the subject of my Motion spreads over the last five years.<lb/>
Then, again, there arises the important factor as to the number of certificated officers carried on board these ships. I am told, for instance, that the sailing ship "Toxteth," a large vessel of 2,585 tons which was posted as "missing" not long ago, carried one certificated officer only besides the captain. I do not hesitate to say that in this respect the ship was gravely undermanned. Her crew, inclusive of the steward and cook, appear to have numbered twenty-four only, four of whom were ordinary seamen, and one a deck boy, and ten of whom, from their names, would appear to have been aliens, though there may have been more, as aliens often ship under English names I have no hesitation in saying that no ships of the size of the "Toxteth" could possibly be efficiently or sufficiently manned with such a niggardly crew, and if this mode of manning is a sample of the manning Of other foreign-going sailing vessels, as I believe it is, then the sooner a very radical change is made the better, particularly so in protection of the lives of the unfortunate men who are the helpless victims of a system which not only admits of sweating but of peril to their lives also. I learn from my noble friend that he is going to give us as full information as possible, and then we may be better
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0577"/>
<col>1105</col>
able to judge what the real position is, and whether, for the safety of our merchant seafarers, it is necessary to deal with it further.<lb/>
Before concluding I wish to thank my noble friend opposite for the kindness and courtesy he has always shown when I have brought matters of this kind before your Lordships. I fully appreciate the unpleasant position in which he finds himself, when I bring forward a measure with which personally he is in sympathy though a sense of stern duty to the Department he so ably represents compels him to oppose, and, to use his own words, appear as the advocate of all that is base and uncharitable; but I am sure he acquits me of any desire to make him appear in such a <i>role</i>. It is the fault of the Department he represents and when that Department, as I hope it will, reforms and realises its duty better towards the service on which England depends so much, then, to quote him again, the official mouthpiece will find his task much more pleasant and congenial.<lb/>
Moved, "That there be laid before the House a Return showing how many British foreign-going sailing ships are recorded as 'missing' during each of the past five years; the tonnage of those vessels, what number of certificated officers they were carrying on leaving port, and the number of men composing their crews, with their respective ratings and nationality in each case."&#x2014;(<i>Lord Muskerry.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I think it would add greatly to the value of this Return if the amounts for which the lost ships were insured were added, and I hope the Government will be able to give the Return with this addition. I am sorry I have to leave the House as I should have been very glad to remain to listen to the noble Lord's answer to my noble friend Lord Musherry.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member>: <membercontribution>The noble Lord need not wait very long to hear my answer, because I think I can give it in a very few words. With regard to his request that the amount for which the ships were insured should be given in the Return, I may say that it is not included in the Return I have here, but I will make inquiries to see if it is possible to add the information. The Return for which Lord Muskerry has asked has been prepared as
<col>1106</col>
fully as possible, and if it were not for the question just asked I should be prepared to lay it on the Table at this moment. I will wait a few days.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE COLOURS FOR TERRITORIAL REGIMENTS.</title>
<p><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF RUTLAND</member> <membercontribution>rose to ask the Under-Secretary of State for War whether the travelling and other expenses of the officers and men composing the detachments of the Territorial Regiments, which are to be presented with Colours by His Majesty on June 19, are to be defrayed by the War Office if not whether the Territorial Associations are to be allowed to pay those expenses out of their funds, or whether such expenses are to be met by voluntary contributions; also, what will be done in the case of regiments which have not been able to procure Colours owing to the shortness of the notice given them by the War Office, and the consequent pressure on the firms authorised to supply such Colours; and if the Under-Secretary of State can inform the House as to the hour when the ceremony of the presentation will take place.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>The noble Duke said</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I shall not trouble the noble Lord who is going to answer this Question in the place of the Under-Secretary for War with any superfluous remarks at this time of the evening, but I would merely emphasise what I venture briefly to hint at in my Question. Although it has been answered to a large extent in another place, still I do hope that we may be given assurances on the part of His Majesty's Government that the Territorial Detachments which will be under orders to go to Windsor on June 19 for the purpose of receiving Colours from His Majesty will be given a full and ample amount of pay for their expenses. It appears to me there is a great danger that if something of that sort is not done in a fairly generous spirit a feeling of
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0578"/>
<col>1107</col>
dissatisfaction will grow up amongst the Territorial Forces that they are being treated somewhat differently from the Line battalions of the county regiments, because in the present case the Colours have not been issued free to these Territorial battalions. I make no complaint of that, for it was an understood thing in the Circular of last September that that should be the case. At the same time, if any further call is made upon the private finances of the county with which these regiments are connected I think an unpleasant feeling will exist that there is too much difference made between the first and second battalions and the third fourth and other battalions which compose the Territorial battalions of any regiment. I am sure in the present case the noble Lord who is going to answer for the Under-Secretary of State for War will agree with me that the Territorial Force requires every possible encouragement and help to keep in as sound a position as it has reached, and that anything which discourages or appears to make a differentiation between the Line and the Territorial battalions will go far to remove that energy and sympathy which might otherwise exist in the Territorial battalions. I am not going to press any further remarks upon the noble Lord now because time will not permit; but I hope we may be assured that adequate payment for the detachments of the Territorial Regiments who are going to Windsor on June 19 will be given by the War Office. With regard to the second portion of my Question, I fancy that need hardly be asked now, as I understand arrangements have been made by which the difficulties that certainly existed when I put the Notice on the Paper have been very largely removed. The last part of the Question has, I think, been already answered, but I should like an assurance on that point.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD HENEAGE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I hope I may be allowed to put at the same time the Question standing in my name on the Paper&#x2014;namely, to ask what arrangements have been made as to the place and time when His Majesty will present the Colours to the Territorial Forces; and what provision the War Office propose to make for the travelling expenses, subsistence, and lodging of the escort parties; and what is to be the number of officers and rank and file of each escort party. I hope the Secretary of State for War will take as
<col>1108</col>
carefully into his consideration as he can what time this review is to be held. The 19th of June is a Saturday, and it will very seriously affect the regiments from the Northern and Midland counties if they cannot get home on that night.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD DENMAN</member>: <membercontribution>The Under-Secretary of State for War is absent owing to indisposition, and has asked me to answer these Questions for him. I learn that it has been decided that the travelling and other expenses of the officers and men attending this function shall be paid from public funds on the following basis:&#x2014;For the Colour Party of two subalterns and three sergeants (one subaltern and three sergeants in the case of mounted units), and for a detachment of ten non-commissioned officers and men, there shall be paid&#x2014;(a) railway fares at Territorial Force rates; (b) travelling allowances according to the time occupied on the journey, at the following rates:&#x2014;Officers, daily rate 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. or 6<i>s</i>. or nightly rate of 15<i>s</i>.; non-commissioned officers and men, daily rate 1<i>s</i>. or 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. or nightly rate of 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. As regards the inability of certain regiments to have the Colours quite ready by the date specified, His Majesty will not require them to be complete in all respects, and a circular letter is being sent out by the War Office giving detailed instructions on this point. I understand that the hour fixed is three p.m. on June 19. With regard to what the noble Duke has said, I would remind him that it is an entirely voluntary proceeding as to whether the units choose to send representatives to this function or purchase colours at all for their battalions. I quite agree with the noble Duke that it would be a very great pity if friction of any kind should ensue on such a unique occasion, and I hope the provision made by the Secretary of State will be regarded as adequate.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MOVABLE DWELLINGS BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<section>
<title>[SECOND READING.]</title>
<p>Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, last year I introduced a similar Bill with which I did not proceed because a very large portion of it was in process of being dealt with in a Government measure, which, I think, has met with almost universal acceptance in the country&#x2014;I refer to the Children Act. That Act dealt with the question of the education of
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0580"/>
<col>1111</col>
children who live in movable dwellings, and dealt with it in a much more thorough way than I or the County Councils Association could have ventured to propose. What is contained in the Bill now before your Lordships is the remainder of that Bill after deleting the part that related to education.<lb/>
I am quite aware that on this question there is a good deal of sentiment, and I am very far from decrying that sentiment. I am, perhaps, one of the last persons who ought to decry it, for in common with a noble Lord who is not here, Lord Poltimore, I happen to have had a first cousin some five or six generations ago who was elected king of the gipsies. Therefore, I have some sympathy with a gipsy's life. There is a great deal to be said for a free life in the open air, sleeping beneath the starry canopy of heaven, free from the interference of a socialistic world and with all the pleasures of constant change of scene; and there are times, I confess, particularly in the month of August, when we are discussing very doubtful legislation in the somewhat vitiated atmosphere of this House, when I sigh for such a life. There is also the old historic sentiment. The nomad tribes of Europe, driven by a relentless civilisation to wander into every country, invading every country and conquering none, afford a melancholy instance of the proverb that no nation that did not build ever became great.<lb/>
But we must not be carried away too much by sentiment in these days. There are many of your Lordships who are descended from those who came over to England with the Norman Conqueror, but I venture to think that if any of your Lordships were to endeavour to live in a Norman castle, with the hygienic conditions which were common in those days, you would rapidly fall into difficulties with the local authority, and that is a position the hardihood of which is so great that I do not think in these days any one would attempt it, except, perhaps, members of the Judicial bench. We are all bound by sanitary and hygienic rules, and it is impossible to contend that it is justifiable that any body of the community should be entirely free from them in these days.<lb/>
It has been argued, however, and perhaps some of your Lordships have received a memorial from the Showmen's Society to this effect, that these people are already 
<col>1112</col>
under the Public Health Act of 1875, which gives special powers to sanitary authorities to make rules and regulations and pass by-laws, subject to the consent of the Local Government Board, to deal with dwellers in vans and tents. It has been pointed out to me, and I daresay will be argued by the noble Lord who represents the Local Government Board, that these rules and regulations are quite sufficient to meet the case. But the fact is that, although the powers possessed by the sanitary authorities differ very little from those which by this Bill your Lordships are asked to approve, there is this difference. In the first place, we maintain that a wandering community like those who live in movable dwellings should not, as at present, be subject to ever-varying and ever-changing by-laws, but should be subject to one set of by-laws, and that wherever they go they should carry these regulations with them. The other point is this. Granted that the powers of sanitary authorities are sufficient there still lies this great difficulty, that they take no account whatever of the mobility of the van dwellers, and that is at the bottom of the whole trouble.<lb/>
The van dweller settles in a sanitary district. He breaks every law and regulation, it may be, of the sanitary district, but the moment that the sanitary authority begin to move to keep him in order he puts in his horse and leaves for another sanitary district, and the sanitary authority, like Dog-berry, allow him to go and thank the Lord they are rid of him. The sanitary authority have no machinery whereby they can pursue him when he is out of their district, and he proceeds to follow the same course within the new sanitary district. This Bill proposes that these wandering dwellers shall be given some kind of local habitation. They are, in the first place, to be registered, and, secondly, the power of controlling them is placed in the larger bodies of the community&#x2014;namely, the county councils and the borough authorities.<lb/>
I will touch very briefly on the various points raised in the Bill. Every temporary erection which is not intended to be moved and is not naturally moved is left where it is under the regulations, which almost invariably deal with temporary structures, of the local sanitary authority. There is no possible reason why such an erection, however temporary, however in-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0581"/>
<col>1113</col>
sufficient in its kind it may be, should not be left under the existing sanitary authority. The difficulties I have pointed out only commence when the temporary dwelling partakes of a movable nature. It has been urged that a movable dwelling should not include tents and light structures of that kind; but after very careful consideration, after trying many alterations and finding all of them more or less unworkable, I am afraid they must be included.<lb/>
If the Bill were limited to vans and only to tents and temporary structures so far as might be necessary to bring the accommodation up to the hygienic requirements for the number of people occupying them, you might have the Act entirely evaded by persons living exclusively in tents which they could convey in a vehicle which in no way was used for the purpose of residence. It was for this reason that in drafting the Bill I felt bound to include tents as well as vans; and I am sorry to have to do so, because it renders it necessary to deal with several classes of tents which one would gladly leave out. To make the Bill symmetrical it is absolutely necessary that every dwelling which is designed to be and is liable to be constantly moved should have some place to which you may refer to find out its antecedents and the persons who are responsible for it. Your Lordships will notice that Clause 10 provides that nothing in the Bill shall apply to any movable dwelling used by any portion of His Majesty's naval or military forces or to any encampment which may be certified as under proper supervision by the Territorial Force Association of a county. You will also note that not only canal boats but house boats of all descriptions are expressly excluded from the action of the Bill.<lb/>
Clause 1 merely provides for the registration of movable dwellings. Then by Clause 2 the Local Government Board are empowered to make regulations with regard to the registration. It is to be a condition precedent to registration that the registering authority should be satisfied that on sanitary and hygienic grounds these places are fit places for persons to live in, taking into consideration the number of people who will live in them, the question whether they are children or adults, and the question of the sexes. This is a regulation which is common to both urban and rural authorities, and I can see nothing whatever to 
<col>1114</col>
complain of in it. This kind of regulation is made every day with regard to houses. The regulations as a whole, with this exception, go very little beyond the model by-laws of the Local Government Board. The matters dealt with in Clauses 4 and 5&#x2014;certificate of registry and power to prohibit encampment&#x2014;are exactly the class of things provided for in the model by-laws, with the exception, perhaps, of the prevention of fire. Anyone who has any knowledge of these wandering residences knows what a very great danger they are in the matter of fires. Half the fires which devastate moors and woods are due to people living this kind of life, and the necessity for some regulation is very great. In towns the regulation with regard to the sweeping of chimneys to prevent fire is a very analogous kind of regulation. Clause 3 provides that for the purpose of the registration of movable dwellings the registration authorities shall be the county and county borough councils.<lb/>
Clause 5 is, perhaps, the one which introduces the most debatable matter into the Bill. That clause provides that&#x2014; 
<quote>Where it appears to any registration authority that the presence of movable dwellings on any specified place or places within their area would be dangerous to the public health or constitute a nuisance to the neighbourhood the registration authority may by by-law prohibit such movable dwellings being on such specified place or places and any person acting in contravention of any by-law made under this section shall be guilty of an offence under this Act.</quote>
That is, I admit, a very large power, but it is a power much sought by county councils. None of the smaller authorities are willing to take the trouble or go to the expense of dealing with these persons, and the county councils think that they should be under their control. They consider that the county council would be the better authority to deal with them because, being the larger authority, they would be less likely to be swayed by any local or personal feeling, and would be better able to deal with the question as to whether a certain place was or was not suitable for the resort of movable dwellings. Although the camping of one movable dwelling on a certain spot for a short time may create no very great nuisance, yet the constant succession of such movable dwellings may very well constitute a considerable nuisance. The county and county borough councils
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0582"/>
<col>1115</col>
are given power to deal with the encampment of movable dwellings even on land which is not waste and common land but the property of private individuals.<lb/>
Clause 6 provides that it shall be the duty of the sanitary authority having jurisdiction in the place where a movable dwelling is for the time being situate to assist any registration authority concerned in carrying out the objects of the Bill by giving information and otherwise. It has been found by experiment that sanitary authorities are in most cases unwilling to act in matters of this kind on account of the difficulty of following movable dwellings and the expense that would be incurred; but if the work could be done by some other authority the local authority would be only too glad, in many instances, to assist. The proposal in the Bill, therefore, is that the authorities to control movable dwellings shall be the larger authorities, and that the smaller sanitary authorities should assist in the regulation of these dwellings. It is not by any means desired to take away from local sanitary authorities the power they exercise at present, but the fact is they exercise this power so very rarely that it is taking away from them nothing which they ever use. Clauses 7, 8 and 9 merely provide the machinery for carrying out the Bill.<lb/>
I sincerely hope your Lordships will give a Second Reading to this Bill. I am not prepared to argue that the details contained in it are incapable of amendment, and I am not going to say that they do not, perhaps, suggest the desirability of considerable investigation as to the necessity there is for them and the effect they would have if put into force. But I do say it is very strongly felt by county councils that this is a matter which decidedly needs regulation of some kind, and I think it will be to the advantage of everybody that this question should be ventilated and the matter carefully gone into. I hope, therefore, that whatever happens to the Bill in the future it may at least be allowed to pass this stage.<lb/>
As I said at the commencement of my remarks, a portion of my original Bill has been rendered unnecessary by the legislation promoted by the Government. I have hopes that in this case, too, some future Government measure may work a cure. The Local Government Board have at this 
<col>1116</col>
moment a Bill before Parliament for town planning, and here we have a class of individuals who are daily, almost hourly, planning towns and buildings of their own, varying from day to day and hour to hour, and they do it without any regulation whatever. I do not know whether it will be possible to bring this question within the four corners of such a Bill as that, but I do ask your Lordships to agree that this is a matter which needs consideration, and that it is only equitable and just that people who wander about and live in movable buildings of a very doubtful kind which could not possibly comply with the regulations appertaining to buildings inhabited by any other class of the community should be under some kind of regulations. That they should be entirely free from the regulations necessary both for health and sanitation is a matter which, I think, needs consideration, and which I recommend to the consideration of your Lordships.<lb/>

<p><member>LORD ZOUCHE OF HARYNGWORTH</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I should like to say two or three words on this Bill. It seems to me that the principal point in the Bill is that for securing the registration of the occupiers of these movable dwellings, and I have no doubt that is a sensible and good provision; but there seems to me no reason why, when an occupier of a movable dwelling obtains registration, he should not be required to obtain at the same time a licence and pay a certain sum for it. I see no machinery in the Bill for his being obliged to take out a licence and to pay a fee for it. It must be remembered that these people have a considerable advantage over other members of the community, for they roam about where they please and pay no rates and taxes. So long as they are favoured with pretty good weather they have a distinct advantage over other people, and it does seem fair that if they are to be dealt with in the manner suggested by the Bill they should be called upon to pay a reasonable sum for a licence to occupy these buildings. The money arising from these licences should be handed over to the councils who have jurisdiction in this matter. I have risen merely to throw out that suggestion. I do not wish to criticise anything in the Bill, and I venture to hope it may receive a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

It was then my duty to reply on behalf of His Majesty's Government and to point out some of the difficulties in the provisions as they presented themselves to the Local Government Board, the Department that would be principally concerned in administering the Bill should it become law. I was then told by some noble Lords that I had displayed lukewarmness in support of the Bill. If I showed a certain amount of caution, it was not, nor will anything I may say to-day be, from any feeling on my part, or on that of the Local Government Board, that the question with which the Bill proposes to deal is not deserving of the attention of Parliament. But whilst fully realising that persons who live the existence which has been described ought not to be a nuisance to other people and a source of risk to themselves, it is found somewhat difficult to frame regulations for their control and to understand how the provisions in the Bill would quite have the effect that is desired by the noble Lord.<lb/>
The general object of the Bill, as Lord Clifford has explained, is to provide for the registration and regulation of movable dwellings. These dwellings, I need hardly point out, are already subject to specific legislation under Section 9 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1885, and the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act of 1889. The two main features of the Bill are, first, the registration and control of movable dwellings by general regulations; and, secondly, the proposal to give power to local authorities prohibiting encampments in specified places in their districts. The existing law enables local authorities to make by-laws on some of the subjects dealt with in Cause 2, and many local authorities have already availed themselves of this power. The Bill proposes that there should be some general regulations instead of local regulations, and that their scope should be considerably extended. As I had occasion to point out last year, the Bill in this respect seems to go rather fluffier than is reasonably practicable or desirable, and the Department that I represent are of opinion that the scope of such general regulations will require very careful consideration. I gathered last year that amongst those of your Lordships who supported the Bill there was a general feeling that the people affected 
<col>1118</col>
should be registered rather than that their existence should be destroyed, and I am afraid that some of the provisions of the Bill, if passed in their present form, would have the effect of altogether exterminating gipsies and others who would come within the scope of the Bill. Therefore I think the Bill will require a good deal of modification in that respect.<lb/>
The noble Lord has, I am pleased to say, indicated that he would be prepared to move that the Bill should be referred to a Select Committee, to which motion I hope your Lordships would agree; and if that course is to be adopted it will certainly save me a good deal of trouble in pointing out difficulties in the Bill at this stage. The intention of the noble Lord apparently is that the Local Government Board shall make regulations with respect to movable dwellings which shall prescribe some sort of standard of fitness, and that the local authorities who register shall have the right to refuse registration to dwellings that they consider insufficient or unsuitable. As I have said, I rather think the result of that would be that those gipsies who do not move about in a van but with a small equipment, perhaps in a small cart with rough material for putting up tents at night, would probably altogether disappear.<lb/>
Then I should like to say a word on Clause 5, which, as Lord Clifford said, seems to contain the most debatable provision in the Bill. I question whether it is desirable to give local authorities a free hand in such a matter as prohibiting the encampment of gipsies and others in their districts. Local authorities have, I am informed, sometimes proposed by-laws on this subject, but I understand that the Home Office, to whom these by-laws have been referred, have been averse to approving them, and the same view has been taken in relation to similar proposals which have been made in private Bills. As I have said, the question of registration is certainly not an easy one to deal with; indeed, from the very nature of the case it cannot be easy, these dwellings being movable and it being difficult to trace them and to follow them about. In many cases registration would only be valuable in assisting identification. I think there is a good deal to be said for the suggestion made just now by Lord Zouche that these people when they are registered should be compelled to pay for a licence. As the noble Lord very
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0584"/>
<col>1119</col>
properly pointed out, they have a great many advantages and are free from rates and taxes, and a small fee for a licence, if it is practicable&#x2014;and I do not commit myself in the least to it, because I do not know whether it is practicable or not&#x2014;is certainly a suggestion well worthy of consideration.<lb/>
Another matter dealt with in the Bill is that of overcrowding. Local authorities already have power to take proceedings in the cases of tents, vans, and other structures which are so overcrowded as to be injurious to health, and it is questionable whether it would be practicable to go further than this and give them powers beyond what they already possess. The meaning of Clause 6, which makes it the duty of the sanitary authority to assist the registration authority in carrying out the objects of the Bill, does not seem to me to be very clear. The Bill contemplates, apparently, that the registration will be performed by county and county borough councils, but the enforcement of the Bill would lie with the police and local authorities in whose area the van and tent dwellers were found. I would, therefore, suggest that Clause 6 should be omitted, and that in its place a provision should be inserted making it the duty of the county and county borough councils and the police authorities to enforce the provisions of the regulations. Clause 8 provides that every registration authority under the Bill shall, not later than January 21 in every year make a report to the Local Government Board as to the execution of the Act within their area. It seems to me that it would probably be better that every medical officer of health should in his annual report refer to the execution of the Bill in his district. That would be, I think, a better way of dealing with it than that defined in Clause 8.<lb/>
To go back to Clause 2, that clause refers to the renewal of registration from time to time. It seems to me that this also would be a very difficult matter to enforce. It would be impossible for a man who had registered in some northern county, for instance, and had removed, perhaps, to the other end of England, to go back to be registered afresh. This, however, is a matter with which, if the Bill goes to a Select Committee, the Committee would have an opportunity of dealing, and I need <ob/> say any more regarding it. I hope that 
<col>1120</col>
after the remarks I have made I shall not be accused of having shown lukewarmness in support of the Bill. I have merely endeavoured to point out some of the directions in which, in the opinion of the Local Government Board, the Bill calls for amendment before it can be satisfactorily administered by them; and, in supporting the Second Reading of this Bill, I should like to use the words which fell last year from the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition in your Lordships' House, but who is unfortunately not in his place this evening. The noble Marquess said&#x2014; 
<quote>I hope we shall not hesitate to give the Bill a Second Reading this evening. By doing so we commit ourselves only to the principle of the Bill. The principle of the Bill is, I conceive, this, that we do not desire that persons who adopt a nomadic mode of life should thereby emancipate themselves from the laws and regulations to which other members of the community are subject.</quote>
I venture to think that that is the view of your Lordships and if the House is agreed generally on the principle of the Bill and will consent to refer it to a Select Committee, that Committee will have an opportunity of putting the Bill into shape, and of making it more workable, on the lines which I have indicated.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD BELPER</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I do not wish to follow the noble Lord who has just spoken for the Government into any of the details, because I understand from him that the Government are perfectly willing that the Bill should be read a second time, and that its details should be referred to a Select Committee for the purpose of full consideration. If that is done by the general consent of the House I should certainly advise my noble friend to accept the suggestion. I may say that the County Councils Association, in promoting this Bill, have no idea that the details of the Bill could be passed in anything like the form in which they now are. It is clear that, in regard to a delicate matter of this kind, the first legislation should have the fullest consideration that can be given to it by a Select Committee, and if the Bill can be amended in any of the details to which tho noble Lord referred we shall be only too glad to do anything to facilitate that, in order that there may be some legislation which may meet the difficulties that have constantly arisen with regard to these nomad classes. I did not quite follow the noble Lord, Lord
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0585"/>
<col>1121</col>
Allendale, with regard to Clause 5. No doubt that clause gives certain powers to county councils. Those powers are guarded in this way, that it is only in cases within their area where it would be dangerous to the public health or constitute a nuisance to the neighbourhood for people to put their dwellings in these particular districts that they have this power to actually prohibit encampment. I think a county council is competent to exercise discretion of that sort. But, as I say, if there is any objection to the particular wording of this clause and it can be modified, we shall be only too happy that it should be considered. The Bill was read a second time last year, and I conclude from what the noble Lord has said that the Government are perfectly willing that it should be read a second time to-day before being referred t o a Select Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the course suggested is the one which was recommended last year by my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition, and it is the course, therefore, which we should desire respectfully to recommend to your Lordships to-day. We are very glad to hear that the measure is to be referred to a Select Committee. We think that the matter does require very careful inquiry. The scope of this Bill is a good deal wider, I think, than some noble Lords who have addressed your Lordships have indicated. Most of the speakers have spoken of gipsies as if the Bill only referred to gipsies, but it is far wider in its effect. The whole class of showmen, all those who cater for the innocent amusement of the countryside, come within the scope of this Bill. There is no reason, of course, why they should not be under proper regulations, but there is reason for caution in dealing with a matter of this kind. As your Lordships are aware, the association which showmen have formed is very much alarmed at the proposed legislation, and has made representations to your Lordships asking that Parliament should be very careful in what it does in this matter. The Bill would also include the summer encampments of working boys. All those are very wide powers, and when we find that these encampments are to be legislated for, not merely when they are in public places, but also when on private property&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member>: <membercontribution>In the case of camps of that kind there
<col>1122</col>
would be power to get out of the Bill altogether by obtaining a certificate from the Territorial Association that they were under proper supervision.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member>: <membercontribution>I understand that the Territorial Association would only operate in the case of military or quasi-military encampments. I do not know whether the noble Lord thinks that the Territorial Association is such an admirable body that it might be entrusted with the power of dealing with all encampments. But the point I wish to emphasise is that the scope of the Bill is extremely wide. Of course, if the evils which have to be met are great the Bill ought to be passed and ought to have a wide scope; but the question is, Are the evils great? Are there great objections from a sanitary point of view and from the point of view of fire and disease? It may be so, and we shall, therefore, await with the greatest interest the investigations of the Select Committee which your Lordships will, no doubt, appoint. Personally&#x2014;and I believe my noble friends behind me agree&#x2014;I think that is precisely the course which ought to be adopted with this Bill, and when we have the Report of the Select Committee in our hands we shall be able to judge how far the Bill ought further to proceed.<lb/>

<title>AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATION.</title>
<p>*<member>LORD SALTOUN</member> <membercontribution>rose to call attention to the work of the Agricultural Research Association and to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture if he would reconsider his refusal to continue the grant which had been given for many years. The noble Lord said: My Lords, I should like, in the first place, to tell your Lordships briefly the origin and objects of this association. It was originally established as the Aberdeenshire Agricultural Association in 1875, but in the course of a very few years it undertook other duties and became known under its present name. The subscribers to the association number under a hundred, chiefly in the northern
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0586"/>
<col>1123</col>
counties, amongst whom are the Lord-Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire, the Earl of Aberdeen, and the noble Marquess who leads this side of the House, but who, I am sorry to see, is not in his place to-day. But by far the greater number of those interested in this association are farmers. There are some 200 associates who take the keenest and liveliest interest in the proceedings and in the results obtained. The total subscriptions come to somewhere about &#x00A3;145 annually, and to this has been added a grant from the Board of Agriculture, which began in 1891 and up to 1893 was &#x00A3;150 a year and after that was reduced to &#x00A3;100, but in 1900 it was discontinued altogether. I will, however, allude to that again, as the then Minister reconsidered the matter and renewed the grant, which has been continued since that date until 1906.<lb/>
I know that the noble Earl who is going to reply to me is deeply interested in all farming operations and is keen for the interests of farmers, and I can assure him that it is for their sake that I am calling attention to this matter to-day. I can imagine that one of the arguments which the noble Earl will use, in reply, is that in the course of the last two or three years colleges have been founded for the purpose of experimenting in agriculture, and that these agricultural colleges now carry out this work. But I can assure your Lordships that these colleges, at all events the college in Aberdeen, do not in any way go into research work. The colleges are purely educational and do no research work but only experimental work. They do not in any way attempt to undertake the duties of this association. The objects of this association are&#x2014; 
<quote>To obtain reliable and useful information on agricultural subjects by means of scientific investigation and practical experiments and to disseminate information; and to advance and aid in such way as may be deemed expedient the knowledge and the application of agricultural science.</quote>
This will show your Lordships that the objects of the association are entirely different from those of the agricultural colleges.<lb/>
I will in a moment point out some of the chief results which have been accomplished by Mr. Jamieson, the director of research and chief experimenter of the association. I do not know him personally, but I believe that in scientific research work he 
<col>1124</col>
is quite a genius. Mr. Arthur Balfour, speaking the other day at Glasgow, described two kinds of geniuses in the course of his speech, and he was speaking on this very subject of research. One kind he described as follows&#x2014; 
<quote>Then there was the rarer class of those who seemed born for research, to whom the penetration into the secrets of nature or into the secrets of history was an absorbing and overmastering passion from which they would not be diverted except by the absolute necessity of earning their daily bread. To those men it was all important&#x2014;not for the sake of the men but for the sake of the community&#x2014;that they should have a chance of devoting their rare talents to that great work for which God undoubtedly intended them.</quote>
That, I believe, is a very accurate description of Mr. Jamieson in regard to his genius for this particular kind of work.<lb/>
Now let me call your Lordships' attention to some of the principal results which have been obtained by this association. One of the leading results was this, "that insoluble mineral phosphate is utilised by plants, and, if sufficiently ground, increases the produce equally as well as soluble phosphate, which is double the price." About 1,000,000 tons of insoluble phosphatic manures are now used in the United Kingdom yearly, of which 50,000 tons are used in the north of Scotland, where there has been a saving of &#x00A3;50,000 annually. Therefore, in respect of the 1,000,000 tons of these manures now used in the United Kingdom yearly there is a saving to farmers of &#x00A3;1,000,000 annually. I think your Lordships will agree that that is a most important result to have secured.<lb/>
Another result secured&#x2014;and it was this that led to the grant being dropped in the year 1900&#x2014;was the discovery that natural (or self) cross-fertilisation takes place in the gramine&#x00153; family, which includes the cereals and the grasses. The reason for withdrawing the grant in 1900 was a mistaken report of the Board's expert. What the association claimed in the last-mentioned discovery was that two kinds of oats sown together crossed, and that the crossed seed could next year be sown and yield larger produce. The expert thought the association alluded to the well-known practice of mixing wheat with oats and grass in order to provide green food for cattle, which is a very different thing; and when this was pointed out Mr. Hanbury, who was then the Minister, reconsidered his decision and continued the grant. Another
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0587"/>
<col>1125</col>
result well known to your Lordships was the "primary cause of finger and toe in turnips and the means for its prevention."<lb/>
Now I come to the last and latest work to which I am going to allude, and that is the discovery that nitrogen of air is directly absorbed and fixed by plants&#x2014;largely by many plants, in smaller degree by other plants such as cereals and grasses. This is a subject of the greatest importance, and already a tremendous storm of opposition and inquiry has been raised. But from all I hear there are in this country an increasing number coming round to the views of the association in regard to this point. There is an old proverb to the effect that a prophet is not without honour save in his own country, and I have in my hand a great number of appreciations and criticisms from different parts of the world of the work done by this association. There is an appreciation from America. In France the work of the association has been appreciated to such an extent that there was published in the <i>Annales de la Science A gronomique,</i> under the auspices of the Minister of Agriculture, two of the reports of the association <i>in extenso.</i> The work of the association has been recognised also by Professor Grandeau, Director of Experimental Stations in France; by Professor Franck, of Berlin; and by Professor Roerdan, of Denmark; while in Holland the pamphlets have been translated in the Flemish language, and in Brazil the Government Department of Agriculture have issued publications on the subject. And last, but not least, there is the confirmation of two scientists, professors in Government experimental stations in Hungary, who have tested the investigations of the association and who say&#x2014; 
<quote>Our researches&#x2014;we mention it in every place of our essay&#x2014;are based on your pioneer explorations and our results justify your theory.</quote>
I will not trouble your Lordships further on this point, but I think that what I have said shows the great appreciation in which the work that has been done by this association is regarded in all parts of the globe.<lb/>
I confess that I do not know why this grant was refused, but I understand that the only reason given was that the Board did not approve of our investigations. I understand that an interview was had with Earl Carrington, who, I think, recalled that expression and said that the grant 
<col>1126</col>
would only be given "if the results accorded with the opinion of the expert." The grant is not now given, and, therefore, I presume the results do not accord with the opinion of the expert. I do not know who the expert is or on what he bases his opinion. I have not the slightest doubt that he may be an excellent expert in educational and in experimental agricultural matters, but I am told that he is not recognised as an authority on agricultural research. It is quite clear that the Board have advanced money for many years to aid in this research, and I do not understand how they can now argue that this aid is dependent on the results harmonising with the opinion of the expert when the results can only be obtained after the outlay has been made. The sum is only a small one and the work that has been accomplished is very important. I would, therefore, ask the noble Earl to reconsider his decision. The noble Earl the other day appealed to your Lordships to give him "his little Bill." I would earnestly ask him to give me my little grant.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF HUNTLY</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, as I have been president of this association since it was started thirty-three years ago, I desire to support my noble friend in the action he has taken and to make an appeal to the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture that in this matter he should reconsider his decision. I say unhesitatingly that I regard the noble Earl's action as a most retrograde step. This association is, I believe I am right in saying, the only research association in the British Isles which devotes itself solely to original investigation, and it appears to be held by the Board of Agriculture that because one of its experiments is disputed therefore it is to be condemned. I do not intend to go through the list of the good work that the association has done, but there is hardly anyone connected with agriculture who does not know the great results obtained by this body.<lb/>
The business, of course, of a research association is not always to go on hard and fast facts. It pursues its investigations, it publishes results, it invites criticism, and it is by that means that the truth is arrived at. The grants given for agriculture in this country are given to colleges and educational establishments, but where would these institutions be if it had not been for the research of the past? It is
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0588"/>
<col>1127</col>
through the original investigation that has been conducted that you are able to arrive at the truth and at facts which you can afterwards teach to the rising generation of agriculturists. But here you have the disgracefully small grant of &#x00A3;100 a year to this association stopped because one of the experts of the Board of Agriculture disagrees with the chemist who is directing these research experiments. That was the explanation given, and it has not been withdrawn.<lb/>
Compare what has been done in this country with what is being done on the Continent. Every other country in Europe is studded with State-aided institutions. In France, Germany, Denmark, and every other country the institutions are supported out of the funds of the State&#x2014;not only institutions for research and original investigations, but also qualified officials for checking the results that are obtained by these institutions. Then these are tabulated and transmitted to the educational establishments for their benefit. I presume that the policy of the President of the Board of Agriculture is not to stifle all research work in this country. But the Universities have not time for research work. I would call attention to the extraordinary interest that is being taken on the Continent in the latest discovery of this association&#x2014;namely, the utilisation of nitrogen by plants from the air. Mr. Jamieson was the first person to demonstrate how much nitrogen plants have the power of absorbing from the air. This discovery led to a storm of criticism and comment; but what has been the result of the investigations of one of the greatest institutions in Hungary? The professor at the Royal Hungarian High School of Forestry and also the professor at the Royal Hungarian Central Experimental Station of Forestry wrote&#x2014; 
<quote>Our researches&#x2014;we mention it in every place of our essay&#x2014;are based on your pioneer explorations; our results justify your theory.</quote>
That is a Report from the Government Department in Hungary addressed to our association confirming and acknowledging the great results attained. I sincerely hope that the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture, who, we know, has the interests of agriculture at heart, will not seek to stifle our work by withholding such a small grant as &#x00A3;100.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1128</col>
<p><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I regret it, but I am afraid I am unable to meet the wishes of the two noble Lords who have so eloquently pleaded the cause of the institution in which they take so great an interest. I have been a great nuisance to my colleagues in the Government in advocating the cause of agriculture and in asking for money, and I am bound to say that they have been very generous. I have been more successful than I had any reason to anticipate; but, having obtained promises of money, it behoves, me to be extremely careful how that money is spent. I should be blamed, and rightly so, if any expenditure of public money was made to an institution which it was afterwards rather difficult to justify.<lb/>
The institution referred to is the Agricultural Research Association. The noble Lord has described its inception and the grants that were made to it up to last year, when the grant was discontinued. Looking at the financial statement for the year ended December 31, 1908, I find that, although only one-half of the "direction"&#x2014;I speak under correction, but I suppose "direction" is Gaelic for "salary"&#x2014;although only-one-half of the salary, namely, &#x00A3;100, was paid, yet there is a deficit of &#x00A3;260. That, of course, is to me as an agriculturist a matter of great regret, and all the more so as the noble Lord told us that the farmers are deeply interested in this agricultural research work. The noble Lord also stated that the association was entirely different in its aims from the agricultural colleges because the latter did not undertake research work. I am unable to follow the noble Lord there. The agricultural colleges do undertake research, and with very beneficial results.<lb/>
That this association did very good work in days gone by I entirely admit, and it was supported and received a grant in consequence; but at the present moment I am afraid I am unable to recommend the continuance of the grant for the reason which I shall state to your Lordships. I do not know what his official title is, but the chemist of this association, as has been said, has theories. I had an interview on July 4, 1907, with Mr. Jamieson, who has been rightly described as a genius. He was kind enough to spend an hour and a half with me, and he explained at very considerable length the absorption
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0589"/>
<col>1129</col>
of nitrogen by the hairs of plants. Though a number of qualitative tests show that albumen is present in the hairs of certain plants, there is no proof whatever that the nitrogen comes from the air outside. On the contrary, it comes in the ordinary way through the root of the plant.<lb/>
The noble Lord who called attention to this matter to-day said that an increasing number of people were coming round to the view of this association, and he quoted the report of two Hungarians confirming and acknowledging what had been done. I have here the Report of these Hungarians. It is perfectly true that in their Report these two scientific gentlemen say&#x2014; 
<quote>Our investigations and studies support, for the most part, the opinions of Mr. Jamieson in according to these hairs of specialised form a physiological significance of great importance."</quote>
They add&#x2014; 
<quote>We are persuaded that Jamieson's theory will prevail, for evidently it is these hairs and club-hairs that produce the albumen of plants, and it is these organs that enable the plants to profit from the immense quantity of nitrogen in the air.</quote>
It is perfectly true that they believe in it themselves, but they submit no proof whatever that this theory is correct.<lb/>
Naturally I had to take the opinion of people who know a great deal more about these scientific matters than I do myself. Mr. Baillie Balfour, Professor of Botany at Edinburgh, said, in a lecture on March 16 two years ago, that&#x2014; 
<quote>Not a semblance of proof of the fixation of nitrogen was advanced by Mr. Jamieson.</quote>
He went on to say&#x2014; 
<quote>Mr. Jamieson's discovery was not a discovery at all.</quote>
What is the opinion of Professor Middleton, who was professor of Agriculture at Cambridge and whose valuable services I have been fortunate enough to secure at the Board of Agriculture? He advised that&#x2014; 
<quote>Mr. Jamieson's work was of an unsatisfactory character.</quote>
Then I come to the opinion of Mr. A. D. Hall, Professor of Botany at Rothamsted. Mr. Hall on March 31, 1906, said&#x2014; 
<quote>The speculations of Mr. Jamieson on the subject of the fixation of nitrogen are not accepted by any scientific man with whom I am acquainted;</quote>
<col>1130</col>
and Mr. Trail, Professor of Botany at Aberdeen, on February 27, 1907, after a most careful and unbiased examination of the evidence, declared that&#x2014; 
<quote>Mr. Jamieson has failed to prove his case, and he has so completely misunderstood the structures examined by him as to make impossible a true interpretation of their functions.</quote>
The action of the Board, or rather my action, for I take the whole blame of it if there is any blame, has been described by Mr. Jamieson in a speech delivered to his supporters as "ridiculous." But I will ask the noble Lord one question. In the face of the decided opinions of these learned and scientific gentlemen, would he himself have increased the grant? I quite acknowledge the good work that has been done in the past, and I go further and say that should Mr. Jamieson be fortunate enough to make any fresh discoveries or be able to produce any further evidence as to the value of his agricultural work, it will, of course, be most carefully considered; but on the evidence at present available I do honestly think, in the interests of my Department, that it is impossible to sanction a grant from the public funds at my disposal. I very much regret that I am, therefore, unable to meet the wishes of the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I confess that most of us have listened to the noble Earl's answer with feelings of considerable surprise. Here is an institution engaged upon very interesting agricultural research work&#x2014;a subject in which in this country we are vitally interested. The association apparently enjoys a reputation not confined to the United Kingdom but world wide, and testimonials to their good work have been received from many European countries and some from America. In the face of a position of that kind we find that the Government have suddenly deprived this association of its grant. The noble Earl took to himself great credit in his efforts in the direction of economy. What economy has he effected by the withdrawal of this grant? He has saved the taxpayers of this country the stupendous sum of &#x00A3;100 a year! And the noble Earl effects an economy of &#x00A3;100 at a time when one of his colleagues, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is taking untold sums for a development grant to make experiments of this kind. Could anything be more amazing than that an association which
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0590"/>
<col>1131</col>
apparently does first-rate work should be deprived of this paltry sum by a Government who believe in a development grant?<lb/>
Let us look for a moment at the noble Earl's reasons. It appears that his reasons turn entirely upon the qualifications of the particular scientific gentleman who advises this association. He is admitted to be a genius. The noble Earl himself says he is a genius. That is something in these days of mediocrity. Well, what has he done wrong that the association should be deprived of this &#x00A3;100? Apparently all his theories have not been proved. Are we never to give money for investigation to associations unless they can immediately prove all their theories? That is verdict first and trial afterwards. I confess I never heard a reason so ill-founded as that for depriving an association of a grant. But there is this one great subject of dispute&#x2014;a question that I am afraid I am not qualified to deal with&#x2014;as to the fixation of nitrogen. That is not the only theory of the association. The other great discoveries made by the association are admitted. Yet because in one particular case the theory has not been proved their work in every other direction is, so far as the Government are concerned, to be put an end to. Lastly, the case of the association does not and cannot rest on the reputation of one gentleman. The noble Earl seems to me to have failed lamentably to prove anything against the association itself, and in these days when agricultural science is so important I would respectfully ask the Government&#x2014;this economical Government&#x2014;to be considerate and see whether they cannot find it in their heart to provide this &#x00A3;100.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD HENEAGE</member>: <membercontribution>I should like to ask whether it is not the fact that the expert opinions quoted by the noble Earl were given some four years ago, and that during the last three years, while the theory has been in course of being perfected, not one single word has been said by any of these experts against it?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, this seems to me to be purely Departmental interference with scientific investigations, which I should have thought the noble Earl would have been the last person to have encouraged. The Board of Agriculture is surely, under his rule, interested 
<col>1132</col>
in developing investigations into every branch of science connected with agriculture, and agriculturists had reason to hope that, whatever might be the economic opinion of the new development grant which was to absorb the old Sinking Fund, at any rate some of it might be devoted to purposes that would assist the cultivators of the land. But the noble Earl at this juncture, when his pockets are going to be filled with the stream from the old Sinking Fund even refuses money to an existing institution which has been in receipt of a Government grant even under the old system when those grants were less liberally given. I hope the noble Earl will reconsider the position and see whether he cannot give this paltry sum out of the large funds at his disposal.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member>: <membercontribution>What I could do if I had more money is a different question. I have only a certain amount at the present time, and that ought to be expended to the best possible public advantage. There are other societies and colleges that have a prior claim as doing more practical work.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member>: <membercontribution>I would like to ask whether this is the sort of purpose to which the money to be derived from the old Sinking Fund might be devoted?</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member>: <membercontribution>This is not the only society engaged in research work. All the agricultural colleges are pursuing exactly the same work, and, in my humble opinion, doing it a peat deal better.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT RIDLEY</member>: <membercontribution>That was not the question I asked. Is the noble Earl in a position to say if work of this kind will come within the purposes of the development grant? If so, he might be in a position in another year to comply with the request of my noble friend for a grant for this particular institution.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (THE EARL OF CREWE)</member>: <membercontribution>We will answer the noble Viscount's question when we have got the new fund.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD SALTOUN</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I cannot refrain from expressing my disappointment at the answer I have received from the noble Earl. No notice was given that the grant was to be withdrawn, and the
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0591"/>
<col>1133</col>
result of its withdrawal has been to land the association heavily in debt. As this debt will have to be met, the future work of the association will be seriously crippled. I earnestly hope the noble Earl will, out of kindness of heart, reconsider his decision in this matter.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE ARMY.</title>
<p>*<member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to move for a Return showing the total <i>(a)</i> combatant <i>(b)</i> non-combatant establishment of the Expeditionary Force; the number of officers and men of the Regular Army at present available included in this force; the number of officers and men who will be drawn from the Special Reserve <i>(a)</i> combatant <i>(b)</i> non-combatant; the number of men, if any, who will be sent abroad under twenty years of age; the number of officers and men over twenty years of age at present on the strength of the Regular Army who will remain in this country to replace the wastage of war after the Expeditionary Force has left <i>(a)</i> combatant <i>(b)</i> non-combatant; the force which could be mobilised at home of men of not less than one year's service after the Expeditionary Force has been despatched, dividing <i>(a)</i> Regulars from <i>(b)</i> Special Reserve, as the existing strength of these forces.<lb/>
I trust the noble Lord who represents the War Office will understand that, in moving for this Return, I do not wish him to publish any information the disclosing of which may be detrimental to the national interest; but as he stated the other day that a good deal of this information could be derived from official publications, I think we are fully justified in asking the noble Lord to lay this Return on the Table. No one, I think, can fail to appreciate the fact, stated by the noble Lord during the course of the military debate last week, that until the scheme of the Secretary of State had had time to mature there were bound to be certain gaps. I am glad to think that the noble Lord now admits the truth of our contention that there are serious gaps, especially amongst officers. The question is, how soon do the Government anticipate that those gaps are likely to be filled up? Nearly three years have elapsed since the Secretary of State for War said in the House of Commons&#x2014; 
<quote>As the result of the Government's proposals we shall be in a position to readily mobilise 150,000 officers and men. Of this total, 50,000 
<col>1134</col>
will be regulars serving with the Colours, about 70,000 wi11 be Reservists, and about 30,000 men employed and trained on a Militia basis.</quote>
The right hon. gentleman went on to state that:&#x2014; 
<quote>An Army so organised would be, in point of numbers, available for taking the field over seas nearly fifty per cent. stronger than any Expeditionary Force which we have ever hitherto attempted to organise in this country.</quote>
A War Office Return subsequently issued showed an even more encouraging statement&#x2014;namely, 159,620 officers and men. After the very clear statement made during the course of the debate last week by the Duke of Bedford, which was fully endorsed by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal Lord Roberts, it is difficult for any of us to imagine that that number is ever likely to be forthcoming. I say this for this reason, that neither the noble Lord nor any member on the Government side attempted to discredit or seriously to dispute the many hard facts and proofs produced by my noble friend the Duke of Bedford. In fact, if I may say so, they evaded all these points in every detail, and adopted the somewhat extraordinary attitude of appealing to us on this side as to what alternative scheme we had to suggest for this purpose.<lb/>
Because the noble Duke, myself, and others have thought fit to criticise the military policy of His Majesty's Government, I fail to understand&#x2014;I say it with all respect&#x2014;why the noble Earl the Leader of the House should think that we have imparted unusual animus into our criticisms or that we have been actuated by any party motives. I can assure him that the criticisms we have made have been made purely for the good of the service, and more especially that particular branch of the service to which many of us belong. The noble Lord the Under-Secretary told the House last week that he did not see that any good could accrue from having a special inquiry into the state of the Special Reserve, but that if such a Commission should sit, which he did not anticipate, the result of their deliberations would, he believed, be to ask for the heads of the Ministers in the late Government. I can assure him, whether he thinks that or not, that in asking him for this Return I am not in any way actuated by motives of that kind with respect to himself. I hope, therefore, that the noble Lord will be more responsive than he has been on two former occasions, and will not be content to
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0592"/>
<col>1135</col>
shelter himself behind the well-known official statement that it is contrary to precedent to give the information.<lb/>

<p><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD LUCAS)</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I should like to express our gratitude to the noble Viscount for his statement that he does not desire anything which it is contrary to the public interest should be published. I can assure him that in all our answers to him we will bear that carefully in mind, and that nothing that is in the least likely to be prejudicial shall be made public. For that reason I am afraid I am unable to give any other answers to these Questions than I have already given on two occasions. But shortly after Whitsuntide we propose to lay Papers on the Table of your Lordships' House showing the full effect of the reforms that we have up to now carried out in the Army. I think there is some need for that, because the debate of last week showed pretty clearly that the result of those reforms is not so well understood as it might be. The Papers that we shall present will show all that can legitimately be made public in the way of elucidating the points upon which the noble Viscount asks for information, and anything beyond what will be contained in the Papers the noble Viscount can only, I am afraid, get by 
<col>1136</col>
coming to the War Office as I have proposed to him on previous occasions. That is all I have to say on the Motion of the noble Viscount. But there is another Question on the Paper standing in the name of Lord Lovat. I would like to say, with regard to that Question, that it deals entirely with our mobilisation arrangements. It amounts to asking for our mobilisation plans in detail, and therefore&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LOVAT</member>: <membercontribution>The noble Lord is proceeding to answer a Question which I have on the Paper, but which I have not yet asked. I should like to inquire if the noble Lord is in order in answering a Question which has not been put.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, we may congratulate my noble friend behind me who has moved this Motion that, directly, I think, as the result of his perseverance, we are going to get something out of the Government after Whitsuntide. I think it is a pity that we were not told that when my noble friend asked these Questions the first time. I suppose most of us will be ready to possess ourselves in patience and see what we are going to get from the promised Papers. But I would draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the late Government gave certain particulars to this House which, as regards matters at that time, gave a good deal of the information that my noble friend desires to obtain as regards matters at the present moment. Mr. Arnold-Forster, when he made certain proposals regarding the reorganisation of the Army in 1904, gave a statement showing the composition of a battalion on mobilisation, the number under and over twenty years of age, the number of Reservists required to complete war establishment, and the number in excess. That only gave the figure for one battalion, but obviously a small sum in multiplication would give it for the whole Army. I ask specifically that a similar return should be included among the Papers we are to see. The Secretary of State for War is going round the country almost conducting an election campaign in his own favour, and it is right that we should know the facts about the optimistic statements he is making.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>VISCOUNT HARDINGE</member>: <membercontribution>I am content to withdraw my Motion and to wait and see what the Return we are promised divulges.<lb/>
Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0593"/>
<col>1137</col>
<p><member>LORD LOVAT</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, in asking the noble Lord the Under-Secretary of State for War the Question standing in my name <ob/>the Paper&#x2014;namely, what is the total number of combatants of all ranks in organised units available for the Central Home Defence Force after the Expeditionary Force and the garrisons of naval bases and defence areas have been deducted&#x2014;I intend to adopt a rather different method of procedure. I have asked this Question on more than one occasion already and have not had a satisfactory answer. I Propose on this occasion to answer it myself.<lb/>
It has been clearly stated by Mr. Haldane that the military forces of this country are divided into the Expeditionary Force and the Home Defence Force, and that the Home Defence Force is divided into two definite parts&#x2014;those troops that are allocated for fixed defences and those which Mr. Haldane has stated are to form the Central Home Defence Force. Now with regard to the Expeditionary Force, we have, I think, passed out of debatable ground. It has been admitted that the Expeditionary Force will consist of 165,000 men, and Mr. Balfour laid down in 1905 that for this force would be required six divisions in certain cases for the defence of India. The Secretary of State for War has more than once stated the number of men required for the Expeditionary Force, and our friends across the water have laid it down in their military reviews that if the <i>entente cordiale</i> is to be worth anything at all we must have a force capable of going over to that side. Every military writer in the French Press says that if there is to be any real understanding there must be a possibility in England of six divisions, or some large number, and a Cavalry division being able, in certain circumstances, to cross the sea. Our Colonies have in no less certain terms declared that the central police force of the Empire must have a real power of mobility to go oversea. Therefore I think I may say that we are agreed that the Expeditionary Force should number something approaching six Infantry divisions and one Cavalry division &#x2014;167,000 men in all.<lb/>
As to the question of fixed defences, we are also well in agreement. The number was defined by Mr. Balfour as 142,000 men, plus Garrison Artillery. The figure of 168,000 has been repeatedly used throughout the country by our leading military 
<col>1138</col>
writers as the number to defend our ports, naval arsenals, and other posts which must be held from the purely naval point of view. I am not going to say that 168,000 is the figure to-day, but I say it is not less than that number, because the limited raid theory which held the field until a year ago was definitely abandoned by Lord Crewe in November last; and, in addition, we know that in a few years time the number of ships which a certain Power will have will upset the present proportion.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member>: <membercontribution>I do not desire to interrupt the noble Lord, but I rather object to being quoted in that way. I wish the noble Lord would quote my words.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LOVAT</member>: <membercontribution>I am afraid I have not the noble Earl's words, but I shall be happy to read what Mr. Haldane said, and he went further than the noble Earl. After all, the force required for the defence of our naval ports is dependent on the number of men who can be brought against us. The Secretary of State for War said on March 8 last in the House of Commons&#x2014; 
<quote>I have never said that invasion of these islands was impossible, but there is great ambiguity about what is meant by an invasion. A small raid might take place or an invasion upon a considerably larger scale might well be possible. What you have to consider is what is the size of the invading force which the Navy can make sure of intercepting? That is a problem you cannot answer with exactitude, but investigation and consideration make it pretty plain that a force somewhere between 70,000 and 100,000 is the force you must guard against by keeping your home defence army sufficiently strong to prevent the enemy coming in larger numbers than the Navy can deal with with something like certainty.</quote>
Therefore it is now admitted that invasion by a force of between 70,000 and 100,000 is possible. That brings me back to my point&#x2014;namely, that as the number of possible invaders is greater the number of the fixed defence force cannot be less. The noble Duke, the Duke of Bedford, pointed out clearly the other day that a portion of the defenders of fixed places&#x2014;the Special Reserve&#x2014;were not better for their work than the troops they had succeeded. Consequently the number of men required may be considerably more than 168,000.<lb/>
From there we go to the question of the Central Home Defence Force, and here there is agreement. May I for a moment show exactly how the train of thought on this
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0594"/>
<col>1139</col>
particular subject has altered in the last few years? In 1905 we had the limited raid theory&#x2014;that is to say, a raid by a force of from 5,000 to 10,000; and therefore we had no Central Home Defence Force except the defence force by commands. In 1907 Lord Roberts instituted an inquiry into this matter and brought certain evidence before the Defence Committee, and in 1908 a mobilisation plan was begun for a Central Home Defence Force. In March of this year the Secretary of State made the statement which I have read to the House&#x2014;that we had to make preparations for a possible invasion by between 70,000 and 100,000 men. This great Central Defence Force then became a thing of vital necessity to the defence of this country. How many men have we to fill these three <i>r&#x00F4;les</i>&#x2014;the Expeditionary Force, the garrisons of naval bases and defence areas, and the Central Home Defence Force. We require for our Expeditionary Force over seas, as Lord Lucas said, the whole of the men over twenty and the Reservists.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>I never said the whole of the men over twenty.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LOVAT</member>: <membercontribution>Then I will take back that statement. There are so very few over twenty that it really does not matter. The noble Lord stated that in order to mobilise the home battalions you would require the whole of the Reserves, with a negligible quantity over of a few thousand. That being so, we have, for the mobolisation of the 160,000 men, the whole of the Reserve used up with the exception of these few thousand, all the men over twenty with a few exceptions, and also&#x2014;this was mentioned in the noble Lord's statement the other day&#x2014;in order to complete the mobilisation of the ammunition columns and the Army Service Corps, a certain number of men, not specified, from the Special Reserve. On the Expeditionary Force quitting these shores we should be left with a certain number of half-trained Regular soldiers, of whom 30,000 might be recruits under one year's service, a proportion of the Special Reserve, and a negligible quantity of really trained Reserves.<lb/>
I know it is very often argued that a certain portion of our Expeditionary Force might be left at home in the event of an expedition overseas; but I am unable to follow this argument. I am told by those who have been responsible for making some 
<col>1140</col>
of our plans for oversea campaigns that it would be inconceivable, if four divisions went abroad and received a reverse, that the other two divisions should not immediately follow; and, in case the four divisions had a success, it is impossible to think that the other two divisions would be refused to the General in command, who would naturally wish to extend the lines of communication and <ob/> the results of victory. There is no doubt that plans will be made by the General Staff to have the whole of the men who are earmarked <ob/>the Expeditionary Force ready to be sent abroad if required, and it is no use for Ministers to tell us that only four divisions will be sent out of the country.<lb/>
The value of the curiously mixed mass of men to whom I referred a moment ago and who would be left over I put down as not more than 70,000 fighting men. They will have no junior officers, and the men, according to the Duke of Bedford, will not be as efficient as the old Militia. They will be jammed together in <i>cadres</i> of which they have no knowledge; they will be serving, many of them, in works of which they have no previous knowledge, and I think if there is one thing which the South African war proved to the hilt it was that mixed details who do not know their officers are not more than a third the value of other troops. As I say, I put down the total value of these men as not more than 70,000 fighting men. That means that we must have another 100,000 men to fill the fixed defences. Where are these to be obtained? They will obviously have to be found from the Territorial Army. To-day the Territorial Army is 260,000 strong. In the near future we may have 313,000 in that force, but this will not mean 313,000 men capable of taking the field. A large number of them will never have shot their musketry course, and it would not be possible to take them out against trained Continental soldiers over twenty years of age and of two years service.<lb/>
There is also the point that the whole of our ammunition column and other subsidiary corps are not even armed with a rifle. You must, therefore, make an allowance of 250 per 1,000&#x2014;in other words, you must deduct one-fourth before beginning to count the fighting strength. I think from 200,000 to 220,000 men would be the outside number of really efficient men. That gives you 100,000 for the fixed de-
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0595"/>
<col>1141</col>
fences and 120,000 to take into the field as the great Central Defence Force. These men might have to face 100,000 trained conscripts. Are you, therefore, not asking the Territorial Army to carry out work which they are incapable of doing? I think one has a right, as a Territorial officer, to put this question. I do not think it is fair to ask troops to do work which they certainly could not do. Therefore I make this protest. I have been driven to bring up this question by the Secretary of State going about the country making absurdly optimistic speeches about the state of our defences.<lb/>
The statement of the number of men available for the defence of the country is greatly exaggerated, because the ammunition corps and the Army Service Corps are not only not trained to the use of the rifle, but do not possess rifles; whereas it is laid down in the latest German regulations that the men in these branches are to be thoroughly trained in their arms in every particular and made efficient as soldiers, as upon them will largely devolve the duties of adequately protecting convoys. I take another point. Lord Roberts stated, in your Lordships' House, that the Central Defence Force would not exceed 40,000 men, and the Secretary of state, referring to that statement, said&#x2014; 
<quote>Lord Roberts, in the House of Lords, thought 200,000 men would be locked up in the defence of ports, and only 40,000 would be available. That was really absurd, because the men relegated for port defence, if their number were 200,000, would still be available to draw upon.</quote>
We could not afford the destruction of one single Dreadnought slip anywhere. How is it possible, therefore, to draw upon the men who are responsible for these local defences? How could they be taken sway and sent to the South of Scotland, it may be, to join the great Central Defence Force? The statement is not less than absurd. I feel that this matter is one which it is very necessary for us to consider at the present time. There are many here who wish for the continuance of the voluntary system and who wish to get the full amount out of the magnificent work Mr. Haldane has done in organising our forces but who are driven into the other camp because Mr. Haldane claims at the same time to have provided the men and the training. I beg to ask the Question standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1142</col>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the noble Lord has asked a Question which he knew perfectly well at the time he put it down was one which it was impossible for the Government to answer. The Question goes to the very heart of the whole of our mobilisation arrangements, and would be impossible to answer without practically explaining in detail what those arrangements are. Therefore, the noble Lord knew the answer would be a definite refusal to give any information on the subject. Nor am I going to follow Lord Lovat into the fantastic figures which he has given to-night. I cannot see what good raising this question and making speeches of this kind can possibly do. These figures, which the Government are debarred from answering, and debarred from correcting where they are wrong, as they are in most cases, can only create a false impression upon the minds of people who read these debates in the newspapers. If such a false impression has been created, it has been created by noble Lords opposite, and it is beyond the power of the Government to correct it, for we do not intend to give the information.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member>: <membercontribution>I think it right to point out that the Under-Secretary has used extremely strong language, and has applied the word "fantastic" to the figures given by Lord Lovat.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD LUCAS</member>: <membercontribution>Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member>: <membercontribution>Let us accept that word, for the figures were all taken out of the speeches of the Government.</membercontribution></p>

<title>DECK CARGOES.</title>
<p><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to draw the attention of His Majesty's Government to the decision of the Court which investigated the circumstances of the loss, with all hands, of the Great Eastern Railway Company's steamship "Yarmouth," and, in view of a statement made by the principal officer to the Board of Trade at Cardiff, that there is nothing like the number of surveyors to deal with one-tenth of the vessels that leave port, what special precautions the Board of Trade have taken, or propose to take with the object of, if possible, avoiding repetition in the future of serious sacrifice of life through merchant ships proceeding to sea with dangerous deck-loads; also, whether it is now proposed to increase the number of surveyors, and whether anything is being done in regard to dealing with recognised "systems" of carrying these deck-loads such as that alluded to in the course of the inquiry into the loss of the "Yarmouth."<lb/>
I am always anxious to avoid trespassing on your Lordships' time unless I feel that it is absolutely necessary, and if I bring forward a question which I have previously brought to your notice it is only when I am convinced that there are ample grounds for doing so. Long experience tells me that the Board of Trade will not move until they are practically forced to do so. I am again asking them to mitigate what is at present a grave peril of the sea. Towards the conclusion of last session I pointed out to your Lordships the enormous risks which British merchant ships are permitted to undertake in carrying dangerous deck-loads at all times of the year and under all conditions of weather. It is a common sight to see large passenger steamers and others, down to the small coasting traders, going to sea with heavy weights on deck, such as boilers, cylinders, railway wagons, and other unwieldy cargo of a similar character, which are supposed to be secured on leaving, but which, as all seamen will tell us, it is impossible to keep secured in heavy weather. These vessels are, therefore, saddled with an incubus which exposes them to enormous risk.
<col>1148</col>
When I last raised this question I was informed by my noble friend who represents the Board of Trade that this practice was common, and that, provided proper precautions were taken, the Board of Trade saw no objections to it. I was informed that the Board had adopted no special precautions in regard to such cargoes, but that their surveyors had general power to detain any ship which was improperly loaded. I am once again calling attention to this subject owing to the fact that since last session a terrible calamity has occurred to a coasting steamer which completely substantiates my contentions in this matter, and one which we cannot allow to pass without notice. I refer to the loss of the steamer "Yarmouth" with all hands.<lb/>
It is true that the Board of Trade ordered an investigation into the loss of this steamer. It is also true that the Court made some very strong comments regarding the deck cargo which was carried, and which they held responsible for the disaster. But I am sure your Lordships will agree that it is the clear duty of the Board of Trade to go further than this, and take some action whereby we may profit by the grim lesson which this terrible affair teaches us. I know that the "Yarmouth" at the time was bound from the Continent to Harwich, and that the Board of Trade have not any surveyors who could have prevented her leaving a Continental port in such a condition. Yet ways and means can be found to deal with such a case, if only in the direction of inflicting heavy penalties on the owners of ships not only sailing with but arriving with such dangerous cargoes, just as a ship is fined should she bring a large timber deck-load into a United Kingdom port in the wintertime.<lb/>
It does not matter very much as to the actual voyage the ship was taking, for the point I want to emphasise is the actual danger of these cargoes. From the report of the Board of Trade Inquiry I find that this steamer frequently carried heavy deck-loads, including furniture vans, thrashing machines, and engines, and this in all weathers. It seems that, according to the superintendent of the company, there was no compulsion upon the captain to take a deck cargo, and it lay entirely in his discretion to reject any cargo which he considered he could not safely carry. We
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0599"/>
<col>1149</col>
all know what this means. It is tie common practice of attempting to shift the responsibility on to the unfortunate captain, who has lost his life and cannot defend himself. Would he dare use his discretion? When such a practice is of common and usual occurrence, the tenure of the position of any captain who declined such cargo would be very brief.<lb/>
Of the deck cargo being carried by the "Yarmouth," there were three lift-vans of furniture which measured fourteen feet by seven feet by six feet six inches, and each weighing about three tons. It is not necessary to be a practical seaman to enable one to realise the immense danger of cargo of this character in case heavy weather is experienced. According to those on board the Outer Gabbard Lightship, from whence the "Yarmouth" was last sighted, she had a heavy list to starboard. When she got into shorter seas inside the Lightship she took very heavy rolls which put her over on her broadside with her starboard main-rail in the water. Before long those on the lightship lost sight of her, and the sequel was told by a Norwegian steamer falling in with bales or buoys floating on both sides of the ship, and cries as of drowning men. Nobody, however, was found, though every possible search was made.<lb/>
It is a very significant feature that immediately on the loss of the "Yarmouth" and long before the investigation into the casualty was held, the marine superintendent issued orders to the effect that these deck cargoes must be carried no longer. He, in effect, anticipated the report of the Board of Trade Inquiry. At the inquiry itself two experts&#x2014;naval architects&#x2014;said that they considered the stability of the "Yarmouth" when she started on her passage as satisfactory. But noble and learned Lords who have had experience in dealing with expert evidence will know that evidence of this kind is somewhat elastic in its character. In the present case, the Court said it must be borne in mind that the opinions expressed by the experts were based mainly on the testimony of the stevedores&#x2014;that is, those who loaded the ship&#x2014;and the Court had found serious discrepancies between the statements of these stevedores. The Court pointed out that the stowage plan placed before them was filled in with information supplied after the loss of the ship with all
<col>1150</col>
hands was known, and when it was likely that the question would be raised as to whether the cargo was properly stowed.<lb/>
In the opinion of the Court, which was assisted by two assessors of long experience in the merchant service and one vice-Admiral of the Royal Navy, it was improper to stow any cargo on the poop and forecastle, and there was no adequate provision for the satisfactory securing of the cargo that was carried upon these structures on the voyage which has been the subject of the investigation. The Court was distinctly of opinion that the ship was not properly loaded, having too much top weight, and we are informed that the vessel was lost through carrying too heavy a deck-cargo, which led to her listing heavily to starboard, and finally turning over with a suddenness which gave those on board no opportunity of making effective efforts to save themselves. The blame, it was said, did not attach to the Great Eastern Railway Company, the owners of the steamer, but, in the opinion of the Court, the system in existence was bad. The Court strongly condemned the practice of carrying deck-cargoes upon structures such as the poop and forecastle of the "Yarmouth," and was glad to learn that instructions had been given for the discontinuance of this practice on board the Great Eastern Railway Company's ships.<lb/>
This is a plain statement of a grave shipping calamity entirely attributable to avoidable causes. It is natural that the Great Eastern Railway Company are taking no further risks of that kind. But I ask what is going to be done in regard to the many other vessels outside this company which can, with impunity from any regulations, continue to carry deck-cargoes with the same frequency as before. When I last submitted this question to the House I was informed that the Board of Trade surveyors have a general power to detain any ship which is improperly loaded. This might, quite naturally, be considered by your Lordships as sufficient to meet the case but when I point out to you that hundreds, I may say thousands, of ships sail out of our seaports in the United Kingdom without any inspection whatever by nautical surveyors to the Board of Trade, you will then understand that this talk of their being able to cope with the situation is sheer nonsense. I believe that in some of our shipping ports there are no nautical
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0600"/>
<col>1151</col>
surveyors whatever, and in others they are in a very small minority, and their time is generally taken up in connection with duties as emigrant officers.<lb/>
In an important case which arose at Swansea, where the captain of a steamer was fined for neglecting to keep two lifeboats fit and ready for use, as required by the Merchant Shipping Act, some striking evidence was given by the principal officer to the Board of Trade at Cardiff. Asked his opinion as to the duties of Board of Trade surveyors with regard to life-saving appliances and other matters, he said that the Board had nothing like the number of surveyors to deal with one tenth of the vessels that left port. He further added that the surveyors performed a number of statutory duties that were paid for; and it is worthy of notice that these duties take precedence over every other duty. The mere matter of the safety of life is, apparently, of little moment to the Marine Department of the Board of Trade so long as they do not miss collecting the official fees chargeable by their surveyors for performing statutory duties under the Merchant Shipping Act. For some years past I have urged the necessity for a great increase in the number of nautical surveyors at our different seaports so that it would become nearly an impossibility for a merchant ship to proceed to sea in an unseaworthy condition through one cause or another.<lb/>
We have always been led to believe that a merchant ship was, in practically every case, officially inspected before she set out on her voyage. This, as I have explained, is a popular fallacy which cannot be too freely exposed. The Board of Trade, to whom we look as the primary protector of life at sea, shelve on to the unfortunate shipmasters the responsibility of seaworthiness or of the efficiency of life-saving apparatus, and other matters in the same category. On the other hand, shipmasters must look to their means of livelihood and they are only too alive to the fact that, if they wish to retain their positions, they must save their owners every possible farthing. With economy ever their first regard, is it not natural that they should take chances, from which the Board of Trade should, in justice, protect them by inspection of ships in the first place rather than by prosecuting them afterwards. The Board of Trade expect our merchant
<col>1152</col>
shipmasters and officers to conform to all sorts of requirements, under penalties of varying severity, but when, on the other hand, captains and officers look to the Board of Trade for assistance in the performance of their duties and protection from vexatious and unfair prosecutions, their claims are totally ignored by the Board.<lb/>
I hope that my noble friend who represents the Board of Trade in this House will be able to furnish us with a satisfactory reply to this Question on the Notice Paper; otherwise, I must bring it forward again. The fact of these deck-loads being responsible for loss of life cannot be denied. The decision of the Board of Trade inquiry. into the loss of the "Yarmouth" cannot be ignored, and the necessity of supplementing the ranks of nautical surveyors and inspectors to the Board of Trade at different seaports&#x2014;that is, gentlemen who have had practical experience in command of merchant ships&#x2014;is obvious. I hope for the sympathy and support of your Lordships so that these different matters may, at an early date, be properly adjusted, when the supervision of the Board of Trade in matters concerning the safety of life at sea will command much greater confidence than it does at present. I beg to put the Question standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL </member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, the noble Lord alluded to what I said last year in answer to a Question put by himself with regard to the carrying of deck cargoes. I then said that, provided the cargoes were properly stowed, the Board of Trade saw no objection to the practice being continued; and I further stated that the Board of Trade surveyors had power to detain ships which they considered to be improperly loaded. Those were the facts then, and that is the position now. The case of the "Yarmouth," to which the noble Lord has specially called attention, is one of those very sad cases where the ship leaves port and practically nothing more is heard of her except that she does not arrive at her destination. The "Yarmouth" was lost with all hands. An investigation, of course, took place, and it is on the report of the Court of Inquiry that the noble Lord bases his Question. In this case the deck cargoes were loaded at foreign ports, and therefore, as the noble Lord has justly pointed out, it was impossible for any Board of Trade official to interfere with her before she left. But if on arrival
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0601"/>
<col>1153</col>
a ship is found to be improperly loaded I believe that the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act are quite wide enough to enable a prosecution to be instituted against whoever is responsible for it, if that is considered desirable.<lb/>
The noble Lord's Question is, I think, divided into four parts, and I will answer each in order. In the first place, the noble Lord draws attention to the decision of the Court. The decision of the Court was that the "Yarmouth" carried too heavy a deck-load, which led to her taking a heavy list and eventually capsizing, causing the loss of all on board. The report goes on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"The Court strongly condemn the practice of carrying deck cargoes upon structures such as the poop and the forecastle."</quote>
The noble Lord has alluded to certain furniture vans forming part of the cargo. Those vans, I understand, are not quite what I should imagine a furniture van to be&#x2014;a large box on wheels. They are large boxes such as your Lordships are acquainted with in crossing from Dover to Calais, in which luggage is put and which are swung from the truck into the hold of the ship. In this case the vans seem to have been stowed in the well of the ship, and I rather understand from the report that it was certain packages of meat stowed on the poop and forecastle to which the Court alluded in condemning the carrying of loads on those places. Then the noble Lord alludes to the statement made by the principal officer of the Board of Trade at Cardiff. I have a letter from that gentleman in which he states what the nature of his evidence was. He says he stated that it was quite impossible for the Board of Trade surveyors to inspect every vessel, and that, in his opinion, it would be very impolitic to remove responsibility for the efficiency of life-saving appliances from the owner and master. That is, and always has been, the policy of the Board of Trade in this matter. The responsibility of seeing that the ship leaves in a seaworthy condition rests absolutely on the master and the owner, and under Section 457 of the Merchant Shipping Act any person who sends a ship to sea in an unseaworthy condition is liable to prosecution, and, on conviction, to imprisonment with or without hard labour up to two years. The functions of the Board of Trade surveyors are very similar to those of the police.
<col>1154</col>
Their duty is to pay surprise visits to certain ships, and in that way to detect instances where the law is contravened. It would be absolutely unreasonable to expect that policemen should watch outside every house on every night in the year in order to see that burglary did not take place. A certain number of policemen patrol the streets, and very similar duties are carried out by these Board of Trade surveyors. Then the noble Lord asks whether it is intended to increase the number of surveyors. There is no present intention of doing so. According to the view held by the Board of Trade, there are sufficient surveyors to carry out the duties which I have indicated; but, of course, if there was any idea that there was not a sufficient number steps would be at once taken to increase the staff. Finally, the noble Lord asks what has been done in regard to dealing with recognised "systems" of carrying deck-loads. As the noble Lord said, in the case of the Great Eastern Railway Company an undertaking was given to the Court that this would not be done again; and, as I have already stated, the general law seems to be capable of dealing with these cases.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>LORD INVERCLYDE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I had not intended to intervene in this discussion, but the noble Lord, Lord Muskerry, made several sweeping statements which I think ought not to pass unchallenged. I think it was rather unfair to refer to the Board of Trade as being only concerned about collecting their fees, and not about safety of life at sea. It may seem rather strange for a shipowner to be defending the Board of Trade, but I believe they do their duty and that the aspersion of the noble Lord was unjustifiable. The noble Lord stated that hundreds, he might say thousands, of ships sailed out of our ports in the United Kingdom without any inspection whatever by the Board of Trade, and anyone might infer from that statement that these ships never arrive at their destination, whereas ships in the coasting trade almost invariably arrive safely. The noble Lord also spoke of masters and officers of vessels not daring to interfere with the stowage of cargo. I would point out that it is an everyday occurrence for either the master or chief officer to interfere in such matters. The stevedore is bound to follow their orders, and I know for a fact that shipowners welcome any remarks or advice which the masters and officers of their
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0602"/>
<col>1155</col>
ships give in this direction. It is quite a common practice in the coasting trade to carry deck-loads in summer and winter, and it is done with perfect safety. It depends very much upon the design of the vessel. Certain vessels are designed to carry deck-loads, and it is a perfectly legitimate way of carrying cargo. Of course, in some cases, as in the case of the "Yarmouth," accidents have occurred through the stowage not being as it ought to be. But that is the fault of the stowage and not of the system. I merely rose to say these few words because I thought the remarks of the noble Lord ought not to go unchallenged.</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member>: <membercontribution>May I ask the noble Lord who represents the Board of Trade whether the Board are quite satisfied with the action of the owners in this case? It is true that the owners have undertaken not to carry any more deck cargoes, but this ship has been lost with all hands.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, there is one way in which the risk of deck cargoes might be considerably diminished without doing away with them altogether. I suggest as a remedy that the Board of Trade surveyor should survey a ship and then draw up a scheme showing the amount of cargo and also the amount of deck cargo she should be allowed to carry. This might be done once every year or two, instead of surveying the vessel every time she left harbour, and it might be done without greatly increasing the number of Board of Trade surveyors. In the case of this steamer it appears that deck cargo was stowed on the forecastle and poop. How far the forecastle and poop were fitted for carrying cargo we cannot gather, but it is quite impossible to secure deck-loads unless there are solid bolts fixed in the ship's frame. In this case it is worthy of note that the ship was not insured, and so the loss falls on the Great Eastern Railway Company. Their marine superintendent committed a grave error of judgment in permitting the deck-load to be carried as it was carried. I think there ought to be some means whereby the Court could deprive such a superintendent of the power of superintending the embarkation of cargo any more. They ought to compel such a man to change his profession. There is a power in bad cases to deprive a captain of his certificate, and I think a Court of Inquiry should, subject to the right of
<col>1156</col>

appeal, have power to deal in the way I suggest with men who live on shore and direct the loading of ships.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member>: <membercontribution>I will answer the question put to me a moment ago by the noble Earl opposite. Lord Mayo asks, as I understand, whether the Board of Trade intend to institute any prosecution&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member>: <membercontribution>Whether they are satisfied.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member>: <membercontribution>The Board of Trade are, of course, guided by the report of the Court, in which it is stated that&#x2014;

It is definitely stated that blame does not attach to the railway company, and I do not think there is any intention to go beyond that. The noble Lord who has just sat down alluded to the fact that this ship was not insured, and if anything were required to show that a great corporation like the Great Eastern Railway Company would not have neglected any reasonable precautions I think it is afforded by that fact.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SHIPOWNERS.</title>
<p><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to call the attention of the House to the loss of the "Idlewild" of Sunderland, off Portland, on June 30, 1908, to the proceedings at the Court of Inquiry held by the Board of Trade, and to the judgment of the President of the Admiralty Division on an appeal from the findings of the Court of Inquiry; and also to ask His Majesty's Government whether, considering that these Courts of Inquiry already have the power to prevent masters of ships whose incompetence or negligence has been the cause of the loss of a vessel from continuing to exercise their profession, they should not have their powers still further extended so as to be able to deal in a similar manner with the owners of unseaworthy and over-insured ships, and thus be able to prevent such persons from continuing to exercise the profession of shipowner.<lb/>
The "Idlewild" was thirty-seven years
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0603"/>
<col>1157</col>
old. I shall not trouble the House by reading the details of the pecuniary arrangements connected with the ownership of this vessel. It is sufficient for me to say that the Court considered them&#x2014;
<quote>"to be very complicated, and the more so because no books were produced to enable the Court to verify the figures referred to."</quote>
The "Idlewild" was last surveyed for classification in November, 1905. During the remaining years of her life there were no fewer than thirteen entries in her log referring to collisions, groundings, and minor mishaps. The engineers' log contained innumerable entries of trouble in the engine room department. Her plates were so wasted and so thin that in March, 1908, a cork fender burst through the ship's side when she was entering a dock at Methill. In June of the same year the second mate, Guthrie, touched a crack with a closed pocket knife and it went through and let the water in as if it had been a small tap. Guthrie and another man left the ship on June 27 owing, as they said, to her condition. Three days later Guthrie lodged a complaint with the Board of Trade surveyor at Blyth, stating that the vessel was unfit to proceed without serious danger to human life. That very night she went to the bottom in fine weather off the Bill of Portland. The ship's papers were not saved. The Court found that there was no excuse for this, as no difficulty was experienced in getting the boat's sails out of the cabin. The papers might have been got out also. It appears to me that the natural conclusion is that they were purposely left behind.<lb/>
The Court described the "Idlewild" as an old vessel perpetually in debt, and said that nothing but the wasted condition of her plates could satisfactorily account for the damage found at Methill and Pelaw Main. The Court said they felt it their duty to censure the master and chief engineer, and, in the exercise of their discretion as to costs, to order Mr. Alexander and Mr. Wilkinson to make substantial contributions towards the expenses of the inquiry, as they were not altogether satisfied with the manner in which they gave their evidence, particularly as regarded the history of the vessel and the disclosure and production of necessary documents. The Court also intended by their order to impress upon Mr. Alexander and Mr. Wilkinson, as the acting owners and re-
<col>1158</col>
sponsible managers, that it was their paramount duty to maintain the vessel in a state of efficiency, and to see that the lives of the crew were not unnecessarily imperilled. They also said that&#x2014;
<quote>"Blame attaches to Mr. Thomas Norne Alexander and Mr. Cuthbert Wilkinson for not taking adequate means to maintain the vessel in good and seaworthy condition, and the Court orders Mr. Alexander to pay the sum of &#x00A3;50, and Mr. Wilkinson the sum of &#x00A3;25, to the solicitor of the Board of Trade on account of the expenses of this investigation."</quote><lb/>
Mr. Alexander and Mr. Wilkinson appealed against the decision of the Court of Inquiry, and have, by so doing, enabled me to refer to the opinions of Sir John Bigham and Mr. Justice Bargreave Deane. Sir John Bigham said that the survey made by Lloyd's in June, 1908, was a most unsatisfactory survey of a ship with this record. He went on to say that&#x2014;
<quote>"He was of opinion that the 'Idlewild' started in a grossly unseaworthy condition, and that was why she went to the bottom. It was said that Mr. Alexander and Mr. Wilkinson should not have to contribute towards the cost of the inquiry; but the tribunal gave their reasons for their order&#x2014;they were not satisfied with the way these gentlemen gave their evidence. He had no doubt that the tribunal would not have put that finding on record unless they had grounds; and if they were not satisfied with the manner in which the evidence was given, he considered it a good reason why these gentlemen should be ordered to pay part of the costs. Mr. Pollock contended that the order amounted to a finding that the appellants had not discharged their duty, and he argued that they were justified in relying on the survey and classification in 1905 and the report in June, 1908, and that these being satisfactory, all further liability on their part was gone. He (the learned President) thought that the facts which were staring these men in the face ought to have made them question the seaworthiness of the vessel. The cracking and bursting of the plates was quite sufficient to have aroused their attention. The tribunal had dealt tenderly with these two. They had acquitted them of criminal neglect, but had found that they were guilty of carelessness. The appeal would be dismissed with costs."</quote>
Mr. Justice Bargreave Deane agreed with the President of the Court.<lb/>
As regards insurance, the Court of Inquiry said&#x2014;
<quote>"There was no evidence to show the original cost of the vessel, nor her actual value at the time of the casualty. She was in the hands of Mr. T. N. Alexander (Managing Director of the Tyne Dock Engineering Company, Limited) as the first mortgagee in possession, and Mr. Cuthbert, Wilkinson as second mortgagee, by whom she was valued at about &#x00A3;7,000. The vessel was insured for &#x00A3;7,250. In addition, Mr. Alexander
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0604"/>
<col>1159</col>
had a P.P.I. policy for &#x00A3;350, and Mr. Wilkinson a P.P.I. policy for &#x00A3;300,"</quote>
making a total of &#x00A3;7,900. I have been informed, on what I believe to be good authority, that these sums have been paid. A Bill making P.P.I. policies illegal is now before the other House. By it, both parties to a P.P.I. policy are to be liable to six months imprisonment with or without hard labour. In the interests of the lives of seamen I hope that the Bill may become law this year. The only punishments inflicted on the owners of this vessel were fines amounting to &#x00A3;75. Yet if we accept the valuation of one of them&#x2014;the only valuation apparently available&#x2014;that of Mr. Wilkinson, the owners must have made a profit of &#x00A3;900 by the loss of their ship. The President of the Admiralty Court said that the Court of Inquiry had dealt tenderly with these two men&#x2014;far too tenderly in my opinion. I wish that it had been possible to pass a sentence rendering them incapable of acting as owners, managers, surveyors, or in any capacity connected with shipping, and ordering them immediately to dispose of any property or shares they might possess in ships or shipping companies, and declaring that all such property owned by them three months after the date of the sentence should be forfeited to the Crown. The arguments brought forward in favour of the owners made their case much worse. They actually had the audacity to claim that as their ship had passed the surveyors all responsibility on their part was at an end. This theory found no favour from the learned Judges who heard the appeal. If once it is admitted, it means that if a shipowner can succeed in hoodwinking a Board of Trade surveyor his responsibility for the safety of the vessel and the lives of her crew is at an end.<lb/>
The only way to bring home responsibility to such men as managed the "Idle-wild" is to subject them to considerable annoyance and pecuniary loss whenever they neglect their obvious duties to ship and crew. I consider that the infliction of severe punishment on incapable shipowners is far more likely to conduce to the safety of ships and their crews than the employment of an army of surveyors, whose continual interference with shipping would act as a check to trade and inconvenience owners of high character and standing. I believe that the vast majority of the ship-
<col>1160</col>
owning community would prefer such a method of getting rid of their black sheep to increased restrictions on the management of shipping. The Courts of Inquiry have the power of preventing a master of a ship from continuing to exercise his profession. I cannot see any reason why men who live on shore should be treated differently whenever a disaster occurs which has been caused by their carelessness or misconduct, especially when dealing with fully-insured or over-insured vessels. Barristers, solicitors, physicians, and men belonging to many other professions can be deprived of the right to exercise their profession by means in accordance with the law, and I think that shipowners should be placed on a similar footing.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>LORD HAMILTON OF DALZELL</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I am very glad to hear that we are to have the noble Lord's good wishes for the P.P.I. Bill when it arrives in your Lordships' House. I can assure him that my right hon. friend is using every endeavour to push it on as fast as possible. The loss of the "Idlewild" is another case which has been investigated by a Court of Inquiry. Fortunately in this case no lives were lost. The noble Lord will have seen that the Court stated that, in all the circumstances, they did not feel justified in finding that the owners knowingly allowed the vessel to go to sea in an unseaworthy condition, but they blamed the mortgagees and acting owners for not taking active measures to maintain the ship in a good seaworthy condition. That was the finding of the Court, and by that finding the owners received what I might be allowed to describe as a coating of rather diluted whitewash. The circumstances of the case do justify the noble Lord in bringing the matter forward, and I have only to say about it that the Board of Trade are still making investigations, and should any further evidence of an important nature come to light there is no reason why the matter should not be recommitted to the Court to be reheard. If evidence of that sort does come to light I am quite certain that that will be done. Then the noble Lord made the suggestion that the same law should be served out to the owner of a ship as to the master. At first sight it does seem as if there is a good deal to be said for that. I stated the law on the subject just now. Any owner who knowingly sends a ship to sea in an unseaworthy condition may be sent to prison,
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0605"/>
<col>1161</col>
with or without hard labour, for two years, and in the opinion of the Board of Trade that is a sufficient deterrent. If the law as it stands should not prove a sufficient deterrent, the Board of Trade would be ready to introduce legislation making the penalty more severe; but I do not think that that penalty would take the form suggested by the noble Lord, because there are practical difficulties in the way of carrying it out. In the case of a master or any other officer of a ship who has a certificate you can, of course, withdraw that certificate. The matter is a simple one; but, in the case of an owner, I do not know how it would be possible to carry out the noble Lord's suggestion. But I can assure him that if anything of the sort is found necessary the Board of Trade will act very quickly in asking Parliament to pass further legislation.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ST. HELENA.</title>
<p><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I rise to ask whether, as St. Helena has been given up as a coaling station, and as His Majesty's troops have been removed from that island, His Majesty's Government will facilitate the sale and exportation of cattle, which the inhabitants of the island were encouraged to breed and keep, in order that the land now occupied by these cattle may be made available for the growing of <i>phormium tenax</i>, or New Zealand flax, which at present is grown on the island, and is a source of revenue to the inhabitants.
<col>1162</col>
I have been asked to put this Question by the captain of the ship I came home in the other day, and who is an inhabitant of the island. When the Boer prisoners left and the troops were withdrawn the inhabitants naturally suffered, because they had been making money supplying provisions and catching fish for the large number of people who were there. It has been said that the island has been given up entirely to rats and disappointed islanders, but that is a very pessimistic view to take of St. Helena. I am told it is not so bad as that. The Government encouraged the inhabitants of the island to breed and keep cattle for the convenience of the troops and the Boer prisoners, and therefore it is thought only fair that the Government should assist the islanders in disposing of their cattle so that the land now occupied by the cattle may be used to grow New Zealand flax. They grow phormium already, and it is a very valuable export. I therefore hope His Majesty's Government will look with some kindness on these people, who have, so to speak, been left in the lurch. I do not myself know whether these islanders are industrious. I have heard it said that they are not; but I think they would become industrious if the sale and exportation of the cattle were facilitated so that they could develop the industry to which I have referred, and which has already been established on a small scale on the island.</membercontribution></p>
<p>*<member>THE EARL OF CREWE</member>: <membercontribution>My Lords, I have to thank the noble Earl for postponing his Question from yesterday, and I will endeavour to answer briefly the points which he has raised. St. Helena has been for some time past a source of anxiety. As the noble Earl has pointed out, the removal of the garrison and the fact that the Boer prisoners did not remain there seriously affected the material interests of the islanders. So far as the removal of the garrison is concerned, that, of course, is an unfortunate fate which happens to various Colonial possessions. St. Helena is not the only victim of a change of military policy. There are others, such as St. Lucia in the West Indies, upon whom a change of that kind has fallen with still greater severity. But the fact undoubtedly remains that the position, of St. Helena is such as to arouse sympathy, and such as to make the Government wish to do everything they can to alleviate it. St. Helena consists of 28,800 acres, and of that area some 20,000
<image src="S5LV0001P0I0606"/>
<col>1163</col>
are described as being altogether unfit for agricultural operations. But there is some land which can be profitably used. As regards what the noble Earl said of the invitation to invest in cattle on behalf of the Government, what happened was this. In 1898 it was pointed out that there was a probability of the garrison being increased, and the farmers who had at that time a considerable stock of cattle went to some little expense in buying breeding stock of an improved kind in order to better their herds. As a consequence of that, during the time that the prisoners were there and while the garrison was maintained they must have made considerable profits. I do not think it is quite fair to argue from that that a permanent obligation can be said to rest on His Majesty's Government, now that the policy of keeping the garrison there has been changed, to dispose of this stock in the interests of the farmers. At the same time, the Government have been anxious to help the farmers, if possible, to get rid of the cattle; and in March of this year the suggestion was made that the Admiralty would buy 200 of them at contract prices for use at the Cape, and the Cape Government agreed to dispense with the duty which would, in the ordinary course, be charged upon them. That, unfortunately, fell through, as I understand, on the question of price; but I shall be quite willing to represent to the Board of Admiralty that a renewal of that offer might be made, and I understand they would be willing to make it provided it was possible to do it on reasonable terms. Beyond that, I am afraid, at
<col>1164</col>
this moment I cannot go. It is true that the flax industry is one to which we look for some improvement in the condition of St. Helena. There are rather over 450 acres under flax at this moment, but I do not think there is any evidence that there is land occupied by cattle which would be immediately devoted to flax growing if the cattle were removed. It is not the case that the whole of this stock of 1,200 cattle is in the hands of very poor people. Some part of it is in the hands of business firms, who are, I should hope, well off, and therefore not exactly in a condition to make an appeal <i>ad misericordium</i>. But I can assure the noble Earl that the state of affairs of St. Helena is continually before my mind, and if I can help in this matter I shall be glad to do so.</membercontribution></p>
