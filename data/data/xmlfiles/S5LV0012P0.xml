<title>TRIBUTES TO EARL LOREBURN.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00144"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships will have seen in the public Press some account of the regrettable circumstances which have deprived the Government of the services of their Lord Chancellor&#x2014;circumstances, I am certain, regretted by no one more deeply than by my noble and learned friend who has taken his place on the Woolsack. Lord Loreburn's doctors had warned him that it was impossible for him to continue the heavy labours and anxieties inseparable from the office of Lord Chancellor without grave risk to his health, and they advised that he ought to resign immediately and take a thorough rest for a time from all business. Lord Loreburn has asked me to say that he resigns the Great Seal on that ground, and on that ground alone, and he specially begged me to convey to the House his most deep gratitude for the uniform kindness which he has received
<col>6</col>
at its hands for more than six and a-half years. Lord Loreburn was in some doubt as to whether he ought not to show his respect for your Lordships' House by coming here himself and saying a word of farewell; but I ventured to assure him that the House would deeply regret if he was to run any risk of the kind, having been warned, as he has, against all exertion, because we should be sure that in saying anything of the kind, Lord Loreburn's feelings would have been most deeply involved. I am sure, my Lords, although we on this side of the House are in a small minority of your total number, that I am right in saying that regret at the absence of Lord. Loreburn's familiar figure and at its cause is by no means confined to noble Lords who sit on this side. I think, my Lords, that even those who had traced with great admiration the career of my noble and learned friend in another place would hardly have ventured to foretell how soon and how completely on coming here as Lord Chancellor he would win both the confidence and the regard of this House as a whole. We all knew that Lord Loreburn was a thoroughly good Party man. We all knew that he held his political principles with something approaching to religious fervour. We knew, too, his deep capacity for moral indignation at anything which he considered mean or wrong. Perhaps his possession of those very qualities might conceivably have created doubt in the minds of some whether on being suddenly cast into the middle of a critical Assembly such as this, with all its ancient traditions, Lord Loreburn would hold, as I venture to think he did, an equal balance between both sides, without, of course, ever in any degree hiding the strength of his own views on debatable subjects. It might have been doubted, I think, whether he would have been entirely able, as I may claim Lord Loreburn was, to estimate the meaning and strength of the position which his opponents might take up on any particular question. I believe my noble and learned friend succeeded entirely in winning not merely the respect but in a great measure the affection of the House as a whole. We all regarded him, I think, in the words of the familiar quotation, as
<quote>justissimus unus</quote>
<quote>Qui fuit in Teucris, et servantissimus &#x00E6;qui,</quote>
because I am confident that the recollection of Lord Loreburn's Lord Chancellorship will be that of a thoroughly just and
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0008"/>
<col>7</col>
fair-minded man. I am perfectly certain, too, my Lords, that the whole House will trust that during his retirement from political activity, which we hope may be only temporary, he will find some work to do which may be of interest to himself and which we may be certain will be fruitful and serviceable to his fellow-countrymen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00145"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the reception which has been given on both sides to the remarks of the noble Marquess must have proved to him how completely we are at one with him in his estimate of the loss which this House has sustained by Lord Loreburn's retirement. The programme of this evening's proceedings promised to be a somewhat uneventful one, but it has brought us face to face with one of those personal changes which count for so much in our political life and which affect us so closely. We were all of us aware that Lord Loreburn was suffering from the heavy strain of the numerous official duties which he had to perform, but I do not think that any of us quite realised how much that strain had told upon him. He leaves office amidst the universal regret of all who have had to do with him, and we cordially join with the noble Marquess in the hope that the relief which he will obtain from official work will bring about a restoration of his health and enable him to take a not infrequent part in our proceedings. But the Woolsack will know him no more. It is for others to speak of the public services which he has rendered as a Minister, as a Judge, as the head of the legal profession. We think of him rather as we knew him in the capacity of Speaker of this House. It is no exaggeration to say that from the date when he came to us as a stranger, having, perhaps, one would have thought, not very much in common with most of us, he at once established a hold which he never lost upon the respect and, if I may borrow the expression of the noble Marquess, upon the affection of your Lordships' House. It was often our business on these Benches to differ from Lord Loreburn. Our standpoint was often quite another standpoint than his, but I can remember no occasion upon which Lord Loreburn did not meet us courteously and considerately, and upon which he did not show a desire to understand and to give due weight to our arguments, or on which he did not leave upon those who listened to him an impression
<col>8</col>
of the complete sincerity of his convictions. The noble Marquess spoke of Lord Lore-burn's occasional fervour. We always felt that it was not a simulated or histrionic fervour, but that it represented genuine and sincere emotion, which he felt very deeply indeed. May I be permitted to add that I think the noble Marquess was amply justified in advising Lord Loreburn to abstain from imposing upon himself the ordeal&#x2014;for it would have been an ordeal to him&#x2014;of coming here to take leave of the House under such painful circumstances. One word more with regard to Lord Loreburn. Those of your Lordships who have the honour of holding the position of Lord Lieutenant of a county have every reason to look back with gratitude to the assistance which Lord Loreburn gave us in the important and difficult matter of the appointment of Justices of the Peace, and we shall always remember with admiration the determined manlier in which he set his face against the attempt to connect appointments to the local Benches with Party politics. If Lord Loreburn had done nothing else, I think for that alone he deserves the gratitude of this House. We can all of us wish for nothing better than that Lord Loreburn should carry with him into his retirement as kindly a recollection of this House as that which we shall preserve of him during the years of his official connection with us.<lb/>
Before I sit down may I be allowed to offer to the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, our congratulations upon his accession to an office which must, I think, have seemed to him the natural goal of his aspirations. The noble Marquess ventured upon a Latin expression. May I follow suit and say that there never was a happier illustration of the saying <i>Cedant arma tog&#x0153;.</i> We all appreciated the untiring energy which the noble Viscount showed while he was in charge of one of the most onerous, and I am almost tempted to add one of the most thankless, portfolios in the Government, and we may be permitted to wish for him that the work which he did as Secretary of State for War&#x2014;and unquestionably he did much hard and holiest work&#x2014;may last, and that in that respect he may be more fortunate than some of those who preceded him. And perhaps most of all may we congratulate the noble Viscount upon his success, if I may use a military simile, in entrenching himself in a position where he will no longer be
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0009"/>
<col>9</col>
exposed to the constant sharp-shooting which he experienced so frequently from the Benches on this side of the House&#x2014;attacks to which he never failed to respond with an amount of dexterity and resourcefulness which elicited our genuine admiration. We feel confident that as Speaker of this House the noble Viscount will in no respect fall behind the example set him by his illustrious predecessor.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00146"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it would not be natural were I not to desire to acid something to what has been said by the two noble Marquesses, but my words shall he very few. I have had the privilege, the infinite privilege, of intimate friendship with Lord Loreburn, and no man realises more than I do or has better ground for knowing the strong moral character of Lord Loreburn and the combination of qualities which have made him the personality he is. I only wish to say that the feeling which is uppermost, with me just now is a sense of the difficulty of following adequately in his footsteps.</membercontribution></p>

<title>IRISH CREAMERIES AND DAIRY<lb/> PRODUCE BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00149" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00150">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00151"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Bill the Second Reading of which I have the honour to move to-day is based upon the Report of a Departmental Committee of the Board of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland, and it gives effect to certain recommendations made by that Committee in the year 1910 on the question of the Irish butter industry. I do not think it is necessary for me to dwell upon the importance of the butter industry to
<col>10</col>
Ireland. Many of your Lordships, at any rate those who come from Ireland, will recognise the important character of this branch of agriculture in Ireland. But I may say that there are in Ireland at the present moment no fewer than 700 creamery businesses and 164 butter factories. The importance of the industry has been recognised by the Board of Agriculture, and they have dairy inspectors who visit the creameries and give scientific instruction; they also have an instructional station at Ballyhaise, and in many counties itinerant instructors are employed to teach farmers the art of butter making. There is no doubt that the butter industry is a very important one to Ireland.<lb/>
Owing to a great, extent, I imagine, to the exertions of the Department, Irish butter enjoys a high reputation for excellence, but its very excellence has been in some respects, as it were, a snare to the industry, because Irish creamery butter has been subjected to ninny fraudulent imitations. The result is that the reputation of Irish butter has suffered, and it is, I am sorry to say, regarded in the British market with some suspicion. In that connection there are some rather significant figures. In the quinquennial period ended in 1907 the export of Irish butter fell from 818,000 cwt. to 688,000 cwt., or in value from &#x00A3;4,000,000 to &#x00A3;3,670,000. There is in these figures some indication that owing to fraudulent imitation of Irish creamery butter its character and reputation have suffered in the English market. It is with a view to restoring Irish creamery butter to the position which it ought to enjoy and to preventing these frauds that this Bill is introduced. Of the figure of 688,000 cwt. which I gave a moment ago no less than 500,000 cwt. is Irish creamery butter.<lb/>
I think it would be as well that I should state exactly what "creamery butter" is, and I will quote the words in the Report of the Departmental Committee. Creamery butter is&#x2014;
<quote>"Unblended butter made from cream separated by centrifugal force from the commingled milk supplies of a number of cowkeepers, in premises adapted and utilised for the manufacture of butter in commercial quantities."</quote>
That is the description of "creamery butter" which the Committee adopted after consulting the trade both in Ireland and in England, and it is, I think, adequate
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0010"/>
<col>11</col>
and covers the whole ground. Creamery butter is defined as superior to any other kind of butter. Here, again, I will quote from the Report of the Departmental Committee&#x2014;
<quote>"The superiority of this class of butter has now been well established in the markets, not only in the case of butter from Ireland, but also in the case of butter exported from other countries."</quote>
This is the modern scientific method of making butter, and the one from which the best results are secured. Indeed, it is the system which prevails generally all over the Continent and almost universally in England. But in Ireland, side by side with the development of this scientific butter making, there exists the old method of making what is called "farmers' butter"&#x2014;namely, churning it in the ordinary old-fashioned way. This butter is almost invariably of an inferior quality to creamery butter, but unfortunately it is sold in many cases as creamery butter, with the result that the proper Irish creamery butter has been brought into disrepute. This is one difficulty with which the industry has had to contend.<lb/>
There is another difficulty, and it arises from the fact that the practice of winter dairying is practically unknown in Ireland, with the result that the cream separating stations find great difficulty in getting any quantity, if indeed any cream at all, for the purpose of their factories in the winter, and they have adopted in some cases the unfortunate habit of importing foreign butter and sending it to the market as if it were creamery butter. The difficulty with regard to this matter arises from the fact that there is no statutory definition of Irish creamery butter. Consequently, although these frauds can often be detected, and I believe there have been prosecutions under the Merchandise Marks Act, the prosecutions have failed from the want of a statutory definition. The object of this Bill is, in the first place, to give a statutory definition to Irish creamery butter; in the second place, to prevent the fraudulent sale of inferior butter as creamery butter; and, in the third place, to enact provisions for the inspection of creameries by the Board of Agriculture. There is a further provision, to which I must also make allusion, which is equally important in this connection&#x2014;the provision penalising the knowing supply of unclean milk and unclean butter. Those are the objects of the Bill.<lb/>
<col>12</col>
Now a word with regard to the methods of the Bill. Clause 1 gives a statutory definition to the term "creamery." By subsection (1) the term "creamery" is made a trade description applicable, in the case of Irish butter, to such butter only as has been manufactured in a creamery registered under this Bill, and has not subsequently been blended or re-worked; and the application of the term to any other butter is made a false trade description within the meaning of the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887, and such offenders are subjected to the penalties of that Act. In Clause 2 powers are taken to register creameries. These premises will be registered by the Board of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland as creameries or cream-separating stations. In Clause 3 are described what premises are capable of being registered as such, and your Lordships will observe that one of the provisions is that the creamery should manufacture butter in what is called "commercial quantities"&#x2014;that is, not less than 56 lbs. per day. We have taken the figure of 56 lbs. because it is regarded in the trade as the commercial unit, and it is impossible with smaller quantities to ensure the quality of the butter being maintained. We have excluded from registration such premises as fall under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1907. That provision applies to margarine factories and such like enterprises. It was felt to be impossible to include a business which carried on the manufacture of margarine, because fraud could not be detected if the premises were registered both as a creamery and also for the purpose of making margarine and other inferior butter material. Then in Clause 4 there are certain conditions as to registration which affect the position, structure and mechanical equipment of the premises. These provisions are inserted with a view to ensuring cleanliness and proper conditions. In the second subsection of this clause there is a saving with regard to creameries which existed before 1910, so that under any circumstances they will have a right to be registered. In Clause 5 are laid down certain regulations with regard to the creameries. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) requires that the milk must be separated by means of centrifugal force applied by mechanical power; and in paragraph (<i>b</i>) there are provisions requiring wrappers on every package indicating exactly what the butter is.</membercontribution></p>

<col>13</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00152"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: I should like to ask a question with regard to paragraph (<i>b</i>). There is a provision that if the butter is not so manufactured the package containing the butter shall be marked with words indicating distinctly that the butter is not creamery butter, or, in the case of British, Colonial, or foreign butter, that the butter is not of Irish manufacture. Does that mean that all butter of Irish manufacture must be labelled?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00153"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASIIBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: The provision means exactly what it says. I do not see any difficulty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00154"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: English butter is to be labelled English butter, and Colonial butter is to be labelled Colonial butter. Must all butter of Irish manufacture be labelled also?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00155"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: This only applies to Irish butter coming from creameries. In the case of creameries sending out butter which is British or Colonial they must state on the wrapper that the butter is not of Irish manufacture. That is all. I do not think there is any pitfall in that. It is a simple provision. The next point of importance is the question of appeal. Your Lordships will observe in Clause 9 that although the Department is responsible for the granting or withholding of licences&#x2014;that is to say, registering or declining to register&#x2014;yet any person aggrieved by a refusal of the Department to register premises may appeal from that decision to the County Court, and there is a further appeal to the Judge of Assize; so that no individual can suffer any grievance or assert that he has been unfairly treated, or that the Department has not sufficiently considered his claim to be registered. I think this provision gives ample safeguard.<lb/>
Clauses 11 and 12 deal with the supply of unclean milk and unclean butter. Your Lordships will readily see that if unclean milk is supplied it obviously contaminates the whole of the butter manufactured on that occasion, and I think it is only right that people who knowingly supply unclean milk should be penalised. This Bill makes it an offence, and subjects the persons concerned to certain penalties, and the same is the case with regard to the supply of unclean butter. Powers of inspection are taken under Clause 13. They are the
<col>14</col>
usual powers, but there is a further power in subsection (2). This subsection gives the Department the right to enter other premises than those of a creamery if they have reason to believe that fraudulent practices are going on there, and consequently gives them a chance of detecting that malpractice. Those are the main provisions of the Bill, and I hope it will commend itself to your Lordships. It is promoted solely in the interests of the Irish butter making industry. It is admitted, I think, on all hands that the Bill is necessary, that without it Irish butter is likely to suffer in the English market, and that the Bill, which in effect brings creamery butter within the definition of the Merchandise Marks Act, will have the desired effect. We shall, of course, be quite prepared to consider in Committee any reasonable Amendments which noble Lords may care to move, but I hope that the general principle of the Bill will commend itself to your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00156">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Ashby St. Ledgers.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00157"><member>LORD O'HAGAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are one or two points which seem to me of considerable importance, not merely to those interested in dairying in Ireland, but also to those interested in the dairy industry in Great Britain. I think your Lordships will agree that if this Bill could be brought into effect it would be of undoubted benefit to the butter trade. Doubtless the provision for the prevention of fraud will do much to prevent fraud, and as a whole I think there can be little doubt that it will protect the public against unwholesome dairy produce, at any rate so far as Ireland is concerned. But I should like to ask the noble Lord in charge of the Bill why the Bill is limited in scope to Ireland. It seems to me that the Bill sets up practically a trade mark for Irish creamery butter. In fact, it hall-marks that butter. It gives a guarantee for the purity of the butter and also secures that its manufacture should be under proper sanitary conditions, and so far as that is concerned, I am sure everybody will welcome the introduction of the Bill.<lb/>
But, with regard to that, I should like to ask whether as a result of this hall-marking, as it practically amounts to, a really undue advertisement will not be
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0012"/>
<col>15</col>
given to Irish creamery butter and a distinct preference in the markets of Great Britain. It seems to me that this might act unfairly on English butter producers, and I fail to see why you cannot, by some modification, secure that this same protection as to the purity of the butter should be given as far as English and Scottish butter is concerned. It has been brought to my notice that the Butter Act which was passed by the present Government applied not only to Ireland but also to England and Scotland, and I should like to know why this Bill should not be extended to cover both England and Scotland. It may possibly be urged&#x2014;and the figures given by the noble Lord confirm it&#x2014;that there is more co-operative dairying in Ireland than there is in England, and that there is more need for this Bill there. At the same time, we must not overlook the land policy of His Majesty's Government. They have repeatedly announced their intention of assisting agricultural co-operation to the best of their ability; they have given grants in that direction, and have spoken of assisting land banks and so on. Surely creamery co-operation would be most valuable for the smallholders in those colonies which' the Board of Agriculture, through the Small Holdings Commissioners, hope to see formed in this country.<lb/>
Clause 4 of this Bill, which deals with the conditions of registration, is doubtless most valuable from the point of view of the public health, but I fail to see why the public should not have the same protection in respect to existing creameries in England or those to be created in the future. Then as to paragraph (<i>b</i>) in Clause 5, to which Lord Mayo made allusion, it seems to me that one interpretation of it distinctly leads to the conclusion that it gives to Irish creamery butter a very special advantage in English and Scottish markets. If that is not so, I should like to ask what is the object of that paragraph. Clauses 11, 12 and 13, which deal with unclean milk, unclean butter, powers of inspection, and so on, are obviously most useful in the interests of the purity of the butter and the protection of the public, but why under like conditions cannot the same principles be applied to British creameries? I, for one, fully realise the importance of the Irish agricultural industry. We all, I think, in this House realise its importance, and welcome any
<col>16</col>
effort in legislation which would give encouragement to those interested in agriculture in Ireland. But it seems to me that in endeavouring to do the right thing by Ireland you run the risk of doing at any rate a certain, perhaps a considerable, amount of injury to the dairy farming industry in this country. As long as we have one Parliament for the United Kingdom, we should, in my opinion, have common legislation on such questions as this, at any rate where the relative interests of these kinds of trades in the different parts of the kingdom seem of equal importance one with the other. The noble Lord in charge of the Bill said that the Bill was introduced solely in the interests of the Irish creamery butter industry. I am sure we all agree with that. My only fear is that, instead of being merely in the interests of Irish creamery butter, it may be in the interests of Irish creamery butter at the expense of the English butter industry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00158"><member>LORD PLUNKET</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in rising to say a few words in this debate, I do so as a member of the Committee of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, which, as many of your Lordships are aware, was the originator and is the adviser and representative of the co-operative creameries of Ireland, of which there are now some 400, responsible for more than half the creamery butter which is made in that country, their turnover being something like &#x00A3;2,000,000 per year. The noble Lord who has just spoken complained that this Bill does not apply to the United Kingdom, and I suppose the answer to that is that our Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction and our voluntary associations are very much better managed in Ireland than is the case in England. My Committee share the views of His Majesty's Government and of the Irish Department of Agriculture, that legislation is required to regulate the manufacture of dairy produce in Ireland and to protect the sale of Trish creamery butter. We have to thank the Irish Department for the opportunities they have given us of seeing this Bill from the time of its birth&#x2014;when I can assure your Lordships it was not at all a promising infant&#x2014;until the present stage of its existence, a period during which it has been greatly improved. We therefore hope that your Lordships will give the Bill a Second Reading to-day.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0013"/>
<col>17</col>
I must, however, guard myself by stating that there are, in our opinion, grave objections to some of the provisions in the Bill and when the Committee stage is reached we&#x2014;that is, the Agricultural Organisation Society and those who think with it&#x2014;will have sonic important Amendments to lay before your Lordships, without which I venture to think the Bill should not be allowed to go further. These Amendments have already been placed before the Vice-President and the members of the Department, and though the Vice-President has been able to meet us upon sonic of the points, there are still a certain number upon which I am sorry to say we have not yet been able to come to agreement. I earnestly trust that we may be able to come to such an agreement during the progress of the Bill through this House, because in these moments of heroic legislation and social cataclysms elsewhere I fear that it would be impossible to hope that the Bill could receive much attention in another place. Indeed, I presume that its only chance of passing through the House of Commons would be if it were accepted as a non-contentious measure&#x2014;a description which in its present form the dairy farmers of Ireland, whether they be co-operative or not, could not admit for a moment as being correct. In the hope that in Committee we may be able to obtain assistance in the direction of altering the Bill as is desired by the cooperative associations, I for one am ready to vote for the Second Reading to-day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00159"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am delighted that such a Bill as this has been brought in, for at length we see a prospect of Trish creamery butter being properly hall-marked in the markets on this side of the water. I was rather astonished that the noble Lord, Lord O'Hagan, found fault with the Bill on the ground that it did not apply to England. I think the answer to that is that English creamery owners are quite able to take care of themselves in regard to this matter. In my opinion one of the most important provisions in the Bill is that dealing with the supply of unclean and contaminated milk, and making persons who are guilty of the offence of knowingly supplying or knowingly accepting unclean milk liable to penalties, for we know that one of the causes of tuberculosis is the use of unclean and contaminated milk in the making of butter. I should like to ask the noble
<col>18</col>
Lord opposite to explain subsection (2) of Clause 12, which runs&#x2014;
<quote>"If any unclean butter is found in a butter factory or margarine factory in Ireland, the occupier of the factory shall be guilty of an offence under this Act, unless be proves to the satisfaction of the Court that the butter was not intended to be blended, re-worked, or treated is the factory."</quote>
Surely if unclean butter is found in a butter or margarine factory the person concerned ought to be punished for having it in his factory. Persons are to be liable to punishment for knowingly supplying or accepting unclean milk, and I cannot see why the occupier of a factory should not be punished if unclean butter is found in his factory. I hope that the Bill will become law, and I trust that the Amendments which will be submitted will not be so difficult of acceptance by the Government that the Bill will be dropped, because it is of great importance that the Bill should be passed in view of the fact that, owing to the practices to which Lord Ashby St. Ledgers referred, the sales of Irish creamery butter have gone down. It must be 'remembered that this is one of our most important industries. Although Lord Ashby St. Ledgers gave credit to the Department, he did not give credit to Sir Horace Plunket and his workers for having started these creameries. He gave every praise to the Department for their work in this matter, but I should have liked to hear a word from him in praise of the work of Sir Horace Plunket. As I have said, I hope the Bill will become law, and that the Amendments which will be moved will be tendered in a manner and in a form that may be acceptable to the Government, because we badly want this Bill in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00160"><member>LORD PLUNKET</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to make a personal explanation. I did not hear Lord Ashby St. Ledgers say that the production of Irish butter had gone down. If he did say so, the statement should not be allowed to go without an answer. I will not venture to say more than that such a statement, if it were made, is entirely a mistake. The fact is that our own creameries five years ago were getting 100&#x00B7;8 for their butter; they are now getting 107&#x00B7;5; and their increase in output for the period is 25 per cent. I think the explanation of the reduction in the export of Irish creamery butter is to be found in the fact that very much more creamery butter is now consumed in Ireland than was consumed there before.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00161"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no doubt that this Bill will be accorded a Second Reading, and I should be very sorry if it were not so. I am sure that the objects of the Bill are good, and that it will have the effect, when passed&#x2014;as I hope it will be, possibly in an amended shape&#x2014;of improving the Irish butter industry. Irish butter is about as good butter as you can find in any part of the globe. I am an Irishman, and am entitled to make that statement. I was greatly amused at hearing one of my noble friends allude to-day to a possible non-contentious Irish Bill. That would be rather a novelty. I would be glad myself to sec occasionally an Irish Bill which was unopposed. The Department of Agriculture have made amendments and changes in this Bill in deference to opinions that have been expressed, but any one who has read the criticisms of the Bill and also the proceedings of the deputation received by the head of the Department will see that there are matters still in controversy. Those matters may be dealt with in the form of Amendments, and when the Amendments are put down I have every hope that they will be reasonably and fairly considered and that there will be every desire to meet them, so that the Bill may leave this House in a shape which will be likely to make it acceptable when it goes elsewhere.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00166"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I was only quoting Dr. Johnson, the noble and learned Lord will remember. I am sure that my noble friend in charge of the Bill has a right to be gratified at the general reception with which this Bill has met, and he will. I am certain, particularly appreciate the observation of the noble Earl on the second Bench opposite (Lord Mayo), who said he trusted that such Amendments as noble Lords might place on the Paper would not be of a character which it would be impossible for the Government to accept, and which therefore might possibly imperil the passing of the Bill. I trust that there is no probability that any attempt will be made to subvert in any degree the principle of the Bill. I entirely agree that this creamery industry&#x2014;as to which, as the noble Earl opposite has said, great credit is due to Sir Horace Plunket for his unwearying exertions in former years&#x2014;is one which it is worth while to make every effort to support and to extend. The noble Lord opposite asked how it is that this is not made a general Bill applying to the United Kingdom as a whole rather than to Ireland only. I take it that the answer to that is that the particular grievances and difficulties which this Bill is intended to meet&#x2014;namely, that of the lowering of the standard of creamery butter by either blending with it inferior forms of butter, or of selling in the winter farmers' butter as creamery butter&#x2014;do not exist, or if they exist at all exist to a very small extent, in England. What may be the case in Scotland I do not know, but I have no doubt there are noble Lords opposite who can tell us. But if a case could be made for the extension of this principle to other parts of the United Kingdom there is no reason why the scope of the Bill, or at any rate the scope of the legislation, should not be enlarged in that direction. The criticisms which have been made on certain points of the Bill will, of course, receive close attention from my noble friend behind me when the Bill comes into Committee, and I can say on behalf of the Government that every effort will be made from this side to meet any reasonable objection which can be brought against any of the provisions in the Bill, provided&#x2014;and I think this is important&#x2014;that the safeguards which the Bill offers are in no way materially weakened.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00167"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not desire to delay the Second Reading of the Bill for a moment. I think there is a general concurrence both ns to the importance of the Irish creamery industry and as to the necessity of placing it under somewhat strict regulations if it is really to flourish and if a high standard of excellence is to be maintained for the product of Irish dairies. Those regulations will, of course, in the first instance press somewhat severely upon parties who have not been used to them. I therefore rather welcome the provision, which I find in Clause 4, under which creameries which were going concerns in the year 1910 are given until 1916 to set their house in order. I do not think four years is at all too long when you come to requiring these people to put up new plant and equipment, but I must say four years seems a considerable period of grace when you conic to such matters as the removal of cesspools, manure heaps, pigsties, and so forth, or when you come to the condition that the premises and plant are to be kept in a state of cleanliness and repair. I do not think the parties in charge of a creamery are entitled to a period so long as four years in which to set their house in order in those modest respects.

I will not press the noble Lord for an answer now, but I dare say he will consider the point before we reach the Committee stage.</membercontribution></p>

It was the export of Irish butter which had fallen in the quinquennial period. With regard to the points which the noble Marquess and others have raised, I will give them my best consideration. I think the suggestion made by the noble Marquess seems a reasonable one. I do not know why the regulations should not be relaxed in some particulars only in respect of existing creameries.</membercontribution></p>

<title>NATIONAL INSURANCE&#x2014;MOTION FOR<lb/> POSTPONEMENT.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00199"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member> rose to call attention to the unsatisfactory position of the National Insurance Act, 1911, and the profound ignorance which prevails throughout the country in regard to the interpretation, policy, and provisions of the Act, especially amongst the agricultural labourers and domestic servants in the rural parishes; and to move&#x2014;
<quote>"That it is most essential, in the interest of all those affected by its provisions as well as of the taxpayers and ratepayers of England, that the operation of the Act should be postponed by a Privy Council Order under the powers given in the Act until January 1, 1913, in order to give sufficient time for the Official Commissioners to understand and explain its provisions, and, if necessary, to suggest such amendments as will render the Act workable and really beneficial as a scheme of National Insurance."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00200">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I placed this Motion on the Paper six weeks ago in the hope that I would be able to bring it on before the Whitsuntide holiday, but unfortunately, owing to the adjournment, I was obliged to put it off, and I have taken the first day I could after the House resumed. As far as I am concerned I am content that the Motion should have been adjourned, because I am the more convinced every day that the object which I have in view is perfectly right. All that has happened since I put the Motion down shows what a great advantage it would be to the Act, owing to the way in which it has been altered and revised by the Commissioners, if its operation were postponed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00201">I think the Resolution speaks for itself, and I shall not detain your Lordships with many words on the Insurance Act of last year. It is common knowledge that it was introduced without any mandate from the country and without any consultation with those principally concerned in the working of it&#x2014;the friendly societies and the medical men. It is admitted now to have been introduced with no sufficient care in preparation and drafting, and it was in this state that it was hurried through the House of Commons by means of the guillotine and the closure without reasonable or fair discussion. I am told that forty-nine clauses were not discussed at all in Parliament. But during the progress of the Bill clauses were inserted setting up a Commission with entirely novel and unprecedented powers to revise, amend, and
<col>28</col>
alter the Bill in almost every particular. The consequence is that at the present moment we have not only to try and digest what is before us in the Act itself, but what is practically in many respects an entirely new Act. And I believe that this week there have been issued by the Insurance Commissioners 20,000,000 copies of Provisional Orders&#x2014;Provisional Orders which may be altered at any time. I would remind your Lordships how different was the procedure adopted by German statesmen in regard to their measure of this kind. They took five years to prepare the Bill in consultation with everybody who would be interested, and they gave the German Parliament two years in which to thoroughly debate the details of the Bill. Our National Insurance Bill only saw the light a year ago, and we are asked to put it into force within fifteen months of the first being known about it at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00202">In addition to the clauses setting up this Commission with the enormous powers to which I have referred, a proviso was inserted in the last clause of the Bill to the effect that&#x2014;
<quote>"His Majesty in Council may, should necessity arise, substitute some date or dates not being later than the 1st January, 1913, as respects the provisions of this Act relating to health insurance."</quote>
I assert that the necessity has now arisen. I would call your Lordships' attention to another fact. In the National Insurance Act which became law in December last it was provided that there should be six months before the Act came into operation, in order that it might be fully known and in order that plenty of time might be given to the Commissioners to amend and revise it. That is, in my opinion, a considerable fact in this discussion, because we shall have to see how far this six months has been made use of in any way. The Act itself is practically a legislative contract between Parliament and the contributors under the Act. Employers and employ&#x00E9;s are compulsorily forced to make these payments, and in return Parliament undertakes that there shall be given medical and other benefits under Section 8 of the Act. There is a penalty for the employer if he does not pay, not only his own contribution but the contribution of those who are employed by him, but there is no penalty as far as I know upon Parliament if they do not give the benefits of the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0019"/>
<col>29</col>
Act. Therefore it is essential that we should see whether the Government are in a position to give the benefits which they contract to give.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00203">The penalty of &#x00A3;10 under the Act applies only to the employer, but some time during May a pamphlet, marked A, was issued by the Official Commissioners on the duties of employers, and curiously enough this sentence was inserted in one paragraph&#x2014;
<quote>"A worker who, without reasonable cause, fails to, deliver a contribution card when the employer requires it for the purpose of paying contributions or for production to an inspector, is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding &#x00A3;10."</quote>
This would appear to be creating a new criminal offence by Provisional Order, and that appears to me a very strong measure indeed. I suppose the answer will be that this is done under the vague words of subsection (2) of Section 68 of the Act, in which "other persons" are put in generally. All I can say is that it would have been more honest and straightforward to have put into the Act itself a provision that the workman was liable to this &#x00A3;10 penalty as well as the employer, and not put it in insidiously within six weeks of the Act coming into force. This question has been constantly raised at meetings addressed by the itinerant lecturers who have gone round the country under the command of the Government Whip, and they have always denied that there was any provision in the Act with regard to that. Two other points, however, arise on this paragraph. First, what is "reasonable cause"? because I suppose if the workman is to be prosecuted by the unfortunate employer he will be heard in defence in a Court of Justice, and I think he would be able to give very good reasons for not paying if he could not see that he was going to get the benefits under the Act. In that case I think the employer would be in a very difficult position. Secondly, are the Commissioners under the Act, entitled to make Provisional Orders and Regulations with penalties attached? They claim, or it is claimed for them, that any Regulations made by them or for them are to be read into the Act and have the force of law. I cannot find anything in the Act which allows them to repeal a law when they have once made it. But no doubt we shall have some reply with regard to that.</p>
<col>30</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00204">I should like to ask what has been done by the Government or by the Special Commissioners to explain the Act in the country and to secure the co-operation of the medical profession and the great and small friendly societies. So far as I can learn, they took no steps at all for three months. The Commissioners went to sleep for three months, or, probably acting under orders, took no active steps; and as regards the doctors the Chancellor of the Exchequer went out of his way to insult and abuse the medical profession as a "selfish trade union." My Lords, there is no more generous or kindly profession in the world, especially to the poor in the rural districts, than the medical profession. I venture to say that the demands which they have made are largely fair and reasonable, and are made quite as much in the interests of the poor people whom they have to attend as in their own interests. They will be called out at all hours and will be called out more in the future when nothing will have to be paid by the people themselves. It is absolutely necessary in a large and scattered rural district that a medical man should have either a motor-car or horses and carriages. How is he to keep horses and carriages, much less a motor-car, on &#x00A3;200 or, &#x00A3;250 per annum? Yet that is what I am told will be the average income of a medical man under the terms of the Act. How much more liberal is the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he wants to find spies and inspectors to send into your houses&#x0021; They are advertised for at from &#x00A3;350 to &#x00A3;500 per annum. We could do very well without some of those officials, but the Government cannot bring this Act into force and give medical and sanatoria benefits without the medical profession.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00205">Up to the end of April nothing whatever had been done towards bringing the Act into operation. But in April the Commissioners sent official lecturers all over the country. They were very able men. I presided at several of their meetings in Lincolnshire at the request of the Commissioners, and I heard what they had to say. They had two great disadvantages. In the first place, they had to follow a number of men who had been sent out by the Government Whip as unofficial lecturers to popularise the Act, and who had been making speeches absolutely regardless of either facts or accuracy, or, to put it in
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0020"/>
<col>31</col>
milder language, they had shown an absolute ignorance of the Act itself. Questions were constantly asked the official lecturers as to whether what they said or what had been stated by the unofficial speakers was true, and when I was in the chair at one of these meetings I was appealed to by some very stanch Radicals as to which statements were true. The answer I gave was that as they had an official lecturer there it was not for me to say which statements were right or wrong. The next day I received a letter from the Official Commissioners in which they stated that they declined to be responsible for the opinions and explanations of their own lecturers; they must be taken to be saying as far as they could what they understood to be the Act, but the Commissioners were not responsible for their opinion. It is rather hard upon lecturers to be sent down to the country and then for their opinions to be treated in this way. I think that after three months a brief might have been made for them. They did a certain amount of good, however, and cleared the decks in a great many instances.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00206">But latterly the Commissioners have issued an enormous number of pamphlets for which they are responsible. I do not know whether any of your Lordships have followed all these pamphlets. I have done my best to do so, but they have come a great deal faster than I have been able to manage to digest them. What is really the present position? I will only speak of what had been done up to May, for anything that has been done during the last six weeks clearly can be of no use in the way of giving information in the country districts. I would like to call attention to a speech made by Sir Robert Morant on May 20 at a meeting of the London Chamber of Commerce. He then said that&#x2014;
<quote>"There were some important practical matters to be dealt with by the Commissioners, complex and full of detail, and regulations to be framed within the four corners of the Act in a way that would suit the societies, great and small, which had to administer them."</quote>
This is within two months of July 15, when it is proposed that the Act should come into operation. How are employers and employed to be informed on these complex questions of which the Commissioners two months ago could not make head or tail? But that is not all. Sir Robert Morant stated that, though some five or six sets of
<col>32</col>
Regulations had been drafted, they must be taken and regarded as experimental Regulations only. The outstanding difficulty, he said, was that they had not yet a list of approved societies, nor did they know precisely what societies existed in different localities. So that when we have done all we can to master these Regulations we have to realise that they may be done away with the next day; and I am told that, in the Provisional Regulations issued this week, among other things which have been withdrawn is this notice as to a penalty in the case of the workman. At any rate, that provision has been softened down.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00207">Remember that the words I have quoted were used within two months of July 15. I think it may be said with perfect truth that the general body of workmen in town and country have no knowledge whatever either about the general provisions of the Act or what friendly societies have been or will be approved. We know now, from speeches delivered at meetings of several of the principal friendly societies, that they never wanted the Act at all, but are willing to make the best of it provided they are given time in which to prepare the necessary regulations. I heard the other day that one of the largest friendly societies in Lincolnshire received a letter saving that their application to be approved could not be agreed to unless they sent up their rules and regulations within twenty-four hours. It is said that they sat up all night to make them, but I do not think it is very satisfactory to people who have to pay their money to know that they have to go into a society whose regulations have been revised and made up in twenty-four hours. The reason why the societies want more time is obvious. The regulations and benefits which will do for the towns will not do for the rural districts. In the towns people want a great deal of medical attendance and are to a certain extent short lived, but in the rural districts they are strong and healthy and do not care quite so much about medical attendance. What they really want is what I may call deferred benefits between the ages of sixty and seventy, when they can claim the old-age pension. At one meeting over which I presided, and at which a member of the Advisory Committee as well as the lecturer was present, it was distinctly stated on
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0021"/>
<col>33</col>
behalf of these friendly societies that they desired to form branches with benefits suitable to various classes of labour, but that it would be impossible for there to form these branches until they knew whether they would be approved themselves and exactly what the labourers required.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00208">I do not think I need say anything more about the friendly societies. But I would like to say that it is not only for rural labourers that they wish to establish branches. They also desire to have branches for other classes, like domestic servants, fishermen, seamen, and others, who do not want exactly the same benefits as are now being provided for the towns. On the part of rural labourers there is a great distrust of any advice given them by the employers, distrust principally caused by the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Limehouse speeches and the way in which employers and employed have been set one against the other; and when they are told that they ought to become members of an approved society they look upon the advice with distrust, and they cannot be got to understand that the most pitiable condition a man can occupy is to become a Post Office depositor. Again, the small societies in the villages are very suspicious. They do not know what is going to be done with them, and some of them are inclined to think that they had better dissolve and divide what money they have before the Government, as they think they will, lay hold of it. I think that one of the things most necessary at the present moment is to try and keep going these small societies in rural districts, to get them recognised as approved societies, and then to group them together for pooling purposes so as to form societies of 5,000 members each. That is one way of getting good societies for the agricultural labourer. The other way is to get the friendly societies to institute branches with particular benefits for them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00209">But there, again, you are met with the same difficulty. Up to the present moment no replies have been sent to any of these smaller societies, and therefore they do not know whether they are going to be approved or not, and the friendly societies will not start branches until they know how many of the smaller societies are approved and how many members they
<col>34</col>
will take away from them. Therefore until it is known which are to be approved societies and which are not, it is impossible to do anything in the rural districts. I look upon domestic servants and casual labourers as absolutely hopeless at the present moment. I doubt whether there is a single Minister on the Front Bench opposite who can tell us anything about the casuals or what will happen to them. But, whatever happens, we do not want to see the hard-working healthy English labourer put into the same position as casuals. There is another question I should like to ask to which I hope I shall get an answer. Large employers do not pay the wages themselves. What will be the position of a pay clerk or a foreman who presents the stamps and the remainder of the wage to a workman if the workman refuses to accept it as full payment of his demand? The workman says. "No, I do not want your stamps; I have got no card; I want the full wages upon which you engaged me." What will be the position in that case of the pay clerk or the foreman under the Workmen's and Servants' Act? Can he refuse to pay the remainder of the wages unless the receipt is given, or must he pay the remainder of the wages and not be able to produce his receipt when he goes back to the office? This is a question which presents some difficulty.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00210">There is only one other class to which I wish directly to refer. As far as Lincolnshire is concerned the farmers and others are quite prepared to carry out the Act if they can only see their way to do so, and to form associations purely and entirely for rural labourers, or, if that cannot be done, to get branches from the larger societies. But fishermen are in a worse position than rural labourers. At the present moment the Board of Trade and the Fisheries Department have not come to an agreement as to what is a foreign-going fishing vessel. Under the Act fishermen in foreign-going vessels are to pay a good deal less than what is paid by other workmen&#x2014;I think they are only to pay a penny or twopence. But, as I say, no decision has yet been come to as to what is a foreign-going fishing vessel. I was present at the meeting of the National Sea Fisheries Association when the matter was discussed. Mr. Runciman was present, but unfortunately, although he was most desirous to remain, he was called suddenly away to a
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0022"/>
<col>35</col>
Cabinet meeting, but he left Sir Thomas Elliott to describe the position. He asked us to name three practical fishermen who could advise the Department as to what was a proper definition of a foreign-going vessel. That we have done, but no decision has yet been come to. The Board of Trade have got their own ideas, but all I can say is that the definition of a foreign-going vessel in the Merchant Shipping Acts is useless for this purpose. That is the first difficulty with regard to fishermen.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00211">The second difficulty is that the Insurance Commissioners have declined to accept the Royal Provident Fund as an approved society, and I must say I think their decision is quite right under the Act. But if that is the law, what happens? No branches of the society can be approved. The sick funds are affiliated to the branches, and they are also disqualified by the Act. I think that the sick funds must be at once dissociated from the Royal Provident Fund and must be started as fresh trusts and apply to be approved on their own bottom. But until the <i>status</i> of the fishermen is known it is impossible to do anything at all. In a recent circular issued by the Insurance Commissioners they warn domestic servants, especially women&#x2014;and what they say with regard to domestic servants applies to every other class&#x2014;under no circumstances to become Post Office depositors. They tell them that the Post Office is not really an insurance at all and advise them strongly not to join that category.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00212">We are now within a month of July 15, and we do not know half of the friendly societies or half of the small societies which are eventually to be approved. It is most unfair to hustle those who are to be contributors into the few societies which have been approved, some of them only provisionally approved, and it is still worse to hustle 9,000,000 people into becoming Post Office depositors. But that must be the result if you bring the Act into force on July 15. I therefore appeal to the Government to give the Motion which I have brought forward their friendly consideration. Remember that the first list of approved friendly societies was only published on Friday last, but they are not very well satisfied with the rules that they have sent in in such a great hurry. Terms have not yet been come to with the
<col>36</col>
medical profession, and only last week a circular was issued to all the county councils asking them to send in their regulations for sanatoria in their counties within seven days. That is pretty strong hustling, because if the Commissioners had been men of business they would know that most county councils cannot be called together within seven days. Nothing has been done with regard to sanatoria or with regard to medical benefits. All that has been done is absolutely provisional and experimental. I do not think that in the hay season you will get many labourers to read this list of Provisional Orders which is to be circulated throughout the country, and I very much doubt the legality of enforcing fines against the employer or the workman when you cannot give in return the benefits which in the Act you have stated you will give.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00213">I apologise for having detained your Lordships so long, but I have done my best to put the matter clearly without any controversy so far as I could help in the matter. I am satisfied more every day that it is in the interests of the Act itself, and in the interests of the system of national insurance, that the date fixed for the Act to come into operation should be postponed. Every day shows, if you would only give time to get a full list of approved societies and if you would only come to terms with the doctors, that then, long before January, or, if you like it better, by October 1, there would be plenty of opportunity for making the Act to a certain extent a success notwithstanding its unworkable nature at the present moment. I beg to move the Motion standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00214"><i>Moved</i> to resolve, That in the opinion of this House it is most essential, in the interest of all those affected by its provisions as well as of the taxpayers and ratepayers of England, that the operation of the Act should be postponed by a Privy Council Order under the powers given in the Act until 1st of January, 1913, in order to give sufficient time for the Official Commissioners to understand and explain its provisions, and, if necessary, to suggest such amendments as will render the Act workable and really beneficial as a scheme of National Insurance.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Heneage.</i>)</p>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0023"/>
<col>37</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00215"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that none of your Lordships will dispute what Lord Heneage has said as to the manner in which this Act was passed through the other House and also through this House, and I think I shall be able to show to your Lordships that the haste which is being displayed in bringing it into operation is quite equal to the haste which was displayed in making it into law. Such little experience as I have had coincides with that of Lord Heneage, that at the present time, at all events in the rural districts, the people are in a state of absolute perplexity and bewilderment with regard to this Act. Lord Heneage has already given instances of matters which are very important but which remain entirely in doubt. It would be easy to multiply them to any extent you chose. I will only mention one or two.<lb/>
The question of casual labour has been raised several times in the House of Commons, and the usual answer given was that it was under consideration. Within the last few days a draft Order was issued with regard to casual labour which appears to me to leave the matter in a much more confused state than before. The Order provides that persons employed in any of the following capacities: hop-picker, fruit-picker, pea-picker, flower-puller, potato-raiser, or gardener, are outside the Act except in the case where, previous to their hop-picking, fruit-picking, and so on, they happened to be employed persons. Just think what an amount of confusion that creates&#x0021; It means that every farmer who employs hop-pickers will have to examine into the antecedents of all these casual labourers. The difference it will make to the farmer is this, that whereas if they were previously not employed he will not be liable to pay anything in respect of them and they will not have to pay anything, but if they had been employed the contributions in respect of them will have to be paid.<lb/>
Lord Heneage mentioned the case of fishermen. Some sets of fishermen hold shares in the vessel and in the catch. In the draft Order made in regard to them it was stated that whereas fishermen who are employed in the ordinary way will have to pay in the ordinary way, persons who
<col>38</col>
hold shares in a vessel will come like other people under the Act. What does that mean? A person who has a share in a ship or in the catch is not an <i>employ&#x00E9;.</i> Will those men be regarded under the Act as employed, or does it merely mean that if they like to appear as voluntary contributors they can, and if they do not they will not be under the Act at all? Then there is the case of outworkers. We have not yet had any definition of an "outworker." In the first instance, all outworkers appeared to come under the Act, with the exception, of course, of Irish outworkers, because there is a special clause which provides that Irish out-workers are to be treated quite differently and are not to come under the Act. Then, in the same way, there was a single exception made with regard to the wives of persons who are insured and whose main employment does not consist in a particular form of outworking. It is very curious, but that one exception in the Act was made in the middle of a by-election in Somerset, where it appeared that very great interest was taken in the matter. I suppose there were a great many wives of insured persons there. At all events, it was a coincidence that that particular exception, and that one only, so far as England is concerned, was introduced in the Bill at that particular moment.<lb/>
Cases like those I have mentioned are without number, and they have to be dealt with by July 15 if this Act is to be brought into operation on that date. Then take the case of a jobbing gardener. He works for A on Monday, for B on Tuesday, and so on. Naturally there is a good deal of anxiety as to who is to pay for that man. I will give an instance of the value of the Government lecturer in solving these matters. One lecturer, when asked who would pay in respect of this jobbing gardener, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The man who first employs him in the Week would pay, but he would soon get to know the others and would ask them to share the obligation with him."</quote>
You must remember that these Government lecturers mere under a great disadvantage, because they had strict instructions that if any question was asked them with regard to which they entertained any doubt they were to say nothing at all, or, at all events, they were to be most careful to say nothing which could involve
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0024"/>
<col>39</col>
the Commissioners in any way. This particular lecturer seems to me to have been either a wag who was pulling the leg of his audience, or else he was a person who was not fit to lecture at all, because how can any man possessed of commonsense, and after ail these lecturers ought to have some commonsense, say such a thing as this seriously&#x2014;that the man who first employs him is to pay for the jobbing gardener and then attempt to recover their proportion from the people who employ him on other days. These are instances which could be multiplied as much as you like.<lb/>
But what I wish particularly to call your Lordships' attention to is this, that whether it is from the careless and slipshod way in which this Bill was drawn and in which it was allowed to pass through Parliament, or whether it is from this extraordinary hurry which is being displayed in order to get the Act brought into force on July 15&#x2014;from whichever cause it is, and I think very likely it is from both, this Act is being, in some of its main particulars, brought into force by the Commissioners under Section 78, which gives them extraordinary powers which were never before given to any body of men, and which certainly I hope will never be given again. They are really working the Act in their own way, and not according to the words which the Act itself contains. I will give your Lordships an instance or two, first of all with regard to the constitution of the Advisory Committee. The Act says that as soon as may be after the passing of the Act the Commissioners are to appoint an Advisory Committee, for the purpose of giving the Commissioners advice and assistance, consisting, amongst other persons, of representatives of approved societies. There were no approved societies; there could not be approved societies for this excellent reason&#x2014;that time was not given to make the regulations which would enable any societies to be approved. Therefore the Commissioners, in an Order made under Section 78, say&#x2014;
<quote>"And whereas before the Insurance Commissioners can grant approval to a society for the purposes of the Act it is necessary that regulations prescribing the form of certain of the rules of such a society should be prescribed by the said Commissioners and by reason of the premises&#x2014;</quote>
whatever that means&#x2014;
<quote>"a difficulty arises with respect to the constitution of the Advisory Committee."</quote>
<col>40</col>
Then they propose to constitute the Advisory Committee in a different way. It was not a "difficulty"; it was an impossibility. The Commissioners proceed to say&#x2014;
<quote>"The requirement of Section 58 of the National Insurance Act, 1911, that the Advisory Committee shall, amongst other persons, comprise representatives of approved societies shall be modified&#x2014;</quote>
that is to say, altered&#x2014;
<quote>"so as to require that the first Committee appointed under Section 58 of the Act shall comprise, in place of representatives of approved societies representatives of such bodies of persons corporate or unincorporate as, in the opinion of the Insurance Commissioners, are desirous of transacting insurance business."</quote>
The result of that is that the Commissioners just put on to the Advisory Committee the persons they saw fit. That is the result so far as the Advisory Committee is concerned. There was no time to pass the regulations which were necessary before a society could be approved. That was probably a slip in the Act. But to say that the Commissioners are to have the right to alter the Act in any way they think fit appears to me very wrong indeed.<lb/>
Again with regard to the composition of local insurance committees. The Act says that a committee shall be constituted for every county and county borough, and it is further provided that every such committee shall consist of such number of members as the Insurance Commissioners determine, but in no case less than forty or more than eighty; of whom three-fifths are to represent the insured persons resident in the county or county borough who are members of approved societies and who are deposit contributors in proportion to their respective numbers. Just listen to what the Commissioners say with regard to that provision. They say&#x2014;
<quote>"In the absence of definite information, not only in regard to the number of persons in each county or county borough who will be insured, but also in regard to the number who will belong to each of the different societies which propose to transact insurance business under the Act, and in regard to the respective numbers of the persons who will become members of approved societies and of the persons who will become deposit contributors, it is impossible to adopt any system of proportionate representation&#x2014;</quote>
That is going against the provision in the Act&#x2014;
<quote>"but the spirit of the Act will, as it appears to the Commissioners, be observed if the committees are
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0025"/>
<col>41</col>
so constituted that there shall not be lacking any important element of the various kinds of experience which it is desirable should be comprised the first committes."</quote>
That is, as I say, entirely to alter the provision in the Act. Your Lordships will see that what the Commissioners did was this. The Act said that insurance committees were to be set up. The Commissioners state that it is impossible to carry that out, but that they will appoint provisional insurance committees, and this is the way they proceed to constitute these committees&#x2014;
<quote>"In Our opinion the most practical method of achieving the object in view was wherever possible to utilise the machinery in the possession or at the command of central representative bodies for obtaining the names of suitable persons for inclusion on each of the committees; and accordingly we invited the assistance of members of the Advisory Committee representing respectively (1) the National Conference of Friendly Societies, (2) the Holloway, Deposit, and Dividing Societies, (3) the Trade Unions, and (4) the Industrial Assuance offices."</quote>
The representatives on the Advisory Committee of those four bodies undertook to furnish the Commissioners with the names of suitable persons to the number specified for each of the four groups in the case of each provisional insurance committee. Therefore these three-fifths who are supposed to represent the insured persons are entirely nominated at the instance and through the medium of the members of the Advisory Committee. That is the way in which the provisional committee is constituted. I merely instance that to point out how entirely the Commissioners have created a sort of Act of their own. It may be good or it may be bad, but it is not the Act which passed through Parliament.<lb/>
Further than that, the Act said that there were to be representatives of the deposit contributors. There is no such thing as a deposit contributor, for the excellent reason that three months are given from July 15 during which a person may join an approved society and become an employed contributor. It is not until three months from that date that you will know who is a deposit contributor. How is that dealt with? The Commissioners state that the members selected for inclusion on each provisional insurance committee will form a temporary or nucleus committee which will be charged with the duty of representing these deposit contributors.
<col>42</col>
In the first place the people do not exist and, in the second place, those appointed to represent them&#x2014;and you might just as well have appointed anybody else&#x2014;certainly do not represent the deposit contributors.<lb/>
Then we come to the doctors. It is proposed that on these provisional insurance committees there shall be representatives of the doctors. We were told just before the House of Commons rose for the Whitsuntide recess that there were the most amicable and friendly negotiations going on with the doctors. That was what the Secretary to the Treasury said. But how were these amicable and friendly negotiations commenced? At the beginning of them, the moment that the medical profession had taken exception to some things in his Act, the Chancellor of the Exchequer described the doctors in his most elegant Limehouse style. He proceeded to threaten them, and said that if they did not mind, all the privileges they enjoyed under his Act would be taken away and he would set up dispensaries and in other ways alter the disposition of the money provided for medical benefits. That may be a good way to start negotiations, but I must say I should hardly have thought it.<lb/>
Have we advanced one single inch since that time? The moment the provisional committees were started the State Sickness Insurance Committee of the British Medical Association declined to take any part in forming them or in the business which was to be submitted to them. There have been several meetings. I observe that there was one with Mr. Lloyd George on Thursday last. What happened? According to the published account of what took place the doctors merely repeated their six points, and the negotiations did not advance a single step. I believe they are meeting again this afternoon. I noticed the other day that the Chairman of the Scottish Commission said&#x2014;
<quote>"I am certain that we are going to make an arrangement with the doctors. The doctors may have to come down a bit and the Government may have to go up a hit, but that there will be an arrangement I feel positively and absolutely certain."</quote>
That is just the point. Who is going to go up and who is going to come down? It seems quite clear from what has passed hitherto that before Mr. Lloyd George
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0026"/>
<col>43</col>
brings the doctors into line he will have to eat a good deal more of the Welsh national vegetable than he ever anticipated when on February 17 he was calling the doctors names and attacking them.<lb/>
On July 15, or any time after that, you may have the insurance committees started. But what are they to do? What powers will they have? Will they have power to impose a charge on the rates? The Commissioners may establish a body which they call a temporary body for purely temporary purposes, but that they can give that body any powers seems to me doubtful. Suppose that some county council declines to appoint an insurance committee. What is going to happen? There is no remedy so far as I can see. Now as to the cost. This Act is being brought into operation, so far as I can ascertain, absolutely regardless of cost. There are at this moment in the offices of the Commission high officials, borrowed I suppose, from the Treasury, the Home Office, and the Board of Education. But that is a mere trifle. Is there any estimate of the cost of this Act? There never was one; and, moreover, I very much doubt whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer really cares what the thing costs. All that he cares about is that the Act should be started on July 15 in order to enable him to go and say what enormous benefits he has given to the people. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is always reminding us that this Commission is a perfectly independent body, that it acts entirely for itself, and that he personally takes no part in administering the Act. I really cannot understand how he can say such a thing. For who is the chairman of the Advisory Committee? Mr. Lloyd George.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00216"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: Mr. Masterman.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00217"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: No. Then who is the chairman of the Joint Committee? The Secretary to the Treasury. More than that, the Commissioners themselves were created by the Treasury, and all the things they have done and are doing have been and are being done with the advice and consent of the Treasury. Further, to show how far the present Chancellor of the Exchequer is from being in any way impartial or independent in regard to this matter, your Lordships may remember that he took the chair at
<col>44</col>
the meeting which was held to establish the Liberal Insurance Committee, which committee, he said, was to be established for the purpose of "expounding the Act and pounding those who oppose it." The meaning which the Chancellor of the Exchequer attaches to the word "oppose" is this. Any one who differs from him in any particular whatsoever opposes the Act. If ever there was a measure which was made up of nothing but details this is the measure. Nobody differs from the principle of the Act. The whole question has reference to the manner in which it is carried out, and when any question is raised with regard to the careless way in which then; principles are carried out in this Act the Chancellor of the Exchequer immediately declares the questioner an opponent of the Act and proceeds to write those eloquent letters which your Lordships read about once a week in the newspapers. It seems to me that if you want the people of this country to understand the Act at all, you must give them time in which to do so; if regulations are to be made, time must be given for the making of them; and if committees are to be appointed, time must be given to collect the men who are to sit on those committees. For these and a good many other reasons I entirely agree with the Motion which my noble friend has made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00218"><member>LORD ST. AUDRIES</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I intervene in this debate only because this is a question which is of serious importance to the rural districts of the West of England, with which I am intimately connected. We are very simpleminded folk down there; we live very far apart; we are not like people in large towns, who can meet together and discuss Acts of Parliament. We meet very seldom, and we are now asked to discuss and understand, not only a very complicated Act of Parliament, but a series of Regulations which are constantly being altered and constantly being issued in fresh batches. The Government ask us not only to understand accurately the anatomy of their child, but to investigate most carefully every article of attire of the huge trousseau with which they are providing it. I found in my part of the world, not unnaturally, a very strong feeling amongst farmers that they would refuse to carry out the Act, and I gave them what I believed to be sound advice. I advised them that as long as this law is on the Statute-book
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0027"/>
<col>45</col>
every man must obey it and endeavour to carry it out. Personally I have, on the Bench, fined gentlemen for passive resistance to one Act of Parliament, and I should be the last person in the world to advise others to offer passive resistance to another Act of Parliament. I think we may take it as certain that the farmers and employers generally in the country do mean to work the Act to the best of their ability, but I must say I think they have been very unfairly treated. To cover an Act of Parliament with all these Regulations, which take any ordinary man days and days to read and understand, is treating employers of labour very unfairly.<lb/>
We had a big meeting at which there was present a lecturer sent down by the Government. He was a courteous and intelligent gentleman, who, I think, knew the Act thoroughly. But he could not answer our questions, because our questions are not dealt with by the Act and have not yet been dealt with by Regulations. He spent a happy two hours with us and then had to catch a train to address another audience, who were quite as anxious as we were to interrogate him about the Act. The last advice he gave us was to procure all the leaflets we could and study them. I have done so. I have studied them with great care, but I was rather disgusted to find on the back of each leaflet the following notice&#x2014;
<quote>"It must be clearly understood that nothing in this leaflet is to be regarded as determining any of the questions that have to be decided under the Act, whether by the Commissioners or otherwise."</quote>
In these circumstances I do not see much use in issuing the leaflets. They give information, and then the reader is told on the back that the information is worth nothing.<lb/>
There are two questions affecting rural labour which I should like to put to His Majesty's Government. The first has reference to the position of an agricultural labourer who is receiving less than 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day in cash, but who is getting in addition a cottage and garden free. How is the weekly value of that cottage and garden assessed? Is it by the rateable value? And in that case would the rateable value be added to the cash value of the man's wages, and the employer's contribution and the man's contribution
<col>46</col>
be adjusted in that way? Noble Lords opposite will see that it does make a difference. If you calculated the employer's and the man's contribution purely on the man's wages there would be one scale, but if you threw in the value of the cottage and garden there would be another scale.<lb/>
The other question I wish to ask concerns the vexed subject of casual labour in agricultural districts. In the West of England casual labour is a very great asset to the tenant farmer, to the small holder, to the market gardener, and to the landowner. I do not know how we should get on without it. In the busy months when extra hands are wanted there is a great supply of casual labour in the West of England. There are a great number of men there who much prefer to work for different masters than to remain in the employ of one master throughout the year. I quite understand that as the Act stands the man who employs the casual labourer on the first day of the week on which he is employed, whether it be a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, is responsible for putting on the stamp. May I take a typical casual labourer's week? On Monday he goes out shooting with a neighbouring landowner as a beater. I was informed by the lecturer that if the labourer went out with the landowner in that way and the landowner gave away the whole of his game, then the beater was not employed for profit or business and the stamp need not be put on; but if, on the other hand, the landowner sold a single bird then the beater was employed for profit and the stamp had to be put on. The landowner may understand that, but I am certain the ordinary beater would not understand it. On the next day, Tuesday, or on the Wednesday, the labourer goes out with a thrashing machine. The first question the employer has to ask him is whether that is his first day's employment, and the man has to produce his card. The same thing happens on the Thursday, when he goes to work for sonic small holder.<lb/>
On each occasion the man must produce his card. The employer is bound to ask him to produce it to see whether that particular day is the first day in that week on which he has got employment. It is obvious that the employer must do that to safeguard himself from the penalty of &#x00A3;10
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0028"/>
<col>47</col>
for not putting on the stamp. I think one of the great drawbacks of the Act is that this penalty of &#x00A3;10 is much too heavy, not for the rich man or the large employer of labour, but for the small employer who might inadvertently make a mistake. The casual labourer will have to carry his card about in his pocket for thirteen weeks, and every time he works for a fresh employer he will have to produce that card. I can imagine that the card will be in a curious state at the end of the thirteen weeks. It is suggested that the employers should agree to pool the insurance. That may be all right in some forms of business, but in the case of the casual labourer in rural districts it will have a very curious reside. There would have to be a Sunday-afternoon meeting of the sportsman, the owner of the thrashing machine, and the small holder to decide how the 4<i>d.</i> was to be divided amongst them during the ensuing week. I think this question of casual labour should be referred to the Commissioners, and that they should bring out some scheme applicable to rural districts. If something of that kind is not done the casual labourer will cease to be employed. That will be a bad thing for him, a bad thing for the farmer, and a very much worse thing for the land.<lb/>
Then there is the question of our village clubs. These village clubs are and have been for years past the centre of life in some of our best villages. They are very much older, many of them, than the great friendly societies. In the best class of village there is nothing the inhabitants are more proud of than of the village club, and I feel that if things are hurried, as it appears they are to be, many of these village clubs will disappear. Your Lordships must recollect this, that many of the members of these clubs, if the clubs disappear, are not in a position to join the great friendly societies. They will have no alternative except to become Post Office contributors&#x2014;that extraordinary form of self-paid pauperism which this Act introduces into the country for the first time. We are anxious to save the labourer, and especially the more elderly labourer, from the fate of becoming a Post Office contributor.<lb/>
In Devon and Somerset we are forming a county association to amalgamate all
<col>48</col>
the old village clubs, but it is obvious that that work must take time. It is not difficult for the great friendly societies to enrol new members; they have their organisations and staffs. But with us, dealing with widely-scattered parishes in widely scattered counties taking in Exmoor and Dartmoor and districts of that kind, it is obvious that these county associations cannot be formed by July 15. We attach, as I say, the greatest importance to these county associations, and I believe the Government do, too. All I ask is that the Government should give us time in which to form them. I am quite aware what the answer is. It is that there will be no benefits of any kind until January 1 next. It is said not to matter whether the Act comes into operation on July 15 because no one will get any-thing until January 1 next. If that is so, what is the use of bringing the Act into force on July 15? It seems to me, especially as regards these rural questions of the casual labourer and the village clubs, that it would be very much wiser for us to be given an extra six months in which to form these associations, and for the Commissioners to bring out more leaflets and pamphlets, but leaflets and pamphlets which will give us some idea of what we are to do before the Act comes into force.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00219"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am disposed to apologise for intervening so early in this debate, and, indeed, for taking part in the debate at all. I was unable last year to follow the long course of the measure in another place, and I was also, through no fault of my own, altogether absent from the debates in your Lordships' House in the autumn session of last year. But I am anxious to say one or two words of a more or less general character upon the points of principle which have been raised by the three noble Lords who have spoken in this debate, dealing with any minor points that I can in the course of the few remarks which I shall make, but leaving other points of detail to be dealt with by some of my noble friends who are more conversant than I am with the ins and outs of what we all admit to be a complicated measure. I ought to say, my Lords, that His Majesty's Government are far indeed from objecting to the discussion initiated by my noble friend opposite.
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0029"/>
<col>49</col>
On the contrary we welcome it, because we fully recognise that there still exists, particularly in the remoter parts of the country, much uncertainty as to the actual provisions of the Act, and still more uncertainty, perhaps, as to what is going to happen when the Act is brought into positive operation. I also fully appreciate that the attitude of all the noble Lords who have spoken is not one of hostility to the Government in this matter; it is not one of fundamental objection to the Act as an Act, but they think it their duty to call attention to what they conceive to be certain deficiencies in the Act itself, and in particular to ask that its operation may be deferred for some time.<lb/>
It is important, in the first place, that I should endeavour to deal with this demand for delay. So far as I was able to follow the progress of the measure until it became an Act, this demand, or a similar demand, has been made throughout its whole discussion in Parliament, proceeding, I think, from a complete difference in outlook between the Opposition and the Government in this matter. The ideal of noble Lords opposite, as I take it, is that the measure should not come into operation until everything is cut and dried. All the approved societies ought to be formed; every individual should have decided whether he can join an approved society, and, if so, what, or whether he should become a mere deposit contributor through the Post Office. Everything, in fact, in relation to the Act must be comprehended by practically everybody concerned. The view of His Majesty's Government has been that that is an impossible manner in which to deal with a measure of this particular kind. The view that we have taken all through&#x2014;it appears in the debates in another place, it has appeared in the debates here, and it will appear in the course of this debate&#x2014;is that this measure is one to which it is necessary to apply the principle of <i>solvitur ambulando;</i> that it is only by bringing the Act into operation, by observing the methods of societies and of individuals, and, it may be also, by discovering the existence of errors and mistakes, either, if you like, in the Act itself or in the administration of the Act&#x2014;that it is only by taking such a course that it is possible in this country to bring the Act into full and complete operation.<lb/>
<col>50</col>
I say in this country because I firmly believe that in a country like this, whose main dread is of being bureau-ridden, this is the only method by which an Act of this kind can be worked. There are no doubt some countries in Europe&#x2014;I quite admit it&#x2014;in which the more complete measure which some members of the Opposition might like to see brought into operation could be applied, other countries in which far stronger personal pressure could be put either upon employers or upon workpeople to carry out, either at short or at long notice, the provisions of the Act; but here, as we all know, things are different. People are most jealous and suspicious of interference with their personal liberty by Government, or, indeed, by anybody else, and therefore I think it is not out of place to point out that all the difficulties to which noble Lords have drawn attention, all the anomalies, if you like, which attach to the Act, are due to the fact that we are introducing the contributory principle&#x2014;a principle generally admired by noble Lords opposite, but one which is, I frankly admit, in some degree foreign to the genius of the people of this country. I cannot help, in passing, making the reflection that if we had obeyed the urgent call of noble Lords opposite and applied to the Old Age Pensions Act the contributory principle with the prospect of compelling workpeople to subscribe through their employers for benefits which might only come home to them forty years hence or more, if they should live so long&#x2014;I cannot help reflecting what the practical difficulties would have been in adding a principle of that kind to our Old Age Pensions Act.<lb/>
The arguments against delay appear to me to be these. So far as the large benefit societies are concerned, I believe it is true to state that they do not want delay. I see that Lord Heneage shakes his head. But what I think points to the truth of that statement is the very observation that he made, that until the Act comes into operation many members of the benefit societies are in a condition of doubt, and the benefit societies themselves&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00220"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: I said that until the larger societies knew whether the smaller societies were going to be approved and grouped together for pooling purposes with 5,000 members they could not themselves furnish branches specially for rural districts.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0030"/>
<col>51</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00221"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Precisely. I think it is not unfair to infer from that statement, exactly as made by the noble Lord, that the large benefit societies will welcome the early bringing into operation of the Act. I am speaking, of course, in this case in particular of a long delay&#x2014;say, a delay until January 1. It has been mentioned that if the Act is not postponed until January 1, it might, at any rate, be postponed until October 1. There, again, that comparatively short delay covers just the harvest time and the hop-picking time to which allusion has been made, and also, what is not at all unimportant as regards the officers of the friendly societies, the usual holiday time. All those periods are covered by the three months interval, and I venture to say therefore that, so far as fresh active operations are concerned, not much of a new kind would be likely to be done if a postponement until October 1 took place.<lb/>
The noble Earl who spoke last but one, Lord Camperdown, drew attention, with no little censure, to the provisional arrangements which are provided for by, I think, Section 78 of the Act. It is reasonable to remind the House that provisional arrangements of this kind are by no means uncommon. There are various precedents for them, and if you look at any of those precedents I think you will all admit that the actual words of the section constituting the provisional arrangements are often somewhat startling, as they seem to be in this particular Act. I take only one instance, that of the County Councils Act of noble Lords opposite&#x2014;the Act of 1888. I see there a section which says that the Local Government Board may, within six months after the day fixed for the first election, make such Orders as appear to them necessary for bringing the Act into full operation; and then follow these words&#x2014;
<quote>"Such Orders may modify any enactment in this or any other Act, whether general or local or personal, so far as may appear to the Board necessary for the said purpose."</quote>
That seems to give a vast, and, if you like, most dangerous power to a public Department to play ball with any Act of Parliament on the whole of the Statute-book; but it is quite clear that in all such cases where you are bringing an entirely new force into operation, as was the case in that Local Government Act, such vague and wide powers are almost necessarily given to the
<col>52</col>
public Department concerned. I feel, therefore, that the alarm which the noble Earl expressed as to what may happen under this section in this particular case is in no way well-founded.<lb/>
Then Lord Heneage dealt with the question of what he called Provisional Orders, but which more properly, I think, ought to be described as Provisional Regulations, because the term "Provisional Orders" is one to which a different meaning as a rule attaches. Those Regulations are made under the section of which I have just been speaking, and what I have said so far applies to them. In our opinion you cannot bring a novel systems of this kind into operation without making some such provisional arrangement; and I also venture to think that it is quite fair to warn the public, in the terms to which Lord St. Audries objected, that such arrangements must not be taken as laws of the Medes and Persians which cannot be altered, but that they are subject, as we see the effect of their application, to various modifications and alterations.<lb/>
That brings me to the question of the amount of information which the Commissioners have hitherto been able to supply to the public on the details of this Act. Noble Lords have mentioned the various leaflets which have been circulated, and they have also alluded, I am glad to have observed, in terms of generous commendation to the personality of the various lecturers who have been round the different parts of the country to explain the Act. At the same time some complaint seemed to be expressed that these lecturers were not, perhaps, sufficiently primed with information, and that they expressed themselves in certain cases unable to answer questions which were put to them. We certainly should desire that the lecturers should give every possible information on any point which has been decided, but it clearly would not have been wise of them to express a personal opinion upon a disputed point to which Government sanction had not been actually given. And, above all, I am certain that they have been most careful, in a manner which noble Lords opposite would commend, to abstain from the smallest appearance of holding a brief for the Government in this matter, using the Government in the political sense, and that they have confined themselves to the bare skeleton of the Act
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0031"/>
<col>53</col>
and the explanation of its details without anything that could be regarded as most remotely connected with political argument.<lb/>
On the question of delay our argument is that, even if we postponed the coming into operation of the Act, we should not be able to bring the process of explanation and information home until the Act is actually in operation. That is to say, supposing the Government agreed to a postponement the only effect would be that the actual bringing home to the people of the meaning and working of the Act would also have to be postponed, and you would gain very little in the way of general knowledge during such an interval; whereas it may be hoped that within six months or a year after the Act has been actually brought into operation public information will be increased to a large, indeed almost to a surprising, extent. Noble Lords very naturally dwelt on the particular difficulties which attach to the dissemination of information and to the ensuring of a grasp of the Act in rural districts. We fully admit the existence of those difficulties. It is obvious, as the noble Lord who spoke last said, that in scattered districts where there is by no means the amount of conversation, in comparison, which takes place in more crowded areas, and where, without suggesting any imputation on the ability of the rural labourer, which I should be the last to make, the absence of that conversation and frequent society has a tendency to make people's minds work more slowly than is the case in crowded districts, a special difficulty exists, and we are proportionately grateful to those who reside in the country who have given time and trouble to assist both in the explanation of the Act and in the work, as to the importance of which I fully agree, of consolidating and joining together for the purposes of this Act the various rural societies. I should like to say that I fully agree with the noble Lord who spoke last as to the importance of some of these small rural societies, many of them of long standing, and I entirely appreciate that they are regarded with a peculiar and intimate sort of affection by those who belong to them, who would dislike and resent, if such a thing were possible, being forced into one of the large and to them somewhat bleak sort of societies in place of the smaller body with which they are familiar.<lb/>
<col>54</col>
And among those who have contributed the help to which I have referred I am well aware that many members of your Lordships' House are numbered. I know that the noble Lord who has made this Motion has presided at more than one such meeting. I think I am right in saying that the noble Marquess opposite (Lord Lansdowne) has played a not inconsiderable part in his county in helping on this work. I am aware that Lord St. Audries has also been active, and should like particularly to mention his Lord Lieutenant, Earl Fortescue, who has given a great deal of time and trouble to helping to start the Act in Devonshire. It is only right also to mention in this regard that a great many of the friendly societies have themselves circulated private papers of information to their members, which I have no doubt have been of service in informing the public generally of the more complicated parts of this Act. I hope Lord St. Audries will forgive me if I do not attempt to deal with the interesting legal point which he mentioned, as to how far a. free cottage is or is not considered as forming part of the wages of an agricultural labourer. That is a legal point with which I have no doubt one of my noble friends will deal.<lb/>
One other point I desire to mention is this, not so much because there is any misapprehension in this House, because I do not think there is, but it is desirable surely to dissipate any misapprehension which may exist outside. Noble Lords have spoken freely of the Act coming into operation on July 15 as though at that time, on that date, everybody had to be a member of an approved society or become a deposit contributor. It is desirable to make it markedly clear, although I know it has been admitted by one noble Lord, that such is not the case, but that a further three months will exist after July 15 during which that choice can be made. Everybody has a free choice until October as to whether he will join an approved society, and, if so, what, or whether he will become a deposit contributor. It is, I think, desirable to attempt to remove the confusion which seems to exist in some quarters, although again I do not say that it at all exists here, as to what has to be done with regard to domestic servants. Domestic servants bring their cards, and if a servant fails to get a card his or her employer can get one. During the three
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0032"/>
<col>55</col>
months while the servant is deciding to what approved society he or she will belong the stamps are placed on the card, and when October comes the servant takes the card to the society and gets the benefit of the value of the stamps. Even supposing the servant does not find the right approved society by October, say not for some months later, he or she would still get the benefit of the reserve value acquired up to that time.<lb/>
It is important to point out that it is not the case that if the master or mistress fails to deduct 3<i>d.</i> from the servant's wages he or she is thereby subject to a penalty. He or she is entitled to make the deduction, but is not compelled to make it. What has to be done is to see that the stamps are affixed in accordance with the regulation. There has, I fear, been some misapprehension in the public mind as to the manner in which penalties are liable to be incurred. There have been, I think, cases before in which somewhat widespread terror has been caused by the appearance on Government circulars of the penalty which is attached to the non-performance of a public duty. That, no doubt, is an alarming fact to some recipients of public circulars, but I venture to say that the amount which, if people are merely ordinarily careful, will be received in penalties in connection with this affixing of stamps will not be such as to add to the revenue any sum which is likely to be appreciated by my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The risk of incurring penalties is, I venture to assert, a slight one. It is slight, I also venture to assert, even in the case of those casual labourers to whom Lord St. Audries drew attention in an amusing picture of a casual labourer who works on different days in the week for different employers. That, I take it, was meant to be a somewhat extreme instance. I have no close knowledge of the West of England, but the number of casual agricultural labourers who change their employment as frequently as that is, I venture to think, small in most parts of England. The noble Earl, Lord Camperdown mentioned the case of hop-pickers. The arrangements to which he drew attention were the result of a series of conversations with deputations from hop farmers in the South, and were arrived at, as I am told, by agreement between the Commissioners and the hop farmers.</membercontribution></p>
<col>56</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00222"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Did the farmers understand that they would have to inquire into the antecedents of all their hop-pickers?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00223"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I was going to draw attention to the fact that the noble Earl had seemed to indicate that the farmer would have to apply himself to a study of the biography of every hop-picker who came into his temporary service. I take it that what would actually happen is this. When a hop-picker goes to receive his wages&#x2014;whether they are weekly wages or not I confess I do not know, but I imagine they are generally weekly&#x2014;the farmer would ask him whether he had an insurance card, and if the hop-picker could not produce a card&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00224"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Marquess will look at draft Order No. 1A he will see that a hop-picker is put out of the Act unless he was immediately before in employment. As I understand the Order, it means that if the man had just previously to his hop-picking been engaged, say, in a factory, he would then be liable for the 4<i>d.</i> and his employer would be liable for the 3<i>d.</i> Therefore the employer, in order to know whether he is liable, would have to ascertain whether or not the hop-picker had been previously employed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00225"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Yes; but clearly he would have to take the word of the hop-picker as to what his previous occupation had been. I think it would take the form of saying, "Have you an insurance card?" and either the man would produce one or he would not. I confess I do not see, from the way my noble friend puts it, in what manner the employer would become liable to a penalty supposing the hop-picker failed to produce his card. However, this is one of those minor points from which I expressed my intention of keeping aloof in these few remarks, and therefore I pass from it. I will merely say that, speaking generally and after listening with close attention to what has fallen from the three noble Lords, I cannot believe that we are wrong to start the machine in the manner in which we propose to start it. It is quite easy, I admit, to produce cases, particularly what may be called typical, but which are, in one sense, imaginary cases, which indicate the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0033"/>
<col>57</col>
possibility of much confusion arising in the minds of individuals. I do not doubt also that there is, and that there will be for some little time, in the minds of many of those affected no little share of the perplexity and doubt to which noble Lords have alluded, but I have endeavoured to show that that state of affairs is inseparable from the introduction of a great measure involving so much novelty, some novelty in principle and much novelty in detail, and affecting hundreds of thousands of people who are not accustomed to study closely the detail of any subject. Where I confess I do remain unconvinced is that that state of things would be at all bettered by a postponement, either for three or for six months, to an extent which would outweigh the inconvenience that we are informed must necessarily result from such postponement.<lb/>
I do not hesitate to say that if it is found that there are sections in the Act which either involve a wrong method of proceeding, or which might be so amended or improved as to more completely grease the wheels of the machine, we shall not pause in introducing a Bill with amending clauses for that purpose. I hope that may not prove to be necessary; but I assert quite frankly that nobody&#x2014;not, I believe, the most experienced of noble Lords in this house or any of those outside the House who are most conversant with local conditions and with the lives of the people specially affected by this Bill&#x2014;can say with confidence whether some amendment of the terms of this Act may or may not be necessary. That is a matter on which wise people will, I think, reserve their judgment until the Act has been in operation for a short time; and I should be indeed glad if I thought that your Lordships were prepared to agree that the noble Lords opposite have not really proved their case, that in the interests of the public it is better to start the machine in the manner in which we propose, and that there are at any rate fair grounds for supposing that no harm will be done by what noble Lords consider so great an acceleration, but which we consider to be merely the most practical method of getting to work with as little delay as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00226"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friends who brought this matter before the House are at any rate fortunate in one respect. They have not
<col>58</col>
been met from the Bench opposite by a rebuke or by the imputation that their action has been the result of sinister motives. The noble Marquess, indeed, stated a moment ago that he was very far from objecting to the course which they had taken. In fact, be welcomed it. He even bestowed the golden largesse of his praise upon some members of this House who have interested themselves locally in preparing for the coming into operation of the Insurance Act, and he told us that in his opinion it was conceivable that amending legislation might be necessary. The noble Marquess will forgive me if I remind the House that His Majesty's Government have two voices when they are discussing this question, and that the voice which comes from the courteous lips of the Leader of this House is only one of those voices. May I be permitted to give to the House an example of the other voice? I happened to notice a few days ago a letter addressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer during the course of a recent by-election to the Liberal candidate, and I find that in that letter the noble Marquess's colleague said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Tory Party were doing their best to postpone and prevent the actual enjoyment of these great advantages by the working classes so that they [the working classes] should not find out too soon how they had been deceived by Tory canvassers&#x2026;The Tory Party are getting perfectly frantic in their eagerness to put off the Act so that the people should not really know what has been done for them."</quote>
That is what I ventured to describe a moment ago as the imputation, the most unjust imputation, of sinister motives to those who, like my noble friends, consider that there are excellent reasons, reasons which the noble Marquess himself thinks worthy of discussion, for considering whether the operation of this Act should not be postponed for a while.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, is the request of my noble friends really an unwarranted one I think Lord Heneage was perfectly justified when at the outset of his speech he reminded the House of the Parliamentary history of the Act which we are discussing. That Act was not preceded by any inquiry, and in that respect there is a striking contrast between what happened in Germany when the question of insurance was dealt with and what happened in this country&#x2014;a contrast striking both in regard to the amount of time allotted respectively
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0034"/>
<col>59</col>
in the two countries and in regard to the amount of expense to which the public was put in each case. Let me give the House the figures for the purposes of comparison. In the case of Germany&#x2014;and I am taking my figures from the same letter of the Chancellor of the Exchequer which I quoted a moment ago&#x2014;the total cost to the public of a national insurance which covers old-age pensions, sickness, and permanent infirmity, was &#x00A3;3,000,000 sterling. In the case of this country the Chancellor informs us that the expense incurred for the same purposes this year will be &#x00A3;15,000,000, and that it will eventually reach &#x00A3;20,000,000, of which I suppose &#x00A3;8,000,000 may be charged to the Insurance Act; and yet the German measure took five or six years to prepare, while this Act received only fifteen months' investigation. Apart from this, we have none of us forgotten that the Insurance Bill was absolutely transformed during its passage through the House of Commons, and that clause after clause of the measure went through without any discussion or examination at all. Of course, the result was what might have been expected. We have in our hands a measure which all insist is a crude and imperfect measure, and His Majesty's Government are perfectly aware of the fact, for what other reason, indeed, did they put into the Bill the proviso suggesting the idea that it might be necessary to postpone the operation of the Act? It was, of course, put in upon the presumption that when the time came none of the parties interested in the Act might be found ready.<lb/>
Well, are they ready? Are either those who are going to administer these benefits or those who are going to be the recipients of them ready? It is idle to pretend that they are, and the noble Marquess himself does not for a moment suggest it. Then what was the argument of the noble Marquess? He turned to us and said, "Oh, you want everything to be cut and dried before the Act is to come into operation." No, my Lords, I do not think we do. I can well conceive that there should be omitted points and unsolved difficulties when the Act comes into operation, but before the Act comes into operation do let us emerge from the region of chaos and confusion in which we find ourselves at the present time. Do let us try and get out of this atmosphere of lecturers, leaflets, pamphlets, and Provisional Rules by
<col>60</col>
which this question is fogged and confused. The noble Marquess says it will all come right&#x2014;<i>solvitur ambulando.</i> But suppose we amble into a quagmire. Will the noble Marquess remain quite satisfied, and is he certain that this <i>experimentum in corpore vili</i> which he recommends may not result in great hardship to a number of people whom we all wish to treat considerately and justly? The fact is that the success of this Act depends on the construction of a vast network of machinery of an extraordinarily intricate character, partly constructed by private agency and partly by Governmental and Departmental agency, and my noble friends have been able to show that that machinery, far from being ready to be set in motion on an early day, on the 15th of next month, is at this moment out of gear and incomplete, and that the working of it is hardly understood at all by many of those who will be most affected by its operation.<lb/>
Something has been said during the course of this discussion as to the manner in which the question of postponement is regarded by the friendly societies themselves. I think the noble Marquess stated that he believed the great societies were in favour of proceeding without further delay. I am told that at the meetings which took place at Whitsuntide the great societies, on the contrary, in most cases showed evident signs of a desire for more time to acquaint themselves with the probable working of the Act. But what of the Government themselves? Are they ready? They are improvising this machinery, altering it from day to day, putting it together without sufficient time for consideration, and" inundating the country with advice and exhortation and explanation which I am sorry to say in most cases has only added to the confusion of mind which prevails. Then I should like to ask the noble Marquess, What about the Commissioners themselves? Are they quite ready? Are they pressing the Government to go ahead without any delay? I have had no communication with them and do not know what their views are, but I should very much like the Insurance Commissioners to be allowed to vote by ballot on the question of postponement or no postponement. Again, the Advisory Committee, which we know will play a part of such immense importance in these transactions, was only brought together, if I remember aright, in the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0035"/>
<col>61</col>
month of May, with three months to constitute itself and acquaint itself with the immense volume of difficult business which it will have to transact. Then there are the Insurance Committees? I fancy there will be about 260 of these altogether. They are to number between forty and eighty members apiece, and three-fifths of those members are to represent members of approved societies. But very few of the approved societies are yet in existence. If you consider the stipulations of Section 59 it seems to me quite impossible that those committees can be set up in accordance with the provisions of the Act, and no doubt it is for that reason that we are having, not only provisional regulations, but provisional committees set up to bridge the gulf.<lb/>
What is true of the Insurance Committees is still more true, I think, of those district committees which will be formed under the Insurance Committees, and which will have to do what I suppose may be described as the spade work of this business throughout the country. Between 1,000 and 2,000 of these committees will, I am told, be necessary, and they are to be appointed by the Insurance Commission within six months under schemes to be prepared after consultation with the county councils and approved by the Insurance Commissioners. Now how are all those conditions going to be complied with with any approach to decency in the time which is at command? In all those respects I maintain that my noble friends are right when they contend that we are not ready, and shall not be ready by the 15th of next month, to set this Act in motion.<lb/>
But, my Lords, hardest of all seems to be the case so well touched upon by my noble friend Lord St. Audries&#x2014;the case of the smaller clubs. I desire to associate myself entirely with him in what he said as to the important part that these small clubs play in our village life, and as to the cruel injustice of doing anything which would have the effect of depriving them of the <i>status</i> and position which they now enjoy. I know that both the Act and the Regulations provide, and I think provide in a reasonable spirit, for arrangements under which these smaller societies will be allowed to retain, at any rate in great measure, their independence and their individuality. But they want time to look around, and what we are afraid of is
<col>62</col>
that in your hot haste you will hustle these small clubs, either into winding themselves up and perhaps allowing their members to become deposit contributors, or into joining without adequate consideration and without sufficient knowledge of the facts other societies perhaps not properly constituted and perhaps not of the complexion which these little clubs would really desire to join if they had full opportunity of considering their position.<lb/>
It is within the knowledge of most of us who have taken any interest in what is passing in the country at this moment that many of these little clubs have been seriously considering whether they should not dissolve. In fact, I am under the impression that some have dissolved already. His Majesty's Government are quite aware of the importance of this matter, and that is one of the points to which the circulars which are falling so thickly all over the country are directed. I received a circular the other day dealing with the question and offering some extremely well-meant suggestions as to the kind of action which might be taken. It is numbered A S 31, and an extremely elaborate account is given of the different alternatives which are open to the existing societies. They may fall in under a scheme of centralisation, under a scheme of affiliation, or under a scheme of association&#x2014;these are all technical expressions which now will become part of the jargon of this question; but I will undertake to say that if this paper were put into the hands of the secretary of an ordinary village club and he was given an hour to read it and then told to explain what courses were really open to his club he would be absolutely incapable of doing it. There are other documents of the same character. There is a little leaflet, No. 13, in which there is more official jargon of the same kind, and in which the alternatives open to these clubs are described in language which I am entirely unable to reconcile with the language of the circular that I have just quoted. I merely mention this because it seems to me to be an illustration of the manner in which we are puzzling the people of this country by the avalanche of documents which is being scattered broadcast.<lb/>
Then as to the question of postponement. Should we really be depriving anybody of
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0036"/>
<col>63</col>
any substantial advantages if the operation of the Act were postponed for a few weeks or a few months? What can you do when the Act comes into operation? You can do nothing in respect either of maternity benefit or medical benefit or sick benefit. In the case of sanatoria benefit you can do only what you may be able to do with the existing inadequate accommodation, and, as far as we know, without the co-operation of the doctors, which, after all, counts for a good deal in this matter. Disablement benefit cannot come into operation for a year's time, so that, as my noble friend put it, you are in this position. You have entered into a contract with those who will pay these contributions under the Act. They are to pay their contributions, and you are to produce certain benefits in return. You will receive the contributions, but you will not be able to produce the benefits. What you will be able to do, no doubt, will be to pay the little army of officials of all kinds with which you are covering the country, most of them, remember, appointed altogether outside the scope of the Civil Service Commission and therefore without any guarantee whatever of their fitness for the work.<lb/>
One word only as to the doctors. Your Lordships probably have not forgotten that quite recently, on May 1, the House of Commons passed without a Division a Resolution that the Insurance Act will fail to confer medical benefit until the cooperation of the doctors is assured. I hope we shall be told to-night whether His Majesty's Government are in a position to hold out any hopes to us that the co-operation of the doctors has been secured. The doctors have been alternately cajoled and intimidated, but, so far as I have been able to observe, neither the cajolery nor the intimidation have been successful in driving them away from their point. A deputation of the doctors was received by the Chancellor of the Exchequer about a week ago. He treated them respectfully, I will say that, on that occasion. He then invited them to submit a statement of the facts upon which they based their claim, and they promised to do so. I should like to know whether that statement has been put in, and whether His Majesty's Government discover in it any hope of that co-operation without which obviously the Act must be to a great extent a failure. I do not know whether the point is one that I can reasonably ask
<col>64</col>
for information upon, but it would be interesting to know whether, supposing His Majesty's Ministers are not able to come to terms with the doctors, they have in view any other plan for obtaining the assistance of the medical profession. If I might put it quite crudely, is it their intention to bring in "strike-breakers" for the purpose and thus obtain the assistance that they desire?<lb/>
My noble friends have touched, and I do not think I need follow them except to a very slight extent, upon some of the unsolved and still outstanding difficulties of the Act. We have not received an answer to the point which was raised in regard to the employment of what I think is called seasonal labour. It has not been explained how an employer is to satisfy himself when he takes on a casual labourer whether the contribution is due in respect of the man and whether as a matter of fact it has been paid; and, as my noble friends have pointed out, this is the case where the new offence created by the Regulations comes in, and where the &#x00A3;10 penalty not mentioned in the Act itself but introduced in these Provisional Regulations, appears for the first time. Then there is another point that I do not think has been touched upon&#x2014;I mean the case of the married woman. The history of the case of the married woman outworker is rather a singular one. At first these out-workers were included within the scope of the Bill. Then at a rather remarkable moment&#x2014;the Somerset by-election happened to be going on&#x2014;wives of insured persons were promised exemption with suspicious alacrity. But since that a further complication has arisen. His Majesty's Government have appointed a committee to deal with the question, and the committee has advised to the effect that if the scheme is to be an equitable one they must be included with all the other outworkers. So that first they were put in, then they were left out under pressure, and now the committee suggest that they should be put in again. Perhaps the noble Lord who will follow me will explain how the matter stands. With regard to the moot question of domestic servants I will only say this, that it is a little remarkable that, considering the extreme difficulty of that part of the case, no explanatory leaflet dealing with it has, so far as I am aware, yet been issued. If I am right in regard
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0037"/>
<col>65</col>
to that, it is a remarkable piece of evidence. The point that I particularly refer to is the question of substituted benefits under use 13. I do not think any explanation been vouchsafed upon that point.<lb/>
I will not take up the time of the House by going further into these somewhat technical matters, but I would like to ask whether the noble Lord who will follow me can tell us that the postponement of the operation of the Act would really injuriously affect the interests of any of those who are concerned in this piece of legislation. So far as His Majesty's Government are concerned&#x2014;and we know how closely they are officially mixed up in the whole of the machinery of the Act&#x2014;would it not be to them a relief to be given little more time to turn round? So far as the societies go, would it not be a fair and reasonable thing that they should not be hurried into a decision which must so vitally affect their interests in the future? And, lastly, would it not be in entire accordance with the intentions of Parliament, which expressly provided for the possibility of postponement, that such a postponement should take place in circumstances which seem to most of us so urgently to call for it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00227"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lord, if I venture to take part in this debate for a brief period, it is because I have taken a deep interest in this Act and to some extent co-operated in the preparation of its machinery. I think that no one who has listened to this debate can regret that it has taken place. It has given evidence of interest in and study of this intricate subject, and it has drawn attention to points of difficulty which only become realised when people have to consider these things from a practical standpoint. The debate has shown something else. The speeches that have been delivered have given us ample evidence that many of your Lordships, I think a good many, are doing on this occasion what you have done on other occasions&#x2014;you steadily refuse to allow the issue to be mixed up with politics. Many of you may and probably do object to the way in which this Act is being worked, but I have not gathered from any noble Lord who has spoken that he has not put his best ability into assisting the working of the machinery of the Act in that part of the country with
<col>66</col>
which he is concerned. I think it is a great feature in this country that this should be so. I had myself cause to appreciate it in connection with the intricate arrangements for bringing the Territorial Force into operation, and I shall ever be grateful to many of your Lordships for your assistance in that matter. Perhaps it is just this practical character of the British mind that makes this question one which is sure to be brought up in the form in which it has been brought up to-day. I think it is a great advantage that it should be so.<lb/>
But the present issue is whether it would not be better to postpone bringing the Act into operation to a period subsequent to July 15. If your Lordships will allow me, I will give some reasons which make me think that postponement would he a very great evil indeed. I am well aware of the difficulties of launching a new system of the kind, well aware of the time that was taken in Germany; but in Germany the whole machinery was the machinery of the State, whereas the scheme of this Act is to work through the existing friendly and other societies. That makes a great difference. If you postponed the coming into force of this Act you would injure the societies in a very serious way. Their members are already dropping off because of the new system which is coming into existence, and if you asked the best and most experienced of them I believe they would tell you that at this moment there is no evil they would regard as so great as the postponement of the coming into operation of this Act. Up to the present time societies have been approved representing about 5,000,000 of insured persons, and they are being added to. These are the latest figures, and they show that within the last few weeks rapid progress has been made. Therefore I say it would be a very great evil to expose these societies to the risk of seeing their <i>clientele</i> fall off by reason of the machinery not being ready.<lb/>
I turn to the side of the State. I did not gather from the noble Marquess that he had as clearly put before his mind what would be the effect of postponement as regards benefits. If payments are postponed there would have to be postponement of the time from which benefits would accrue. To take any other course, to defer payments for three months and at the same time let the benefits come into
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0038"/>
<col>67</col>
operation at the time appointed, would necessitate a sum of &#x00A3;3,000,000 being provided from the coffers of the State. My right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has a large surplus just now, but it is possible that it may be wanted for other purposes, and it is not desirable to create a new mode of applying that surplus unless there is strict necessity. To my mind there are very formidable difficulties in postponement.<lb/>
Now turn to the other kind of difficulties. I ask your Lordships to visualise what will happen on July 15. When wages become due&#x2014;it may be a week later than July 15&#x2014;the employer, on making the payment, would ask the servant for his or her insurance card, which the servant can obtain at a Post Office, and to this card the necessary stamps would be affixed. If the servant does not produce a card, a card will have to be obtained by the employer. It is a very simple procedure. You have to see that the servant has a card upon which the stamps can be placed or else you send for a card yourself, and you must not pay wages without going through these formalities. It is a simple procedure, and I venture to say that in a few years it will become a matter of course. I have been told in Germany that all sorts of objections were raised there at first, but the system has become so much part of the national life and the benefits of this great system have been so clearly realised in Germany that it is regarded as a matter of daily routine to do the stamping.<lb/>
Various other difficulties have been put by some of your Lordships. It is asked how is the servant to find his society; it might not be ready by July 15. That may be so. There is an immense deal to be done, but it need not all be done by July 15. For three months after that there is nothing necessary except to put the stamps on the card and so secure payment of the contributions. By that time a great many more societies will have been approved than have been approved up to the present. As I have informed your Lordships, up to the present time societies approved represent 5,000,000 of insured persons. Five millions is a substantial fraction out of the 14,000,000 who will be insured when the Act comes into full operation. I think it will happen very
<col>68</col>
often in the country that the servant will not wish to join a society at once, but will prefer to keep his card until the little society he wishes to join is ready. But let the system come into operation. These little societies may take the form of dividing societies, slate clubs, or what not. It is a great fallacy to suppose that no society with less than 5,000 members can be registered. The smallest society can be registered, subject to the section of it devoted to this form of insurance being managed by the members themselves and not being conducted for profit. They do not need to federate with any other society. They need only to be brought together with other societies and pooled for the purpose of valuation of assets; but that takes place at a later time.<lb/>
I do not propose to go into the details of that further than to say that I listened with the greatest interest to the practical speech which Lord St. Audries made. I agree with him that it is in the most eminent degree desirable that small societies should be encouraged to work together more than they have done in the past. The business which they will have to undertake is new and on a larger scale than hitherto, and it is better that there should not be a multitude of these small societies working independently but that they should work together. We feel that these societies form part of the life of the country, and therefore it is desirable that plenty of opportunity should be given them in order to enable them to get upon their feet. As I have said, no one will need to join a society for three months, and at the end of three months he need not join a society but can become a deposit contributor, and if he does not wish to remain a deposit contributor he can withdraw his account and transfer himself to a society. So that really the 15th of July, about which date conjured up, means nothing except that persons will have to put stamps on the cards. But it will have the beneficial effect of waking a great many people up to the unknown terrors of this system. People cannot learn to swim without going into the water, and one of the advantages of bringing this Act into early operation is this, that we shall all learn to swim. When July 15 comes we shall apply our minds to this new branch of our domestic relations.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0039"/>
<col>69</col>
The noble Marquess asked whether the Insurance Commissioners were ready. If he had asked that question a month ago I should have said that the Commissioners were not ready, but great efforts have been made during the past month. The whole resources of the Civil Service have been placed, as far as they could be, at the disposal of the Commission, and immense progress has been made. I do not wish to trouble your Lordships in detail with what has been done, but, speaking for myself, I anticipate that the whole of the machinery will be in working order by the time when something has to be done&#x2014;that is to say, by October, when people are expected to join their approved societies. The noble Marquess also asked about the position as regards the doctors. His Majesty's Government fully realise the situation as regards the medical profession and the extreme desirability of carrying the doctors with us in a cordial spirit and of enlisting their co-operation in this great experiment, but in view of the fact that negotiations are now going on I think it would be undesirable that I should say more on the subject at this moment.<lb/>
Then the noble Marquess referred to the case of the hop-pickers. Hop-picking, by an Order, has been exempted from insurance as being a kind of subsidiary employment that would not ordinarily come into it; but it has been said that a hop-picker is to come in if he is a person who is ordinarily in employment. All the farmer has to do is to ask the hop-picker whether he has been in employment and whether he has a card. If the hop-picker deceives the farmer the farmer will not be fined for believing him. All the farmer will have to do will be to put the question. Another point was raised by Lord St. Audries, who asked whether, in the case of a man who, in addition to his wages, had a free cottage and other emoluments, the value of the cottage and the other emoluments would be counted in. Yes, they would. They are valued now by the pension officer, who has experience of that kind of work in connection with the Old Age Pensions Act. I think I have now dealt with the main points that have arisen in the course of this discussion. The Act does not come into operation on July 15 for practical
<col>70</col>
purposes, except to the limited extent I have explained, and I think it is desirable that it should come into operation then to that limited extent. It will focus people's minds on what they have to learn, and I do not think it would be a service to the country if we postponed the coming into force of the Act. July is a good time to start, and, as I have explained, the burdensome part of the work will not become operative until October. To postpone the payments would, as I have explained, be to postpone the benefits, and it would be a great disappointment if the benefits did not come into operation in January next. I have explained also that the societies would suffer because the confusion which is causing their members to fall off would operate still more severely.<lb/>
My answer to the Marquess's question as to whether it would not be better to postpone the Act is that I do not think a postponement would be advantageous to the country. I admit that it would have been better if we had considered this thing academically for a longer time, but the bulk of people will not take the trouble to learn at all; it is only practice which teaches them. The thing to do is not to postpone a great social reform of this kind, but to do the best we can to bring it into operation. The machinery is sufficiently ready to justify the very limited extent to which the provisions of the Act would impose a burden as from July 15 next. On these grounds I submit that we should be guilty of an error of judgment if we postponed the operation of the Act. That there will be difficulties I do not for a moment deny. I recognise that there are difficulties in applying the Act to the Army and Navy, but still it can be done, and the difficulties are being overcome. In conclusion, I have no hesitation in saying that in my opinion it is to the advantage of the country that this Act should be brought into operation as soon as we reasonably can do so.</membercontribution></p>

<col>76</col>
policy of this measure which was so fully discussed in the debates in the House on the 21st and 22nd of February last. It is, perhaps, safe to assume that the convictions of no member of the House were materially altered by that discussion. Some very divergent views were expressed, and it is probably safe to conclude that those views are still held by those who maintained them. We discussed the question "about and about," and, to continue the quotation, we all of us came out by the same door wherein we went. I assume, therefore, that the noble Earl opposite (Lord Curzon), who was the protagonist on that occasion, maintains his views in the main, and I have certainly no reason to alter mine. I am further absolved from discussing the policy of the question by the fact that, so far as I am aware, there has been no change of opinion in India itself of such a character as to make further discussion necessary. The two principal sets of opponents of the policy&#x2014;that is to say, English Calcutta and Mahomedan Dacca&#x2014;I have no doubt retain the objections which they originally took to the Bill. On the other hand, I see, after observing as closely as I can, no signs of wavering in the general acceptance which the policy received in other parts of India; and even among those who were originally opposed to it there are signs, gratifying signs to us, of a tendency towards acceptance of the policy&#x2014;a tendency which is indicated by a desire to make the best of it, and to obtain such consequent concessions as it is believed can be granted.<lb/>
The Preamble of this Bill states the various Executive acts which have been performed in this country and in India under the powers that belong to His Majesty and to the respective Governments. It has been argued, although it is not a point, I think, on which it is worth while to dwell at any length, that these Executive acts to some extent suffer from being exercised under ancient and archaic Statutes which were passed in circumstances altogether different. It might be observed that all our British liberties, both as subjects of the Crown and as citizens, depend upon very much older Statutes than those which are here in question; but it is more to the point to remark that, as a matter of fact, all the powers which we exercise in relation to the Government of India, practically all the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0043"/>
<col>77</col>
main powers exorcised by the Secretary of State in Council, are simply transferred and taken over bodily from the powers formerly exercised by tie Court of Directors of the East India Company under the direction and control of the Board of Commissioners who at that time administered Indian affairs. The acts, therefore, which the Secretary of State in Council performs every week at the India Office are, if our critics will have it so, open to a kindred objection to that which seems to be taken to the exercise of the administrative powers which preceded this Bill and are mentioned in the Preamble.<lb/>
The steps which were taken were five in number. They were as follow. The Secretary of State in Council declared, by the powers given him in the Act of 1853, that the Governor-General should no longer be Governor of the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal, but that a separate Governor should be appointed for that Presidency. That having been done, His Majesty was pleased to appoint a Governor of the Presidency in the person of Sir Thomas Carmichael, who up to that time had been Governor of Madras. The three other Executive steps were taken in India. The first was the proclamation by the Governor-General in Council of the new Province of Behar and Orissa under a Lieutenant-Governor; that was done under the Act of 1861. The second was the creation of Assam into a Chief Commissionership under the Act of 1854; and the third was the delimitation of the extent of the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal.<lb/>
I now come to the clauses of the Bill. The first clause declares that the Governor of Bengal should have all the rights, duties, and functions which the Governors of Madras and Bombay possess. The effect of this clause is to give the Governor of Bengal those extra powers given by the later enactments&#x2014;that is to say, those subsequent to 1853&#x2014;under which power was taken to apply to any new Presidency the powers which the Governors of the other Presidencies possessed up to that time. Then the House will observe that two provisos are attached to this first clause. Those provisos depend upon the fact that the powers of the Calcutta High Court are not, as matters stand, curtailed, although the area of Bengal is changed and the new
<col>78</col>
Lieutenant-Governorship is created. The power which is pointed to in proviso (<i>a</i>) is this, that the High Courts Acts of 1860 and 1911 give the Governor-General power to appoint temporary Judges for the High Court of Calcutta. Now those Judges, besides administering justice in Bengal itself, will administer it for the Lieutenant-Governorship of Behar and Orissa, and we think that this fact points to the denomination of such temporary Judges by the Governor-General and not by the Governor of Bengal. Proviso (<i>b</i>) also hinges on the fact that for the present we are dealing in no way with the High Court of Calcutta. The Advocate-General of Bengal has hitherto been the Law Officer of the Government of India and also of the Bengal Government; and so long as the two Governments inhabited the same capital it was a reasonable matter that this Advocate-General should be a member of the Legislative Council of Bengal. But now that the separation has taken place, and pending any permanent arrangements which are made in the future with regard to this appointment, that necessity does not exist, and power is accordingly taken in this proviso to absolve, if necessary, the legal adviser of the Government of India from being a member of the Bengal Council.<lb/>
Clause 2 authorises the creation of an Executive Council for the new Lieutenant-Governorship of Behar and Orissa. As I dare say some of your Lordships may I remember, because the question was one which aroused some debate in 1909, the ordinary procedure for creating an Executive Council is by an Order which lies on the Table of both Houses of Parliament for a period, I think, of 60 days. The object of that, of course, is to give Parliament the necessary control, and, if desired, the power of veto on the appointment of such an Executive Council. But since this Bill is being passed through Parliament it is clearly a simpler proceeding and one which would save time to insert the creation of that Executive Council in the Act rather than go through the more cumbersome procedure of allowing the appointment to lie on the Table of Parliament.<lb/>
Clause 3 authorises the Governor-General to constitute Legislative Councils for territories under a Chief Commissioner. The prime object of the inclusion of this
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0044"/>
<col>79</col>
provision is the appointment of a Legislative Council for Assam. Assam, having been part for the last few years of the Lieutenant-Governorship of Eastern Bengal and Assam, has enjoyed the advantages of a Legislative Council, and I am sure that the House will be disposed to agree that it would be not merely an unreasonable slight but a positive disadvantage to indict upon the inhabitants of Assam, who, as your Lordships know, represent for one thing one of the most important industries in India&#x2014;it would he a slight upon them if they were to be deprived of this representation. That, as I say, was the prime reason for introducing tins provision. But it is also true that it will be desirable for the Government of India to take power to constitute a similar Council for the Central Provinces&#x2014;a division which is quite right for such an enhancement of its governmental dignity, if I may use the phrase, and in which the advent of the Council will, as we know, be extremely welcome. Those are, indeed, the two Chief Commissionerships to which Councils are for the time being clearly applicable.<lb/>
Clause 4 explains the changes and repeals set out in the two Parts of the Schedule. In Part I of the Schedule the Act of 1861 is amended by placing the Governor of Bengal in the same position as the Governors of Madras and Bombay for this purpose&#x2014;namely, that the senior Governor should replace the Viceroy when for any reason there is no Viceroy. There has not, I believe, been in fact such a case since the lamentable death of Lord Mayo, because when the noble Lord opposite (Lord Ampthill) took the place of the noble Earl on the Front Bench opposite (Lord Curzon) he was not, I think I am right in saying, Acting-Viceroy, but actual Viceroy for the time being. But it is clearly right that the Governor of Bengal should not be placed in an inferior position to that of his two brother Governors in this respect of automatic succession to a momentary vacancy in the Governorship-General. Part I of the Schedule also names the maximum figures for the two Legislative Councils of Bengal and of Behar and Orissa.<lb/>
Then in Part II of the Schedule there are various repeals. The only one to which I need draw attention is the first&#x2014;Sections 53 and 57 of the East India Company Act, 1793, which refers to the
<col>80</col>
filling up of vacancies in the Indian Civil Service. It is provided in this Act that Civil servants shall be employed in the Presidency to which they were originally allotted and to which they belonged. In the old days when this Act was passed that was a simple enough matter. All India was, like ancient Gaul, divided into three parts: it consisted of Madras and Bombay; all the rest of British India was included in the term Fort William in Bengal. It was therefore reasonable enough that the various divisions should be self-contained and complete. Now, of course, to confine the newly-formed Presidency of Bengal within such a strict rule as that would be contrary to the interests of the public service. But it is right to inform your Lordships that the effect of the repeal will be a somewhat wider one even than that which I have indicated, because the effect of the repeal is that the Civil servants of Madras and Bombay will also become interchangeable with those of Bengal in a manner which has not hitherto been strictly the case.<lb/>
Perhaps I might also explain the point, it is a small one, in the second subsection of Clause 4&#x2014;the power of the Governor-General in Council to make new distributions and arrangements of territories into and among the various Presidencies and Lieutenant-Governorships. There has been some doubt as to what the power of the Governor-General is in these respects. The legal assumption is that, although the Governor-General in Council is empowered to transfer any territory by alteration of boundaries from a Chief-Commissionership to a Presidency, or to a Lieutenant-Governorship, it is not possible for him, owing to the wording of the Act of Parliament, to carry out the reverse process. There seems to be no conceivable object in such a restriction, and it disappears under subsection (2) of Clause 4.<lb/>
I am afraid I have detained the House at somewhat undue length over those technical explanations, but, although technical, the subject is one of such importance that it is advisable to make clear this measure, which sins even to an unusual extent in modern legislation in respect of being legislation by reference. I am not without hope that one of these days we shall be able to introduce a consolidating measure which will reduce to order the amazing tangle of all these old Acts of
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0045"/>
<col>81</col>
Parliament relating to the Government of India. It will be possible, I hope, to do that without introducing any controversial matter, and even I should hope in the main without introducing anything which could be called new matter; and I have no doubt that noble Lords opposite who are interested in India will also agree that it would be a serviceable thing to do. At any rate, it would avoid the long and technical explanation which I have been obliged to give tins afternoon of matters which, though connected with a highly important subject, cannot in themselves be deemed to be of great importance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00284">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>The Marquess of Crewe.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00285"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON or KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess has treated tins Bill, it is true, with respect, but as if it were a Bill of no great importance. The Bill is in itself a very small Bill; it has the appearance almost of being a trumpery measure. It is concerned, as the noble Marquess told us, with the technical details arising out of the policy that has been pursued by his Government in India. There is not, therefore, very much in the clauses of the Bill which apparently it is necessary for us to discuss; but, of course, every one of your Lordships knows that the Bill masks what the Secretary of State himself, in an earlier Despatch, described as one of the most momentous changes that have ever taken place in the Government of India. Consequently it is impossible for some of us, at any rate, to consider the Bill without relation to the policy which it embodies. In the remarks which I have to make I shall, therefore, be compelled to travel rather beyond the ground that has been traversed by the noble Marquess, and to deal with the Bill in a fuller spirit than perhaps the actual phraseology of its clauses would seem to justify.<lb/>
I think that Parliament has some right to complain of the manner in which it has been treated with reference to this transfer of the seat of Government in India. I am not alluding to the pronouncement that was made by His Majesty the King at Delhi. Whatever I had to say on that matter I said several months ago in your Lordships' House. I discharged my responsibility upon that occasion, and I should not think of repeating what I then said. But we were undoubtedly led by
<col>82</col>
what the Prime Minister said at the beginning of the session to believe that the consent of Parliament would be asked by legislation, not merely to the technical details embraced by this Bill, but to the whole policy in its broader aspect. These were his words&#x2014;
<quote>"The Government propose to challenge the judgment of Parliament in regard, first of all, to the removal of the seat of Government from Calcutta to Delhi."</quote>
Such has always been the procedure on previous occasions of great changes in the Government of India&#x2014;notably, of course, with the Government of India Act of 1858&#x2014;and such I believe was the original intention of the Government in the present case, for I have been told; on what I believe to be good authority, that this Bill as originally drafted was a very much larger affair than that which we are discussing this evening. But subsequently the Government appear to have modified their policy, and, as the Secretary of State indicated, all the Statutes and Acts of Government&#x2014;I do not complain that they are archaic, to use his phrase&#x2014;have been ransacked in order to find in them various sections or subsections which might justify the Government of India in proceeding as far as possible by Executive act&#x2014;that is to say, by Proclamation and by notification in that country.<lb/>
The result is that this Bill is a mere bantling, consisting of the odds and ends which could not be covered by the most vigilant search in the existing Statute-book. If you look at the Bill you will find no mention of Delhi in it at all. There is no mention even of the transfer of the seat of Government. You might really think, from the title of the Bill, that the important feature of the policy of the Government had been the appointment of a separate Governor of Fort William in Bengal, and that all we had to do was to consider the changes consequential upon that. I imagine that the transfer of the capital is really covered by the phrase "other administrative changes in the local government of India." Well, my Lords, if that be so I would say that so big a policy had never been described by so exiguous a title. This seems to me to be a very strange and debatable procedure. It is really a part of the mystery and secrecy that have attended these proceedings from the start. One might have thought that, with a policy so
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0046"/>
<col>83</col>
popular as the Secretary of State has once again claimed the action of the Government to be, they would have sought every opportunity of obtaining public and Parliamentary sanction to their conduct. But that has not been the case, and their one idea seems, on the contrary, to have been to deprive us of any opportunity of saying anything about the matter at all.<lb/>
This House is placed, therefore, in rather an invidious position. In the first place, we are called upon to give our assent to acts which the Secretary of State has distinctly told us have already been carried out. As he said, the new Governor of Bengal was appointed months ago, long before the administrative boundaries of his Province were determined. The same has been the case with regard to the Provinces of Behar and Orissa and of Assam. The same thing is going on at Delhi, where ground is being bought and the policy is being carried out. We are then in this position. We cannot amend this Bill even if it were desired, because the Bill only touches the fringes of the bigger policy which is behind, and because any amendment we might make would be utterly ineffective. Still less can we reject the Bill, because if we were to throw it out we should, of course, make the Government of India ridiculous, and should be thought to be guilty, although it would be an unjust suspicion, of disloyalty to the King. The Secretary of State did not defend himself with the plea, which has been urged in another place, that what the Government are doing by this Bill is the equivalent of what was done by the so-called Partition of Bengal for which my Government was responsible in 1905. That plea, if he had used it, would only hold good in so far as the readjustment of provincial boundaries was concerned. But you have gone beyond that. You have embarked upon a great policy embodying a transfer of the capital, costing millions of money, and, one may almost say, altering the whole basis of our rule in India. My point is that the whole of the larger aspects of your policy you have carried through without the consent of Parliament at all, and I imagine, whatever be the reception your policy has met with, that as regards your procedure this will stand out in history as one of the most irregular, and, as I think, most unconstitutional proceedings which have ever taken place with regard to the
<col>84</col>
Government of India, and you have created a model which I, for my part, firmly hope will never be imitated in the future.<lb/>
The Bill, as I have said, deals with details, and I will only allude to two of the details to which the Secretary of State specifically called our attention. The first is Clause 2, which provides for the creation of an Executive Council in the new Province of Behar and Orissa. I regard this provision in the Bill as tantamount to an evasion of the Indian Councils Act of 1909. When we passed that Act the one condition on which your Lordships gave your consent to it&#x2014;it was really part of a compromise with the Government&#x2014;was this, that when any new Executive Council was to be created in India it should not be done until the draft Proclamation of the Viceroy constituting it had been laid on the Table of this House and received the assent of your Lordships. It was in the power of your Lordships' House, if you objected, to move an Address to the Crown, in which case, of course, the proposal would have fallen to the ground. What was our object in doing that? I think it was a little more than what the Secretary of State indicated just now. Our object was that each case should be considered on its merits as it arose; that we should have given to us here the opinion of the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province concerned as to whether he wanted an Executive Council or not, and that we should thus know whether we were really creating something which was required by the needs of the Province. But now, instead of laying the Proclamation on the Table, the matter is dealt with by a clause in this Bill, and the Secretary of State tells us he has adopted this plan because the procedure is a simpler one. Does that cover the whole ground? In my view there is the greatest difference between the two situations. As I have said, under the procedure provided for by the Indian Councils Act it would have been in the power of this House alone, if it so chose, to stop the creation of such a Council, but under this Bill we can do nothing of the kind. We cannot cut out this single clause. Our hands are tied in the matter. We have no freedom. Therefore it does seem to me that the action of His Majesty's Government amounts to a distinct abrogation of the rights claimed only three years ago and enjoyed by this House.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0047"/>
<col>85</col>
May I ask a question about this Executive Council for Behar and Orissa? It is to cost, we have been told in the House of Commons, &#x00A3;13,300 per annum. May I ask who wants it? Has the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province asked for it? Is it required by the needs of the Province? You will have the rather absurd spectacle of Behar and Orissa, admittedly&#x2014;I do not say it with any disrespect&#x2014;one of the backward Provinces in India, with the full machinery of a Lieutenant-Governor and Executive Council, and side by side with it you will have the United Provinces, one of the most enlightened and progressive Provinces in India, with a Lieutenant-Governor, but with no Legislative Council at all. That is a real anomaly.<lb/>
The second point arising out of the Bill is this. The Government state in the title of this Bill that its provisions are "consequential on the appointment of a separate Governor of Fort William in Bengal." But Clause 3, as explained by the noble Marquess, is obviously nothing of the sort. Under this clause you take power to create Legislative Councils, not merely for the Chief Commissionerships of Assam and the Central Provinces, as explained by the Secretary of State, but also for any or all Chief Commissionerships in India. Thus it might be, though I do not say it will arise, that in the future the Governor-General in Council, with or even without the consent of the Secretary of State, will create Legislative Councils in the North-West Frontier Province, or in Baluchistan, or in Ajmer or Coorg, or in the Andaman Islands, though I shudder to think what a Legislative Council in the Andaman Islands, constituted even of the most reputable of the inhabitants, might be. Whether that policy is a right or a wrong one, it is not consequential on the change of capital, it has nothing whatever to do with this Bill, and I venture to say that this clause&#x2014;Clause 3&#x2014;ought not to have found any place in this measure at all.<lb/>
I pass from these smaller details to the much wider issues which are involved in this measure and which it is impossible to ignore. I hope I shall not repeat anything that I said in the debate in this House three months or more ago. I am satisfied with the protest I made on that occasion, and have no wish to renew it.
<col>86</col>
But there is one point arising out of that debate about which I must say something, because it was distinctly raised by a passage in the speech of the noble Marquess just now, and that is concerned with the degree of acceptance and popularity which this policy has obtained in India itself. I dare say your Lordships will remember that when the Government of India penned their Despatch on August 25 last year the writer of the Despatch in India, with all the enthusiasm of a happy parent contemplating his first born offspring&#x2014;although, of course, the offspring at that time was not yet born&#x2014;told us that this policy would excite a wave of enthusiasm throughout India, that the Mahomedans would receive it with unbounded gratification, and that unprecedented satisfaction would be the attitude of the bulk of the people. I have never seen a Despatch of the Government of India&#x2014;they were much more dull in my days&#x2014;which exhibited so fine a frenzy. Then the Secretary of State followed with his Despatch. He was much more cautious in his handling of the question, but still he will remember that there was one line purple patch in his Despatch about Rome and Constantinople and about satisfying the historic sense of millions; and in this House he taunted me with being a member of a small minority in this country and an infinitesimal minority in India. His Under-Secretary in the House of Commons has gone further than his Chief, because on more than one occasion he has said that the Government's policy has been&#x2014;
<quote>"welcomed by the overwhelming bulk of the people of India, of all races and creeds, amid has opened up a new era of contentment and progress."</quote>
I think this last phrase is rather hard upon the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, and upon my noble friend Lord Minto, because your Lordships remember very well how frequently Lord Morley rose in this House and explained to us that he and my noble friend were the magicians who had exorcised discontent in India. Now we are told, on the authority of the Under-Secretary, that it was reserved for the noble Marquess the present Secretary of State to inaugurate a new era of contentment and progress.<lb/>
I wonder how it was in the power of the Under-Secretary to ascertain what is the opinion of the overwhelming majority of the people of India of all races and all creeds. I spent seven years in
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0048"/>
<col>87</col>
India in the vain attempt to ascertain what that opinion on any subject was. But here is an Under-Secretary who has never been in India at all, but who, with the confidence of which Under-Secretaries alone are capable, is able to inform an astonished Great Britain of the fact. I venture to hazard the opinion that the vast majority of the population of India of all classes and creeds are absolutely ignorant that there has been any transfer of capital at all, and that of those who know anything about it the vast majority are absolutely indifferent&#x2014;the fact is, it will not touch them in their everyday lives. But as regards those who do know and who will be affected I believe the state of affairs to be very different from what the noble Marquess has laid down. He said in his speech just now that there had been no wavering of opinion&#x2014;I think that was the phrase&#x2014;and that it did not matter what we said in this House, nobody's opinions were affected one way or the other. I think that is to represent the persuasiveness of the noble Marquess himself, not to mention other speakers, unduly low. I venture to say that the debate which took place some months ago did have a material effect, and that this debate will have some effect, though not altogether in the direction which the noble Marquess desires.<lb/>
Let me ask your Lordships to listen for a moment to what I conceive to be the facts of the case in regard to the matter. What are the communities in India who constitute the "infinitesimal minority" for whom I speak? In the first place, the noble Marquess admitted just now that there is the British mercantile community in Calcutta. They are not a negligible factor. Their attitude with regard to this change has not been dictated by selfish or mercenary motives. They object to it, not because Calcutta will suffer&#x2014;I do not think it will in the mercantile sense of the term&#x2014;but because they regard this policy as involving a cruel waste of public money, because they distrust the financial methods by which the money is going to be raised, and because they regard with dismay the effect that will be exercised both upon the Government of India and upon commerce, in their opinion, by the removal of the capital of India to Delhi. So much for them. What about Bengal? As to the attitude of the Mahomedans of Bengal,
<col>88</col>
who after all number more than 25,000,000, there can be no doubt, because they recently passed a Resolution at the annual meeting of their League, in which they expressed their deep sense of regret and disappointment at the policy that had been carried out.<lb/>
Then I turn to the Mahomedans of all India, nearly 70,000,000 of people, whose representatives, at the annual meeting of the All-India Moslem League in March last, passed this resolution&#x2014;
<quote>"The All-India Moslem League places on record its deep sense of regret and disappointment at the annulment of the Partition of Bengal in utter disregard of Moslem feeling."</quote>
So much for Moslem feeling. Now what about the Hindus in Bengal, the very people to placate whom these great sacrifices, the sacrifice even of the pledged word of the Government, were made? Every one who has served in Calcutta knows that there are two principal native newspapers in that city&#x2014;the <i>Bengali,</i> which is a strong supporter of the changes brought about by the Government, and the <i>Amrita Bazar Patrika,</i> which represents the most orthodox Hindu opinion. What does this latter journal say? It writes&#x2014;
<quote>"The re-partition of Bengal, instead of appeasing public feeling in Bengal, has only embittered it. The mischief which certain so-called Bengali leaders and their English friends have done to Bengal by supporting these changes is simply incalculable&#x2026;The Durbar announcements have given deep pain to the entire Bengal nation."</quote>
And at a meeting held at the town hall in Calcutta Babu Moti Lal Ghose, a very advanced native politician, claimed to voice the whole Bengali nation when he said that&#x2014;
<quote>"The contemplated redistribution of territories will be a gross wrong to our kith and kin and a sore point to the entire Bengali nation."</quote>
The entire Bengali nation has over 80,000,000 people, so that if any weight attaches to the spokesman whom I have just quoted, the "infinitesimal minority" for whom I speak is swelling to very formidable dimensions.<lb/>
There are two other classes which cannot be altogether despised. When we had our previous debate the Secretary of State claimed, with respect to Assam, that the reorganisation of Assam into a Lieutenant-Governorship would be thoroughly popular in Assam itself. Three

The last section of opinion I will refer to is the European officers of Government in India. I do not venture to speak of the opinion of our officials in Madras and Bombay. I do not suppose that the change of capital will make any material difference to them in the future. I should imagine it to be the case, in view of the feelings with which, as we know, Calcutta has always been regarded by the outside Presidencies, that the bulk of the Civil servants in those two Presidencies regard the removal of the capital to Delhi with satisfaction. They will not, however, be directly affected. But if you take the opinion of all those officials in the other Provinces who will be affected, I venture to think you will find a different result. I am not an Under-Secretary and am not going to dogmatise about the opinion of the vast majority of this community. I can only speak of what is within my own knowledge, but I do say that so far as I have had opportunities, and they have been considerable opportunities, of ascertaining the views of the Service in Northern India, they regard these changes with suspicion and disquietude. I do not desire to labour this point, but I hope I have said enough to show that to speak of those who disagree with the policy of the Government as an "infinitesimal minority." when it is a minority that contains many scores of millions of people, is to place a severe strain upon language. I have shown that Bengal is not over happy about the change, that the Mahomedans regard it with dislike and apprehension, that the European community in Calcutta at any rate deeply resent it, that the Service, to the best of my own knowledge, in Northern India is by no means friendly, and these facts, for what they are worth, do not justify the Government in speaking in the terms they have done of the alleged numerical weakness of their critics.<lb/>
<col>90</col>
I turn to what is, after all, the policy having been decided upon, the more important question that lies before the Government&#x2014;that is the question of the cost of transferring the capital to Delhi. Your Lordships will remember the history of the case. In their Despatch the Government of India stated that they could not conceive that a larger sum than &#x00A3;4,000,000 sterling would be necessary, including three years' interest on capital until the works were completed. The Secretary of State, in his reply, with commendable caution did not endorse that estimate, but enjoined thoughtful preparation and continuous vigilance. In my speech in your Lordships' House I ventured to throw extreme doubt upon this estimate, and to say that in the opinion of those most competent to judge the estimate of the cost varied from &#x00A3;8,000,000 to &#x00A3;12,000,000 and that in my view it would be more likely to touch the latter figure. How has the matter progressed since then? It was discussed in the Budget debate in Calcutta at the end of March, and the Finance Minister of the Indian Government made the astonishing confession, then seven months after the policy had been approved, that the Government of India were not yet in possession of any estimates of the cost; but he did admit that the burden would be spread over a number of years, and would amount to several millions sterling&#x2014;there was no limitation to three years or to &#x00A3;4,000,000. I venture to say that such a position is unprecedented in the financial history of this country or of India, or, I think, of any civilised country. The practice is, when you ask the consent of the taxpayers of a country to the provision of large sums of money, to give them complete estimates of the manner in which that money is going to be spent. But here we are all in the air; the Government of India have not the least idea what this experiment is going to cost; His Majesty's Government have no idea either. It seems to me, therefore, that this is the most gigantic leap in the dark that the financiers of India or of this country have ever taken. We have to consider the cost of this policy, not only in relation to the actual building of the new capital, but in relation to all the items of cost, to use the words of the Bill, that are "consequential" upon this policy. They are the direct result of your policy. India has to pay for them. The money will have to be found. And remember, too, that there
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0050"/>
<col>91</col>
will be, not only the initial cost, but heavy recurring charges as well.<lb/>
I have drawn up a list of the extra burdens that it seems to me will have to be borne by the taxpayers of India in consequence of this change, and I will briefly give them to your Lordships in order that you may form an idea of the tremendous area of financial charge that you are entering upon in accepting this change. First, I will take Bengal. (1) There is the extra cost of the new Governor of Bengal and his staff, which has been stated in the House of Commons to be &#x00A3;13,300 per annum. (2) There will be the cost of the new University at Dacca which the Government of India propose to create as a sop to the Mahomedans of Eastern Bengal. I pass to Behar and Orissa. (3) There is the cost of the new capital at Patna, the provisional estimate for which has been stated in the House of Commons as between &#x00A3;333,000 and &#x00A3;400,000, and which I venture to say, from my experience in India, will be &#x00A3;500,000. (4) There will be the cost of a summer station for the Lieutenant-Governor of that Province, which will cost some tens of thousands more. (5) There is the cost of the Board of Revenue for Behar and Orissa, over &#x00A3;13,000 per annum. (6) There is the cost of the Executive Council which you are being asked to assent to in this Bill, &#x00A3;13,300 per annum. (7) There is the cost of the Legislative Council to be given to Behar and Orissa. (8) There will be at no distant date a claim for the institution of a University at Patna to balance that which has been given at Dacca. (9) There will be before long an agitation for the creation of a High Court for these Provinces at Patna. (10) There is the cost of the Legislative Council which you are going to give to the Central Provinces and which, in the terms of your Bill, though I think they are absurd, you claim as consequential upon your policy. (11) There is the cost of the increase which the Government contemplate in the staff of the Commerce and Industry Department in order to remove the apprehensions excited by the change of capital to Delhi.<lb/>
Then I come to the capital itself. (12) There is the cost of the ground at Delhi which has already been taken up, and which the Viceroy has stated to be nearly &#x00A3;250,000. (13) There is the cost of the new city at Delhi, estimated by the Viceroy at &#x00A3;4,000,000 sterling. (14) There is the cost
<col>92</col>
of the new cantonment, a matter to which I shall presently allude, which will have to be instituted at Delhi in order to guard the new capital. (15) There is the cost of the temporary Delhi which is now being built to the north of the city in order to accommodate the officers of Government during the four or five years while the new city is being raised, and the whole of which will be sacrificed, because, as we know now, the new city is to be built in another quarter altogether. (16) I have read in the newspapers that a country retreat is even to be provided for the Governor six miles from Delhi in order that he may escape from the torrid and malarial climate of the new city. (17) There will be the loss on the Delhi Durban buildings and structures, the roads, railways, electric light, and water supply, which we were told in the Despatch of the Government of India would be of appreciable value to the Government as permanent works when the transfer was made. Obviously they will be of no use if the site has been changed. (18) Finally, there is the loss on the buildings at Dacca, many of which will no doubt never be used, and still more on the great group of Government buildings at Calcutta, some of them only just completed and some of them not yet finished, the lowest value of which I have seen estimated at &#x00A3;500,000. All of these buildings have been paid for by the Indian taxpayer, and the majority of them will either have to be parted with at a small price or will not be sold at all.<lb/>
I think I have said enough to show that, whatever your policy may be in point of merit, it will be enormously costly, and that, whether you are giving the Indian taxpayer a boon or not, you are hanging a financial millstone round his neck which will weigh him down for many years to come. I should have thought, in these circumstances, that the least the Government of India could have done would have been to economise in the various directions where economy was possible. For instance, I should be tempted to ask, Why should they not have stayed, during the four or five years while the new Delhi is being built, in Calcutta, occupying the existing offices and buildings? They have been there 150 years. Could not they have stayed there 154? Was it not possible for the Viceroy and the new Governor to rub along together for that limited space of time? And even if you are so sick of Calcutta that you must rub the dust of
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0051"/>
<col>93</col>
Calcutta off from the soles of your feet, why should not the Government of India have spent the next four or five years in Simla instead of incurring the enormous expense of going at once to Delhi and building a temporary capital which is going to be swept out of existence in a few years time? I venture to say that these proceedings have been attended by an utter disregard for economy.<lb/>
Now may I add a word about what is really an equally important matter&#x2014;the method of finance? When we had the Despatch before us the Government of India contemplated that the money should be raised by a special City of Delhi Loan of &#x00A3;4,000,000, carrying interest at 3&#x00BD; per cent., to be guaranteed by Government. After a while this idea was abandoned, and we now know, on the authority of the Finance Minister in India, that the scheme is to be financed in the first place out of artificial surpluses and windfalls, and, secondly, out of ordinary loans raised by the Government of India either in this country or in India itself. In his Budget for the next year the Finance Minister is budgeting for a surplus of &#x00A3;1,500,000, purely arbitrary and fanciful, one crore of which is to be assigned to Delhi, and he proposes to devote the Rupee Loan of three crores of the present summer to the same purpose. Those of your Lordships who have followed Indian newspapers will have seen that this decision has met with very severe and authoritative criticism in India, both at the hands of the mercantile community in Calcutta and also at the hands of native opinion. There was even a discussion and a debate about it in Council, in which the opponents of this scheme mustered as many as sixteen as against thirty-nine.<lb/>
I can very well understand the extreme reluctance which has been felt by His Majesty's Government in embarking upon a Delhi Loan. In this country, for instance, they cannot fail to be a good deal disturbed at the failure of their recent India Loan of &#x00A3;3,000,000, of which only 15 per cent. was taken up, and for which, in consequence of the price they had to pay to the underwriters, they are only receiving something like 91&#x00BD; or 92 per cent. That is enough to show that the market here is not over favourable. Then as regards India, where your policy is declared by you to be so popular and where we all
<col>94</col>
know large stores of treasure exist, do you mean to say that the Delhi policy is not sufficiently popular to enable you to raise &#x00A3;4,000,000 or &#x00A3;6,000,000? If your pretensions are correct, you ought to have obtained it without the slightest difficulty at any moment. But, my Lords, the refusal of the Government to do so seems to me to throw a rather sinister light on their pretensions. The plans of the Government appear to me to involve very doubtful finance. There is, in the first place, the budgeting by the Finance Minister in India for what I call fancy surpluses&#x2014;surpluses in excess of the requirements; secondly, there is the point about loans. Will any noble Lord tell me, if the money raised by ordinary loans in India and this country is to be shared between Delhi on the one hand and railways and irrigation works on the other, that the latter will not suffer?<lb/>
I see opposite me Lord Inchcape, who a few years ago went out to India at the head of a Committee to inquire into the railway system. He proposed that the railway programme should be fixed at &#x00A3;12,500,000 per annum, to be raised partly by Sterling Loans here and partly by Rupee Loans in India. But that figure has never been reached. In 1911&#x2013;12 the sum given was only &#x00A3;9,500,000. In the present financial year, 1912&#x2013;13, the allotment is only &#x00A3;9,000,000, and so much of this money is required for existing lines that it is actually the fact that only from seventy to eighty new miles of railway are going to be taken in hand in India during the present year. That is a most unhappy and even deplorable state of affairs. If this money which is so urgently required to carry us up to the limit fixed by the noble Lord opposite for railways alone is to be taken for Delhi, it is inevitable that these works must suffer, and that you will be taking the money of the Indian taxpayer, not for the most remunerative form of expenditure such as railways and irrigation, but for the purely unproductive object of building your new capital on the plains of Delhi. Therefore it seems to me that the financial policy which the Government of India are adopting in this respect is an unsound one and will be injurious to India. It has this further disadvantage, that it leads to obscurity and mystery in the matter. If von had raised a Delhi Loan, either in India or
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0052"/>
<col>95</col>
here, we should have known exactly where we stood and what money you were devoting to the object, but with driblets taken partly out of fancy surpluses and partly out of ordinary loans both in India and in England it will be impossible to know at any stage what is being spent on this Delhi scheme.<lb/>
The last branch of the subject to which I must turn is Delhi itself and the site at Delhi. When we discussed the matter before, the speakers on the Government side expatiated on the historic associations of Delhi, and we were led to believe that the new city would be placed in close proximity to the ancient capital of the Moguls. His Majesty the King was even invited to lay two Coronation stones in the Royal Camp near the site of the Durbar. I ventured on that occasion to say that this was a very premature proceeding, and to point out that that part of the environment of Delhi is liable to be flooded in the monsoons and to be a hotbed of malaria when the rains had passed away. We now learn that the committee of experts which has been reporting on the subject has advised the Government of India to leave altogether this region of swamps to the north of Delhi and to transfer the new capital to the region of stones and snakes several miles to the south of Delhi in the desert. This is another illustration of the heavy price which has to be paid for the extreme precipitancy with which the Government have acted in the matter. This change of site makes absolutely ridiculous that part of the Despatch of the Government in India in which they stated that the costly works that had been undertaken for the Durbar would be valuable permanent works. Clearly they will have no such effect owing to the change of site. Upon this point may I ask whether the Secretary of State can tell us to-night where exactly the new site is&#x2014;how far is it away from Delhi, and has it been finally determined? We were told that the committee of experts were to inspect the Delhi site first in the dry months of April and May; secondly, after the monsoon had broken; and, thirdly, when the rains had subsided; but as far as we can gather they have made up their minds without waiting for the second and third investigation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00286"><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: No, they have not made up their minds.</membercontribution></p>
<col>96</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00287"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON or KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I am glad to hear that. I was relying upon a statement which has been made and not contradicted in the newspapers. The inclination of opinion in India is, however, in favour of moving the capital from the proposed water-logged site to the stones and sands south of Delhi. It is therefore quite clear that your new Delhi will not be the Delhi of the Moguls; it will not be the Delhi of British associations; it will not be the Delhi of the Mutiny or the Ridge. It will be an entirely new Delhi, and there will be none of those associations to which we were led to attach so much importance. Your capital there will, in proportion to its distance from Delhi itself, be an artificial and isolated city, very much like the Summer Palace of the Emperor of China five or six miles away from the walls of Peking. There is another point which should not be overlooked. How about defending it? The gravest apprehensions have been expressed in many quarters as to the military and strategical vulnerability of the new Delhi. I say nothing as to that to-night. But I do say that you cannot plant down your Viceroy and your Government on a site several miles distant from the existing Delhi without protecting them. That means that, in addition to the Civil cantonment which, as it seems to me, you are going to set up, you will want a military cantonment near it in order to defend and protect it. For that purpose, so far as I know, the existing garrison of Delhi will be insufficient, and if the garrison of Delhi has to be increased this is an item of expenditure which His Majesty's Government must bear in mind.<lb/>
And now I come to the last question which I will venture to put to the noble Marquess. I have endeavoured to show that public opinion in India is far from unanimous about these changes, that the Government of India themselves have so far no idea as to the cost, that their ideas have changed as to the question of site, and that it is doubtful whether the new Delhi that will be built can properly be called a Delhi at all. Now I ask the noble Marquess this question&#x2014;What is there, then, to justify this great experiment and this enormous and costly expenditure? Who are to be the gainers by it? That is a question I am always putting, but I receive no reply. Who are to inhabit the new Delhi when you have built it? Of course, there will be the Viceroy and his
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0053"/>
<col>97</col>
bodyguard and staff, the members of the Legislative and Executive Councils, the secretariat and the clerks of Government; there will be the Press and the Post Office, and all the paraphernalia of a highly organised administrative system. There will also be all the hangers-on of Government, and the persons who minister to the needs of a European community. Who else will there be? I believe His Majesty's Government attach great importance to the presence of the Princes at Delhi, and that it is contemplated by these potentates that they will purchase plots of ground and erect palaces or residences for themselves in close proximity to the Government buildings. I have even heard of intentions to found a Club of Princes with all the forms of entertainment to which we are used in great European cities&#x2014;a race course, a golf course, and even an aerodrome. I should be the last person to deny the value of the close association of the Princes of India with the head of the Government. In an intimate and friendly association between the two lies one of the surest guarantees of the tranquility of India and the security of our rule. Nothing that I will ever say will in the smallest degree impair the weight that ought to be attached by every one to that fact. But, my Lords, is it altogether wise to contemplate in the creation of your new capital, if it is contemplated, that it shall become a sort of pleasure resort of the Princes of India, thereby taking them away from the responsibilities and duties which are naturally theirs in the states which they rule?<lb/>
I am sorry, in the observations that I have made this afternoon, to have been so critical. I can truthfully say to the Secretary of State and to your Lordships that I would far sooner never say another word about this matter. It is a most distasteful thing to any one who has been at the head of the Government of India to get up and criticise the policy of a later Government, more especially if that Government happens to be presided over by a personal friend. But I should not be doing my duty as an ex-Viceroy if I did not take this and every opportunity that presents itself to me of protesting to your Lordships against that which I believe to be a great error of policy. There is one analogy which occurs to me. When I was at Lahore I was taken out to see the cantonment of Mian Mir, and I was
<col>98</col>
told the story of how an impetuous Commander-in-Chief more than sixty years ago had galloped out into the country and when asked by his staff where he would fix the cantonment of Lahore, he pulled up his horse and said "Here," and there it was placed. And since then many lacs of rupees have been wasted in attempting to make that site healthy for the soldier. I do hope that that analogy will not be in any sense repeated in this case. I am confident that in so far as expenditure and care will avoid it, you will do nothing that will be in the least degree injurious to the health and comfort of those who are going to serve you in the new capital, but I do say that the selection of Delhi in the manner in which it has been made has been almost equally precipitate in its character, and I say, further, that you are going to place upon the shoulders of the Indian taxpayer a very heavy burden for which, so far as I know, no adequate justification has yet been given.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00288"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MINTO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no intention of attempting to inflict a long speech upon your Lordships. It was only the other day that I expressed my views fully on the recent administrative changes in India, and I have no wish to repeat what I then said. Moreover, my noble friend Lord Curzon has dealt so fully with the Bill now before your Lordships, or rather with the momentous issues which lie hidden behind the Bill, that I shall limit myself to a very few remarks. The administrative changes themselves, I am afraid, we must accept as settled facts. We are still, however, entitled to safeguard as far as we can the working of the new machinery which is being introduced; to call attention, as my noble friend has done, to the vast expenditure which is about to be incurred; and to ask His Majesty's Government what means they propose to adopt to obtain the necessary funds. I therefore very fully associate myself with all the remarks that have fallen from my noble friend Lord Curzon.<lb/>
I can hardly believe that His Majesty's Government still adhere to their estimate of &#x00A3;4,000,000 as the probable cost entailed by the change of capital. I cannot but think that the growth of experience must have led them to acknowledge that the expenditure will very much exceed that estimate. I understand that the idea of a Delhi Loan has been abandoned, and that
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0054"/>
<col>99</col>
the money is to be raised by what has been aptly described as "fancy surpluses." But what I am most afraid of is that various Departments, upon the success of which the future of India so largely depends, may be stinted in order that this money may be obtained. How else is the money to be got? Is India to face the growing demands of future years with a millstone round her neck? She cannot. Her hands are sufficiently tied now by many things that have occurred. She is about to lose her opium revenue, and there is always the chance that famines and outside circumstances may make heavy calls upon her; and if the revenues of the great Departments are to be curtailed in favour of Delhi expenditure, all I can say is that the result will be most unfortunate for the people of India.<lb/>
As regards the Bill itself, my noble friend has alluded to Clause 2, by which an Executive Council is to be conferred on the new Province of Behar and Orissa. I have a pretty distinct recollection of the discussion which occurred in your Lordships' House upon the Indian Councils Act of 1909, and my recollection is very clear that the decision arrived at then was that in the case of the Government of India proposing to grant an Executive Council to any Local Government, that proposition should lie on the Table of your Lordships' House for sixty days before it received official sanction. It may be argued that Clause 2 fulfils these conditions in that the Bill itself has been before the House for the stipulated time, but I cannot admit this, because the incorporation in the Bill of the clause in question really deprives Parliament of that separate consideration of the grant of a provincial Executive Council which was no doubt intended by the Councils Act of 1909. Personally I was always in favour of the extension of Executive Councils, but, of course, on the distinct understanding that the Local Government to which such Council was to be granted, and, above all, the Lieutenant-Governor of that Province, should be directly consulted and that they concurred with the Government of India as to the desirability of such a Council. Now we have no knowledge whatever as to whether the Lieutenant-Governor has been consulted. We ought to have that information before us. It is impossible to discuss the clause fairly without knowing the views of the Local Government and
<col>100</col>
the Lieutenant-Governor of Behar and Orissa; we should like to know whether they have expressed any opinion as to the desirability of a Council being granted to them.<lb/>
There are other smaller matters which will be brought about by the change of the capital to Delhi which are hardly perhaps of Imperial concern, but to which, as a retired Viceroy, I may be allowed to make some allusion. As far as I know, we have never been told definitely what is going to happen in regard to Government House at Calcutta hitherto inhabited by the Viceroy, or what is to become of its contents. Government House is full of pictures of great interest largely connected with the history of Calcutta, commencing with the time of Warren Hastings. There is also a very fine collection of marble busts of Roman Emperors, said to have been taken from a French man-of-war during our war with France, and there are magnificent, chandeliers which formerly belonged to General Claude Martin, one of the old. French adventurers. All these articles have been of great historical interest to the people of Calcutta, and it seems to me that they have some right to inquire how they are going to be disposed of. Are they to be placed, to use an Indian term, in some "go down" until the new capital arises on the plains of Delhi? Again, what is to become of Barrackpur, the beautiful home of many Viceroys, full of stories of the past, with its magnificent park and grounds, laid out by Wellesley, where Lady Canning lies buried? I am told that the gardens have already become a picnicing ground for holiday makers. I think, my Lords, that the Indian public is justly entitled to know something as to these old Viceregal residences, fill as they are of British traditions.<lb/>
I cannot agree with the noble Marquess opposite in what he told your Lordships as to the general satisfaction which exists throughout India in respect to the great administrative changes which are being made. I believe that during the King's visit Indian criticism was restrained by a chivalrous feeling of loyalty towards His Majesty. There was an earnest desire throughout India to avoid anything in the nature of criticism of the acts of His Majesty. But now that the glamour of the Durbar has begun to fade away I am bound
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0055"/>
<col>101</col>
to say that from what I hear doubts are every day increasing as to the wisdom of these changes. I can assure your Lordships that I am still in very close touch with Indian opinion, both native and European, and I am afraid it is not too much to say that my information tells of an increasing wail of sorrow on the part of many who have been proud of India's past and who have been accustomed to look seriously into her future. I say so with very deep regret. In conclusion, I can only repeat what I said on the last occasion upon which addressed your Lordships&#x2014;that owing to the methods adopted by His Majesty's Government, all we can now do is loyally and faithfully to avoid adding difficulties to the administrative changes we have felt it our duty to consider.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00289"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am an inexperienced member of your Lordships' House, but I have been an attentive student of the course of procedure in this House and in another place, and I venture to say that never before has a Second Reading debate followed the course which this debate has followed up to the present. The criticisms that have been made upon the Bill before your Lordships' House are slight and not very much to the point. But the whole policy of His Majesty's Government, which had been so fully canvassed a short time ago, has been once more brought to your Lordships' notice. To those who are supporters of his Majesty's Government in this matter it seems that somewhat less than justice has been done in the absence of any intimation to them that the general question of policy would be again brought under discussion; otherwise some of us who are not ready speakers and have not been accustomed to take part in great debates would have been glad of an opportunity of marshalling the arguments which we know exist in support of the policy which has been carried into effect.<lb/>
I propose, however, to follow as far as I can the course of the arguments of the noble Earl, Lord Curzon. But before I enter into the subjects which he has discussed and which do not pertain directly to the Bill, I may be permitted to make one or two remarks upon the Bill itself. The only point of criticism to which the Bill appears to me to be open was that which was referred to by the noble Earl on the Cross
<col>102</col>
Benches (Lord Minto)&#x2014;namely, the withdrawal of the opportunity for this House to discuss the question whether an Executive Council should be created for Behar and Orissa. It is, perhaps, known to some of your Lordships that when the Councils Bill of 1909 was before this House I took strong exception to the provisions for the creation of Executive Councils in Lieutenant-Governorships. I am of that opinion still. But I recognise that there is a radical difference between a proposal referring, let us say, to the United Provinces, and this proposal which refers to Behar and Orissa. Behar and Orissa and Chota Nagpur formed part of the Province of West Bengal, for which you Lordships agreed that a Council should be created. That Province of West Bengal is conterminous with the existing Province of Behar and Orissa in all respects, if the Burdwan and Presidency divisions be excluded. It would surely be taken as a breach of faith, as a withdrawal of a privilege conferred upon them by both Houses of Parliament, if the inhabitants of Behar, Chota Nagpur, and Orissa were now to be denied the advantages, if they be advantages, which flow from the creation of an Executive Council. It seems to me quite impossible that your Lordships could take such a retrograde action as that. Therefore, although I do not in the least waver in my opposition to the creation of Legislative Councils for Lieutenant-Governorships, I think your Lordships' House is bound to accept the Bill as it stands upon this provision. That is really all I have to say in regard to the Bill, which seems to me a suitable and appropriate instrument to carry into effect a policy which has been already approved.<lb/>
I pass to the remarks which were made by the noble Earl. He states that the policy which has been carried out or is being carried out is unpopular in Bengal and throughout India. I have had opportunities of keeping myself informed of the progress of opinion in Bengal, and I would call your Lordships' attention to this salient fact, that the unrest with which we were troubled in the earlier years has entirely disappeared, and that at the present time the discontent which exists, or is said, to exist, really centres about two questions. One cause of discontent among certain sections of Bengalis is that in the delimitation of Behar, Orissa, and Chota Nagpur from Bengal certain Bengali-
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0056"/>
<col>103</col>
speaking tracts have been included in the new Province. But these tracts have formed an integral part of the new Province for the last 150 years; they have formed an integral part of the Province ever since Bengal, Behar, and Orissa came into the possession of the British Government; and the idea that, because certain people speak the Bengali language in a district which is a Hindi-speaking district as a whole, these people should be excluded is merely an exaggeration of Bengali patriotism. Representations have been made, I know, by important men to their English friends on this subject, and the the latter have counselled their friends in Bengal that agitation on such a question as that would not commend itself to the judgment of Parliament or the Government. The next point upon which agitation exists in Bengal is that of the creation of a University at Dacca. The idea is that if a University is created at Dacca, the power of the Calcutta University over East Bengal will be lessened and the people of that part of the Province will become less amenable to influences from Calcutta, in educational matters at all events, than they would be if they remained under the University of Calcutta. That also is a matter of small importance, and one which will disappear when settled Government prevails, as I have no doubt it will throughout the Province.<lb/>
As regards the discontent of the Service, I am able to speak with a degree of knowledge which I think is not inferior to that of the noble Earl, though I readily admit that his knowledge of this subject is great. It is certain that there is considerable discontent among the. Civil servants of the lower Province, and the reason is that they will no longer have a chance of a change of climate, after serving in Bengal, to the better and drier climate of Behar. But that is inherent in the nature of the division that was made. Besides, it is to be remembered that Bengal, although the climate is not so pleasant and salubrious as that of Behar, is not so had as the climate of many parts of India in which Civil servants serve. I myself have served in Eastern Bengal for several years, and I have served in the Central Province, and I prefer the climate of Eastern Bengal. I know of many civilians who never left the lower Provinces of Bengal but who served there with fair health
<col>104</col>
through their entire period of service. After all, India is not made for the Civil Service, but the Civil Service is made for India. They must take their chances, and there are many parts of the British Empire in which men work and reap honour and distinction which do not possess a climate so good as the climate of Bengal. As regards Delhi, I am unable from any degree of knowledge to speak of it. But when the noble Earl stated that there is throughout India, throughout Mahomedan India especially, no regard or appreciation for the historical reminiscences that attach to Delhi, I am afraid I am of a different opinion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00290"><member>EARL CURZON of KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I did not say that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00291"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINPORD</member><membercontribution>: If so, I beg the noble Earl's pardon. I understood him to say that the removal to Delhi would not appeal to any great patriotic or historical associations to which the Mahomedans of India paid attention or had regard. If he did not say that, then my remarks are inappropriate. But if that was his meaning, then I wish to say that even in conversation with a Mahomedan gentleman in India, when he desires to say that a thing is unattainable he says "Delhi is far from here." The idea of Delhi clings to the Mahomedan mind in India, and in my opinion the establishment of the centre of British power at Delhi will have a powerful effect upon the Mahomedan population in India. It is quite true that the All-India Moslem League, to which reference has been made, appears to be discontented, but the All-India Moslem League seem to exist in London in greater vitality than in other parts of the world. How was it that some time ago when this Mahomedan agitation had shown signs of increase the president of the League, the Agha Khan, desired to dissociate himself from the attitude which the All-India Moslem League was assuming? I think too much importance is attachable to the declarations of exotic associations which find their centre in London. If we pursue the policy that we are now pursuing&#x2014;a policy which has for its object the equal treatment of all classes in India&#x2014;we shall be able to carry through to its legitimate conclusion the policy which was declared by His Majesty at Delhi.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00292"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the debate that we have had to-day, though it has not been a prolonged one, has sufficiently shown the difficulty under which your Lordships address yourselves to this Bill. The speech of the noble Lord who has just sat down was devoted mainly to making good advice which he had given on previous occasions with great effect, and to justifying a change the principle of which was discussed in your Lordships' House a few months ago. But I think there has been a marked difference, in the interest taken in this discussion, between the part which is prospective and that which has already been settled by the policy announced by His Majesty's Government. My noble friend Lord Curzon put before the House in detail, and in a manner which even members of the Government who may disagree with his conclusions must have regarded as extremely forcible, the arguments which he brought forward four months ago when he first called your Lordships' attention to the apparent want of preparation, precaution, and foresight with which this vast change in regard to the capital of India had been introduced. I must say, unless the noble Marquess the Leader of the House has something to tell us which we have not heard up to now, that everything which has passed this evening and everything which has reached us either through the newspapers or through more confidential sources has borne out to the fullest extreme the apprehensions which were expressed on this side of the House by three ex-Viceroys that the Government had not realised the extent of the operation into which they had entered, that they had not calculated the cost, that they were not aware of the difficulties which would beset them after they undertook it, and, especially in regard to the finances of India, that the burden was one which was not merely of great magnitude but one which might prove almost intolerable.<lb/>
In my recollection nothing was said in the debate in February last by the Government which suggested to us that the demolition, as it were, of the Viceregal edifice at Calcutta was to begin in preparation for this move which cannot possibly take place finally for five years to come. I cannot help thinking that what was said by Lord Minto does require some recognition from the Government. The Viceroy cannot have any permanent abode in the
<col>106</col>
plains for possibly five or six years. Government House at Calcutta, we understand, is being dismantled. Furniture is being sold which one would imagine would be required for the next occupant of the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, who is to occupy the house. Everything has been rushed forward, and at a moment when, as Lord Curzon pointed out, even the site on which His Majesty planted the stone for the new Delhi has had to be abandoned, and when apparently the Government have not the smallest idea at what sort of cost they will be able to proceed on the new site six or seven miles distant.<lb/>
I do not know whether the noble Marquess opposite faced the money difficulty. If so, I think we have some right at all events to have cleared away the position which has been set up by attempting to mix up this great change with the finance of the year. Lord Curzon spoke of fancy surpluses, and I will not amplify what he said on that point; but what I do wish the noble Marquess to remember is that this financial question is having a most damaging effect on the credit of India in the Stock Market. It is true that the whole finance of His Majesty's Government has caused a heavy fall in Government securities, which is not the case with other securities of the same character. Take the securities of the London, County Council, the largest borrower in this country and possessing the largest Budget except that of His Majesty's Government. The London County Council 3&#x00BD; per cent. Stock five years ago stood at 97; to-day it stands at about 100. At the same time Government of India Stock, which stood at about 99&#x00BD; when London County Council Stock was 97, is now down to, approximately, 91&#x00BD;. There must be some reason for that fall. The security of India is as good as ever it was; there is not even unrest to account for the drop. The security of London has not improved in the smallest degree&#x2014;except by the better administration of the Unionist Party which now prevails on the London County Council. Yet there has been this remarkable change in the value of the two Stocks. I do not say it is going to ruin India if she has to erect the whole of these buildings at 4 per cent. But at the same time I do think it is an enormous increase on what was imagined when in the Despatch in August last we were told that &#x00A3;4,000,000 would approximately cover the whole of
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0058"/>
<col>107</col>
this expenditure. It now appears that it is more likely to be &#x00A3;10,000,000, or &#x00A3;12,000,000, or even &#x00A3;15,000,000.<lb/>
Unless the Government of India are prepared to do something very drastic the whole of the other services must be clipped in order to carry out the change to Delhi, against which encroachment I venture to record an emphatic protest. The Report of Lord Inchcape's Committee, referred to by Lord Curzon, has not been able to be acted upon. That Report, in my judgment, was made five or ten years too late. If the noble Lord and his colleagues had been sent out before and the policy had been taken up earlier we should have had many results, and I think the Finance Minister of India would probably tell us that we should have had many results which we are not likely to have now. I cannot contemplate without extreme apprehension the idea that for the next ten years the development of Indian railways is to be hampered in order to provide money for a change of capital, the advantages of which have been so freely challenged on this side of the House. I look upon it as a departure from the whole principle of economy on which we have been engaged in Indian finance for the last twenty years. The pace of the forward movement in the direction of railways and irrigation works requires to be quickened rather than retarded.<lb/>
I cannot help asking the noble Marquess whether he has gone too far to make it impossible for him, not to change his policy, but to stop this, as it seems to us, gratuitous destruction of the existing system before it has been fully realised what the cost will be. I do not desire to go back on the policy announced by His Majesty the King in any respect; but so long as the buildings at Calcutta stand, so long as the various heads of Departments do not have their retreat to Calcutta cut off, it is possible to reconsider anything which may be found to be inadvisable and impossible to carry out. As we stand at present, however, the possibility of Calcutta being used as a residence for the Viceroy is being done away with, while the likelihood of supplying permanently what is required seems to be in a very nebulous future. I am certain that it is not only more loyal on our part but more far seeing to endeavour to secure that His Majesty's Proclamation is carried out economically,
<col>108</col>
rather than allow the change to Delhi to lie like a millstone round the neck of the other services in India. It must be so if the Government insist upon carrying it out at whatever cost, without regard, as we feel, even for healthy conditions and with the very probable result, which was indicated by my noble friend behind me, that ultimately Delhi may be only available for a very short period of residence, and the Government may be forced to the very thing which they must desire to prevent&#x2014;namely, a great prolongation of residence at Simla rather than that the Government of India should be brought into greater contact with the people in the centre of the Dependency.<lb/>
I appeal to the noble Marquess to say whether it is not possible to stop further operations at Calcutta until he is able to present to the House of Commons a real estimate of the cost and some memorandum which will make it clear that it is possible to carry out the change, that a site which is really satisfactory has been resolved upon, that the barracks which will have to be built as well as the public offices have been resolved upon&#x2014;in fact that we have, what apparently we have not had up to now, a real scheme for making good this great change&#x2014;a scheme the presentation of which ought, in my opinion, to have preceded the Proclamation rather than follow it, and a scheme which can be proved to us as likely to be of benefit to India in the future and not a handicap to the other services.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00293"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry that the noble Earl who followed me and who started out upon the wider field of discussion should have maintained the tone of entirely unrelieved pessimism which we observed in the speech that he made in the month of February. Before I attempt to enter upon that wider field I will say one or two words upon the few points in relation to the Bill itself which were mentioned by the noble Earl, and, I think, touched upon by one or two other noble Lords who have spoken. In reply to the noble Earl I may say that it never was our intention to ask Parliament to do anything by this Bill which could properly be done by Executive act&#x2014;that is to say, by Proclamation. He seemed to think that we had originally
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0059"/>
<col>109</col>
intended to frame and introduce a much larger Bill, apparently covering the whole ground of the changes that have been made. I can assure him that that is not at all the case, but that we always intended to confine the Bill strictly to the points for which Parliamentary sanction was needed. Our object in doing so was this, and it is one which I should have thought would appeal to the noble Earl above all people in the world. If you create a precedent to oblige the Government of India to come to Parliament for sanction or for confirmation of their action whenever they take an Executive step which can be described as large or important, you thereby, of course, curtail and cut down what I venture to consider the quite reasonable and legitimate powers of the Government of India. Supposing we had taken Parliamentary sanction for those things which we were able to do by Proclamation. The next time that the Government of India, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, and, of course, with Parliament always in the background&#x2014;because Parliament can get rid of the Viceroy and the Secretary of State and the Government to which the Secretary of State belongs and therefore exercises control&#x2014;the next time the Government of India wanted to take a step of much importance they would be taunted with the action that was taken in this case, and they would be told, "Why don't you come and ask leave of Parliament? It is true that in the technical sense you have Executive power, but who are you that you should venture to take a step of this kind without the leave of Parliament?" I hold a strong view on this point and I am certain that in limiting the Bill to the narrow path, as we have done, we have taken the right and proper course.<lb/>
The noble Earl asked when has a change of at all these dimensions been made before without the leave of Parliament&#x2014;such a change as a change of capital. The political capital of India, to all intents and purposes, for the last thirty or forty years has been Simla. The effective official Government of India for many years past has been at Simla. But where does the name of Simla occur in an Act of Parliament? The gradual visits to Simla, which began by the visit of the Viceroy to a health resort, turned in the process of years into the erection of Simla as the real political capital of India, and yet, so far as I know,
<col>110</col>
the name of Simla occurs in no Act of Parliament, and those changes were taken by the same Executive authority with which the transfer of the headquarters of the Government of India is now made to Delhi. The fact is, there is in reality no such place as the capital of India. The capital of India for political purposes is the place at which the Viceroy holds his Council, whether he be in camp or at Calcutta, or whether in the future he may be at Delhi. Therefore I think the noble Earl was travelling outside the political record of India when he laid blame upon for not having made the actual transfer to Delhi the subject of an Act of Parliament.<lb/>
The two points in the Bill which were mentioned by the noble Earl, and upon one of which stress was also laid by the noble Earl, Lord Minto, appear in Clauses 2 and 3, and the complaint of both noble Earls was that we had evaded the provisions of the Councils Act of 1909, which enjoins the laying upon the Table of this House for sixty days of a Proclamation appointing an Executive Council, by inserting in this Bill a clause by which such a Council is created. The noble Earls argued that we are in reality evading the provisions of the Act of 1909 because, although it is apparently competent for them to deal with this clause in the Bill, yet all the circumstances, the well-known circumstances, of the declaration of this policy make it impossible for them to do so. But I would put this to both noble Earls. If this is so, if it is impossible to move an Amendment, which I have no reason to suppose they desire to do, in respect of the clause instituting this Executive Council, would it not be equally impossible for them, supposing the Proclamation were laid on the Table, to take exception to it and to prevent its becoming law? As it seems to me, the real objection of the noble Earls is to the fact that the Lieutenant-Governorship of Behar and Orissa was created and to the way, as they have stated, in which it was done; but that having been done, I confess I cannot see the faintest difference between the creation of the Executive Council by this clause in the Bill or by the alternative method of making the Proclamation and laying it upon the Table, because, if noble Lords think that their hands are tied, they would be tied in one case surely as much as in the other.</membercontribution></p>

<col>111</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00294"><member>EARL CURZON of KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: The difference is very obvious. If the Proclamation had been laid on the Table of this House, it would have been in the power of the House, had they desired to do so, to resist it by an Address to the Crown. In the present case it is not in their power to do so, as this Bill has been passed by the House of Commons. In the circumstances we know very well that, whatever action we might take, the clause would be reinserted in its present form in the House of Commons. Therefore our hands are tied. The difference between the two procedures is substantial.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00295"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Even if the House of Commons reinserted the clause it would be competent for the noble Earl to go on resisting, not the whole Bill, but that particular clause, and create, if he could, a great political crisis on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00296"><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: That is the last thing one would wish to do.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00297"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: That I understand; but I confess I do not see that the difference between the two methods of procedure is a serious one. Then the noble Earl treated Clause 3, dealing with Chief Commissionerships, as an excrescence on the Bill. I do not deny that in one sense it is an excrescence in that it gives some extra powers, as pointed out, to the Government of India over and above what is required by the Executive acts described in the Preamble, but I am not aware that we ever said that this Bill was to be entirely confined to the particular acts described in the Preamble. In those circumstances I cannot see that the addition of this not very formidable power can be held to constitute anything like a grievance either for the noble Earl or for this House generally.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl very briskly combated my assertion that; the degree of acceptance with which this policy is met in India is not a discouraging one for us, and that, although in certain quarters there was still a dislike to the whole change&#x2014;quarters which are quite familiar to us all&#x2014;yet so far as India as a whole is concerned I take the liberty of believing the policy continued in favour. Both the noble Earls say that they have information to the contrary. I would by
<col>112</col>
I no means depreciate the means which either of them has of obtaining information from India, but I cannot help thinking that in a case like this you are very apt to obtain the kind of information you want, and I suspect that the people who correspond with both noble Earls on this matter are people who from the first were opposed to this policy, and that they have not seen much reason to change their mind, and that they do not, as a matter of fact, represent any new body of opinion on this subject. I say, my Lords, that you are apt in a case like this to get the sort of information you want. I see on the Front Bench opposite the noble Earl (Lord Selborne) with whom I had the honour and pleasure of co-operating with regard to the Union of South Africa, and I cannot help thinking that, if there had been anybody in England&#x2014;I hope and believe there was nobody&#x2014;who mistrusted and disliked that policy from the first in the manner in which these two noble Lords mistrust and dislike our policy in regard to India, he could have collected a number of individual opinions in South Africa, by no means all unimportant, to the effect that the policy of the Union carried with it all kinds of disadvantages, that it had positive dangers, and also might lead to a great expenditure of money. Consequently I cannot help to some extent discounting what the noble Earls tell me of the information which they receive.<lb/>
The noble Earl opposite, I thought, somewhat hardly commented on the observation of my hon. friend Mr. Montagu in another place, to the effect that the great majority of the people of India were in favour of the change. The noble Earl spoke of the confidence which an Under-Secretary is apt to show. Well, the noble Earl himself was one of the most brilliant and eminent of Under-Secretaries, and he ought to take a kindly view of the tribe. I think that my hon. friend, who does not profess to know India at first hand, far less to know it as the noble Earl does, was justified in using this expression from the general information which he had received. It, of course, is true that there are millions of people in India to whom the transfer of the capital, or, indeed, almost anything else that happens, is of no serious moment, and the noble Earl is therefore entitled to say that the positive approval of all the hundreds of millions in India may not be extended
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0061"/>
<col>113</col>
to this particular piece of policy. But when he is talking of the objections the noble Earl takes an entirely different view. Be counts, not merely as positive but as violent objectors, all the members of particular races or bodies whose spokesmen he is aware are opposed to this policy. He talks as if every Mahomedan in the Whole of Eastern Bengal, all these millions, was actively and poignantly concerned in the fact that the Lieutenant-Governorship of Eastern Bengal and Assam is abolished. What is true of one is, of course, equally true of the other&#x2014;you will find that the spokesmen of the different bodies and races and of the different districts take a strong view, which is entertained, no doubt, in varying degrees by those who are not spokesmen, but there exists behind the spokesmen on both sides, both the majority who, as I hold, approve the policy on the whole, and the minority who object to it, a large body who are not very deeply concerned. It, of course, is the case that no referendum has been taken on this subject or is likely to be, and even noble Lords opposite who so cordially approve that device would not suggest, I take it, that a referendum should be held in India. It would be a long and an expensive business. I have seen and heard nothing, from a very close study both of the European and of the native Press, or from any other source at my disposal, which makes me think that any change of opinion adverse to this project of ours has taken place since His Majesty left India in January.<lb/>
I am bound, however, to take rather strong exception to one observation which the noble Earl made, and which, if he will forgive my saying so, was really not a fair observation for him to make. He spoke of us as having created a University at Dacca in order to placate the Mahomedans. I will deal with that later; but he spoke of us as having placated the Hindus by the line of partition which we made, and he quoted one of the Hindu papers, the <i>Amtrita Bazar Patrika,</i> as showing that we had not succeeded in our work of placating them. It is quite true that that newspaper has from the first opposed the policy; but the fact is that there have been a certain number of extreme people on both sides who have disapproved of the policy because it is riot entirely worked out in their favour. What those who agree with that organ
<col>114</col>
would have liked would be not merely that Bengal should have been differently partitioned, but that it should have been so partitioned as to include in the new Bengal every village where the Bengali language is spoken. On the top of that they would have desired, no doubt, to retain the Viceroy in Calcutta, and they would also have liked to have a Governor of the type of Lord Carmichael, not a Civil servant but a Governor from England, in order to bring Bengal on an equality with Bombay and Madras. That was an altogether impossible policy, and I am quite certain that the noble Earl would himself agree. That being so, the mere fact that our policy is objected to from different ends for different reasons, and objected to in parts simply because different races and places find something which they do not consider entirely in their favour, I confess does not give us any serious uneasiness.<lb/>
I pass to the strictures of the noble Earl on the question of cost&#x2014;strictures which have been pressed with not less vigour by the noble Viscount who spoke last. The complaint, as I understand, is made that we do not produce quite complete estimates of the cost of the new capital or of the new seat of Government at Delhi&#x2014;estimates which, unlike some other Indian estimates with which both noble Lords are as familiar as I am, are on no account to be exceeded by a rupee when the actual work is done, and meantime, while those estimates are being prepared&#x2014;because I conceive that some time will be given to us for their preparation&#x2014;the Government of India ought in their opinion to remain at Calcutta and carry on its business there in spite of the fact that Bengal has been raised to the <i>status</i> of a Presidency. I think it is only fair to point out that if my noble friend Lord Hardinge had merely considered his own comfort in the matter, that would have been undoubtedly the easiest course to take. It is very much pleasanter to live at Government House at Calcutta and amid those delights at Barrackpur, upon which the noble Earl on the Cross Benches laid such stress, pleasanter from the point of view of his personal comfort to continue there than to make his headquarters in a Circuit House at Delhi; and if my noble friend did not make the suggestion that that should be the course taken, you may be sure that it was a sense of duty only by which he was prompted. I have no doubt that one of the main
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0062"/>
<col>115</col>
reasons which confirmed him in taking the course he did, in which I most entirely agree and which I should probably have suggested if it had not been suggested by Lord Hardinge himself, was that it would give no fair chance to the new Governor of Bengal or to the new system of government in Bengal if the Viceroy was to remain hanging on for two or three years until such time as his new quarters in Delhi were entirely ready for him.<lb/>
While I am on that point I might, perhaps, answer the question which the noble Earl, Lord Minto, asked me about Barrackpur and about Government House at Calcutta. I understand that the arrangement is that Barrackpur will remain as an extra residence for the Government of Bengal. I have heard nothing about its becoming the prey of cheap trippers, and I sincerely hope that that will not be the case. The park, as I dare say noble Lords know, is the home of a golf club, but that is not a matter to which any occupant of the house is likely to take exception. As regards the contents of Government House at Calcutta, without knowing what details have been decided upon I do know that the most friendly arrangement as to their disposition has been arrived at between the Viceroy and Lord Carmichael. There has not been, so far as I am aware&#x2014;in fact, I am not putting it forcibly enough, because I know as a fact that there has not been&#x2014;any kind of friction or difference of opinion between those two gentlemen as to the present disposal of the contents of Government House or as regards their final disposition, and it is certainly not the case that any of the valuable contents will be neglected or stored, as the noble Earl said, in a "go down," where they might be damaged, until they are required. It is true that a certain part of the contents are the property of the Government of India and ought to be so treated and ought in time to be removed to Delhi. The Governor of Bengal was the Governor-General of India, but it was in his character as Governor-General rather than as Governor that at any rate a large number of those works of art came into his possession, and we think that they ought to follow the Governor-General when he changes his seat of Government. But that does not mean that Government House will be altogether emptied or turned into a barrack.<lb/>
<col>116</col>
I come back to the general question of cost, and I turn once more to a remark, to which I said I took exception, of the noble Earl&#x2014;the mention of the foundation of the University at Dacca as a sop to the Mahomedans, shortly to be followed, as he prophesied, by the institution of a University at Patna, which I presume he would regard as a sop to the Beharis. I am sorry the noble Earl should have taken that view of the institution of a University, and I cannot help thinking that it was from a quite natural desire to obtain those dialectical victories which he is so competent to secure that he mentioned the foundation of a University at Dacca in that strain. I have nothing whatever to conceal about the University of Dacca. It was my wish, and it was also Lord Hardinge's wish, that on going to Dacca for the first time since these changes were made he should inform the Mahomedan community there and the inhabitants of Dacca generally of the foundation of that University, but I altogether resent the imputation that the foundation of Universities in India, whether at Dacca, at Patna, at Rangoon, or anywhere else, is to be regarded as a sop to the inhabitants of those particular districts and done on political grounds, whereas they are placed there on educational grounds and no other.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00306"><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: The loan which I understand is to be made to bear the cost of the removal to Delhi.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00307"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Oh, no. The question of this University has no bearing whatever on the expense of moving to Delhi. I can reassure the noble Earl on that point. There is no connection whatever between the two things. I was glad that the Viceroy, on paying his first visit to Dacca, should be able to announce that the first fruits of the policy of multiplying Universities would be made at that place, where, as I am sure on the merits the noble Earl will agree, the foundation of a University is a good thing in itself.<lb/>
Then as regards the site at Delhi, the House knows that we have been able to secure the advice of several gentlemen who are competent, either as engineers or as architects or as having a general knowledge of town planning, to give it with reference to this new site at Delhi which we have been examining. No final conclusion has been reached on the subject. It is desirable that they should see Delhi during or immediately after the rains in order to observe what the precise effect is in making certain portions of the land water-logged and what are the lands that escape. It is, I think, most probable that what is called the Durbar site&#x2014;that is to say, the site of the camp over which the noble Earl presided as well as that in which His Majesty stayed&#x2014;will not be used for the main buildings of the new Delhi. The actual site of those main buildings is not yet determined. There have been, as your Lordships may imagine, a great number of suggestions. I heard one distinguished military authority assert that there was no reason whatever why the most historical part of the Ridge should not be used for the erection either of a Government House or Government offices. He pooh-poohed the idea that it was anything but a military position, and held that if
<col>118</col>
it was the best site for the purpose it should thus be employed. On the other hand we should all, I suppose, agree that there is a vast body of both military and Civil opinion which regards all that part of the Ridge, which was so famous in the Siege, as sacred ground which ought not to be tampered with or interfered with in any way. The site, as I have mentioned, has not yet been decided upon, but I have little doubt that it will prove to be somewhat to the south of the Durbar camp. How far it may be desired to start it along that continuation of the Ridge, which, as the noble Earl will remember, skirts the whole of old Delhi on that side, I cannot possibly say, but I am told that the experts are well satisfied with the sanitary and drainage prospects of some site in that neighbourhood. There is no reason whatever to suppose that a site will be suggested at all as remote from the city as the noble Earl seemed to think possible, nor do I know of any reason why it should be so chosen.<lb/>
I am not able, unfortunately, to give the noble Earl any information as to what is proposed in the direction of strengthening the garrison at Delhi or of providing cantonments for them, but I trust that one result of the change will be this, that in course of time, though not immediately, it will be possible to clear away from the Fort the whole of the barracks which now disfigure it&#x2014;a change which ought to make it entirely what now is almost one of the finest monuments of its kind in the world. The noble Earl touched on one or two other points with regard to the future society which the Government of India would have at Delhi and the possibility that some of the Princes would have houses there. I take it that very little has been decided on this last point. It is, of course, possible that some of the native Princes whose States are in the more northern direction may like to have a house, large or small, in the neighbourhood of Delhi, but that is a matter upon which it is impossible to speak at present; and even if some of them do, I should hope that Delhi would not prove to be a Capua to them, as the noble Earl seemed to think likely to be the case, and that no disastrous consequences need necessarily happen.<lb/>
A further word on the question of the cost and the means of meeting it. The noble Earl mentioned some figures in
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0064"/>
<col>119</col>
relation to Behar quite correctly. The figures which were given were between &#x00A3;333,000 and &#x00A3;400,000. That was the provisional estimate that was adopted, and it would be safe, I think, to assume the ultimate cost as working out to something in the neighbourhood of the &#x00A3;500,000 which the noble Earl mentioned. The recurring cost is, of course, somewhat enhanced by the creation of an Executive Council, whose members, as noble Lords know, receive considerable salaries; but it is only fair to mention that the creation of an Executive Council, besides having its own merits for administrative purposes, also serves the purpose of giving opportunities for reward to meritorious public servants which to some extent may be diminished by the changes we are making. As regards Bengal, the figures as I have them, though I do not pretend that they are completely accurate, work out to a rise from &#x00A3;40,500, which was the cost of the Government of old Bengal, to &#x00A3;53,800&#x2014;an excess of slightly over &#x00A3;13,000 a year in respect of the change from a Lieutenant-Governorship to a Presidency. I am sorry that I have not got the figures for the outlay for temporary quarters at Delhi. It will not, I am sure, reach a formidable total, and as soon as I know what they are I shall be happy to inform noble Lords opposite who are interested of the amount which is estimated. Before I leave the question of the site I might say that the noble Earl, Lord Curzon, thinking as he did that the new capital was about to be removed to a distance of several miles from the town, concluded therefrom that the whole of the Durbar facilities&#x2014;the roads, electric light, and so on&#x2014;would be wasted. That is not the case, because I understand that in any event it is contemplated that a part of that area will be laid out for purposes of public parks and recreation. It also seems to me probable that a part of the area, at any rate, is likely to be found quite fitted for a certain amount of building.<lb/>
As to the method by which the money will be raised, our plan of raising it partly by way of ordinary loan and partly from revenue has been severely criticised on different grounds and from entirely different quarters. There are some people who say that we ought to have done all this financing from revenue, that we ought to pay our way as we go along, and that that is, indeed, the only honest method of
<col>120</col>
carrying out a transaction of the kind. But, my Lords, the Government of India were not prepared to take the risk of debiting the whole of the cost upon Delhi to current revenue. As noble Lords opposite very well know, you can never venture to speak with certainty of what your available revenue may be in India for a year or so hence. To promise, therefore, that you would pay these varying sums as you go along would have been too bold a step for the Government of India to take. But the method which appears to be favoured by noble Lords opposite is the precise contrary of that course. They think that we ought to have raised the whole of the money by means of a loan. I see that the noble Earl, Lord Cromer, does not agree. But that was the gist of the argument advanced by the noble Earl opposite, and it is a course which might have been pursued. We might have borrowed the whole of the money, and, if it was desired, extinguish the debt by means of a sinking fund.<lb/>
We again go to South Africa for a parallel. There was the Transvaal Loan, which was raised all at once; there was no question of meeting that charge partly from revenue. But it does not seem in itself, apart from all other considerations, a very wise piece of economy to raise a large sum of money at once for transactions which must necessarily be spread over a number of years. What are you going to do with the money when you have got it until it is spent? Are you going to reinvest it somewhere? If so, that would be a rather strange and unusual operation for a Government to take. We venture to think, therefore, that the plan we are adopting, the combined method of paying for the annual expenditure so far as we can from surpluses, and, where the surplus is insufficient for that purpose, by an addition to the ordinary loans which we make every year, is the most sensible and feasible plan of any that could be suggested. And it has this advantage. The exact amount of revenue it is difficult to foretell for any year. The revenue from opium, for instance, is a transient revenue, a revenue which, if it does not in due course disappear altogether, is bound to diminish very greatly, and we are not, I think, doing anything unfair or unreasonable by the people of India in saving that this charge, which is to a great extent of a nature which might fairly be placed upon posterity, yet should be met so far as you
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0065"/>
<col>121</col>
are in a position to do so from these transient and, if I may say so, fortunate sources of revenue which exist at this moment. There is, of course, the further argument, to which noble Lords have alluded, that if we were to go to the market now for a large sum of money&#x2014;noble Lords opposite would probably make it &#x00A3;12,000,000 or &#x00A3;5,000,000 at least, holding the views they do with regard to these changes&#x2014;if we were to go to the money market in England or in India for a sum of that kind we should have to pay dear for it. Well, that might not in itself be a matter of so much moment as the fact that we should be seriously crippling our own ordinary powers of borrowing, which, as noble Lords know, are none too active at this moment.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, could not resist the allusion which I have often heard him make before to the usually wild-cat character of our Treasury finance, which, as he maintains, reacts upon us in the Indian market. It is true, and I have no desire to attempt to discuss the reasons now, that the market for all gilt-edged securities is a bad one, and Indian Loans are no exception to that rule. But when the noble Earl, Lord Curzon, inquiries how it is, if this policy is so popular in India, we do not ask for the money there and get it in the twinkling of an eye. I cannot help feeling that again he was thinking of a dialectical score over my unhappy self, because nobody knows better than the noble Earl that it is one of the unfortunate facts, and also to sonic extent, I think, one of the mysteries of Indian life, that in India the capitalists do not come forward with large sums for Government security. As the noble Earl knows very well, the amount of holding in many of the Indian railways by Indian capitalists is almost <i>nil.</i> That is a large and an obscure question, and I am quite sure that the noble Earl knows very well that if we were to try to raise the money in India we should have to do one of two things&#x2014;we should either have to treat the loan as an ordinary Government loan, which would have its inconveniences because it would not be easy, I fancy, to arrange for holders to transfer from one to the other, or else we might have to invent some new kind of financial arrangement in India in the shape of terminable bonds to be paid off by drawings or some arrangement of the kind foreign to the habits of
<col>122</col>
the Indian investor and liable to be regarded, therefore, with suspicion by him. That being so, I venture to think we are adopting a commonsense course in finding as much money as we can from our balances for the purpose of these annual payments and adding the rest to the ordinary loans, whether in India or here, which we raise every year for our current outlay.<lb/>
I think that I have touched on the various points which have been mentioned by the noble Lords who have spoken. I am sorry, too, like the noble Earl opposite, that they thought it their duty to continue to adopt so critical a tone with regard to all these proposals. How far this debate may do good or do harm in India I have no desire to prophesy. I think it will be regarded there as exemplifying the truth of what I ventured to say at the beginning of my observations, that we none of us have seen any material reason to change the opinions which we formed in a close examination of this matter; and I can only express the final hope that the gloomy predictions of sonic of the noble Lords opposite may be falsified, and that it will be found that this great change will come about, as it will, gradually and without disturbance, and that in all its features it will prove to be for the benefit of His Majesty's subjects in India.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00308"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Lord Mac Donnell, who has left the House, complained of us for having allowed this debate to travel so far afield. He seemed to regard it as going beyond the scope of the Bill on the Table. I was glad to observe that the noble Marquess did not support that complaint. Indeed, it would have been difficult for him to do so, for, of course, this Bill, although in appearance it is limited to some technical alterations in the law, really is inseparably connected with the whole of the great question which was raised by the speech of my noble friend behind me, Lord Curzon, and as he reminded the House we were distinctly promised, certainly by the Prime Minister and I think by the noble Marquess himself, that His Majesty's Ministers would challenge the judgment of Parliament in regard to the removal of the seat of Government from Calcutta to Delhi. I therefore make no apology on behalf of my noble friends who have spoken on this side of the House for the scope of their
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0066"/>
<col>123</col>
observations. Still less am I moved by the argument winch fell from the noble Marquess just now when he told us that one of the reasons of His Majesty's Government for doing as much as they could without legislation was that it would be a bad thing in the interests of the Government of India that their action should require what he called "constant Parliamentary confirmation." Surely the noble Marquess will not contend that this is an ordinary case. The changes which have been initiated by His Majesty's Ministers have been described by them in the most magniloquent language as constituting&#x2014;
<quote>"a bold stroke of statesmanship which will give unprecedented satisfaction and will for ever associate so unique an event as the visit of the reigning Sovereign to his Indian subjects with a new era in the history of India."</quote>
This surely separates the whole of these proposals entirely from ordinary administrative and Executive changes for which the concurrence of Parliament might perhaps not be considered indispensable.<lb/>
With regard to the question of change of capital, nothing that we have heard to-night has removed the misgivings which we expressed at first and which we still feel. We still regard it as a change of doubtful expediency and one decided upon without sufficient consideration. I am not going at this hour of the evening to enter into details. But surely the proper test for the suitability of the site of a capital is not whether it happens to occupy mathematically a central position on the map, not whether it is regarded with approval by one section of the community or another, but whether it is a site the use of which is compatible with the efficient administration of the Government. In our view that test is not complied with in the case of an arrangement which requires that the Government of India should divide the year between the hill station of Simla and the brand-new official headquarters winch are going to be constructed in the neighbourhood of Delhi, out of the main current of public life and remote from all those surroundings which have given so much importance to the presence of the Government of India in the great city of Calcutta. Then with regard to the popularity of the change. I freely admit that there is a conflict of evidence upon that point. But do not let us be told by the noble Marquess that
<col>124</col>
the evidence is all one way. The noble Marquess suggested to us that some of the evidence which had been furnished to us was, as it were, made to order. He said you can get the kind of evidence you like. But is the noble Marquess quite sure that, particularly in an Eastern country, this does not apply even more strongly to evidence collected by Government officials?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00309"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: May I correct the noble Marquess in one respect? I was far from hinting that any of the evidence which had reached noble Lords opposite was of a manufactured kind. What I ventured to point out was this, that where there exists a difference of opinion and the distinguished correspondent here is known to hold one set of views strongly, he is likely to receive only letters of agreement and not letters of difference.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00310"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Marquess admits at any rate that there is a difference of opinion. We have always believed that that difference of opinion was a considerable one, and that those who hold our view of the case were not, as the noble Marquess has once or twice suggested, an "infinitesimal minority." The opinions which have been cited are not what the noble Marquess called merely individual opinions. They are the opinions of great bodies of the community having their official organs and their official spokesmen, like the All-India Moslem League and like the organisations which comprise the Mahomedans of Eastern Bengal. There is one section pf public opinion of which perhaps hardly enough has been said&#x2014;the opinion of the commercial classes of Calcutta. I wonder if the noble Marquess carries in his mind&#x2014;I am sure he has seen it&#x2014;a paper that was published a few days ago by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce upon the question of the location of the Department of Commerce and Industry and the location of the Currency Department. They think it almost superfluous to point out that a Commercial Department which is permanently located at a distance of 1,000 miles more or less from the two chief centres of trade and industry cannot be a Commercial Department in the true sense of the term; and then they point out that they are not by any means consoled by some ingenious arrangements, which I understand are proposed, under
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0067"/>
<col>125</col>
which officials of these two Departments are to tour during a certain part of the year in the Provinces. They go on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"For nine months of the year the Department will be completely cut, off from the commercial centres of India. What merchants want is ready and convenient access to the responsible financial, commercial, and railway officers of Government, the officers who are in authority and with whom the decision in important cases rests."</quote>
That is, I think, a very weighty expression of opinion from a body entitled to every respect.<lb/>
Then only half a dozen words with regard to the vexed question of the site. One proposition which has been affirmed from these Benches has not been disputed&#x2014;I mean that the site was selected without consultation, or at any rate without sufficient consultation, with those who were best qualified to give advice to the Government of India on such a matter. Not only was our statement not denied, but I remember quite well that the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, who is not here this evening, gave us the reason. He said the Government could not consult freely because if they had consulted people and the news had leaked out there would probably have been an agitation, and the Government did not want to have an agitation and therefore they kept the secret. It is not quite easy to read between the lines of the noble Marquess's statement as to our precise position with regard to the Delhi site. The noble Marquess told us that no final conclusion had been arrived at, but we gathered that at any rate the Durbar site was not likely to be adopted. The noble Marquess does not contradict me, and I therefore assume that it is so. Is that not rather a serious condemnation of the course which was taken in this matter? Was it quite wise to invite the Sovereign with so much formality to lay a foundation stone until you knew whether the place where that stone was to be laid was likely to be suitable or not for the new capital?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00311"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: It was quite clear to everybody, including the illustrious layer of the stone, that it was not certain or even I may say probable that the place where the stone was laid would be the actual site of Government House or of the Government buildings, but that it would form part of the new capital. Of that there is no reason to doubt.</membercontribution></p>
<col>126</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00312"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Not the actual site, but the approximate site. Surely the point was that His Majesty was invited to designate a particular spot, and upon that particular spot or in the neighbourhood of it, at His Majesty's command, the new capital was to arise. That is the way it would be looked upon by an Eastern people. It now appears that the capital might arise at any point within an area of 35 square miles. As to the cost, we have again and again expressed our entire disbelief in the figure of &#x00A3;4,000,000, and the noble Marquess did not attempt this evening to assure us that &#x00A3;1,000,000 would be anywhere near the mark. We are perfectly certain that it will not be. The noble Marquess said he would not tell us that it would not be exceeded by a rupee. That is not what we ask. We want to know whether it may, as some people have told us, be, not &#x00A3;4,000,000, but &#x00A3;8,000,000 or &#x00A3;12,000,000. The noble Marquess, I thought, did not follow very closely the extremely carefully conceived statement of my noble friend behind me when he dwelt upon the incidental expenses which would be inseparable from this change of capital; and we are quite right to call attention to these incidental expenses, because I remember that in the Government of India's Despatch they took credit to themselves for the incidental savings which would be made in consequence of the alteration in the site of the capital. Arty one who has had experience of building operations knows what a deadly thing the charge for extras is when you come to get your bill, and I feel convinced that the Government of India will have a very bad quarter of an hour over their extras when the day of reckoning comes.<lb/>
I am not going to detain your Lordships longer at this hour. I will only notice one point in the Bill itself. May I venture to say that I entirely agree with what was said by my noble friend Lord Curzon when he insisted upon the significance of the change under which these new Executive Councils are to be called into existence in virtue of the powers conferred by this Bill. The operation is an entirely different one from the operation of the present law. Under the law as it, now stands you are required, before you can create a new Executive Council, to lay your Proclamation upon the Table of both Houses of Parliament, and it would be open to this
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0068"/>
<col>127</col>
House, by carrying an Address against the Proclamation, to put an absolute stop to the whole transaction. That, of course, it is impossible to do when you come to a Bill. If we were to fall back upon our strict rights and throw out the second clause of the Bill the noble Marquess knows quite well what would happen. There would be the usual conflict between the two Houses; we should be accused of obstruction, and we should probably be confronted in the end with the choice of either withdrawing our Amendment or of seeing the Bill abandoned by His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
There were other points about which I should have liked to say a few words, but I feel that the ground has been sufficiently covered by my noble friend behind me. Let me say once more that I think we have acted not only strictly within our rights, but that we have fulfilled what was a duty which we could not avoid by drawing attention to these points. We have done so. We have made our protest; it remains on record; and, as my noble friend who spoke just now said, we shall be well pleased if our misgivings should prove to be exaggerated, and if these changes when carried into effect produce results conducive to the contentment and well-being of the people of India.</membercontribution></p>

<title>COUNTY ASSOCIATIONS AND INSURANCE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00377"><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government whether, having regard to the fact that County Territorial Associations are obliged to employ a number of men as (1) range-keepers, (2) markers at ranges, (3) extra men for baggage parties, the Secretary of State for War will consider the advisability of issuing instructions to Territorial Associations as to how such men, who are of different civilian occupations, should be dealt with under the Insurance Act, and if any additional charge is to fall on association funds; and if the Secretary of State will consider the advisability of making separate provision therefor.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00378">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I have given notice of this Question because those connected with the Territorial Force regard tins matter as of some importance in view of the early commencement of the operation of the Insurance Act. I have been in some difficulty because until quite recently I have not been aware to whom I ought to address the Question. I am bound to confess that personally I viewed the promotion of the noble and learned Viscount now on the Woolsack with mixed feelings. While I very cordially associate myself with the paeans of congratulation which he has received on all sides, we who are connected with the Territorial Force felt that with the noble Viscount's departure from the War Office we were likely to be in a somewhat inferior position to that which we occupied before, because while when the noble and learned Viscount burst upon your Lordships with his genial presence we recognised that he provided an expansive target for our shots and criticisms, we also recognised that he spoke with absolute authority, which to us is a very important point, and that he had that feeling for the Territorial Force which is usually associated with a fond parent. But consider the present position of War Office representation in your Lordships' House. In the other House, where, owing to the exigencies of Party politics, there is never any real opportunity for discussing these questions, there are the three regular Parliamentary representatives of the War Office. I do think it is very important that on matters of this kind we should have somebody in this House who can speak with authority.</p>
<col>134</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00379">I do not propose to go into all the difficulties of the case to which I am calling attention. I have specified one or two in the Question on the Paper. I think it will be recognised that, in view of the difficulty in which County Associations are placed with regard to casual labour and the doubt which exists as to what casual labour really is, it is important that something in the nature of what I have ventured to suggest should be carried out. County Associations in this connection look upon their position in regard to casual labour with some anxiety and some suspicion. They are anxious as to their position, and they are rather suspicious as to the result. What they feel in regard to casual labour is that where they are compelled, as they often are, to engage men at the beginning of the week, they will be called upon to pay the insurance, and that the other employers will endeavour to get the casual labourers who can show that the insurance in respect of them for that week has been paid. What I ask of His Majesty's Government is that a simple statement as to the actual position of County Associations with regard to casual labour should be drawn up as soon as possible and circulated among the various associations. We only want a simple, straightforward statement. I should like to call the attention of the noble Lord who will reply to this Question to the fact that during the last four years the County Associations have been supplied with a great number of circular memoranda. Many of these successive memoranda have been apparently contradictory of each other, while many of them have been so drawn as to be totally incomprehensible to the lay mind. On this matter we want something quite definite; and, above all, we want an assurance that if the County Associations are put to extra expense, as they probably will be, on account of the working of the Insurance Act, this extra expense will not be thrown on the general purposes grant or on any other grant at present in existence, but will be definitely provided for outside existing grants. I beg to ask the Question standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00380"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in rising to answer the noble Earl's Question, I would venture to express the hope that your Lordships will accord to me that indulgence which I have always met with at your Lordships' hands up to the present.
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0072"/>
<col>135</col>
I can only say that as long as I represent the Office which I have been asked to represent it will be my earnest endeavour to give your Lordships every possible information that I can, and also to convey the substance of your Lordships' remarks, should you so desire, to the Secretary of State.<lb/>
With regard to the Question which the noble Earl has asked, generally speaking, the County Associations are in the position of ordinary employers of labour, and therefore as regards the rules which they will have to follow they will have the same sources of information as ordinary employers of labour. Employ&#x00E9;s consist of two classes &#x2014;first, clerks, storekeepers, grooms, etc., who are employed during the whole of their time; and, secondly&#x2014;and these, I take it, are the people to whom the noble Earl refers&#x2014;men employed in part time in cleaning horses and wagons and as markers at ranges. As regards this second class, I am asked to point out that the County Associations have the same opportunity as other employers have of making representations to the Commissioners to obtain a special Order of exemption under Part II of the First Schedule, Paragraph (1), of the Insurance Act, which refers to&#x2014;
<quote>"employment of any class which may be specified in a special Order as being of such a nature that it is ordinarily adopted as subsidiary employment only, and not as the principal means of livelihood:"</quote>
As regards the question of an increased grant to cover this expense, I may say that the expense will not be at all large. In view of this fact and in view of the grant which has recently been instituted for general purposes the Secretary of State does not see the necessity of instituting any fresh grant to meet this trifling expenditure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00381"><member>THE EARL or DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: We do not yet know whether the expenditure is going to be trifling or not. I would earnestly press upon the noble Lord that the view of the County Associations is that they have quite as much to do with the existing grants as they can possibly do, and if extra expense is thrown upon them owing to the passing of a measure of this kind surely it is only fair that they should ask that the extra expense should be provided for outside the existing grants.</membercontribution></p>
<col>136</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00382"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: If this new expense turns out to be a very grave burden upon the associations the matter will naturally have to be reconsidered; but as at present informed the Secretary of State desires me to say that he does not consider the expense will be such as to justify making any alteration in the existing state of affairs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00383"><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: I understand that if the expense is larger than is anticipated it will be met by an extra grant?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00384"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: I did not say that; but if it proves to be a real burden upon the County Associations the matter may have to be reconsidered.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00386">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00387"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Bill which I ask your Lordships to read a second time this evening is one upon which I need not address the House at any length. Although it is a Bill of considerable importance and of a great deal of interest, it is one which can certainly be described as entirely non-contentious. As many of your Lordships are aware, there has been for many years a steady and somewhat alarming decrease in the number of fur seals in the Behring Sea, and this decrease is undoubtedly principally due to the practice of what is commonly known as pelagic sealing, which may be briefly described as the shooting of seals in the open sea outside the limits of territorial jurisdiction. This is both a barbarous and a wasteful method. It is barbarous because by far the greater number of the seals so killed are females, and consequently their young, which have been left on land, inevitably die of starvation; and it is wasteful because a number of the seals so shot cannot be recovered. The principal sufferers from this practice are the United States, who own the Pribilof Islands, the principal breeding ground of the large herds of fur seals. In a lesser degree the Russian and Japanese Governments also suffer, as they own other
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0073"/>
<col>137</col>
islands where some of the smaller herds of seals are in the habit of breeding.<lb/>
As far back as the year 1894 the United States Government entered into an agreement with the British Government by which the nationals of both countries were prohibited from the killing of seals within a certain area of the Behring Sea; but in spite of this agreement the decrease steadily continued, partly owing, no doubt, to the fact that the area prohibited was not sufficient in extent, but also owing to the fact that Russian and Japanese scalers, being bound by no Treaty obligations, were at liberty to pursue their calling and to kill seals even in the prohibited area. Accordingly the United States summoned a conference of representatives of its own, of His Majesty's, of the Russian, and of the Japanese Governments. The result of this conference was a Treaty which was signed by the representatives of all four countries on July 11 last year, the main provisions of which were the enlargement of the prohibited area in the Behring Sea and an absolute prohibition to sell the skins of any seals which had been killed by means of pelagic sealing.<lb/>
As regards our own interests in the matter, compensation is to be paid to the Canadian sealers who lose their occupation owing to the provisions of the Treaty. I may also say that the Treaty itself is approved by the Canadian Government, who were themselves represented at the conference, and that His Majesty's representative at the conference had the advantage of the assistance of certain experts in the seal skin trade from this country. This Treaty was finally ratified and came into force on December 15 last year. The other parties to the Treaty are now engaged in preparing the necessary legislation, and this Bill is desirable in order that we on our side may be in a position to carry out the obligations by which we are bound in this Treaty. I therefore hope that your Lordships will give a Second Reading to this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00391">Moved, That the Bill be now read 3<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014; (<i>The Marquess of Crewe.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00392"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON op KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no desire to renew, much less to repeat, the discussion that I initiated on the Second Reading stage of this Bill. By our attitude on the Committee stage, when we moved no Amendments, we showed on this side of the House that we were quite content that the measure, whatever we may think of it, should pass without further delay into law. But there are one or two questions arising out of the discussion in your Lordships' House last week which I should like to submit to the Secretary of State, and which I think he will not regret the opportunity of being able to answer.<lb/>
The first question is with regard to the site of the new capital at Delhi. I need hardly point out to your Lordships that the question of site is one of considerable importance, because according to the nature of the site will depend the suitability of the new Delhi for the purpose for which His Majesty's Government desire that it should be created. For instance, if you select an unhealthy site it is quite certain that your new city will be doomed to failure and ultimately to abandonment. On the other hand, if you select a distant site, a site remote from the present city of Delhi, it is also clear that a group of important considerations arise. In my remarks a week ago I said that I had been informed that a site in the neighbourhood of Purana Kila, a few miles to the south of the modern city of Delhi had been chosen; and the Secretary of State, in his reply, told your Lordships that no final conclusion had been or would be arrived at until after the rains, and that the new capital would be somewhere to the south of the Durbar Camp but not so far away as I had supposed. I have no doubt, my Lords, in view of what the Secretary of State said, that the final choice of the new site will only be ratified after the monsoon is over, and, so far as it goes, that is quite right. But I speak what is matter of common knowledge in India and what has been confirmed to me by most responsible authority when I say that, subject to this final ratification, the site
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0074"/>
<col>139</col>
of the new city has practically been settled; and it is to be, unless I am quite misinformed, the ground that I spoke of a week ago, which will lie between the Purana Kila and the well-known tombs of bygone saints and kings in the neighbourhood.<lb/>
I do not wish to say anything about the suitability of the site. In all probability, if you are to build a new capital in the neighbourhood of Delhi you do a wise thing in putting it upon a high situation where it is not likely to be waterlogged by the rains. But what I do say is that it is absurd to claim, if the claim be made, that this new city is either close to the Durbar Camp or has any relation to it. As a matter of fact, it is separated from the Durbar site by the modern city of Delhi itself and by the spurs of the Aravalli range, and, as far as I can make out, the new site will be between six and seven miles from the Durbar Camp. If that be so, this emerges: that whereas it was, I believe, your intention to plant the city, in the first place, to the north of Delhi in the neighbourhood of the Durbar Camp&#x2014;and that is the only inference that can be drawn from the action of His Majesty in laying the foundation stone upon that site&#x2014;that decision has been altogether abandoned, and we are now going to have a new Delhi on a new site south of the city and miles away from the Durbar site. I must remember, in fairness, that the Secretary of State told us a week ago that the Durbar site would be utilised for purposes of recreation, for parks, and, I have no doubt, polo grounds, and places of that description. That may be quite true; but it does not affect&#x2014;in fact it confirms&#x2014;my point, that there are going to be two new cities of Delhi, one to the north of Delhi for purposes of recreation, and one to the south of Delhi, several miles away, for purposes of business. It also lends force, I think, to what I said a week ago, that the bulk of the money that was spent on the Durbar and for the spending of which the Government of India took credit in relation to their future utilisation of the same site will have been thrown away.<lb/>
There was another point I mentioned last week to which the Secretary of State did not vouchsafe a reply. I said that if his Government were contemplating building a new city out in the open to the south
<col>140</col>
of Delhi he would inevitably require a new cantonment to guard it, and that the cost of this cantonment must be added to the long list of other items of expenditure which I laid before your Lordships. Here, again, I have information that the site of the new cantonment has been fixed, that it has been placed in the direction of the Kutub, that the ground has been taken up, and that at no distant date the prophecy I made when first this policy was announced&#x2014;that if you put your Viceroy there you must guard him&#x2014;will have to be fulfilled, the existing garrison being inadequate for the purpose. I do not blame the Government for that, but I simply ask the Secretary of State for information. Do not these facts, if they are facts, throw into additional prominence the reasonableness of the request that was made by Lord Midleton and myself a week ago&#x2014;namely that the Government should think seriously before they commit themselves to the expense of the temporary transient Delhi which they are setting up for their convenience during the next four or five years on a site removed by several miles from that which they are going to occupy at a later date? The site to which I refer, on which these new buildings are being erected, is to the north of the city between the Ridge and the river. You cannot set up a temporary city for the Government of India there without incurring great expense, needless expense, and unprofitable expense.<lb/>
When Lord Midleton challenged the Secretary of State about it a week ago, the noble Marquess replied that really some credit ought to be given to Lord Hardinge for tearing himself away from the charms of Calcutta and that his departure would only be giving a fair chance to the new Governor of Bengal. I am certain that not one of us would wish to deny that this official, who has made a most excellent start, should be given every chance in the world, but I do not think that chance would have been in any way impaired by the presence of the Viceroy in close contiguity with him for the course of the next four or five years. But even if your plea holds good, even if you say that the Lieutenant-Governor has so gained in dignity by being made a Governor that he and the Viceroy could not afford to live side by side in the same place for a short space of time, then why not have left he Government of India for the next few
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0075"/>
<col>141</col>
years at Simla, where there are a number of Government buildings which could be utilised? We know that the Viceroy and the Government of India are going to tour a great deal in the winter months. That being so, is it at all necessary to take the Government down from Simla and to incur this expense in building this temporary evanescent capital on the plains? I do not think there can be any doubt that money is being foolishly and lavishly spent on this purpose for which there is no need.<lb/>
The second point about which I want to ask a question of the Secretary of State is this. Last week the noble Earl, Lord Minto, drew attention to the existence of a number of works of art in Government House, Calcutta, and asked what the destination of those pictures, sculptures, statues, and so on was likely to be. The Secretary of State did not give a very clear or conclusive reply, but it has come to my knowledge that the Government of India have decided that the whole of the pictures in Government House at Calcutta, with, I believe, one solitary exception, are to go to Delhi. Some of them have gone already, and I believe a number&#x2014;something like fifty&#x2014;are to come home to this country, to be restored here, I imagine, and to be kept in England for some years and then to go out to Delhi later on when the new Government House is ready for them. Believe me, there is a good deal of feeling about this in Calcutta, much more feeling, I think, than the Secretary of State was prepared to allow. Remember that Calcutta and its inhabitants have grown and lived in the knowledge of the possession of these works of art, and they feel naturally sore about their complete disappearance and about the reduction of their beautiful Government House to something little better than an empty barrack.<lb/>
The noble Marquess last week justified the removal of these pictures on the ground that they, were the property of the Governor of Bengal in his capacity as Governor-General of India. Technically this is not precisely the case, because, as your Lordships will remember, it was only by the Charter Act of 1833 that the Governor-General of Fort William in Bengal became Governor-General of India, the first Governor-General being Lord William Bentinck. The Secretary of State may reply, of course, "True, but the
<col>142</col>
Governor-General of Fort William in Bengal, created by the Act of 1773, the Regulation Act, was really Governor-General of the whole of the British Dominions," and to this extent it is true that the Presidency of Bengal in those days did have a political supremacy over the other Presidencies in other parts of India. But there are pictures in Government House which were obtained and were put there before 1774, and which, therefore, on the argument of the Secretary of State himself, really appertain not to the Governor-General of India but to the Governor of Bengal. This is not a matter, of coarse, that I can pursue in your Lordships' House, but I hope the Secretary of State will view the whole matter sympathetically and will perhaps allow me to communicate with him privately on the matter.<lb/>
There is one other point of view while I am dealing with these works of art. It is this. Many of these pictures, particularly those of Governors-General of a century or more ago, are of great historical value. They are practically a record on canvas of our rule of India. During the last century or more, in spite of the humidity of the climate in Calcutta, they have, subject to occasional return to England to he restored, endured on the whole very well, but I wonder if the Secretary of state has contemplated what will happen to these paintings when exposed to the climate of The climate of Delhi has this remarkable combination of features. In the summer it is excessively hot&#x2014;I believe the mean average temperature in May and June is only a little under 100; in the monsoon there is a very heavy fall of the rain, and in the winter it is excessively cold, so much so that, as any noble Lord who has been out to either of the Durbars in recent years will know, the water freezes in your tents at night. Have the Government of India or the Secretary of State contemplated the effect upon these pictures of being exposed to these extreme vicissitudes of temperature? I am told by an expert that the pictures will be inevitably doomed to destruction. If that is so, as to which I offer no opinion, is it wise that they should he removed to Delhi only to gradually waste away and crack and disappear before your eyes? I hope the Secretary of State will forgive me for introducing a relatively small topic to his notice, but this subject of works of art is

<col>143</col>
of interest to our people in India and is deserving of passing attention in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
The third point on which I wish to trouble your Lordships with a word is this. It arises out of the well-known passage in the Despatch of the Government of India of August 25 last, which has on one occasion before been quoted in your Lordships' House. It is the passage in which the Government of India lay clown their views as to the future nature and object of British rule in that country. The words are these&#x2014;
<quote>"Nevertheless, it is certain that, in the course of time, the just demands of Indians for a larger share in the Government of the country will have to be satisfied, and the question will be how this devolution of power can be conceded without impairing the supreme authority of the Governor-General in Council. The only possible solution of the difficulty would appear to he gradually to give the Provinces a larger measure of self-government, until at last India would consist of a number of administrations, autonomous in all provincial affairs, with the Government of India above them all and possessing power to interfere in cases of misgovernment, but ordinarily restricting their functions to matters of Imperial concern."</quote>
In my humble opinion that was a very compromising, a very unnecessary, and a very unwise declaration. I cannot see why it was necessary at the moment to make any such pronouncement at all, and, if it was necessary, I should have thought it lay, not with the Governor-General in Council in India to indicate the future character of British rule in that country, but rather with the Secretary of State and His Majesty's Government at home. The passage, as your Lordships know, was at once taken up in India and has played a most important part in the discussions that have since ensued. In our debate here in February last the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, and I both drew attention to the subject, and we invited an explanation from the noble Marquess the Secretary of State. These were the terms in which Lord Crewe replied&#x2014;
<quote>"It would be unfortunate, and not in consonance with the facts, if a belief were held that we have, or that the Government of India have, any policy in view in the nature of a formal system of federation. I repeat that my noble friend Lord Hardinge was simply speaking of what he takes to be the inevitable trend and tendency of things in India."</quote>
With all respect, my Lords, the words which I have quoted do not admit of that innocent interpretation. Moreover, if that be the point of view in which they were interpreted by the Secretary of State,
<col>144</col>
we had only a few days afterwards a statement in a public speech made by his Under-Secretary, who represents the India Office with so much ability in the House of Commons, Mr. Montagu. May I read to your Lordships what Mr. Montagu, speaking at Cambridge, had to say about this passage? He said&#x2014;
<quote>"We have endeavoured to look ahead, to coordinate our changes in Bengal with the general lines of our future policy in India, which is stated now for the first time in the Government of India's Despatch that has been published as a Parliamentary Paper. That statement shows the goal, the aim towards which we propose to make, not immediately, not in a hurry, but gradually."</quote>
Mr. Montagu then went on to quote the very sentence which I read out to your Lordships just now, and he continued as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"We cannot drift on for ever without stating a policy. The Moderates look to us to say what lines our future policy is to take. We have put off answering them for too long. At last, and not too soon, a Viceroy has had the courage to state the trend of British policy in India and the lines on which we propose to advance."</quote>
Nothing, I should have thought, could have been more direct, more explicit, more unmistakable than the interpretation put by the Under-Secretary upon that passage in the Despatch. And this can hardly have been an accidental platform aberration, because two months later in the House of Commons, when this Bill to which we are now about to give a Third Reading was under discussion, the Under-Secretary practically repeated his remarks. This was his observation on April 22&#x2014;
<quote>"The Viceroy showed that there was some definite aim and object to which, in the opinion of the Government in India, all these changes might be correlated; that we were there not merely to administer but to develop India on a plan which had been thought out by those who had been advising the Secretary of State. That is as I understand the meaning of Paragraph 3, and as such I regard it as one of the most important parts of that historic Despatch."</quote>
Well, my Lords, I venture to say that this is a very different thing from the conception entertained by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State invites us to believe that His Majesty's Government have no definite policy in view which they have sought this opportunity to enunciate. The Under-Secretary, on the other hand, tells us that there is a definite aim and object on the part of His Majesty's Government, that they have what he describes as a thought-out plan. It appears to me impossible to reconcile these two comments upon the same text.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0077"/>
<col>145</col>
But what is significant, my Lords, is this, that it is the view of the Under-Secretary and not the view of the Secretary of State that is taken in India, and that immense stress and importance is attached to the paragraph as interpreted by Mr. Montagu on two occasions, and as, I believe, understood by every branch of public opinion in India. A week ago I alluded to the Bengal newspaper which is the most prominent advocate of the advanced views in Calcutta. This is what the <i>Bengali</i> said&#x2014;
<quote>"It was the prospect of autonomous self-government in all provincial affairs which largely reconciled the Bengalis to the deposition of Calcutta."</quote>
And in the last mail that came home I read a speech delivered at Bombay by the most capable representative of the Indian Party, himself a member of the Legislative Council of the Viceroy&#x2014;Mr. Gokhale&#x2014;whose name must be very well known to most of your Lordships, and who is now, I believe, in this country. Speaking at Bombay, where he was entertained before his departure at the end of May, Mr. Gokhale used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"As regards their status" [<i>i.e,</i> the political <i>status</i> of his countrymen] "they had to work for attaining in practice that equality with Englishmen which was already theirs in theory, and under pledges solemnly given; and in that connection they could flow take their stand on the memorable announcement of policy made at Delhi&#x2014;</quote>
That is the announcement I have just read&#x2014;
<quote>"a policy to which the word, not only of the Government of India or of the Secretary of State, but in a way that of the King-Emperor himself, now stood committed. That policy was the policy of autonomy for the different Provinces. Whatever attempts might now be made to explain away the passages in the Despatch which bear on the point&#x2014;</quote>
He was evidently referring to the remarks of the noble Marquess the Secretary of State&#x2014;
<quote>"the passages were there, and they in India were entitled to take their stand on them and ask for the realisation of the policy contained in them."</quote>
I hope that during his stay in this country the Secretary of State may have an opportunity of disabusing Mr. Gokhale of these ideas&#x2014;that is, if they cannot fairly be entertained.<lb/>
I have only brought the matter before your Lordships' House because it is one of supreme importance affecting the whole
<col>146</col>
conditions under which we rule India. I venture to think we ought not to have the Secretary of State in one House and the Under-Secretary in the other House giving different interpretations to a great State document. I further would venture to say that we ought to know, we are entitled to know, whether this pronouncement is merely the opinion of the writer of the Despatch or of the Governor-General in Council, because the Despatch was signed by him and his colleagues, or whether it also represents the views of the Secretary of State and of his Majesty's Government. I do not think that is an unfair question to ask, and upon its answer I think a good deal will depend both in this country and in India in the future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00393"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I certainly have no complaint to make of the fact that on the Third Reading of this Bill the noble Earl opposite has desired to call attention to one or two matters in connection with the whole subject with which this Bill is concerned. Before I attempt to deal with the particular points raised by the noble Earl there is one other matter in regard to which some misconception has existed in India which I desire to put right in a formal way. It arises out of proviso (<i>a</i>) to Clause 1 of the Bill, which reserves to the Governor-General powers now exercisable by him in relation to the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal. As sometimes happens when legal language has to be interpreted by those who are not lawyers, I am given to understand that it is believed by many that some obscure but formidable powers are thereby reserved to the Governor-General as against the Governor of Bengal, and that in this respect he is placed in a somewhat inferior position to his brothers of Bombay and Madras. I therefore desire to state quite categorically that such is not the case. We have been at great pains to secure for the Governor of Bengal precise equality in all respects with the two other Presidency Governors. The sole power which the I Governor-General in Council obtains under this proviso is that, at any rate for the present&#x2014;that is to say, until a change is made with reference to the High Court of Calcutta&#x2014;the Viceroy goes on appointing acting Judges to the High Court, which now, as the noble Earl knows, covers the area of the new Lieutenant-Governorship of
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0078"/>
<col>147</col>
Behar and Orissa, and, as I explained, it was for that reason thought desirable that such appointments should be made by the Governor-General and not by the Governor of Bengal. That is the sole operative effect of this proviso; it has no other of any kind, and I am desirous that this should be clearly understood.<lb/>
I now come to the various matters on which the noble Earl has spoken. He first drew attention to the position of the new buildings at Delhi. Since we last debated this subject I have received some further information upon it, and, although it is true that an absolutely final decision involving expenditure must be postponed for a short time, vet it is not too much to say that the Government of India, after consulting with the local experts and the experts who came out from this country, have made up their minds as to what the best site would be. I do not think that the noble Earl has been quite correctly informed as to that site. So far as I was able to follow his description, he has placed the new city and the new cantonment almost due south of Delhi. The site provisionally decided is rather more, I might say considerably more, to the west than that indicated by the noble Earl, and it is also much nearer to the old city of Delhi than the noble Earl seemed to fancy. Speaking without prejudice and provisionally, if the noble Earl will allow me to do so, I understand that the general idea of the new city is something of this kind, that drawing a line a little more west than south-west from the J&#x00E2;ma Musjid&#x2014;perhaps south-west by west would be about the proper description&#x2014;the main Government buildings and the Government House would be placed on high ground, having between them and the walls of Delhi a park of somewhere about 1,000 yards in width. On the edge of that park some of the new buildings would be erected, and Government House would stand on higher ground further back. But if the noble Earl will do me the honour one day to come to the India Office I will show him such information as I have received by the last mail from India. I am able to say that as regards the provision of open spaces, as regards the provision for development and extension, as regards the drainage, and as regards the water supply, this proposed site is considered satisfactory by the experts who have examined it. The criticism which the noble Earl made as regards the
<col>148</col>
distance from the Durbar Camp is, as he will note, somewhat modified by the correction which I have ventured to make in his I conception of the new city. It is true that the site of the camp will not, so far as present intentions go, be utilised for any of the Government buildings, but whether some part of the site of the camp may not be, not, a separate new Delhi, as the noble Earl seemed to indicate, but an extension of the main part of the new city, I am not at present in a position to state. It is also true, as the noble Earl stated, that provision has been made for a military cantonment. I have no reason to suppose that it will be one of any extravagant size, and, as I said on the last occasion, the new accommodation which will be required by the removal of the troops from the Fort at Delhi, to the vast improvement of that structure, ought, as funds available admitted of it, to have been provided in any case.<lb/>
To pursue a point that was not further developed by the noble Earl to-day but which was dwelt on by him on the former occasion and also by other noble Lords&#x2014;namely, that of the vagueness of the estimates of expenditure&#x2014;I must point out that to decide at this stage what you are prepared to spend either upon your Government buildings, upon your municipal buildings, or upon your Government House would be, as I venture to think, unwise. After all, you can build a Government House or Government buildings no doubt for a comparatively moderate sum. On the other hand, it is possible to spend upon them&#x2014;and in one sense the money might be well spent&#x2014;an enormous sum, and it surely requires the fullest consideration and the nicest balancing of advantages and disadvantages, after you have been able to get the best plans and the ideas of the best minds at your disposal, as to whether you are prepared to go into a scale of what might be called extravagant expenditure in order to get a building which, besides being serviceable, would also be of the nature of a great national monument. As it is, I have no conception in my mind at this moment as to what any particular building ought to cost. The whole matter will no doubt be carefully thrashed out in all its bearings, one of the most important of its bearings' being the amount of available money from balances or from the revenue of the year which may be forthcoming during the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0079"/>
<col>149</col>
years when the building is going on. If, which Heaven forbid &#x0021; we were to be in for a series of some of the disastrous famine years of the past I have no doubt, without expressing any opinion whether it would be right or wrong, we should be disposed to look very sharply at the estimates of an expenditure of this kind. On the other hand, if we should be blessed with very bountiful seasons&#x2014;again I do not say whether it is wise or foolish to do so&#x2014;we should probably be disposed to spend something more on ornamentation and appearance than we should do in the other case. I venture to think, therefore, that to ask us to present now anything like a close estimate of what the expenditure on our public buildings is to be is hardly a fair demand to make.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00394"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I quite agree with what the Secretary of State has just said. But if the matter is in as much doubt as he has just explained to your Lordships, why did the Government of India give us that ridiculous estimate of &#x00A3;4,000,000 sterling? It was they who gave the estimate which we have been criticising.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00395"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The Government of India, I take it, named the round sum of &#x00A3;4,000,000 sterling as one about which they would expect to have to work, but they have always been careful to explain that they do not bind themselves to that limit. It was not named either as the highest or the lowest figure, because at that time they were in possession of scarcely any <i>data</i> at all. We are all aware of the reasons&#x2014;to which I know noble Lords object, but they seem conclusive to us&#x2014;which prevented us making a series of inquiries beforehand. Consequently at that time they were altogether without <i>data.</i> Now they have more data although they have not complete <i>data.</i> The particular <i>data</i> which I have just mentioned, and I am glad to find the noble Earl thinks me not unreasonable, cannot of course be forthcoming for some little time, but I have no doubt that if and when the Government of India see reason to revise their estimate in either direction they will lose no time in informing us at the India Office.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl once more raised the point as to whether the Viceroy and his Government ought not to have remained in Calcutta and to have transferred them-
<col>150</col>
selves so soon as the new buildings at Delhi were ready but not before. I mentioned in the previous discussion that one of the main difficulties which we desired to avoid in making these arrangements&#x2014;namely, that of the confusion of powers and responsibilities between the Government of India and the Government of Bengal&#x2014;would have had to continue under a more difficult condition of things than had existed even up to last year; but I am bound to say that there was a further reason which would have occurred to me had it been suggested that no change should be made, and that was the character of the reception which the inhabitants of Calcutta, particularly the European inhabitants, gave to our proposals for the changes. We knew, of course, that they would not be acceptable to Calcutta or to any of its inhabitants, either European or Indian, and we were not disappointed to find that they were not liked; and that dislike was, if the noble Earl will forgive my saying so, greatly fomented and encouraged by the tone which he first took with regard to these changes. If the Viceroy had remained on at Calcutta one of two things would have happened&#x2014;either his presence there would have been distasteful to the Calcutta people and a condition of bad feeling would have existed between him and the inhabitants of Calcutta, which would have been exceedingly unfortunate, and for which we should all agree there would be no real reason; or, what might be more likely, remaining in Calcutta would have been taken as an evidence that the change was not intended to be anything but what is called a setting up of a political capital, that all the social side of the Viceroy's activities would still be exercised at Calcutta, and also that the extreme, and, as some might think, excessive influence which the commercial and other circles of Calcutta had had upon the Government of India in former days was going to be continued at the same level. And therefore, even though a certain amount of money has to be spent &#x2014;not a very large sum, but still a considerable sum&#x2014;in making the temporary arrangements at Delhi, I think the conditions are such that that particular outlay is altogether inevitable.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl spoke with some apology, which I venture to think your Lordships regarded as quite unnecessary because the subject is one of great interest,
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0080"/>
<col>151</col>
about the pictures and works of art in Government House at Calcutta. It is, as I said before, the view of the Government of India, and it is not, I think, improbably that of the Government of Bengal, that the Governor-General has a right to have at his main official residence the portraits of those who preceded him in his office of Governor-General; and ingenious though the noble Earl's argument was that some of the quite early portraits or other works of art may be conceived to have come into the Viceroy's possession more in his Bengal character than in his India character, in spite of that fact I should venture to think that public opinion generally would support that view.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00396"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I was not alluding to portraits of Viceroys; there are a good many others.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00397"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS or CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I quite understood that the noble Earl included the interesting series of portraits of Indian Princes of the Mogul family and many other important pictures&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00398"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON or KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: There is a much more interesting case than that. There is the case of two pictures of Louis XV and his wife, Marie Leczinska, which were taken by Clive. After Clive had come up to Calcutta and redeemed the tragedy of the Black Hole he went up the river to Chandarnagar and captured, in the French Residency there, two pictures of the French King and Queen. By the way, it was left to me to discover this while in India. What have those pictures got to do with Delhi? They were captured by Clive when he was Governor of Bengal and should remain in Calcutta now as they have done for the last 150 years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00399"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I should be glad to discuss with the noble Earl opposite the details of these works of art whenever he is good enough to give me an opportunity of doing so, and to convey his views on particular points both to the Government of India anti to the Government of Bengal. The matter is one rather for friendly arrangement between the two Governments and their representatives, and I have no reason to suppose that there is likely to be any serious matter of friction between them. I quite agree also that
<col>152</col>
the views which the noble Earl has expressed on the relative merits, or I am afraid I must say the demerits, of the climates of Delhi and Calcutta with regard to particular paintings ought to be carefully weighed and considered. I am afraid it is not too much to say that there are very few, if any, places in India which are really suitable for keeping valuable oil paintings. They are one of the purely British importations which, like some other British importations, do not go very well with the changes of temperature and the climate generally. But I confess I am a little surprised, although I listened with great respect to the noble Earl's opinion on such a subject, to hear him say that he considers that the climate of Delhi would be such a far worse one for oil paintings than the climate of Calcutta. The variations of temperature at Delhi are, as we know, extreme&#x2014;from the most blazing heat to a temperature sometimes of uncomfortable coldness. But, on the other hand, during the time of that extreme heat the weather is dry, and I should have thought that such a climate would not have been so seriously detrimental to pictures as the consecutive months of damp, clammy, steamy weather which they have to meet at Calcutta. But I quite agree that that is a subject on which we ought to get the best expert opinion, and if the noble Earl is so vindicated that certain pictures have to remain at Calcutta instead of being transported I certainly shall not offer a word of complaint.<lb/>
The last point on which the noble Earl said a word&#x2014;and I have to thank him for informing me that it was his intention to do this, because it only arises in a very indirect way out of the Bill as printed&#x2014;is the question of the phrase, which has now become almost famous, in the Despatch of the Government of India with regard to the future devolution of power to be conceded, as the Government of India said, without impairing the supreme authority of the Governor-General in Council. May I quote the words of Lord Hardinge once more&#x2014;
<quote>"The only possible solution of the difficulty would appear to be gradually to give the Provinces a larger measure of self-government, until at last India would consist of a number of administrations, autonomous in all provincial affairs, with the Government of India above them all and possessing power to interfere in cases of misgovernment, but ordinarily restricting their functions to matters of Imperial concern."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0081"/>
<col>153</col>
A certain degree of gloss has been put upon that statement by a section of public opinion, and that gloss&#x2014;in spite of the statement which I made in this House that I could see no reason for it&#x2014;is supposed to have received some support from a speech which my hon. friend Mr. Montagu made at Cambridge. It is open to anybody to say&#x2014;as the noble Earl has more than hinted, I think he almost stated&#x2014;that it would have been wiser for the Government of India not to attempt to prophesy about the distant future at all. It is open to noble Lords opposite to take that view, but it is important to remember the context in which those words come. The Government of India had to explain, and I had to explain in reply to them, that we were anxious to remove the Government of India from a close connection with any Provincial Government, and in arguing for that necessity the Viceroy went on to say that the time would come some day, as the tendency showed and as the general drift of our policy indicated, when in local affairs Provinces would tend to become more and more independent.<lb/>
The noble Earl himself, when he was in India, made observations which involved a somewhat similar forecast, perhaps on a more limited scale, but still a somewhat similar forecast. I have here a volume of the speeches which he made in India, and in those I have found two passages which make it clear that in his mind there was at that time a feeling that a further extension of local autonomy was possible. In his sixth Budget speech, which was delivered in March, 1904, the noble Earl was talking about the new provincial settlements, and he ran through the steps that were taken for giving the different Provinces a more permanent instead of a temporary interest in the revenue and expenditure under their control. He went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"This we have succeeded in doing in the cases of Madras, Bengal, the United Provinces, and Assam, and have thereby laid the foundation of national autonomy which I hope will steadily develop and enable the local Governments in the future to undertake enterprises from which they are now debarred."</quote>
And he said he mentioned the matter because he knew that the Government of India had at that time been accused of a tendency towards excessive centralisation. He explained that&#x2014;
<quote>"So far is that from being the case that if the occasion has anywhere arisen where it was possible
<col>154</col>
to develop or depute powers it was taken. This new settlement constituted a most important step&#x2026;and will. I hope, be the forerunner of others in the future."</quote>
The noble Earl, it is true, was then only speaking of finance. But if a local or subordinate Government has in any strict sense financial autonomy, it has something very near complete autonomy. Of course, we all know that there are subjects of a certain kind which, even under the most complete system of federation, are reserved to the superior power, whatever it may be, but if you are going to give a country or a province real financial autonomy you have gone a considerable length towards giving it a system of political autonomy.<lb/>
Then I turn to another speech&#x2014;a most interesting speech&#x2014;which the noble Earl made later at a dinner given to him by the United Service Club at Simla in December, 1905, before he left India. There he dwelt again on this question of centralisation, and said he did not believe that any great measures of devolution could produce better results than those which had actually occurred. He then went on to say that this question of settlements had been solved in favour of local Governments, because his arrangements had given them the means of extending themselves. And he said&#x2014;
<quote>"There cannot be much autonomy whore there are not financial resources."</quote>
Then the noble Earl went on to say some words with which I agree. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"I am not in favour of removing altogether or even of slackening the central control. I believe that, with due allowance of the astonishing diversity of local conditions, it is essential there should be uniform principles running through our entire administration, and nothing could be worse than that the country should be split up into a number of separate and rival units."</quote>
There I am in agreement with the noble Earl. The most distinguished man, so far as I know, and probably the last, who held the view that the future of India under British rule was that very division against which the noble Earl protests&#x2014;that is to say, the division of India into a number of States presumably under a Governor-General but in most respects quite independent of each other&#x2014;was Mr. Bright; he looked forward to it, I believe, as the future destiny of India under British rule. But, like the noble Earl, I do not believe that that is the direction in which we ought to tend or in which we are tending.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0082"/>
<col>155</col>
The noble Earl went on to say, on the occasion I am referring to, that he believed in a strong Government of India holding the reins, but it ought to ride the local Governments "on the snaffle and not on the curb." He added&#x2014;
<quote>"I would do all in my power to consult their feelings, to enhance their dignity, and to stimulate their sense of responsibility and power."</quote>
Those last words might; have aroused something of the same kind of alarm in the minds of those who heard them or read them which the words in the Despatch, according to the noble Earl, have aroused, if not in his mind at any rate in the minds of many. If you say that your duty is to stimulate the sense, not merely of responsibility, but of power in the minds of a local Government, the local Governments will undoubtedly think that what you desire to do is to enlarge within the limits which you have stated the actual measure of those powers. Therefore when my hon. friend Mr. Montagu said that this ideal of larger provincial autonomy, or however you may like to describe it, was being put forward for the first time he showed himself, I am afraid, not quite so well acquainted with the noble Earl's speeches as I admit he ought to have been. In fact, if we could collect the various allusions to this subject in the speeches of former Viceroys, and possibly also former Secretaries of State, we should often find, I am inclined to believe, the expression of hopes that, as education spread and as the sense of responsibility grew, more influence and more actual power should be placed in the hands of local Governments and of local bodies than it is possible to place at present. Whether that be called a policy, which seemed to shock the noble Earl, or whether it be called as I called it when I was speaking on the subject before, a trend or a tendency, I do not think very much matters; because the tendencies in India are, and, as things are, can only be, the policy of the Government; of India and of Parliament here.<lb/>
The noble Earl spoke of the general view taken in India of the proper interpretation to be put upon these words. We know quite well&#x2014;it is just as well known to the noble Earl as it is to any of us&#x2014;that there is a certain political school in India of Indians who are altogether free from the taint of disloyalty&#x2014;a term which is sometimes loosely applied to them and their
<col>156</col>
friends, but, as I think, most unfairly&#x2014;who, while admitting that for a period so far as any man can venture to look ahead India must remain and should remain under British rule, yet look forward to the inception in India of something approaching the self-government enjoyed by those Colonies which have of late years received the name of Dominion. It is vain to deny the existence of such a school. I say quite frankly that I see no future for India on those lines. I do not believe that the experiment&#x2014;for it would be an experiment quite new, so far as my knowledge of history goes, in the whole world&#x2014;of attempting to confer a measure of real self-government, with practical freedom from Parliamentary control, upon a race which is not our own race, even though that race enjoyed and appreciated the advantages of getting the best services of men belonging to our race &#x2014;I do not believe that that experiment is one which could be tried. That being so, standing here as Secretary of State for India it is certainly my duty to repudiate altogether that reading of this Despatch which implies that anything of the kind is the hope or goal of the policy of His Majesty's Ministers or of the present Government of India working with them.<lb/>
I do not know that I can put the matter more forcibly than that. As I say, I do not complain if some men hold this ideal, which is not in the odious sense a revolutionary ideal and is not a disloyal ideal in the sense of its involving a desire to break the British connection. I do not complain if some men, whether they be political theorists or versed in the practice of politics, hold that view. I can only say that I hold it in no sense myself. But I do feel&#x2014;and I have no reason to suppose that in expressing such a feeling I shall be contradicted by the noble Earl&#x2014;that it is our duty as a nation and as the Government for the time being of that nation to encourage in every reasonable and possible way the desire of the inhabitants of India to take a further part in the management of their own affairs. I am quite sure that when the noble Earl was there he never attempted to throw cold water upon the hopes or aspirations of any individual for the opportunity of doing more work in the public service. I know the noble Earl far too well to suppose that he would do anything of the kind. I say this because, as the colour which has been put upon these very
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0083"/>
<col>157</col>
sentences show, men are apt to put upon any phrases used by a politician, either in writing or in speech, the colour which suits the particular views which they hold. I therefore will never have it said of me that I am indifferent to, or could be unmindful of, the ambitions of Indians with the capacity and distinction to serve their country in the fullest degree and to the best advantage; and the furthest that it is possible to go in that respect I should be prepared to go. But when we are confronted with that totally different ideal to which I have alluded, I consider it to be my duty to explain that no such view is in my mind, nor is it in the mind of the Government of India.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00400"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships will have listened with pleasure to some of the latter observations of the noble Marquess. It is, I think, extremely important that the natives of India should understand that, however liberal are the concessions which may from time to time be made, there is not the Smallest intention on the part of His Majesty's Government to relax the paramount hold of the British power in India. But it was not to make these remarks that I have risen. I wish to say one word upon what is really a financial detail. The noble Marquess has told us to-day that he could not give any reasonably accurate estimate of the cost of the movement to Delhi. I can quite understand that, and I confess I was not surprised to hear the statement. It is really part and parcel of the system&#x2014;as I think the most pernicious system&#x2014;which exists nowadays of incurring large expenditure in the first instance, then looking about to see how much the whole thing is going to cost, and lastly considering how the liability is to be met.<lb/>
But there is one point about which I confess I had hoped that we should receive some more detailed information, and that is the cost of the temporary, buildings at Delhi. The noble Marquess explained to us that it would be very inconvenient if the move could not be made at once. I can quite understand that from many respects there would be great inconvenience, but the inconveniences have to be balanced against the cost. I think that the Government of India, although it may not have been able to make an estimate of the total cost of the permanent buildings, might by this time have made an estimate of
<col>158</col>
the temporary buildings, and then one would be able to judge how far the weighty arguments which have been advanced by the noble Marquess could be balanced by the cost. The noble Marquess said the cost, be thought, would not be a very large but still a considerable sum. "Not very large" and "considerable" are relative terms; and when you come to locate such a great machinery as the Government of India even for three or four years, with all the requirements of a hot climate, I cannot help thinking that the term "not very large" will eventually be translated into a figure which some of us would think a great deal. But even if the figure is not large I do not know that the explanation altogether satisfies me. I remember that a good many years ago one of the right rev. Prelates who then adorned the Episcopal Bench either preached a sermon or delivered an address upon the "Sinfulness of Little Sins." I think that the sinfulness of even wasting a small sum of money might be pressed on the Government of India, and, unless it is absolutely necessary, that the cost of this temporary change might be economised. I confess I can hardly reconcile myself to thinking that the money is really required. In any case it ought not, in my opinion, to be charged to the Loan Fund but ought to be paid out of revenue.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00401"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: May I say one word in reply to something that fell about myself from the Secretary of State? The noble Marquess charged me, I think with unfairness, with having by my attitude and speeches here in this country been in some measure responsible for the strong view that has been taken about his policy in Calcutta. My Lords, the dates alone are unfavourable to any such charge being sustained. The Delhi Durbar announcement was first made in this country on the date of the Durbar, in the middle of December. From that date till February 21, when I raised the matter in your Lordships' House, I did not say one word in public either by speech or by letter expressing an opinion unfavourable to the change. By February 21, which was the first occasion on which I spoke publicly on the matter, the attitude of Calcutta had been definitely taken up, and was not influenced in any way by me. That charge I have asked the liberty to deny because it is really without any foundation.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0084"/>
<col>159</col>
The second point to which I wish to refer is that arising out of the famous passage in the Government of India's Despatch. The Secretary of State paid me the compliment, to which I am sure I was not entitled, of quoting portions of some ancient speeches of my own which I confess I had altogether forgotten. I do not know whether I ought to regard it as a compliment to myself, or whether I ought to congratulate the noble Marquess on the researches of his private secretary. However that may be, it must be quite clear to any one of your Lordships who heard the passages read that I was talking about an entirely different matter. I was referring to financial decentralisation. There is no question of financial decentralisation in this Despatch. The passage in the Despatch refers to political autonomy and nothing
<col>160</col>
else; and so it has everywhere been interpreted. I do not wish to pursue the matter, and will only say about it that I was very glad&#x2014;I am sure we were all glad&#x2014;to receive the perfectly clear and distinct statement of the Secretary of State. It was a most emphatic and unmistakable repudiation of the interpretation which has in many quarters been put upon that sentence in the Despatch. That repudiation we acknowledge; we shall remember it, and I have no doubt we shall often have good occasion to use it in the future.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00446">Moved, That the House do now resolve itself into Committee.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Lucas.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00447"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the House goes into Committee upon this Bill I should like, in the words of the Notice standing in my name on the Paper, to call the attention of His Majesty's Government to the objections which have been raised by agricultural bodies to this Bill, and to inquire whether in the circumstances the Government are still of opinion that it is desirable to proceed with the measure. Your Lordships are aware that during the Second Reacting debate a few weeks ago we on this side of the House criticised the most important parts of the Bill. We showed, I think, that while some system of counter-notice might in certain circumstances meet one particular grievance under which agriculturists suffer&#x2014;which is that in certain cases a tenant whose farm is sold very shortly before the expiry of his tenancy is placed in a very difficult position because he has not time in which to make full arrangements with the new owner or to find another farm&#x2014;the particular system which the Government have adopted cannot help those tenants. We also showed, I think very clearly, that no system of counter-notice can in reality touch even the fringe of the difficulties which have recently born pointed out as confronting agricultural, tenants.<lb/>
In the interval since the Second Reading of this Bill the view which we took on this side of the House has been abundantly proved by the protests which have been received from agricultural bodies. The Government, I have no doubt, have seen from those protests that these bodies are entirely dissatisfied with the scheme that has been brought before them. The Bill has met with a chorus of disapproval, I think almost of ridicule. It cannot be satisfactory to agriculturists in any way. I do not wish to labour the reports which I myself have received from these bodies. I have no doubt they are all in the possession of the Government, and that they have considered them, but I think for the information of the House I ought to read extracts from two or three of these reports
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0088"/>
<col>167</col>
from the chief bodies. First, there is the report of the Central Chamber of Agriculture. At the last meeting of the Council of that body the following resolution was passed&#x2014;
<quote>"The Council regrets to have to express its extreme disappointment that the only remedy proposed by the Government to meet the serious position of tenant farmers created by the breaking-up of agricultural estates is the totally inadequate Agricultural Holdings Bill now before the House of Lords. It urges, first, that the Bill should be withdrawn; secondly, that the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1908, should be so amended as to secure full compensation for those compelled to leave their holdings; and, thirdly, that legislation to provide State aid for those tenants who have an opportunity of purchasing their holdings should be introduced forthwith."</quote>
Then we have the Farmers' Club. They have issued a report upon the measure, in the course of which they say&#x2014;
<quote>"The Committee of the Farmers' Club consider that the real remedy at the present time is State-aided purchase, and that any other suggestions are mere palliatives which do not meet the main object, which is to keep the tenant in his farm so that he can feel such security as will lead to better cultivation. The Committee believe, therefore, that the tenant farmers will not be satisfied with the Bill now brought in, and will feel that their cause is being neglected by the Government by reason of the omission of legislation on the most important recommendation made by the Departmental Committee."</quote>
The National Farmers' Union has not met, but the chairman of that body, in a letter, says that he is bitterly disappointed that the Government have done nothing in the matter of State-aided purchase, and also that though the Bill might be amended lie cannot believe that any amendment would be of advantage to the tenant farmer.<lb/>
In addition to those three main bodies, there are a large number of reports from the chambers and clubs affiliated to the Central Chamber. I think one at least has been issued to your Lordships. The Chester Farmers' Club say this&#x2014;
<quote>"The members of this club are strongly of opinion that the proposed amendment of the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1908, as contained in Lord Lucas's Bill, is most undesirable, and hope the Bill will not become law."</quote>
There are many others which I do not propose to read to your Lordships. I think this is a very fair indication of agricultural feeling. In fact, it is difficult to find a single case, although there are two
<col>168</col>
or three, where chambers have in any sense supported this measure, and I think in every case where they have supported it they have suggested considerable amendments. I ask the Government whether in the circumstances it is worth while to continue pressing a measure intended for the benefit of agriculturists, but which agriculturists themselves seem to have almost entirely and unanimously repudiated, and, further, whether it would not he better to withdraw this measure which aims only at a minor item, important certainly but comparatively small, in the grievances of farmers, and yet distinctly fails to carry out the objects with which it is brought in.<lb/>
I do not wish to go over any of the points or arguments which we brought before the House at the Second Reading stage, but there is one point which I desire to lay before your Lordships. I understand that when the Government have received protests from farmers and farmers' clubs against their measure they have replied that the measure is brought in to carry out the express wishes of the Departmental Committee. I endeavoured to contradict that on the Second Reading, but I wish to say one word more about it. I think that the Government's answer must have been given under some misapprehension, because although it is certainly true that the Departmental Committee did recommend in their Report that some further extension of time should be given to tenants when their holdings were put up for sale, yet the Government imply in their answer that the views and intentions of the Committee in making that recommendation have been carried out in this Bill. That is, I think, inaccurate. I am quite certain that any of your Lordships who take the trouble to read the Committee's Report will see that the reason this particular recommendation, which, as I have said, is a minor recommendation&#x2014;it is only one out of eight others&#x2014;was put forward was as supplementary to their main recommendation of State-aided purchase, and particularly to carry out the idea that a tenant should have sufficient time after his farm is sold to make his arrangements. It is obvious that under this Bill he has not got that time, because it is just as probable that the owner will sell three months before the expiry of the counter-notice as it is natural that he should now sell three months before the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0089"/>
<col>169</col>
expiry of his own notice. The tenant is therefore in no better position. The Bill does not carry out the recommendation of the Departmental Committee. The objection which farmers have to this Bill is, first of all, that it does not even carry out that minor recommendation; and, secondly, that the scheme of the Bill is quite insufficient. It does not even touch the main grievances of which tenant farmers now complain.<lb/>
The anxiety and insecurity brought to tenant farmers by the breaking-up of estates is a new grievance and must be met in some way or another. It has been brought about to a large extent by the operations of the Small Holdings Act, and it has also been brought about to a large extent by recent legislation and recent taxation, which have made it necessary for owners to dispose of their estates; and the reason which has made it necessary for owners to dispose of their estates is the same reason which is preventing the large owner from buying. Formerly when the large owner bought it was necessary that he should have his farms well occupied by substantial tenants, but now the position is changed. The large owner is no longer in the market. When an estate is sold it has to be split up and sold farm by farm in order to attract the occupying owner, who is now the only person out to buy. Consequently when the existing tenant is unable himself to become the purchaser it is almost certain that he will be turned out of his farm to make room for the new owner, and that is the anxiety of tenant farmers at the present moment. I am quite certain that that anxiety and that insecurity cannot be remedied by tinkering at the law which deals with notice to quit. The farmers in their protests recognise this thoroughly, and say that this Bill is of no consequence or no use to them. The only remedy they can see is some scheme of State-aided land purchase, and they have expressed their extreme disappointment that the Government have refused to take up their grievances and settle them in the only way they think proper. I repeat my request that the Government should consider whether in the circumstances it would not be better for them to withdraw this measure and endeavour to bring in a f ally considered scheme to deal with the matter.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00448"><member>THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is very sad to hear the noble Lord opposite disown his own child in such an unequivocal fashion, all the more so as the reasons which he gives for it seem to be unconvincing lie states, which is no doubt the case, that the main recommendation of the Committee was that which dealt with State-aided purchase, and it was somewhat as an appendage to that that the majority of the Committee signed the particular recommendation which forms the main part of the Bill now before your Lordships. The reason which Lord Clinton gave for not being able to support this proposal as to the counter-notice is that we have not included in our Bill any proposals with regard to purchase.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00449"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: The reason I object to this Bill is that it does not carry out the purpose for which it is intended, which is to give the tenant time to make his arrangements after the farm is sold.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00450"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble Lord has failed to make good that contention. What we have contended all through is that although you may occasionally have cases where it is possible that under the Bill the tenant may be in no better position than he is at the present time, undoubtedly you will have a large number of cases where the serving of the counter-notice will give the tenant a great deal more time than he now has. It will also tend to do another thing&#x2014;namely, to stop this practice which has grown up quite recently of serving notice to quit upon the tenants before an estate is put up for sale. I think a number of cases could be quoted where the counter-notice will undoubtedly be of assistance to the tenant farmer.<lb/>
To pass to the main point in Lord Clinton's speech, I am not going to try and maintain that this Bill has received the unanimous approval of the various organisations of farmers who have discussed it, but I would like to point out that the Bill has been criticised not so much for what it does contain as for what it does not contain, and the principal thing which it does not contain and which
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0090"/>
<col>171</col>
has led to criticism is any proposal with regard to State-aided purchase. Naturally the particular form of State-aided purchase which the farmers regret they do not see in this Bill is that which is recommended in Mr. Jesse Collings's Bill. On that Bill I have two remarks to make. The first is this. After all, one has to remember that the whole of this question from the point of view of the farmer is a financial question, and the test of whether or not a proposal is satisfactory- to him is whether under such a scheme he will be able to pay what he considers to be a fair economic rent for his farm. In the form in which Mr. Jesse Collings's Bill has been considered by the farmers' organisations, the finance of it is, to say the least, misleading, and for this reason. Until, I think, the edition which has been brought out this year it has been proposed to float Consols for the purpose&#x2014;that is to say, &#x00A3;1,000,000,000 and &#x00A3;2,000,000,000 at a rate of interest of 2&#x00BE; per cent. and a sinking fund of &#x00BD; per cent., so that I think one is justified in saying that the finance of that proposal, which has been the one chiefly considered by farmers, is somewhat misleading. My second remark is this, that I do not think that. Bill has the faintest chance of becoming law.<lb/>
The position of the Government is perfectly clear on the question of land purchase. Under present conditions we are definitely opposed to land purchase. I am extremely sceptical, in spite of all that has been said, whether we shall ever see coming from the Party opposite, if and when they ever come into power, any proposals for land purchase at all on anything like the scale contemplated by the people who are discussing this Bill. It will be interesting to see whether the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition is prepared to commit his Party to a policy of land purchase. I am profoundly sceptical of it. As a matter of fact, land purchase in this country is not within the realm of practical politics, and when people recognise that, and when a good deal of this rather windy talk on the subject of land purchase subsides, I think the farmers will realise that this Bill is going to be a better friend to them than the various proposals with regard to land purchase with which they are being bombarded at present. That is the reason, my Lords, why we have no intention of withdrawing the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<col>172</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00451"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot help thinking that the House finds itself in rather an embarrassing position with regard to this Bill, and that of that embarrassment perhaps rather the larger share must be felt by the noble Lords who are responsible for the origin of the measure which we are discussing. Let me remind your Lordships of one or two rather obvious propositions. In the first place, this difficulty with which we have to deal is one for the creation of which His Majesty's Government are very largely responsible. I am quite aware that it has been contended&#x2014;it was contended with great ability by the noble Marquess who leads the House the other day&#x2014;that there are a number of causes which have contributed to the general desire, now so widely prevalent, on the part of owners of land to part with a large portion of their holding. On the other hand, it does seem to me, particularly when you consider the terms of the Report of Lord Haversham's Committee, preposterous to contend that the particular cause which more than all the others has contributed to force land into the market within the last year or two has not been the general apprehension caused in the minds of all land-owners by the language used by certain members of His Majesty's Government. Landowners may have been well content to receive only a very moderate return for their capital locked up in land. They may have been very well content to submit to the many cares and responsibilities which are inseparable from the possession of landed property. But when they are asked to do these things and also to be held up, as they have been held up, to execration&#x2014;that is not too strong a word&#x2014;and when they have been singled out, not once but many times over, for denunciation as the class of the community which beyond all others is greedy and rapacious in its dealings, then, human nature being what it is, you cannot be surprised that many owners of land should ask themselves whether it is worth their while to submit to all these sacrifices any longer. That is one proposition which I venture to affirm.<lb/>
Then there is the grievance of the sitting tenant whose farm is sold over his head. That is admitted on both sides of the House. It is certainly not disputed by His Majesty's Government, and they could not dispute it in the face of the Report of their own Committee. His Majesty's
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0091"/>
<col>173</col>
Government appoint a Committee; they include amongst its members a number of gentlemen who are universally regarded as experts in regard to agricultural questions; and that Committee makes its Report. Well, the first thing His Majesty's Government do is to brush absolutely on one side the main recommendation of that Committee&#x2014;the recommendation, I mean, which suggested that an attempt should be made, not universal but in the particular ease of sitting tenants disturbed in consequence of sales, to facilitate the acquisition of their holdings by those tenants. His Majesty's Government put that altogether on one side. Indeed, the noble Marquess, Lord Crewe, in his speech the other evening banged and bolted the door against all proposals founded upon land purchase. There was also a remarkable article, which I read with much interest, over the signature of the noble Marquess on the Back Bench opposite, Lord Lincolnshire, in one of the periodical reviews&#x2014;a kind of swan song of the retiring Minister and evidently expressing the views of his Department. He, too, was emphatic against purchase.<lb/>
The noble Lord in charge of this Bill, Lord Lucas, asks me whether I am in favour of purchase. I do not know whether he was in the House the other day when the noble Marquess on the Back Bench opposite also challenged me upon that point. I told him that in regard to this particular class of tenant I was in favour of facilitating purchase, and I added that I believed it would be possible to do this without in any way committing oneself to a general and indiscriminate scheme for converting the whole of the tenant farmers of England into owners of their farms. Any proposal of the latter kind I should deprecate every whit as strongly as the noble Lord himself, for all the evidence, and notably the evidence taken by Lord Haversham's Committee, goes to show that the best thing that can happen for the agriculturists of this country is that the old relation of landlord and tenant should go on under conditions which give the tenant a sufficient amount of security.<lb/>
Then His Majesty's Government, having dismissed the main recommendation of the Committee, concentrate upon the minor and ancillary suggestions. They do not take them all, but they take some of
<col>174</col>
them and found their Bill upon those. What has the result been? The result has been a Bill for which no one has a good word to say. I do not believe any Bill, certainly no Bill that I can recollect, has been more sweepingly and unanimously condemned by the very persons whom it is intended to benefit than this Bill has been. My noble friend Lord Clinton cited the different agricultural associations and clubs which had pronounced against it. The noble Lord in charge of the Bill seemed to be under the impression that the condemnation of these societies was entirely due to the fact that they desire to obtain facilities for purchase and consequently repudiate this Bill, but that is not at all the case. The noble Lord will find, if he will take the trouble to read the resolutions passed by the Central Chamber of Agriculture, by the Farmers' Club, by the National Union, and by the Central Land. Association and a number of other bodies, that quite apart from the inclusion or non-inclusion of land purchase they have condemned the proposals of this Bill on their merits as being unsatisfactory and likely to do very little good to the tenants and a great deal of harm to the interests of farming. That really was the plea which my noble friend Lord Clinton put forward.<lb/>
I do not wish to argue the question to-night upon the point of land purchase. Let us put that entirely on one side. It is quite clear that His Majesty's Government are not going to facilitate it. But I want the House to consider whether this Bill as we find it on the Table is a good and useful Bill or not. You are told by the farmers of this country almost unanimously that it is not a good and useful Bill, and the question that my noble friend asks, and I think asks properly, is whether in those circumstances it is worth while for your Lordships to go on with the Bill, or at any rate worth while for His Majesty's Government to continue to press it on the House. I cannot help thinking that if His Majesty's Government were well advised they would of their own accord ask at any rate for a few days in which to consider this great mass of evidence which has unexpectedly been sprung upon them. They cannot possibly have considered it yet. The noble Lord in charge of the Bill was evidently under a misapprehension as to the contents of a great number of these reports and resolutions. What I venture
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0092"/>
<col>175</col>
to suggest is this. Let us put land purchase aside. Let us consider whether this Bill really does what I think most of us want to do&#x2014;that is, to give to the sitting tenant who finds himself disturbed owing to the sale of his farm a sufficient opportunity to turn round and to come to terms if he can with the purchaser of the estate, or, if he cannot con-Le to terms with the purchaser, to look about him for another farm. Those who have examined this Bill believe that owing to the way in which it is drafted it will fail in its object.<lb/>
My noble friend pointed out one respect in which it might certainly so fail. What is there in the first clause of this Bill to prevent a vendor of an estate, if he is served with a counter-notice, from postponing his sale for a year? At the end of that time the sitting tenant comes face to face with the same difficulty. He may have only three months or so in which to turn round. We all admit that is not enough. I hope noble Lords opposite will not suspect for a moment that I want to get rid of this Bill by a side wind. On the contrary, if you can make it into a good Bill I should like to see it made into a good Bill, but if we are driven to go into Committee to-night before we have had time to consider the overwhelming body of objection which has been taken to the Bill, before we have had time to consider what Amendments might be put forward in order to meet those objections, we shall surely approach the subject at a very great disadvantage. Therefore, my Lords, although I do not press the noble Lord, if His Majesty's Government seriously believe that this Bill is a good and useful one, to withdraw it, I do ask him to consider whether it would not be desirable and fair to the House that we should be given at any rate an interval of a few days in which to consider the situation created by this great body of objection to which I have referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00452"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the question which has been put to the Government by the noble Marquess opposite deserves, and indeed demands, an immediate answer. I am sure that we on this side of the House are much obliged to the noble Marquess for the sympathy he expressed for the embarrassment which we feel with regard to this Bill. I am not quite sure whether in the course of his
<col>176</col>
remarks he followed up the sympathy which he expressed for His Majesty's Government by trying to diminish our embarrassment or to increase it. At any rate I am sure that we do not feel any great embarrassment with regard to the matter, and for our own part we should be quite willing to proceed with the Committee stage this afternoon. As the noble Marquess has just told us, this Bill is concerned with the position of the sitting tenant, and noble Lords opposite and His Majesty's Government are all anxious to do what is possible to help the sitting tenant in the difficult position in which we admit he sometimes finds himself. The noble Marquess and Lord Clinton have both referred to the possibility of a landlord, having once announced his sale and having given notice to his tenant and received a counter-notice, then postponing the sale for twelve months, so that eventually the position of the tenant would be no better than it is at the present moment. Let me say that, to quote an expression already used in this debate, human nature being what it is we do not think that it is likely that any landlord would take such a very curious procedure. Obviously from his own point of view the management of the estate would present considerable difficulties if he did so. For ourselves we do not see the necessity for postponing the discussion, but if noble Lords opposite move that the Committee stage be postponed for a fortnight His Majesty's Government would not offer any opposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00453"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are grateful to the noble Earl for having received the suggestion of my noble friend in the manner in which he has done. I noticed that the noble Lord in charge of the Bill did not attempt to defend his Bill, but proceeded to attack another proposal in a measure which I believe is in the other House but is not before your Lordships' House. But although Lord Lucas showed a discreet silence with regard to the Bill itself, the noble Earl who has just sat down did deal with one point that was raised, and seemed to think it incredible that a landlord on receiving a counter-notice would postpone his sale. I think it is natural enough that on receiving the counter-notice he should postpone the sale. I observed that in the Second Reading discussion the argument was used that the landlord would not do that
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0093"/>
<col>177</col>
because some tenants might give a counter-notice and other tenants might not, and he would, if he postponed the sale, have a sort of particoloured property left. That was a plausible argument, but it was not repeated by the noble Earl to-night, and I think that when it is looked at it is seen not to have much value. Modern sales are not sales of a property as a whole. The property is sold in bits. In the case where particular pieced are purchased for occupation there would be no difficulty in selling a certain number of the farms on your estate one year and the remainder, which had been subject to the counter-notice, in the succeeding year. The difficulty disappears altogether when the estate is disposed of piecemeal, which is the modern practice. Therefore there appears to be nothing whatever to be said for this Bill. The Bill does not make the sitting tenant any more secure. He will not know what his fate is to be until perhaps three months before the expiration of the second year. He will be in the same position of uncertainty as to his fate under the Government proposal as he is under present circumstances, but he will be in this position worse off&#x2014;the period of uncertainty will be much longer. That is not a good but a bad thing. So that this wonderful proposal which is to help tenants will positively put things in a worse position than they are in at present. There will be uncertainty for twenty-one months, and, so far from that being an advantage to the farmer and to agriculture, it will be a disadvantage. How can the Government defend such a proposal as this&#x2014;a proposal which on its merits breaks down and which has been manifestly condemned by all whom it is supposed to benefit? The noble Earl is quite wise in agreeing to a postponement. I think we shall do well to accept the suggestion that the Committee stage should be postponed for a fortnight, and we must see in the meantime whether there are any means of making this useless Bill into a Bill which will be a benefit to the tenant farmers of this country. I move the adjournment of the debate.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00497"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member> moved to insert a new paragraph to follow paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>). The noble Earl said: This Amendment is also to meet a point which was raised by the noble Marquess opposite. When this Bill was in Committee Lord Salisbury said there might be a covenant or contract of settlement made ten or twelve years before the bankruptcy which might contemplate as one of its provisions that money to come subsequently to the husband from some particular person should be protected for the wife under the settlement. The object of this Amendment is more or less to meet the situation then outlined by the noble Marquess. The question is purely a legal one and a very difficult one. We had an interesting discussion upon it when the Bill was in Committee, and I trust that these words, which have been carefully drafted, will meet the view of the noble Marquess.</p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00504"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: I desire to support the Amendment moved by the noble Lord opposite. This is a very difficult question, and, as the noble Earl in charge of the Bill said, it is one upon which we had considerable discussion on the last occasion. I look at the matter from a business point of view, and it is not always easy for a layman to understand what is said on the other side from the legal poi at of view. In supporting this Amendment my one desire is to prevent commercial fraud. There are two sides to this question. We have, first of all, the trader. The trader gets into difficulties; he has command at that time of a great deal of creditors' money, which he takes. He settles the creditors' money on the lady whom he afterwards marries, and that is held to be a good consideration. The creditors can do nothing at all except look on while the trader lives on the interest of the money happily ever afterwards. That is the creditors' side of the case. I listened with great attention to the remarks which were made by Lord Salisbury in Committee. The noble Marquess put it very fairly from the lady's side, and it certainly seemed hard on the lady that she should be deprived of the money. I confess, looking at it as carefully as I can, that I think the lady's interests are more easily protected than the interests of the creditors. If the father takes the necessary precaution the lady's interests can be fully protected. In my opinion this is an extremely good Bill. I supported the noble Earl's Amendment which the House inserted a few moments ago, and I support Lord Rotherham's Amendment because the new paragraph (<i>c</i>) with these words added goes further in the direction of affording precaution to creditors.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00505"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I do not see any objection to the Amendment in principle. I only want to protect a <i>bona fide</i> settlement which the father has had made at the time of the marriage and without which he would not have consented to the marriage in the interests of his daughter. To have that upset years afterwards, which might have happened under
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0097"/>
<col>185</col>
the clause as it originally stood, seemed a great hardship. Upon that point I carried the general sense and feeling of the House with me. Now what the noble Lord opposite proposes is to add to the Amendment which the Government have inserted a provision that the money should be paid over immediately. There is evidently a great advantage in having the money paid over at once. The noble Lord proposes that it should be paid over within one month. I think that is almost too short a period, and what I suggest to His Majesty's Government and to the noble Lord is that they should allow, say, three months.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00506"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: I am glad that a settlement has been come to on this point. One wishes, of course, to protect marriage settlements, and, on the other hand, to avoid the scandal which occurs in such cases as that to which attention was called during the discussion of this point in Committee. There is, I think, a great deal to be said for the Amendment now under discussion, which proposes that whenever a property comes into possession there should be a speedy dealing with it. I feel also the force of what the noble Marquess has just said, that a month is a very short time. One knows how difficult it is to get these transactions through speedily, and I suggest to the noble Lord who has moved this Amendment that he would be well advised in giving a little more time.

<title>SHOOTING ESCAPING CONVICTS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00552"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member> rose to call attention to the practice of shooting escaping convicts, and to move to resolve&#x2014;
<quote>"That in the opinion of this House the infliction of the penalty of death or wounding upon convicts who are seeking to escape should no longer be authorised by law."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00553">The noble Earl said: My Lords, from time to time in the ordinary course of perusing the daily newspaper I read with a certain amount of shock that convicts who may have been attempting to escape, generally at Dartmoor, have been fired upon by the warders and have been more or less seriously wounded and taken to hospital, and in some, but fortunately rare, cases they have actually been killed. I wish to communicate to the House this afternoon, if possible, that sense of shock with which one reads in the year 1912 such announcements as that, and I wish to suggest to your Lordships that that particular method of restraining convicts and of keeping them in confinement is somewhat out of date and might be superseded by better methods. I recognise that in order to justify putting an end to a practice which is undoubtedly one of some antiquity one ought to show that the practice is no longer of any use. I hope also to persuade your Lordships that it comes from a rather barbarous time and should no longer exist, and that it is possible to exercise the necessary discipline and to recapture an escaped convict without taking these extreme measures.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00554">I have not informed, myself as to the origin of this practice, and I do not know whether it rests upon any statutory enactment. I am rather inclined to think that it does not. I am inclined to think that it survives from the time when it was not unusual for force to be used by the Executive in cases of this kind. It is obvious that in the case of an escaping convict shooting is not necessary for the protection of the warders, because the' escaping convict is not an attacking convict. He is running away, endeavouring to escape observation and not offering fight; and we know that nowadays in the case of riots resulting from strikes or other reasons there is a great and natural reluctance to use lethal weapons against people even when they are actually threatening violence to those in authority and causing commotion. Now comes the question whether this practice is any
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0100"/>
<col>191</col>
longer necessary. I think if your Lordships follow the accounts of these occasional escapes in the newspapers you will observe that when a convict escapes he is invariably recaptured within a very short period, generally within twenty-four hours or at the extreme within from three to five days. It may, of course, be argued in support of the practice that while he is at large he is a danger to the ordinary peaceful population in the neighbourhood of the convict establishment from which he has escaped; but I think modern records rather tend to show that all he does as a rule is to break into some farmhouse for the purpose of stealing food or clothes. He is not any danger to life or more than a moderate danger to property, and if it was necessary to restrain him by firing at him because he was a danger to property I think that a somewhat similar argument might apply to burglars at large.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00555">The convict is tried before a Judge and jury with every formality and every protection of law, and no matter how serious his offence may have been, except in a few rare cases where it is possible to order flogging, the Judge himself is not in a position to inflict corporal punishment, far less is the Judge in a position to order the man to be shot at. It seems rather strange that a person in the position of life and with the education of a warder should be placed in a position so much superior to that of the Judge at the trial who sentences the prisoner, and that once the prisoner has been sentenced he should so entirely lose his ordinary human rights as to become a fit object to be shot at by a warder if he tries to escape. The offence of escaping in itself is an offence which involves no moral turpitude. It is as natural for a convict to wish to escape as for a bird to try and escape from its cage. Therefore you cannot say that he is guilty at the moment of escaping of any conduct which deserves moral censure. When once a convict ceases to have the instinct to regain his liberty he has become what I suppose would be called a model prisoner, but a prisoner quite hopeless and useless to the community outside the prison because he has lost all sense of discipline, of self-control, and of self-respect.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00556">Apart from the great power which you entrust to the warder, what justification is there nowadays for this practice? I should also like to call attention to the crimes for which prisoners may find them-
<col>192</col>
selves in this position. I have heard of a man sentenced to three years penal servitude for breaking a plate-glass window. It is true that he had committed the offence before and had been warned that if it was repeated he would get penal servitude, and he did. But once having received this sentence he becomes liable to be seriously wounded or killed if, obeying some sudden hope for freedom, some sudden chance in a fog, he tries to run away; in that case he is liable to be shot at, and, it not killed, seriously wounded. I suggest to your Lordships that the time has gone past for dealing with our convicts on that principle. We are a civilised community, we have an excellent and efficient police force and communication by telephone and telegraph which make it almost impossible for any man to escape when sought for, and we need no longer adopt methods of a rude and uncivilised kind.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00557">Nor is there any moral justification for adding so severe a punishment to the sentence already imposed on the man by the Court Your only right, I suggest, is to catch him again and to keep him for the term of his sentence, and in catching him you ought to use the most humane methods. You ought not to be inhuman any more than is absolutely necessary, and you have no more right to catch an escaping convict by shooting him than you would have to throw at him an anchor with a hook at the end and catch him in, that way. I do not know whether this question has been considered at the Home Office and whether the Home Office have asked themselves whether it is necessary to retain this power, or on what it rests; but I think the time has come when it might be considered, and if I could receive any hope that the matter would be considered and that other regulations might be made, retaining if you like the existence of this power but not exercising it, I should be glad to withdraw my Motion. But I do think that this practice no longer consorts with the state of this country. It is no longer fitting for us in these times to employ these somewhat barbarous methods for restraining convicts. Therefore I move the Motion standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00558"><i>Moved</i> to resolve, That in the opinion of this House the infliction of the penalty of death or wounding upon convicts who are seeking to escape should no longer be authorised by law.&#x2014;(<i>Earl Russell.</i>)</p>

I have had some experience in another place of representing a Department under like conditions, and I know the difficulties. It is therefore with the more sincerity that I ask for the kindly consideration of your Lordships in replying to the Motion of the noble Earl. As far as I gather, the noble Earl makes no charge against the warders or officials of convict prisons of doing anything which is outside their duty, or acting in any extreme way. The view of the noble Earl appears to be that this right of shooting at escaping convicts, many of them very desperate characters indeed, ought to be abolished, and, indeed, that there should be no arming of warders.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00560"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: I did not say that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00561"><member>LORD STRACIHE</member><membercontribution>: As far as I gathered, the noble Earl deprecated shooting to prevent the escape of convicts. It does not matter whether it is inside or out. It might be equally necessary to use firearms in either case. The noble Earl certainly could not have sustained the suggestion that great care has not been taken by the authorities in the regulations regarding the use of fire-arms. Convicts are only fired on under careful regulations with minimum risk to life and limb. To show that that is the case, may I quote the regulation which has been laid clown by the Home Office on this point? It runs&#x2014;
<quote>"The object of firing being mainly to induce a convict to stop whilst in the act of effecting his escape, it would be advisable that the first shot at least should be wide of the mark, and, if it should be necessary again to lire, that the aim should be low, which would avoid the danger of wounding a vital part and would at the same time be most effective in causing him to desist from his purpose."</quote>
I think it will be clear to your Lordships that that principle has been acted upon when I inform you that during the period from 1880 to 1896 three convicts only were killed, and that since that period no
<col>194</col>
convicts have been killed but only wounded when attempting to escape.<lb/>
An inquiry was instituted in 1896, no doubt arising out of the deaths of these convicts, and the regulations to which I have referred were made in consequence. The noble Earl seemed to lose sight of the fact that a very large percentage of the men in these convict prisons are of a desperate character. They are inert who have been convicted, perhaps, of very serious offences against the subject, and of causing grievous bodily harm. Therefore it is very necessary that the warders, who are only in the proportion of ten per cent to the convicts, should be properly armed in order to prevent a mutiny, for these convicts are often employed in field work outside and in gangs in the quarries at Portland and other places. What would be the alternative if the suggestion of the noble Earl were adopted? It seems to me that the only alternative would be to chain these gangs together. It seems to me very undesirable, if not revolting, that you should have human beings at work in quarries chained together, as was the case in the Middle Ages.<lb/>
The right of the restricted power to shoot at escaping convicts is necessary as a deterrent as well as a preventive against escape. It is also a deterrent from attacks upon warders. Warders are often attacked as it is, and I think your Lordships will agree that the Home Office is perfectly right in refusing to accept the noble Earl's Motion. As I have explained, this power is used with great care and under strict regulations, and since 1896 has not resulted in any serious injury, and certainly in no loss of life. In these circumstances, I submit that it would be very undesirable in the interests of good order and good management and preventing attempts at escape that this power should be abolished. Therefore on behalf of the Home Office I must resist the -Motion of the noble Earl.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00564"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF ST. ASAPH</member> rose "to call attention to the misleading statements recently made by the Home Secretary in reference to the comparative work of the Church and the Calvinistic Methodists in Cardiff."</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00565">The right rev. Prelate said: My Lords, in calling attention to statements about the Church in Wales recently made by the Home Secretary I at the outset disclaim any desire to discuss the merits or demerits of the particular measure which gave rise to these statements. My purpose is to deal with simple matters of fact, for proof of which there is official authority open to all which no one can dispute. On May 16, in concluding the debate on the Second Reading of the Welsh Disestablishment Bill, the Home Secretary made the following statements&#x2014;
<quote>"Who does the slum work in the cities of wales? I will take the City of Cardiff and I will ask you to compare the work of the Calvinistic Methodist Forward Movement with the work of the Church of England. And when you are dealing with Wales and ask Who is to minister to the poor?' you have to conjure up to your mind not the work of the Church of England but the work of the Free Churches. The Calvinistic Methodist Forward Movement in Cardiff alone has no less than twenty-two halls. What are the corresponding figures for the whole of the Church of England throughout Cardiff? There are but thirteen churches of the Church of England in Cardiff, and to anybody who knows Cardiff the whole of the work of the Church of England in Cardiff is not comparable to the work done by one Free Church alone, the Calvinistic Methodist."</quote>
Upon this passage let me observe that slum work and work for the poor represent a test of work which the Church welcomes. Cardiff is the greatest city in Wales, and
<col>196</col>
nowhere could this searching test be applied on so large and conclusive a scale.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00566">I now come to the facts. In the one great slum district of Cardiff the Church has the Parish Church of St. Mary's, the Mission Church of St. Michael's, large day and Sunday schools, three clergy residing in the very centre of the slum district, and five Sisters of Mercy living and working there. The Calvinistic Movement, with which Mr. McKenna compared the Church, does not touch this district and has not got one single hall or mission place in the district. Moreover, the number of Church communicants and of Sunday school scholars in this district is at least three times as large as that of all the Nonconformist bodies put together. There is no comparison between the Church and the Calvinistic Methodist work in this district because the Methodists have nothing to offer in comparison. Again, Mr. McKenna stated that the Calvinistic Methodists have twenty-two halls in Cardiff. I called his attention to the fact that all the Methodist chapels and halls added together do not number twenty-two. In justification of his statement he frankly admitted that he obtained the figure twenty-two by counting the various adjoining rooms in these buildings as separate halls, and thus the nine halls which the official record of the Methodists themselves claims were increased to twenty-two. According to this computation a church with a choir vestry and a clergy vestry would be counted as three churches, or a Church mission building with three rooms would be counted as three mission chapels.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00567">I now come to the last statement of Mr. McKenna, that there are but thirteen churches of the Church of England in Cardiff, and that the whole of the work of the Church of England in Cardiff is not comparable to the work done by one Free Church alone, the Calvinistic Methodist. I take the last assertion as to the comparison of the Church and the Methodists in Cardiff. The total number of the Church communicants in Cardiff returned to the Royal Commission was 9,354, and the total number of the communicants of the Calvinistic Methodists in Cardiff was 3,484. Mr. McKenna seems to think not only that a half, but a third, is more than the whole.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00568">Finally, I come to Mr. McKenna's most amazing statement, that there are but thirteen churches of the Church of England
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0103"/>
<col>197</col>
in Cardiff. Mr. McKenna has omitted all the churches in Cardiff and given only the thirteen mission rooms. There are twenty-five churches in Cardiff as returned to the Royal Commission. And here let me make one point clear. I have not raised questions of controversy but questions of fact. The present Government issued a Royal Commission to report upon the work of the Church and the Nonconformists in Wales. Every fact and figure which I have given to-day can be substantiated from the Reports of that Royal Commission. Mr. McKenna cannot urge in his defence the extenuating circumstance that a busy Minister cannot be expected to make minute local inquiries. He had the evidence at hand before him in the Official Reports of the Royal Commission, and therefore there is no reasonable excuse which can be urged for these disastrous blunders.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00569">But the matter does not stop there. Mr. McKenna's attention has been called to these grievous mistakes. The evidence which he does not attempt to deny has been put before him again and again. How has he met this serious position? Instead of answering straightforwardly in another place, he first attempted to shield himself by putting up somebody else to speak, and then, after receiving a rebuke probably as severe as any ever given to a Minister of the Crown, he made no apology for his misstatements hut endeavoured, in the fete words which lie, was compelled to say, to avoid the real points at issue. It is an unpleasant task to call attention to these things, but beyond and above the controversy of the moment we have a right to claim from His Majesty's Ministers a high standard of honour, and it is because I believe that this House is jealous and vigilant in maintaining that standard of honour in our public men that I felt it to be my duty to bring this matter before your Lordships' House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00570"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD STRACHIE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have to ask for some indulgence in this matter, because it was only when the House was rising last night that I was made aware that the right rev. Prelate intended calling attention to this subject in your Lordships' House to-day. I at once put myself in communication with him and asked him to be so kind as to give me the date of the Home Secretary's statement which he describes as misleading. The right rev. Prelate gave me the date&#x2014;namely, May 16. I further asked him whether in the circum-
<col>198</col>
stances he could see his way to postpone this discussion. I pointed out that this was in the nature of a personal controversy between the Home Secretary and the right rev. Prelate and not a question connected with the administration of the Home Office, and that therefore it was desirable that I should have an opportunity of conferring with the Home Secretary on the matter. I informed the right rev. Prelate that owing to public business which the Home Secretary has to undertake to-day, which is even more important than attending to the Motion before the House, it was impossible for me to confer with my right hon. friend on the matter. The right rev. Prelate, however, was unable to agree to a postponement. Having made that explanation I will do my best to answer the statement made to-day, but in the circumstances I hope the House will excuse me if I cannot give a complete reply.<lb/>
The right rev. Prelate said, first of all, that the Home Secretary made a misleading statement in his speech in the. House of Commons on May 16 as to the comparative work of the Church of England and the Calvinistic Methodists in Cardiff. As I understand, the Home Secretary was not dealing with the whole comparative work of the Church of England and the Methodists in Cardiff. He was rather making a statement upon the question of the comparative work of these two religious bodies in the slum areas of Cardiff, the comparison being purely one as regards slum work. The Home Secretary introduced the question with the following words&#x2014;
<quote>"The question has been asked in die course of this debate, `If the Church is disestablished who will minister to the poor?' Words convey meanings to us according to our antecedent impressions and associations, and in this House immediately that question is put to an audience consisting almost entirely of English and Scottish Members, the picture is conjured up of some Church of England missionary going down to the slums of our great cities teaching and winning the poor over to the Christian faith. Is that a picture of what happens in Wales? Who does the slum work in the cities of Wales?"</quote>
That paragraph surely makes quite clear what was in the mind of the Home Secretary at the time. He was not dealing with the ordinary work of the two Churches, but with their purely missionary work.<lb/>
Further on the Home Secretary gave statistics of the Calvinistic Methodist Forward Movement, whose first object,
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0104"/>
<col>199</col>
he said, was "to reach non-church and non-chapel goers," showing that he was referring to a particular class of the population and not to the population of Cardiff as a whole. He gave the number of halls belonging to the Movement and their accommodation. Then he asked, What are the <i>corresponding</i> figures for the Church of England? and lie gave the number of their mission rooms, which, by inadvertence, he described as "churches." The fact cannot be doubted that he was dealing with purely mission work in the slums and among the poor. The point has been taken that there are not twenty-two mission balls belonging to the Forward Movement in Cardiff. There may or may not be twenty-two separate buildings, but there are twenty-two halls which can he used and are used simultaneously for this work; and I must say it does not seem to me a matter of very great importance whether these twenty-two halls are each under a separate roof or not as long as they serve the same purpose of getting the people in in order that they may hear the gospel.<lb/>
In stating that the Forward Movement had twenty-two halls Mr. McKenna took the figure from the Appendices to the Report of the Welsh Church. Commission, Vol. I, Part II, page 167. He took into account the schoolrooms adjoining the halls, because it was explained in evidence before the Commission that these schoolrooms were used for religious services simultaneously with the halls themselves. It is not the case that the Home Secretary took into account all the classrooms attached. The following footnote is appended to the Table in the Report of the Royal Commission which he made use of: "Classrooms are attached to these halls which we have not taken into consideration." The result, then, briefly is as follows. The Home Secretary gave the figures for the purely missionary halls and schools of the Calvinistic Methodists, but never referred to any of their chapels. He then gave the "corresponding" figures for the mission rooms of the Church of England, which he took from Vol. V of the Evidence of the Welsh Church Commission, page 39. That number is thirteen. He did not give, and he never intended to give, the figures for the ordinary churches of the Church of England in Cardiff, as that figure would be utterly irrelevant for the purposes of his argument.<lb/>
<col>200</col>
Then the right rev. Prelate referred to the number of communicants of the Church of England and the Calvinistic Methodists. That, again, is not a question that applies to mission work in slum areas, and it was not the question which the Home Secretary went into. Therefore we can dismiss that from our minds. Then the right rev. Prelate seemed to think that as regards the slum area in Cardiff, which is known as Tiger Bay, the Nonconformists were doing very little if anything at all. I am informed that in the parish of St. Mary's there are four Nonconformist chapels, and that there are also in that area two sailors' rests which are run by Nonconformists, each of these rests having a salaried Nonconformist missioner. Again, the superintendent of one of these homes is a Presbyterian.<lb/>
I hope the House will understand that in replying to the right rev. Prelate I have been placed in some difficulty owing to the Question having been sprung upon me and the right rev. Prelate not seeing his way to postpone it, though I must say he very graciously gave me all the details he could on the matter. I have now given to the House all the information I have at my disposal. It was impossible for the Home Secretary to deal with this matter himself owing to the short notice and to the fact that he had to leave London on public business at an early hour this morning.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00571"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the House has listened with much sympathy to the noble Lord in the difficult task which he has had to perform, because when a colleague commits himself to a statement of the kind to which the Home Secretary committed himself the task of defending him cannot be described as simple or easy. But do not in your sympathy with the noble Lord who has just spoken forget that the whole object of the Home Secretary in his observations was to point out that the Church of England in Cardiff was doing less work than one single Nonconformist body. That was the whole point of his observations, and therefore I do not think that your Lordships can agree with the noble Lord who has just spoken, that the right rev. Prelate had no need to introduce the comparative figures, as given before the Royal Commission, of the communicants of the Church of England in Cardiff and the communicants of the Calvinistic Methodists.
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0105"/>
<col>201</col>
I think those figures require more explanation than has yet been given to them if we are to be led to suppose that the work of the Church of England in Cardiff is of less volume and less effect than the work of that great religious body the Calvinistic Methodists alone.<lb/>
What is the explanation which the noble Lord has asked this House to accept? He tells us that the Home Secretary had in his mind the slum or mission work alone, and it was due to the fact that that alone was in his mind that he omitted to mention all the churches of the Church of England which exist in Cardiff. I will ask your Lordships to listen to the words actually used by the Home Secretary presently, and then you will be able to judge whether that explanation is really adequate and whether Mr. McKenna's words are really capable of that interpretation. First of all, I would ask you to recollect the figures which the noble Lord has just given about the halls at the disposal of the Calvinistic Methodists in Cardiff for mission work. He has read from the records of the Royal Commission that there are twenty-two such halls. He has been careful to explain that all of those halls are not buildings exclusively devoted to this object, but that some of them are halls available for other purposes but available also for these purposes when the Calvinistic Methodists wish so to use them. We are very glad that the number of halls at the disposal of the Calvinistic Methodists should be so large; but there is a distinction, when you are comparing the work of two great religious bodies, between halls which have been purchased or erected for this exclusive religious purpose and halls which can only be occasionally retained for assisting that object. It is clear that the occasional use of a hall for this purpose is not as strong an evidence of the permanent character and strength of the work of a religious body as the existence of a building which has been erected for this purpose exclusively and devoted to no other. Therefore, while giving the Calvinistic Methodists every credit for the existence of these buildings and for the use they put other buildings occasionally to, it is of interest to remember that all these buildings are not exclusively devoted to this purpose. Yet, when it came to the comparison all these buildings were put to the credit of the Calvinistic Methodists. The Church of England was credited with
<col>202</col>
only the thirteen mission halls, all of them, I understand, exclusively devoted to this purpose, and the Home Secretary entirely forgot to mention the twenty-five churches. But why are churches not centres of mission work? Every permanent church or chapel, whether it belongs to the Church of England or to another religious body, is a centre of religious work and not less entitled to be considered in making this comparison than a smaller or humbler building erected in a particularly poor quarter.<lb/>
Now let us consider how far Mr. McKenna's words can possibly bear the interpretation which the noble Lord has put upon them. Mr. McKenna said&#x2014;
<quote>"What are the corresponding figures for the whole of the Church of England throughout Cardiff?"</quote>
Not one word about mission work. Not one word about slums, but the "corresponding figures for the whole of the Church of England throughout Cardiff." Now, my Lords, I say with confidence that if the English language means anything at all those words mean that there was not a building connected with the Church of England unaccounted for in the Home Secretary's statement. I maintain also that it cannot possibly be said that he was thinking only of the slum districts. Otherwise how could he use the words "corresponding figures for the whole of the Church of England throughout Cardiff" And then he went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"There are but thirteen churches of the Church of England in Cardiff."</quote>
We know that a hard-worked Minister does sometimes deviate into inaccuracy when dealing with statistics. I do not think that any inaccuracy really would be pardonable when it is the inaccuracy of a Minister in charge of one of the principal Government measures on a subject which he knows that on one side or the other the whole of his fellow-countrymen feel very strongly. Has there ever been another case where a Minister, having made such a gross misstatement, having been so utterly unfair to his opponents, so utterly unfair to a religious body which is on its trial and which is the subject of a measure which it believes conscientiously proposes to perpetrate upon it a great wrong&#x2014;has there ever been a case in which a Minister of the Crown, having made such a misstatement, has not had the courage or the good faith to confess it?</membercontribution></p>

<col>203</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00572"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think the statement of my right hon. friend the Home Secretary really deserves the hard language which the noble Earl opposite has applied to it. In a question of this kind there are, of course, always facts and inferences, and we all admit that the inferences which may be drawn from certain facts may be different on both sides of the House. It ought to be easy to arrive at the actual facts, and I do not see why we should not do so this evening. What was it that my right hon. friend said? He was dealing with the very poor in Cardiff, and not, as the noble Earl suggests, with the whole of the work of the Church of England. He was dealing with the work of the Church of England and of the Calvinistic Methodists among the very poor in Cardiff, and he proceeded to compare like with like. He did not take the churches of both bodies, or, as the noble Earl would wish me to say, the churches of the Church of England and the Nonconformist chapels. He did not compare those with one another. What he did was to compare the number of mission halls of the one with the number of mission halls of the other. There is no suggestion that in the comparison which he made he added the churches or chapels to either side. He was merely comparing the mission halls which deal with a certain class of the poor, and these mission halls on both sides deal with the same class. Those were the facts with which my right hon. friend was dealing.<lb/>
We have already had quoted to us the figures from the Blue-book, about which I do not think there is any dispute. My information about the use of these halls is different from that of the noble Earl opposite. The Calvinistic Methodist mission halls and schoolrooms are exclusively and permanently used, for religious purposes, if two services can go on at the same time in different rooms in the same building I think it is a fair method of calculation to speak of them as two meeting places. My right hon. friend put the Calvinistic Methodist halls in Cardiff alone at twenty-two, without adding the chapels, and then compared with that the figures of the Church of England. It is perfectly impossible for the noble Earl to deduce from the words used an extended meaning which was not attached to them at the time in the House of Commons,
<col>204</col>
and certainly not at any time by the speaker himself. My right hon. friend was dealing specially with the work of the mission halls among the very poor, and having excluded in one case the chapels he proceeded to exclude in the other case the churches, and he gave the figure of thirteen mission halls. I do not think there is any doubt as to the actual figures, although there has been some criticism as to the enumeration of two rooms in one building as two separate halls. Except from that point of view I do not think that on the actual figures there is any serious controversy between us, and I venture to say that if any one of your Lordships reads the whole passage and does not take a single sentence, as the noble Earl did, away from its context, it will be impossible for him to say that in the statement made my right hon. friend was not substantially correct.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00573"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not intervene in this debate with a view of dwelling upon the detailed statistics put forward by Mr. McKenna, not, I think, as was inadvertently stated by the noble Lord who speaks for the Government, on the Motion for the adjournment of the House but in the great debate on the Bill itself. The point of the matter seems to me to rest, not upon some mistake in statistics, but upon the much broader fact that while we expect accuracy from every member of either House of Parliament when he is speaking on an important subject, we have especially a right to expect it when the Minister in charge of a great Bill is deliberately setting before the House and the country a general summary of the situation and of the Government's case, making for example in this instance a careful comparison between the work of the Church and the work of Nonconformity. We say that in such a case he is peculiarly bound to be, in the large sense of the word, accurate in the figures which he puts forward. I am a bad statistician and a bad hand at remembering detailed figures in the course of a debate, and I should make the greatest possible excuse even for a Minister of the Crown if inadvertently some statements were made which proved on investigation to be unsupported by fact. But I venture to say without hesitation that if any one will read quietly and without bias of any kind the statement made by the Home Secretary
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0107"/>
<col>205</col>
in support of the great proposition which he was giving to the country and will follow the comparison he drew between the Church and Nonconformity in the great city of Cardiff, and will then give attention to what was afterwards said about the mistake the right hon. gentleman had made in the figures, he will see that the Home Secretary had only one possible course left open to him. When a Minister of the Crown had made such a serious mistake as Mr. McKenna had inadvertently made, he would naturally be expected to acknowledge it, and in that case every one would have understood and condoned what had happened. Instead of following that course, when the real figures had been presented to him three or four times by successive writers and speakers, the right hon. gentleman uttered a single sentence or so in the House of Commons and then wrote to the newspapers to say that he had already refuted the figures put forward by those who criticised him. My Lords, there is no such refutation on record. The Home Secretary's memory may have deceived him, but we have not had any refutation to our challenge. I deeply deplore the fact that in a matter of this kind when a Minister in charge of a great measure has inadvertently been led into making a misstatement which was at once made much of by his supporters as an important statement of fact he could not, when it was shown that he had been mistaken, have stood up and acknowledged that he had been misled. That, and that alone, is what I personally take exception to. If the Home Secretary had acknowledged his mistake I would have been ready to make the greatest possible allowance for an over-worked man labouring under the difficulty of a very hard case to prove; but in the circumstances I find it impossible to make any such excuse for the continuous silence with which the demonstration that his figures were altogether erroneous has been met.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00574"><member>*THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are about to have a discussion in this House as to the manner in which the business of His Majesty's Government is distributed among the occupants of the Front Bench opposite. I think we shall have to suggest to them that one Minister should be told off specially for the purpose of explaining away the utterances of his colleagues. Last night we listened to the noble Marquess, Lord Crewe, with much
<col>206</col>
ingenuity putting various glosses upon an extremely inconsistent statement made by his Under-Secretary elsewhere; and tonight we have had two Ministers bestowing equal ingenuity upon explaining away the statement recently made by the Home Secretary in the House of Commons. I hope the two noble Lords will excuse me if I tell them that I never listened to more unconvincing explanations. We all felt a sympathy with the noble Lord who spoke first, and we took note of his plea that he had not had very long notice of his discussion and had been consequently a little pressed for time. But may I venture ay that if lie had had six months to prepare his case he could not have made a better defence than he made this evening, because there was no defence to make. The noble Earl opposite renewed the attempt to convince us that the Home Secretary when he made his speech in the House of Commons was instituting a comparison between mission halls and mission halls. That theory is absolutely inconsistent with the plain language of the Home Secretary himself. The Home Secretary was drawing a picture of the state of things in Cardiff. He did not confine himself to the slum area. He was dealing with what he described as "the whole work of the. Church of England throughout Cardiff" without any limitation whatever, and in the picture that he drew he light-heartedly included the chapels on one side and left out the churches on the other. It is very easy to argue if you are permitted to halve your opponents' figures and to double your own, and that is really the mathematical basis on which the contention of His Majesty's Government is founded.<lb/>
But, my Lords, I do not know that I should have intervened had it not been for my desire to point out to your Lordships that what we are discussing this evening is not merely a personal question. So far as the personal question is concerned, the Minister undoubtedly fell into a very serious error; but, as the most rev. Primate said a moment ago, every one would have been ready to condone the error if it had been frankly admitted and apologised for. But what I think is to be borne in mind is that the whole of these arguments, based, as we have shown, on such a slight foundation, are part of a deliberate policy to belittle the work of the Church of England in Wales and to exalt in comparison with it the work done by the Nonconformist
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0108"/>
<col>207</col>
denominations. In endeavouring to establish that disadvantage noble Lords opposite and their friends spare no pains to show that the Church of England neglects her opportunities in Wales, that she is outstripped by other denominations, that she is out of touch with the people of the country, and that her teachings are imposed upon reluctant people. It is in order to establish those propositions that all these statistics, so inaccurate, so recklessly collected, are put before the public; and I think we owe a great debt of gratitude to the right rev. Prelate for the courage with which he has taken this sample of the arguments used by the other side and exhibited in the full light of day the absolute untrustworthiness of the statements which have been made use of. To my mind, the result of the examination which the Home Secretary's statements have undergone has been to throw very grave doubt indeed upon the statistical basis of the whole of the case upon which it is proposed to deprive the Church of England in Wales of her present position there, and to rob her of her slender resources.</membercontribution></p>

Prelate choose to put upon the substantial meaning of the speech of the Home Secretary. The question that was raised by Mr. McKenna was not that of the whole work of the Church of England. Lord Selborne said that Mr. McKenna's object was to show that the Church of England was doing less work in Cardiff than one Nonconformist church. Mr. McKenna's observations, it is quite clear, dealt with one particular section of the work of the various Christian bodies&#x2014;namely, that section of their work which is addressed to the specially poor and to those who stand out of all religious organisations. The noble Marquess who leads the Opposition complained of Mr. McKenna's figures being grossly inaccurate. I contend that though Mr. McKenna made the slip in his speech, which he corrected long before this debate, of using the word "churches" when he was speaking of "mission halls," the whole of the previous part of his speech showed that he was speaking of those places which appeal to persons outside the regular frequenters of the church.</membercontribution></p>
<col>208</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00576"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF ST. ASAPH</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord is arguing as if these halls were treated as halls in the Blue-book. They are classified in the official return of the Nonconformists themselves as "chapels." That is our point, that while including all the chapels of the Nonconformists Mr. McKenna excluded all the churches of the Church of England.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00577"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: The Church of England statistics, after enumerating their churches, enumerate their thirteen mission halls. These Mr. McKenna inadvertently called "churches," but he corrected himself afterwards and said he meant mission halls. The noble Marquess who leads the Opposition complained that Mr. McKenna had added together the chapels and the mission halls in order to get his number. I turn to Vol. VI of the Royal Commission's Report containing the figures handed in by the Calvinistic Methodists of Cardiff. There you have set out the chapels and the schoolrooms, and very often the schoolroom adjoins the chapel, but sometimes the schoolroom is separate. The seating is totalled up separately in the tables; the schoolroom is different from the chapel, and the statistics are put separately. If you add together the chapels and the schoolrooms of the Calvinistic Methodists you get a considerably larger figure than the twenty-two which Mr. McKenna quoted. There is no mistake about it that the mission rooms or schoolrooms of the Calvinistic Methodists are distinct from the chapels, which are enumerated in a separate column and quite apart. Whether in Tiger Bay the Church of England with its two mission rooms is getting hold of the low class of people better than the Nonconformists I do not know, and I do not very much care. When we come ultimately to seriously discuss this question of the Established Church in Wales we are not going to be side-tracked into the question of any single parish in a particular city. Whatever noble Lords who have no sympathy with Mr. McKenna or with the policy- which the Government advocate may say on the matter, I submit that, barring the little slip to which I have referred, the substance of what Mr. McKenna said is confirmed by the facts in the Blue-book. Because he inadvertently spoke for a moment of churches when he meant to speak of mission halls, you must not put upon him an allegation which he never made.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00578"><member>VISCOUNT HALIFAX</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just sat down has exhibited remarkable courage in the few words which he has addressed to the House. He says it is unfair to judge Mr. McKenna except upon the broad contents and meaning of his speech. It is precisely on account of the broad effect of his speech that we blame Mr. McKenna. Any one who is conversant with the facts knows that the statements of Mr. McKenna are not true. No one who has read the debate in the other House can doubt that the object of Mr. McKenna was, by the statement he made, to make it appear, at all events in this particular instance, that the work of the Church of England was less than that of one of the Nonconformist bodies. I have no sort of desire to belittle the Nonconformist bodies, but on an important question of this sort, which involves the gravest issues, we have a right to expect that a Cabinet Minister when he makes a statement of that sort should make a true statement; and when we have proved to him that he has done nothing of the sort, and that he has made a mistake, and a mistake in regard to an important matter touching very grave issues, his primary and first duty is to acknowledge it. That is what Mr. McKenna has not done, and that is what everyone who knows anything about this matter blames him for and blames him severely.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00579"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to point out the somewhat unsatisfactory position in which the House is placed in dealing with this subject. Very short notice was given of this debate. The right rev. Prelate only put down the Motion yesterday, and as Mr. McKenna, whose conduct is in question, is away on public business it has been impossible to communicate with him. The right rev. Prelate may be quite right in wishing to bring this matter as quickly as possible before public attention, but he must also accept the disadvantage of the position that he is condemning a man who is not here to answer for himself and who has had no opportunity of saying what defence he would desire to make against the imputations that are brought against him. I think it would have been much more satisfactory to hear what the person accused had to say for himself than to bring this Motion forward to-day on the supposed ground of urgency. I have had considerable experience in these matters,
<col>210</col>
and I have learned enough not to come to a conclusion until I have heard the other side. For all I know there may be a great deal to be said for the other side. We have not had an opportunity of hearing what Mr. McKenna has to say for himself. In the peculiar circumstances t think it would have been better if the discussion could have been adjourned for a few days until we were in possession of the views of the chief person whose character is impugned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00580"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF ST. ASAPH</member><membercontribution>: I shall be delighted to move the adjourn-meat of the debate if the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack wishes it. May I say that every statement I made to-day in your Lordships' House I made in <i>The Times</i> as far back as May 23. It is the 25th of June to-day, and I should have thought that Mr. McKenna would have had plenty of Opportunity in the meantime to prepare an answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00581"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I hope the Government will take note of what the right rev. Prelate has said. The noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack has great duties to perform which occupy the whole of his time, and he has not had an opportunity of watching what has really passed in this matter. These allegations have not been made now for the first time. These figures have been quoted against the right hon. gentleman over and over again. The Lord Chancellor urged that his right hon. friend might have a great deal to say in reply to these charges. If so, he has shown a wonderful amount of coyness, to put it no stronger than that, in coining to the point. He has been given an opportunity, not merely in <i>The Times</i> but in the House of Commons. He seemed to be very reluctant to get up in the House of Commons to reply. A private Member was allowed to intervene between the right hon. gentleman in defence of his own credit before the country, and then there were only a few minutes left under the operation of the Standing Orders of the House of Commons in which the Home Secretary could defend his credit and reputation; and so reluctant was he to answer the question that he, a Minister of the Crown defending his own words, was actually reproved by the Speaker for having been reluctant to rise. I am sure the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack did not know all this. He did
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0110"/>
<col>211</col>
not know that his colleague had been exposed to a mortification such as hardly any living Minister has had to undergo. All that the right rev. Prelate and his friends, having failed to get any reply from the Home Secretary, could do was to raise the matter in your Lordships' House in the most formal manner. The Home Secretary has ample opportunity of replying to his critics. He can do it upon any day he likes. Why should he not do it? I should like to say to the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack that when a Minister makes a statement which he cannot substantiate and will not withdraw it, the discredit does not fall only upon him; it falls, of course in a minor degree but to a certain extent, also upon his colleagues in the Government. I cannot think, after what has been said in
<col>212</col>
your Lordships' House and the line which the noble and learned Viscount has most properly taken, that the Home Secretary will fail to take an opportunity of giving a full answer to the statements which have been made. If he has been led into inaccuracies he will have abundant opportunity of saying so, and that will be the end of this matter. But if not, I think hardly any Minister within my recollection has been placed in such an invidious position as he will be placed in, and I think some of the discredit does fall upon the noble and learned Viscount and his other colleagues.</membercontribution></p>

<title>NATIONAL INSURANCE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00590"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member> rose to call attention to the National Health Leaflet now being circulated through the Post Office by the National Insurance Committee, and to ask the following Questions&#x2014;
<col>214</col>
<ol>
<li>1. Whether they will issue without delay a simple and clear leaflet as to what it is necessary for contributors to do in regard to cards and stamps to comply with the Act without becoming either a member of an approved society or a Post Office depositor on the 15th of July next.</li>
<li>2. When the Insurance Commissioners intend to take the applications of the smaller rural societies into consideration, and whether the Government are aware that some of the approved societies are now canvassing the agricultural districts to obtain members before the 15th of July in accordance with the official leaflets, whilst the smaller societies are still without any reply to their applications.</li>
<li>3. When the Government will be in a position to guarantee the medical and sanatoria benefits promised in the leaflet alluded to.</li>
<li>4. Whether the Government have received the opinion of the Law Officers as to the legality of an employer deducting the cost of the workmen's or domestic servants' stamps against the wish of those employed by him.</li></ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00591">The noble Lord said: My Lords, my Notice was down on the Paper for last Monday, but I received a telephonic message from the noble Marquess the Leader of the house at one o'clock in the afternoon asking me to postpone it to suit the convenience of the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack, and, of course, I did so. I have put it down for to-day by arrangement with the Government, and I regret to know that Lord Crewe will not be present on this occasion because I shall have to allude to some part of his speech a fortnight ago. In that debate the noble Marquess declined to postpone the operation of the National Insurance Act. He said he preferred the principle of <i>solvitur ambulando;</i> and both he and the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack protested in the strongest way against the misapprehensions as to the work to be done before July 15. There was to be no "hustling" or "hurry"; time was to be given for new societies, and both noble Lords expressed the greatest sympathy for the small rural societies, particularly in reply to the speech of my noble friend Lord St. Audries. No contributor need become a member of any approved society
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0112"/>
<col>215</col>
or a Post Office depositor before next October; let them "wait and see."</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00592">I do not like in his absence to give my impression of what was said by the noble Marquess the Leader of the House in my own words, and therefore I hope the House will allow me to read from the OFFICIAL REPORT the exact words which he used. The noble Marquess said&#x2014;
<quote>"I should like to say that I fully agree with the noble Lord who spoke last as to the importance of some of these small rural societies, many of them of long standing, and I entirely appreciate that they are regarded with a peculiar and intimate sort of affection by those who belong to them, who would dislike and resent, if such a thing were possible, being forced into one of the large and to them somewhat bleak sort of societies in place of the smaller body with which they are familiar."</quote>
The noble Marquess made some other remarks with regard to the small societies. He then went on to the question which is of most importance to-day&#x2014;namely, the operation of the Act. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Noble Lords have spoken freely of the Act coming into operation on July 15 as though at that time, on that date, everybody had to be a member of an approved society or become a deposit contributor."</quote>
I hope noble Lords will weigh those words and remember them as I proceed. The noble Marquess went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"It is desirable to make it markedly clear, although I know it has been admitted by one noble Lord that such is not the case, but that a further three months will exist after July 15 during which that choice can be made. Everybody has a free choice until October as to whether he will join an approved society, and, if so, what, or whether he will become a deposit contributor."</quote>
Perhaps as I am quoting from this debate I may be allowed to quote from some words which were used to enforce these remarks by the Lord Chancellor. The noble and learned Viscount said&#x2014;
<quote>"It is asked how is the servant to find his society; it might not be ready by July 15. That may be so. There is an immense deal to be done, but it need not all be done by July 15. For three months after that there is nothing necessary except to put the stamps on the card and so secure payment of the contributions. By that time a great many more societies will have been approved than have been approved up to the present."</quote>
Why was not that put into the leaflet which has been scattered broadcast through every household in Great Britain? The noble and learned Viscount went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"We feel that these small societies form part of the life of the country, and therefore it is desirable that plenty of opportunity should he given them in
<col>216</col>
order to enable them to get upon their feet. As I have said, no one will need to join a society for three months, and at the end of three months he need not join a society but can become a deposit contributor, and if he does not wish to remain a deposit contributor he can withdraw his account and transfer himself to a society. So that really the 15th of July, about which date a great many unnecessary alarms have been conjured up&#x2014;</quote>
not half as many as have been conjured up by the leaflet to which I am about to allude&#x2014;
<quote>"means nothing except that persons will have to put stamps on the cards."</quote>
I have quoted this from the noble and learned Viscount's remarks in order that there may be no mistake about what he said. I shall have a few further comments to make upon those remarks later.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00593">Now I come to this misleading and mendacious leaflet. The leaflet commences by saying&#x2014;
<quote>"Every person in the service of an employer <i>must be insured</i> if between the ages of 16 and 70 and must get a contribution card before July 15, either from the approved society of which he or she is a member or from any Post Office."</quote>
That is the truth, but it is not the whole truth; it is a very dangerous half-truth. Then the leaflet goes on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"The full benefits of insurance can only be obtained by joining an approved society (<i>see</i> page 4)."</quote>
What does page 4 say? We there read that&#x2014;
<quote>"It is of the greatest importance to every employed man or woman that he or she should join an approved society without delay&#x2014;</quote>
that is not <i>solvitur ambulando</i>&#x2014;
<quote>"and so avoid becoming a deposit contributor."</quote>
That is absolutely and entirely untrue. There is no other word for it, because it is perfectly clear, not only from the Act itself but from the statements made by the noble Marquess the Leader of this House and by the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack, that they have until October to choose their society, and that there is not the slightest necessity for their becoming members of an approved society "without delay." Then there is this other little reminder&#x2014;
<quote>"If an insured person does not join a society he will have to become a deposit contributor."</quote>
That, again, is absolutely untrue. He can get his card at a Post Office and retain it for three months and can select any society between now and October 15, and there is
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0113"/>
<col>217</col>
not the slightest necessity for him to become a deposit contributor unless he desires to do so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00594">This leaflet is without date and without signature, and perhaps it is just as well for those who composed it that it is. But they are not satisfied with this leaflet which they have sent round to every householder throughout the country. In order that there may be no mistake about it they have put up a notice in every Post Office, of which I could not get a copy. I went to a Post Office, however, this morning and copied it for myself. This notice states that&#x2014;
<quote>"The full benefits of insurance can only be of tanned by joining an approved society. This should be done at once."</quote>
This is emphasising the leaflet. The leaflet said "without delay" but the notice calling attention to the leaflet says that it should be done "at once." I say that that is a most monstrous notice to have been issued, particularly when we know as a matter of fact that the Insurance Commission is a mere dummy Commission entirely under the control of Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Masterman. None of your Lordships will be surprised to hear that there has been very great consternation in the country. I do not know whether any of your Lordships have had as many letters as I have received with regard to this leaflet. The members of the smaller societies are getting very anxious because they are receiving no reply as to whether or not they will be approved, and some of them think it is far better to dissolve their societies and join some of these other societies. Some of the societies which have been approved have most honestly stated that they are not prepared at the present moment with branches which would be suitable either to domestic servants or to rural labourers but hope to establish them later, and that they are no party to their agents touting for members in the country. But that is not the case with all of the societies. I will take one other&#x2014;the Prudential. Their agents have been into every household in the country&#x2014;certainly that is the case in Lincolnshire&#x2014;hustling people and telling them, with this leaflet in one hand, that they must become members of an approved society without delay, and offering them the address of the Prudential Society. One looks to see where the milk is in the cocoanut when one
<col>218</col>
sees a large society like the Prudential, which is not supposed to have so much extra money to spend, taking a whole broad sheet of <i>The Times</i> simply to put its own name and address upon it, without giving any information at all. I think this shows that there is something to be got out of it, for you do not get a broad sheet of <i>The Times</i> for coppers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00595">This raises another point to my mind. I do not wish to be suspicious, but it is an absolutely notorious fact that up to about May 25 there was not one single large friendly society in England which did not wish to have the operation of the Act put off for seven months in order that they might produce what they thought were the necessary branches for domestic servants, for clerks, for agricultural labourers, and other classes. This was brought up in the debate a fortnight ago, and the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack then told us that these friendly societies were most anxious that the Act should come into operation on July 15. Yes, but why? Because between the time when they had their general meetings at Whitsuntide and the time when the noble and learned Viscount spoke they had become approved societies. They were in clover; they did not want any other societies to step in and take part of the plunder. The domestic servants and the rural labourers will be the most profitable members to these societies. Their contributions will go to pay for the sick benefit for town members, and it is just because we want to prevent domestic servants from being raked in by societies like the Prudential that we protest against this statement in the leaflet and against this touting under cover of the leaflet.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00596">One word with regard to the small societies about which the noble and learned Viscount was so anxious and apprehensive a fortnight ago. Why are they not approved? Many of them asked to be approved long before May 25, long before any of these larger societies were rushed in at twenty-four hours' notice on May 31, yet not one of them has even had a courteous reply to the application. Mr. Runciman, who generally speaks pretty straight and pretty accurately, was down at Lincolnshire last Friday. He expressed his deep regret at the number of small societies which had become dissolved and his hope
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0114"/>
<col>219</col>
that something would be done to preserve them. He did not mention that the way to preserve them was for the members to wait and see whether their small societies were approved or not, but he did state that during the previous twelve months 397 registered small societies had been dissolved and that at least 400 more had applied to the Registrar-General. But what are the Government doing to save them? No applications have been even answered, and, so far as I know, not one of these societies has received approval. I say that this leaflet is misleading. I say that certain parts of it are most mendacious. I ask the Government to see that the people who are being deceived by this leaflet shall not be deceived any more. It is a very easy thing, this particular paragraph having misled a great many people in the country, to send out a short notice stating the facts. I should like them to state that no one need become a member of any of the present approved societies or a Post Office depositor before October 13 next, notwithstanding all the misleading literature; that SO long as contributors obtain the necessary card from the Post Office and have the stamps affixed by each pay-clay after July 15, either weekly, fortnightly, or monthly, they can wait and select at any time before October 15 the society which will give them the benefits most suitable to them. This is, in my opinion, especially necessary in the case of agricultural labourers and domestic servants. I think a short leaflet containing that information might to a large extent rectify the misapprehension which exists in regard to what is required.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00597">Let me say one or two words with regard to the Questions on the Paper. I do not think, after what I have said, that it is necessary for me to give any further evidence in regard to Questions 1 and 2. The third Question refers to the benefits to be provided under the Act&#x2014;principally medical benefits and sanatoria. I alluded to this question a fortnight ago, and I ventured to say then, and I was not contradicted, that the Act of last year was a contract between the Government on the one hand and those who will be contributors on the other, and that whilst they were to contribute weekly towards this fund the Government on the other hand undertook honourably and faithfully to give them the benefits which they contracted to give. On the third page of this famous leaflet
<col>220</col>
contributors are told that among the benefits they are to receive are&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(1) MEDICAL BENEFIT&#x2014;that is, doctor and medicine, or in special circumstances money payments instead.</li>
<li>(2) SANATORIUM BENEFIT&#x2014;that is, treatment in a sanatorium or in some other way in case of consumption.</li></ol>
I repeat what I said a fortnight ago. The Government cannot give these benefits unless they come to an arrangement with the medical profession. They have not come to such an arrangement up to the present time. On the contrary, the medical profession seem to get more irritated every day and are even threatening to give up their honorary posts at hospitals. We ought to be told whether there is any prospect of the Government coming to an arrangement with the medical profession. As to sanatoria, no arrangements have been made for this benefit coming into operation on July 15. The medical benefit, it is true, does not come into operation until January, but sanatorium benefit comes into operation at once. I ask, Where are the sanatoria? What arrangements have been made for sanatorium benefit? How can any arrangements be made for sanatoria unless you have the consent of the medical men? Therefore I think Question 3 on the Paper stands on its own merits.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00598">With regard to the fourth Question, the noble Marquess the Leader of the House told me after the debate a fortnight ago that he was unable to answer the question at that time because it was under the consideration of the Law Officers, but I understand that the Law Officers have now given their opinion, and I should like very much to know what it is. There is only one other point which I should like to make, not so much with regard to what is in the leaflet as to what took place a fortnight ago. We are in this House accustomed to rely upon the accuracy of House of Lords Statesmen on both sides of the House and especially of Ministers of the Crown. It is absolutely impossible, when the whole of the work of the Ministerial Bench has to be done by two or three Cabinet Ministers, that they can possibly have of their own knowledge information with regard to the details of questions which belong to the various Departments for which they have to reply. It is quite clear that neither the noble Marquess the Leader of the House
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0115"/>
<col>221</col>
nor the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack had the slightest notion that at the very moment they were speaking this leaflet was in print and was being sent out to the Post Offices. I do not believe for a moment that they had, because we all know that they would have told us candidly and honestly if they had known this. Therefore I say we have a right to expect, when Ministers in the House of Commons depute their colleagues to answer for them in your Lordships' House on matters of which their colleagues can have no personal knowledge, that at any rate they should give them every information honestly and faithfully and supply them with the whole truth with regard to the facts on which they have to speak and not keep back from them essential facts which are important to the debate, With the exception of the refusal to put off the operation of the Act, the debate in your Lordships' House a fortnight ago was very satisfactory. Courteous and sympathetic language was used by the noble Marquess the Leader of the House and by the Lord Chancellor, and I, for one, desire to thank them for the way in which they treated my Motion on that occasion. But when I come to know that at that time the "other voice," to which the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition referred, was compiling this leaflet which was to be distributed throughout the length and breadth of the land, then I ask what reliance can we put in future on information which is vouchsafed by noble Lords who speak for Departments with which they have nothing to do and which ought to be absolutely accurate and true?</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00599"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that the Questions which the noble Lord has placed on the Paper have been put down with a desire to have the position of the contributor in regard to an approved society made perfectly clear. The noble Lord stated that what was said by the noble Marquess the Leader of the House a fortnight ago differs considerably from the three lines on page 4 of this leaflet, and also differs considerably from the note at the bottom of the Post Office notice to which he alluded. If I may take that point first, I think that as a matter of fact what the noble Marquess the Leader of the House said in the recent debate and what is stated in the leaflet and in the Post Office notice are really very similar in nature. The whole thing hinges on
<col>222</col>
the word "should." The noble Marquess on June 12 said&#x2014;
<quote>"Everybody has a free choice until October as to whether he will join an approved society, and, if so, what, or whether he will become a deposit contributor."</quote>
I do not think there is any great difference between what the noble Marquess then said and the three lines in the leaflet, which run&#x2014;
<quote>"It is of the greatest importance to every employed man or woman that he or she should join an approved society without delay."</quote>
It does not say that he or she "must" join an approved society without delay. If every single person who is going to join an approved society left the actual joining until the last days of the quarter the work would be enormous. First of all, it would inflict great hardship on the actual societies themselves. It would also be very difficult to manage such an enormous lot of applications coming in at one time. These three lines were inserted in the leaflet simply for the purpose of getting people to join as soon as possible, not to lead them to think that they must join at once. The noble Lord shakes his head.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00600"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: The statement on the leaflet is that he or she should join an approved society "without delay"&#x2014;that is, it should be done at once.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00601"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: it does not say that he or she "must" join at once. I will give an analogy which comes within my own experience. In the old Volunteer days there was a certain time by which the musketry had to be clone and everybody invariably left it till the very end, with the result that a great deal of heavy work in connection with the returns fell upon the adjutant at that time. But here, when you are dealing with a totally new subject, it would be extremely difficult if everything were left until the last few days of the quarter and if nothing was done before then as regards employed persons joining one of the approved societies. I do not see, therefore, that the statement on the leaflet and what the noble Marquess the Leader of the House said on June 12 are at all different. It would be another matter if this leaflet said that every employed person "must" join an approved society at once. I have in my hand a copy of the Post Office notice to which the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0116"/>
<col>223</col>
noble Lord referred. The statement thereon is that&#x2014;
<quote>"The full benefits of insurance can only be obtained by joining an approved society. This should be done at once."</quote>
It does not say "must" be done at once. The noble Marquess the Leader of the House was alluding, first, to rural societies which have not yet made their arrangements. He rightly thought that there was no reason for members of rural societies which are not approved by July 15 to leave their societies. They have a special reason for waiting, and no one becomes a deposit contributor before October 14. Hence in special circumstances it would be as well to wait. In the case of members of rural societies, or of other societies which are applying for approval but have not yet been approved, the society should make it clear to its members that they can get their cards from the Post Office and hand them to the society in October, by which time it will be seen whether they are approved or not. Secondly, as regards domestic servants. Domestic servants might wait and see what societies were offering special benefits suited to their particular requirements. In these two cases, where there is special reason for waiting, the noble Marquess advised that there was no need to join within the next few weeks and that it would be best to wait. But where there is no special reason for waiting insured persons should, as advised in the leaflet, join without delay.<lb/>
I will now take the noble Lord's Questions <i>seriatim.</i> In his first Question the noble Lord asks whether the National Insurance Commission will issue without delay a simple and clear leaflet as to what it is necessary for contributors to do in regard to cards and stamps to comply with the Act without becoming either a member of an approved society or a Post Office depositor on July 15 next. The answer is "Yes"; and it is suggested&#x2014;I do not say that these are the actual words which will be used&#x2014;that some such form as this should be put forward: (<i>a</i>) The employee will get his card on or before July 15. If he is a member of one of the approved societies (which are now issuing cards to their members) he will get his card from his society. If he is not, he will get it from any Post Office. (<i>b</i>) A master or mistress can obtain cards for their servants, if they prefer, by sending for them to any Post Office. (<i>c</i>) Employers of labour
<col>224</col>
can obtain cards to give to their employees who have not obtained cards for themselves by applying to the Insurance Commissioners. All these cards (whether (<i>a</i>) they come from an approved society or (<i>b</i>) from the Post Office or (<i>c</i>) from the Insurance Commissioners) are if exactly the same kind; all are valid for a quarter, and, when the stamps are on them, all will equally be taken by any approved society the employee may join. (<i>d</i>) A special kind of card, called an "emergency" card, for one week, can be obtained by employers to stamp in case the ordinary cards are mislaid; but to begin with private employers need not trouble about these, and will probably find it simpler to get the ordinary cards for their servants. (<i>e</i>) When wages are paid on or next after July 15 the employer will see that the cards are stamped. He need not, of course, stamp them himself, any more than he need actually pay the wages himself, but he will be responsible for its being done. In ordinary cases stamps to the value of 7<i>d.</i> (for men) and 6<i>d.</i> (for women) will be put on for each week, 4<i>d.</i> of which (for men) and 3<i>d.</i> (for women) for each week may be deducted from wages. (<i>f</i>) An employer has only to see that a card is properly stamped for the persons he employs and he will have done his duty under the Act. Then whether his servant destroys his card or refuses to join a society, or whatever he does, the employer has fulfilled his duty under the Act and is liable to no penalty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00602"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: Does that mean that once the employer has done this after July 15 he will have no more responsibility for the remainder of his life?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00603"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: I do not follow the noble Earl's question. Then (<i>g</i>) at the end of the quarter, <i>i.e.,</i> by the middle of October, the cards (with their 13 weeks' stamps) will be filled up and members of approved societies will send or take them to those societies. Those who are not members of societies will take them to the Post Office. (<i>h</i>) Those who have not joined societies by the middle of October&#x2014;and whose cards therefore go to the Post Office&#x2014;will be deposit contributors. But there will be no deposit contributors until the middle of October.<lb/>
In his second Question the noble Lord asks when the Insurance Commissioners intend to take the applications of the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0117"/>
<col>225</col>
smaller rural societies into consideration, and whether the Government are aware that some of the approved societies are now canvassing the agricultural districts to obtain members before July 15 in accordance with the official leaflets, whilst the smaller societies are still without any reply to their applications. The Commissioners have taken special care that in the administration of the Act nothing should be done to impair the <i>status</i> or utility of small rural societies or prevent them from applying for approval. It has become evident, however, that in order that they may administer the Act efficiently some form of common action is desirable. The Commissioners have therefore encouraged and in some cases helped to found some form of county associations for the purpose. These associations are of various kinds and include county friendly societies, county State insurance societies, county associations of separately approved societies, and voluntary advisory committees. In every case their object is to provide the full benefits of the Act without impairing the independence or voluntary activities of the village societies. When the Commissioners are satisfied that such organisations are representative of rural interests as a whole they have given and will continue to give them all the assistance in their power, <i>e.g.,</i> by providing literature specially suited to the particular area, by preparing model rules, and by bringing local societies and county organisations into touch with each other. Lecturers and officers of the Commission have attended meetings specially to advise them as to their constitution and procedure, and will be sent, if possible, still more freely in the future. Every possible assistance will also be given to societies in keeping their accounts, and it is hoped that the official auditors and officers of the Commission will be able to give personal advice and assistance to officers of societies who desire it before the real work of account-keeping commences in October, when the cards come into the societies. This is the policy of the Commission. It means that instead of dealing separately with all individual applications from small rural societies they are attempting to reach them more effectively through the medium of these larger associations. Necessarily the arrangements indicated are not yet complete, and actual approvals in the majority of cases therefore are not yet given. This would be a serious disadvantage if it were neces
<col>226</col>
sary for persons affected by such societies to join them by July 15. But they will not become deposit contributors so long as they join by October, and by that time all societies which have now definitely decided to take its share in the administration of the Act should be approved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00604"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: When will the applications of these small societies be taken into consideration?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00605"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord has asked why the applications for approval sent in by these small societies have not been answered. Where it has been possible to answer them direct it has been done, and in other cases they have been answered through the medium of the county associations to which I have alluded.<lb/>
I now come to the noble Lord's third Question, in which he asks when the Government will be in a position to guarantee the medical and sanatoria benefits promised in the leaflet alluded to. The Government can at once give an absolute assurance of what is promised in the National Health Leaflet&#x2014;"doctor and medicine, or in special circumstances money payment instead." Negotiations are at present proceeding with representatives of the medical profession. They are of a friendly character; but it would clearly be inexpedient to risk prejudicing them by any statement while they are still in progress. They are not likely to be prolonged, and the Government hope that long before January 15, when medical benefit begins under the Act, they will have been successfully concluded. If, however, it should prove impossible to make arrangements, insured persons would in that case receive an equivalent payment in money. If that be 6<i>s.</i> a year, which was the calculation upon which the scheme of the Act was based, it will mean that each insured person for medical treatment per year will receive&#x2014;in the case of a man, 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> from his own contributions, 2<i>s.</i> from his employer, and 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> from the State; making a total of 6<i>s.</i></membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00612"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: What is the exact meaning of the cryptic and disquieting phrase which the noble Earl used that the Insurance Commissioners are "trying to reach the rural societies through the medium of the larger societies." Does that mean that the larger societies are being induced to swallow up the smaller societies? If it does not mean that, I fail to see what it does mean.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00613"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Lord will put that down as a separate Question I will do my best to answer it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00614"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: I was quoting the noble Earl's own words. He can surely explain them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00615"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: Lord Heneage asked how we were dealing with the smaller rural societies which had not been approved, and I said that the policy of the Commissioners in that case was to find out whether they were able to become approved societies through the medium of the three different kinds of associations which I mentioned.<lb/>
<col>228</col>
I now come to the question of sanatorium benefit. In this case no waiting period is laid down in the Act, as in the case of medical benefit. Sanatorium benefit comes into operation on July 15. It must be remembered, however, that only employed persons will be insured. A gradually increasing number of these will in time develop tuberculosis, but there is no reason to anticipate a sudden rush of great numbers of insured persons claiming treatment. As will be seen from the Astor Report, "sanatorium benefit" does not mean treatment in sanatoria only. It may include, in addition or as alternatives, treatment through hospitals, through dispensaries, and through other forms of existing agencies, and also treatment in the patients' homes. These alternative methods are directly contemplated in the Act and indicated in the National Health Leaflet; and the Astor Report shows clearly the different sets of cases which require these different sets of treatment. One of the paragraphs in that Report states that&#x2014;
<quote>"The belief that any considerable proportion of consumptives may safely depend on any one factor of the treatment to the exclusion of the others, such, for instance, as satisfactory housing, adequate nutrition, the sanatorium, or tuberculin, is a mistake, and, if acted upon, is likely to diminish the value which may be expected to accrue from each and all of these when used in proper conjunction."</quote>
From the commencement of the Act insured persons will be sent to sanatoria for treatment as far as sanatoria are then available. Some will be sent to hospitals. As soon as the local authorities have instituted tuberculosis dispensaries, a matter which they are actively engaged in, patients will be referred to those institutions. A considerable number will receive treatment in their own homes from private practitioners. It is not, of course, suggested that institutions for treatment will be available on July 15, 1912, to the same extent as by July 15, 1913. It was never expected that institutions could be built in time, but the Act provides the money by which institutions can be developed as rapidly as those responsible can carry out the work. From July 15 onwards a considerable number of insured persons will begin to receive through the assistance of the insurance funds treatment for tuberculosis which would not otherwise have been available for them. Some who could not have afforded any treatment will have treatment provided, and some who could
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0119"/>
<col>229</col>
only have afforded treatment on a very limited scale will be able to obtain with the assistance of the insurance fund treatment of a better kind than they themselves could possibly have provided. The provision for tuberculous persons will begin as far as possible as soon as the Act comes into operation, and will increase with every week.<lb/>
In his fourth Question the noble Lord asks whether the Government have received the opinion of the Law Officers as to the legality of an employer deducting the cost of the workmen's or domestic servants' stamps against the wish of those employed by him. The answer to that is that Section 3 of the Third Schedule of the National Insurance Act authorises the employer to deduct from wages paid by him the workman's part of the contribution payable under Part I of the Act, notwithstanding the provisions of any contract to the contrary. In the opinion of the legal advisers of the Insurance Commission the effect of this section is perfectly clear, and no reference to the Law Officers of the Crown is considered necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00616"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: Does the noble Earl mean to say that the point is not going to be submitted to the Law Officers of the Crown? Lord Crewe told me that the reason for his not answering my question a fortnight ago was that the point was to be submitted to the Law Officers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00617"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: I am assured that the Act is perfectly clear, and that the step that has been taken is all that is necessary. Two additional Questions have been sent to me privately. The first is as to a complaint with regard to the printing of this leaflet. There are a number of copies of the leaflet which have been badly printed, and steps have been taken to prevent any recurrence of that. The second Question was sent to me by a noble Lord from Ireland, who asks what would happen supposing he spent part of the year in Ireland and the other part in London. He wishes to know whether it would be better for his servants to be insured in Ireland or in England, because the contributions are different in the two countries. I have asked the noble Lord to kindly allow me to postpone the answer to that Question until I have made the necessary inquiries.</membercontribution></p>
<col>230</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00618"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I only rise to say a word or two with regard to the statement which has just been made by the noble Earl. Lord Heneage, in bringing this question before the House, pointed out in rather strong terms that this leaflet was calculated to convey a very erroneous impression to the ordinary man in the street with regard to what he ought to do. The noble Marquess who leads the House and the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack the other day pointed out to your Lordships very clearly that there was no reason why this Act should not come into force on July 15, because it was not necessary for an employed person to join an approved society before October 15. That, of course, was a perfectly good argument. But to say that that statement is the same as and corresponds with the statement in this leaflet seems to me a very strange contention.<lb/>
The noble Earl who replied to-day on behalf of His Majesty's Government founded his defence on the difference between the word "should" and the word "must." Unfortunately the ordinary man in the country does not draw such fine distinctions, and when he is told that the full benefits of insurance can only be obtained by joining an approved society and that it is most desirable that he should join an approved society without delay, and when also a Post Office notice is circulated to the effect that he should do this at once, he does not go into distinctions between "should" and "must," and as far as that part of the noble Earl's statement was concerned I confess I do not think it was of very much value. In the first place, Lord Heneage asked when the Insurance Commissioners intend to take the applications of the small rural societies into consideration. That is a most important point, because the Commissioners have taken into consideration the applications of the larger societies and have approved them, thereby giving them an advantage of which they are apparently making full use by advertising and pointing out the benefits that will be derived by joining them as approved societies.<lb/>
The difficulty which the smaller societies are in is this. In the first place, many of them have not received a definite answer to their application, and if they are not going to be approved very shortly
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0120"/>
<col>231</col>
they are distinctly placed in a very inferior position and are likely to lose thereby. I confess I could not understand the words which Lord Liverpool used, and which appeared also to puzzle Lord Ampthill as much as they did me, when he said that the Commissioners were "endeavouring to reach the smaller societies through the larger associations." What does that mean? I have no conception. Are the Commissioners communicating with them? Have they done anything?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00619"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: I explained that the manner in which the Commissioners are attempting to get into touch with the smaller rural societies is through the county associations. These associations are of various kinds, and include county friendly societies, county State insurance societies, county associations of separately approved societies, and the voluntary advisory committees which exist in most counties for the purpose of helping to bring in the small societies as approved societies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00620"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Then it means that, so far as they can, the Commissioners are endeavouring to swallow up these smaller societies through the medium of the larger societies?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00621"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: No.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00622"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Then I am afraid I do not understand what the noble Earl means. What mode there can be of reaching the smaller societies through the larger ones without swallowing them up I am at a loss to understand. With regard to medical benefits, I wonder how many times we have been told that the negotiations which are proceeding with the medical profession are of a friendly kind. I remember hearing the same thing a fortnight ago, and I ventured to point out to your Lordships on that occasion that the friendly manner in which these negotiations had commenced was by the Chancellor of the Exchequer abusing the medical profession in very strong language. I suppose negotiations which commence in that manner may subsequently become comparatively friendly, hut as to the amount of real friendship there is in these negotiations one can only guess. When are these negotiations likely to be concluded? On many occasions in both
<col>232</col>
Houses of Parliament we have been told that the negotiations were nearly concluded. Mr. Masterman said he hoped to make an announcement very shortly, and it was then that he said the negotiations were extremely friendly. A month has since elapsed, but apparently we are no nearer to a settlement. The noble Earl who replied to-day on behalf of His Majesty's Government alluded to the month of January as the time when the medical benefits would come into operation. I suppose from that he meant that he hoped that by January next some arrangement might have been arrived at with the doctors. We can all imagine what this arrangement, if it ever is arrived at, is likely to be. Certainly the Chancellor of the Exchequer will find that if he is going to make an arrangement he will have to put his hand into his pockets to a depth which he never contemplated when he commenced these negotiations.<lb/>
Now with regard to sanatoria. There are no sanatoria. How could there be? And now, as I understand, the Commissioners are actually making applications to the various county councils, or rather to the provisional committees which they have set up in the various counties, asking them what provision they propose to make. All this merely shows what haste and hurry there has been in bringing this Act into operation, or in pretending to bring it into operation. One excuse that was given by the noble Earl to-day was that there was not likely to be any sudden rush of consumptives. I thought we were told that tuberculosis was so common that we had to stamp it out. Now we are informed that one reason why we need not be alarmed about the absence of sanatoria is that there will not be any rush of consumptives. I must confess I do not understand it. To the general tone of this leaflet I take great exception&#x2014;not to any particular words in it, but to the whole tone. Its whole tone is that of men who are trying to induce the public to fall in with their Act and are not particular as to the terms which they use in offering these inducements. They shave the truth as close as possible. It is the difference between "should" and "must." Any ordinary man reading this leaflet and the other leaflets would certainly be led to believe that it was necessary for him to join some approved society at once.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00623"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: I should like to say, in regard to the remarks of the noble Earl about the swallowing up of the smaller societies, that that is not intended in the least. The Commissioners find it is easier to get in touch with the smaller societies by local means. In the case of Wiltshire they have been in communication with the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, and with Lord Heneage in regard to Lincolnshire. They find it much easier to get information through those agencies.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00628"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SANDERSON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to ask the noble Earl any questions, but perhaps I might be allowed to make one or two small suggestions. In the first place, I feel bound to state that Lord Camperdown was mistaken in saying that there are no sanatoria. There certainly are sanatoria and dispensaries in which considerable numbers of consumptive persons are treated, though they are not Government institutions. But what I wish to say is this. The Government are issuing for the payment of these insurance contributions stamps of the value of 6<i>d.</i> and 7<i>d.,</i> and they are also issuing stamps of the value of 1<i>s.</i> and 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.,</i> the latter for the payment of two weeks' contributions in one stamp. In the leaflets there is no suggestion that you can pay these contributions otherwise than with a separate stamp for each week. What I wish to suggest is that in the new leaflet which is going to be issued something should be said as to our being allowed, if that is intended, to stamp the card every fortnight by a single stamp and there should be a direction where it should be placed. I am not sure that this will not require the issue of a fresh regulation also.<lb/>
On the subject of regulations perhaps I might be allowed to make another suggestion. The National Insurance Commissioners
<col>234</col>
are issuing a considerable number of regulations. They are called draft regulations and vary a good deal inform. They all of them have short titles. Sometimes the short title is put at the end of the regulations, sometimes at the beginning, sometimes it is put in the heading and sometimes not. It is very desirable, I think, that they should all follow one model. But there is another point. These regulations are all, according to the Act, laid before Parliament, and when they are so laid they are no longer called draft regulations but provisional regulations, issued under the seal and signature of the Commission. I do not know whether, when the time has elapsed during which they should lie on the Table of Parliament, the provisional regulations become definitive regulations. But there is this curious fact, that the provisional regulations issued by the Commission do not in several cases bear the same date as the draft regulations which are identical with them. For instance, the regulation upon the subject of the collection and payment of contributions is dated as a draft regulation "May 24," but as laid before Parliament as a provisional regulation it is dated "May 22"; from which it would appear that it was issued before it was drafted. That, of course, is a slip; but I suggest that when the Act comes into operation all these regulations should be gathered together and should as far as possible be numbered and put into order, so that we who are liable to be fined through a contravention of them should be able to refer to them without so much difficulty as we at present experience.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00629"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this conversation suggests, I think, a moral. It shows how eminently reasonable your Lordships were a few days ago when you asked that the operation of the Insurance Act should be postponed for a time in order to give people a fuller opportunity of considering its provisions. We made that suggestion because we were convinced that unless further time were given people would be hustled&#x2014;that was the expression which I think I used and which was used by others&#x2014;into decisions which they might afterwards have much reason to regret; and it is evident from what the House has heard to-night that the danger which we apprehended was not an imaginary danger and that that process of hustling is going on, and going
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0122"/>
<col>235</col>
on very actively, at the present moment. It is going on&#x2014;I am afraid I must say so&#x2014;in spite of the extremely reassuring announcements made to us the other day by the noble Marquess who leads the House. It is to me inconceivable that the noble Marquess should have made that statement to us the other evening if he had been aware of the existence of the leaflet to which my noble friend Lord Heneage has called attention this evening.<lb/>
Let me again remind the House of the noble Narquess's words. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"There would be a further period of three months after July 15 during which a choice could be made. Everybody has a free choice until October as to whether he will join an approved society, and, if so, what, or whether he will become a deposit contributor."</quote>
I think my noble friend is amply justified in saying that this leaflet is not, consistent with the idea of a free choice. But before I say a word about the substance of the leaflet, may I be allowed to say a word about its form? I heard with interest my noble friend Lord Sanderson's suggestion that these documents which are showered upon us in such abundance should each of them have some mark by which they can be identified for purposes of reference. This leaflet is headed "N.H. Leaflet." By an effort of imagination one is able to say that "N.H." possibly stands for national health. I presume that other leaflets on the same subject are likely to appear. I want to know how we are to distinguish this leaflet from other similar documents. When we are dealing with Parliamentary Papers, as the House knows, there is generally a number in the corner which enables us to identify the Paper beyond all dispute. Now these leaflets are abundantly supplied with hieroglyphics of a kind, but they are not hieroglyphics which make it very easy to identify them. I have two separate editions of this leaflet, one received only this morning. One is dated "6&#x2013;12," which I presume means some day during the month of June, and the other "29&#x2013;5," which I presume means the 29th of May. That edition of the leaflet was public property before the noble Marquess the Leader of the House made his speech on the 12th of this month, and that is what makes it so extraordinary that his attention should not have been called to it. There are other interesting hieroglyphics. I find on one of these two leaflets the figure
<col>236</col>
"2,000,000." I presume that refers to the number of copies that have been circulated. The other one is "4m," which by another effort of imagination I should say means that there have been 4,000,000 of that edition. That is a specimen of the way in which these papers are being scattered broadcast over the country.<lb/>
Now I come to the alternative offered by the leaflet. The noble Earl who spoke for the Government just now insisted that there was nothing in the leaflet inconsistent with the idea of a free choice. I would ask the House to consider the actual wording of the document. On the first page the person who contemplates insurance is told that he must get his card before July 15 either from an approved society or from the Post Office, and then on page 4 it is explained to him that&#x2014;
<quote>"It is of the greatest importance to every employed man or woman that he or she should join an approved society without delay, and so avoid becoming a deposit contributor."</quote>
That is to say, you explain to these good people: Here are two courses open to you, but do not be such a fool as to take one of the two courses; the other is the only course which as a reasonable human being you can adopt. If you put a paper of that kind into the hands of a villager it is surely, I will not say depriving him of his free choice, but putting strong pressure upon him to join an approved society and thereby avoid the drawbacks and detriments of becoming a deposit contributor which are explained with great force on the same page of the leaflet. Let us assume that the recipient of this leaflet, influenced by these arguments, makes up his mind that he has to look for an approved society. How many approved societies are there for him to join? Perhaps the noble Earl or the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack will be able to tell us how many thousands of people are represented by the associations and clubs which have already come in. I think I have seen it stated that there are altogether 14,000,000 or 15,000,000 people to be insured, and that the societies which have already come in for approval only represent something like 5,000,000. I am under the impression that these figures are somewhere near the mark.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00631"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: And pray remember this, that among the societies which have come in and have obtained approval you are sure to find a very large proportion of the larger and more powerful associations, for obvious reasons. Their affairs are in good order, their officials are experienced, they have seen what they had to do and have done it; but that is not the case with the smaller local societies for whom Mr. Runciman expressed, and very properly, so much sympathy and tenderness the other day. They are puzzled, and feel it is a very serious thing that His Majesty's Government should come in and put, as I said just now, what really amounts to pressure upon their members to join societies which have already come in and obtained approval. The smaller societies have barely had time to consider the alternatives which have been put before them by the Insurance Commissioners. They received not very long, ago a most elaborate document setting forth the three kinds of arrangements which a local society could choose between if it desired to join a larger society. There was the process described as centralisation, the second process was described as affiliation, and the third process was described as association. I am under the impression that most of these smaller societies and clubs would prefer to come in under the third process, which enables them to retain much the largest measure of independence and individuality, but in order to come in under that third process they have to get approved, and by this leaflet they are being hustled into a decision as to the society which they might or might not join under circumstances which render it extremely difficult for them to arrive at a deliberate judgment on the matter.<lb/>
The noble Earl on the Front Bench opposite referred to what was happening in a part of the country with which I am familiar, where he truly suggested that one of the larger societies was considering the question of allowing the smaller societies to join it. I do not for a moment suggest that there is any impropriety in that course; but when you consider what this process of reaching the rural societies, by which is meant the smaller societies, through the medium of the larger societies means, and that the people who have this leaflet in their hands are virtually told that they must make up their minds
<col>238</col>
at once and go in hot haste to an approved society, I repeat that the amount of freedom of choice is very much restricted indeed. We are, indeed, reminded in all these conversations of a dictum of the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack. He told us the other evening that His Majesty's Government did not encourage the idea of postponing the operation of the Act because it was necessary for us to get into the water in order that we might learn to swim. Well, my Lords, a great many of these societies are getting into the water, and I am afraid their struggles may be of an extremely painful and inconvenient character, and may in many cases have results which they will afterwards have reason to deplore.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00632"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think there can be any doubt as to the usefulness of these conversations, as the noble Marquess has called them, on this Act. A great many points have been brought out; some of them are large and some of them small, but I think all of them have been usefully discussed. Lord Sanderson brought up a number of points which are new to me, points of detail which showed that he had obviously been forecasting the future with great care. I can assure the House that note will be taken of these points and that they will be attended to. I agree with the noble Marquess that it would be well that these leaflets should have a distinctive mark, and that the leaflet which we have been discussing is defective in that respect. I suppose it was imagined that this leaflet would be of general application and would not be one of a series; but it shall be seen to in the future that there is no ambiguity about the identity of these documents. The House has been reminded that on the last occasion my noble friend the Leader of the House and I declared that it was not necessary to join a society on July 15 or for three months after that date, and it is contended that the leaflet which I hold in my hand is apt to be misleading on that point. All that my noble friend and I wished to do was to clear up an ambiguity which there appeared to be by stating that there was no legal necessity, and that no penalty would accrue for not joining a society on July 15.<lb/>
I agree that the words of the pamphlet which have been quoted&#x2014;namely, that "It is of the greatest importance to every
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0124"/>
<col>239</col>
employed man or woman that he or she should join an approved society without delay and so avoid becoming a deposit contributor," and that "If the insured person does not join a society he will have to become a deposit contributor"&#x2014;might tend to induce a person who was not a member of a society to look round to see whether there was a society he could join under the apprehension that he would suffer if he did not join a society. I am not sure that that is not a good thing because he will soon discover that there is no legal penalty, and he will also find that it is to his advantage that he should join a society as soon as possible. I will tell your Lordships why. Under the scheme of the Act any person who is within the limits of age can join a society on the same terms as a young person. The reserves which the finance of the Act contemplates make good to the society taking the older life the additional risks which arise from his being older. But there is always this which remains, that anybody who falls ill before joining a society or anybody who is not in such physical health that the society would think it advantageous to have him as a member on the ordinary terms runs the risk of being rejected. The longer a man delays, particularly if he is not young, the more risk he runs of finding himself outside the society and being a deposit contributor. It is obviously, therefore, good advice to give to a man that he should join a society as soon as possible, because if illness overtakes him beforehand he may be thrown back into the category of a deposit contributor.<lb/>
Then it is said that this will be prejudicial to members of a small country society which has not been recognised as an approved society because it tempts them to leave their small society and join a larger one. But there is no necessity for them to do so. The best course for those men is not to leave their societies but to continue with them until they become approved societies. They will all realise that presently. The process of recognition is going on at the present moment with such rapidity that I hope there will not be very many of these small societies left out after a few weeks from the arrival of July 15. But one can never, of course, be sure, because one never knows how backward they are in taking the necessary steps. Over 300 societies have been approved altogether. A large number of
<col>240</col>
these small societies are coming in daily, and progress of a steady kind is being made for their recognition. Efforts are being made to get the small societies to come together, not for the purpose of federating them in such a way as to extinguish their individuality, but for the purpose of bringing them into the pool under some larger organisation for the purpose of the realisation of their assets. That was what the Commissioners had in their mind when they used the phrase about approaching the smaller societies through the medium of the larger associations.<lb/>
We have been told that it would have been better had there been a further postponement of the Act beyond the date which has been so much in everybody's mind and which seems to be fraught with a good many terrors, but I cannot think so in view of the facts to which attention has been called. July 15 is probably a less inconvenient date than many others. I can conceive, for instance, that August 12 might be a most inconvenient date, and I can also conceive that September I might be a very tiresome date. People would have gone away for other purposes. It seems to me that July 15, when everybody will be attending to their daily avocations, will be the most convenient date. After all, what is it that July 15 brings with it? Merely the obligation to stamp the cards, and when the stamping of the cards has been done then there will be this latitude of time for the servant to select the society which he desires to join.<lb/>
I am sure that we have not in this debate exhausted all, or nearly all, the minor points of difficulty that are likely to arise under this Act. In my humble opinion the difficulties will be colossal. We are about to go through this experience for the first time in our lives, but I believe that the scheme will be of great benefit to the population of this country. After all, foreign countries have faced what we are about to face, and as a result they tell us that the last thing they would desire to do would be to go back upon the system with which they have become familiar. We all must go into the water and learn to swim&#x2014;I do not think we are in much danger of being drowned&#x2014;and having learnt to swim I hope that we shall make such progress with the system that it will become second nature to us and we shall wonder how we ever got on without it.</membercontribution></p>

The noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack spoke of persons who had fallen into the mistake indicated as persons who were not to be taken much into account. I do not agree with my noble and learned friend. I have read this leaflet, and regard the first paragraph as open to all the constructions put upon it by Lord Heneage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00634"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I did not describe persons who had been misled by the leaflet as of little account. I said that I was not sure that it was not a good thing that these persons should be induced to immediately look round for a society which they could join. As soon as they went to inquire they would, of course, find that they were under no legal liability to join an approved society at once.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00635"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: Nothing could be clearer than the wording of this leaflet. The employed person is told repeatedly that he should join "at once," and at the close there is the statement that the penalty for an offence against the regulations is &#x00A3;10. But I will not further criticise the leaflet if we are to understand that the answer to Lord Heneage's first Question is in the affirmative, and that a simple and clear leaflet will be issued free from the criticisms which have been made.<lb/>
I desire to put to His Majesty's Government the Questions standing in my name on the Paper&#x2014;namely,
<quote>"To ask His Majesty's Government, in reference to the National Health Leaflet issued by the insurance Commissioners, whether they have obtained the opinion of the Law Officers as to the use of emergency cards. In the event of the employees refusing to take the emergency card from the employer, what is to be its fate? If the employee will not get a contribution card from an approved society or from any Post Office, or an emergency card from his employer, what is to be done? May any Post Office be used for the purposes of the Act?"</quote>
We all know, from the Press and public criticism, that there are thousands of domestic servants and employees throughout the country who have signified their intention of neither joining approved societies nor going to the Post Office for a card. What, then, is the position? The only position is to fall back on what the Lord Chancellor has referred to as
<col>242</col>
emergency cards. The noble and learned Viscount said that these cards were to meet a temporary oversight. That is what we would expect an emergency card would be for. But I am putting a question, not as to an actual slip or occasional omission, but a sustained and definite determination on the part of employees to refuse to get a contribution card from an approved society or from any Post Office or to take an emergency card from the employer. What then becomes of the emergency card procedure? This procedure requires the employer to go to the Post Office and get each week a separate card which has only room upon it for one stamp. The previous machinery provided that the whole of the obligation of the employer was to make a payment and affix stamps. I am not questioning that. But here for the first time comes in the obligation on the employer, in addition to making the payments and putting on the stamps, to get an emergency card himself. I ask&#x2014;and it is not an unreasonable request&#x2014;whether the legality of that new obligation cast upon the employer has been considered by the Law Officers. I understand that the suggestion is that the employer is to get this emergency card&#x2014;he may have to get it week after week and month after month for many a long day. And after he has obtained the emergency card and stamped it he has to go to the domestic servant who has refused up to then to get a card and hand him or her the emergency card. Supposing the domestic servant says, "I don't want your card. I don't believe in the Act. I am not going to mix myself up in the matter at all." What is the position then? Is there any further obligation upon anybody? The employer has performed to the last the obligations upon him. He has obtained the emergency card at the Post Office and stamped it, and has searched out the negligent employee who had refused to get a card. Is there any further suggestion as to what the employer is to do? If the card never finds its way to the Post Office what will be the position? I do not see any reference to this in all these leaflets, though I have read them with interest; they vary so much that one's interest grows in them. The noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack said the difficulties were colossal. I cannot better that word. The difficulties are growing, and it would take a first-class prophet to indicate how many difficulties are likely to occur between this day and July 15.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00636"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: I wish to ask one practical question, in no hostility to the Act but rather the contrary. I cannot understand from what has been said either by Lord Liverpool or the Lord Chancellor what is the position at the present moment of the small societies. Are they going to be approved or not, and, if so, when? There are a large number of these small sick and slate clubs in Lincolnshire, and when the official lecturer was down there he told them that the best thing to do was to apply to be approved and when they had each been approved individually they could join together for pooling purposes as one society. A large number of these small societies have applied to be approved, but, so far as know, not one single society has received an answer to its application. One society on my own estate with a membership of 300 applied some months ago, but are still without an answer. An endeavour has been made to start in Lincolnshire a society for domestic servants and rural workers which shall give to these two classes the benefits most suitable to them, and I have been asked to be a trustee of that society. I want to know when we are going to be able to begin. It appears from the statements that have been made to-day on behalf of the Government that these small rural societies are not to be approved individually but are to wait until they have been swallowed up by the bigger societies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00637"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL or LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: I tried to make it clear that there is no intention of swallowing up these small societies. The actual applications are coming in day after day from all over the country. When these societies make application to be approved the applications will be considered.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00639"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Lord will put a Question upon that matter on the Paper I will endeavour to give him an answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00640"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the questions which have been asked in connection with this Act, which we all have to co-operate in working and making succeed as far as possible, are not questions
<col>244</col>
for discussion on the floor of the House, but rather for direct representation to the Commissioners. I agree to a great extent with what the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition has said about this leaflet. I think it undoubtedly suggests to ignorant people that they ough6 at once to join some approved society although for some particular classes of people it might be better to wait. At the same time I recognise that, as a matter of administration, it would be, most impolitic to encourage the average contributor to wait. In the case of the average man I think the sooner he joins an approved society the better, and within the limits of fairly letting him know what his rights are I think the more the Commissioners can stimulate activity and move people in this direction the better. In the case of domestic servants it is very important that a society should be formed which should frame benefits specially applicable to them, and they would not act prudently if they rushed in to join any society before they had an opportunity of knowing whether it would give them the best benefits. It is prudent and wise that certain classes of persons should pause and not insure themselves in particular societies at the very earliest moment but should take advantage of the intermediate time which is allowed.<lb/>
There is a group of societies interested in this Act who ought to be allowed time, and that especially applies to the small rural societies. The societies which have already become approved are mainly the great affiliated orders. They are bodies which have secretaries and complete organisations, and they have been looking at the measure for the past six or eight months and commenced their preparations even before the Act became law. But that is not the case with the small village clubs and bodies of that sort, and in connection with them time should be allowed. Some of the people who might naturally have been expected to advise the members of these rural clubs have been more occupied in the controversial aspects of the Act than in the question of how the Act should be got to work. Consequently there has been a little delay in bringing that educated assistance to these clubs which would have helped them to adjust themselves to the new conditions. I entirely sympathise with the point raised by Lord Heneage that the Commissioners ought to hurry
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0127"/>
<col>245</col>
forward and let these societies know as quickly as possible whether they are approved. The Commissioners are, of course, bound to a certain extent. I believe the society or group of societies must number 5,000 members. The small societies must pool together in some form of affiliation before they can get approved. I should be very sorry to see undue pressure put upon these small local societies to become absorbed in the larger societies.<lb/>
This, however, is a matter which could be better discussed at the offices of the Commissioners. Noble Lords would then get the information which would enable them to go down to their neighbourhoods and talk to the people who look to them for advice. At the same time we do not wish to encourage other persons to delay joining an approved society until the last moment. There will not be, I understand, any serious loss to a man if he even dawdles on beyond October 15. I take it that a man may at any time pass from being a deposit contributor and join a society, and if a man of twenty or twenty-five years of age does not join for six months or a year he will not suffer any appreciable loss. There might be some slight loss, but he would not suffer greater loss than might be thought a fair penalty for his delay in joining. In the same way a society can become an approved society at any time. Therefore I think we ought not to exaggerate the dangers and difficulties which will affect the people who are going to be insured even if they do outstrip the limit of time which the Act allows them as initial members. I feel that we ought to try and get as many good sound societies in and on as easy terms as possible. I was, however, surprised to hear Lord Heneage clamour for the recognition of slate clubs. Such clubs are conducted on an unsound and unfinancial basis, and we ought to ignore such improvident institutions.<lb/>
It is one of the valuable provisions of this Act that there is to be effective control by the insured members over the management of the society in which they put their money. But it is impossible that there can be any effective control if a large number of contributors all over the country are induced to join a society through collectors and send their money to the London headquarters. In that case control and management by the members is a
<col>246</col>
perfect farce. Therefore I should be sorry if the Commissioners, in framing the Regulations, make it at all easy for the requirement as to the effective control of the members over the body which administers their funds to be relaxed or to be made merely a theoretical requirement. If we are going to work the Act as much as possible through the friendly societies, as I hope we shall, we ought to make it easy for friendly societies to come in, and they ought to he told that if, in consequence of local difficulties or through not understanding the Act, they are a little late in coming in they will not suffer seriously in consequence of their being late. In this scheme of insurance we are undertaking a most gigantic business. We are trying to do in one year what took the Germans five or six years to lick into shape. But as we are entering into this scheme I hope we shall all do our best to make it a success.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00641"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to answer the Questions put to me by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ashbourne. In the first part of his Question he asks whether the opinion of the Law Officers has been obtained as to the use of emergency cards. I am assured that there can be no doubt whatever as to the legality of emergency cards. The Insurance Commissioners are given full power under Section 7 of the Act to make Regulations providing for any matters incidental to the payment and collection of contributions, and in particular for&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>"(<i>a</i>) payment of contributions whether by means of adhesive or other stamps affixed to or impressed upon books or cards or otherwise, and regulating the manner, times, and conditions in, at, and under which such stamps are affixed or impressed, or payments are otherwise to be made;</li>
<li>"(<i>b</i>) the entry in or upon books or cards of particulars of contributions paid and benefits distributed in the case of the insured persons to whom such books or cards belong;</li>
<li>"(<i>c</i>) the issue, sale, custody, production, and delivery up of books or cards and the replacement of books or cards which have been lost, destroyed, or defaced."</li></ol>
Under the powers given by this Section the Insurance Commissioners have made Regulations, dated May 22, which provide for ordinary contribution cards and emergency cards.<lb/>
In his second Question the noble and learned Lord asks what, in the event of the

employees refusing to take the emergency card from the employer, is to be its fate; and also, if the employee will not get a contribution card from an approved society or from any Post Office or an emergency card from his employer, what is to be done. Emergency cards, of course, would only be used in rare cases&#x2014;in the case of loss, for instance.</membercontribution></p>

<title>DOGS IN THE OUTER HEBRIDES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00669"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to call attention to the manner in which the Dogs Acts are administered in the Outer Hebrides with reference to the granting of certificates of exemption from licence duty. I have ventured more than once to call your Lordships' attention to matters connected with the state of things in the Hebrides, and if some of your Lordships think that the matter to which I am now directing your attention is one of not much importance, I can assure you that to those persons who own or occupy land and who own cattle the manner in which these Acts are administered is of very great importance indeed. It is also of special importance to the Government, because the Government have as one of their favourite schemes the division of farms in these islands into small holdings, in connection with each of which there is a large common outrun, and it will be quite evident that if there is an undue number of dogs wandering about it is on these holdings and in connection with the stock on these holdings that the damage and destruction are most likely to fall.<lb/>
In the first place, will your Lordships allow me to tell you, very briefly, what the law with regard to the exemption of dogs from licence duty is? It was established by the Act of 1878, and under Section 22 of that Act farmers and shepherds or persons following the occupation of shepherd were allowed to have exemption for a dog provided that it was kept and used solely for tending sheep and cattle. That was an Excise Act. A form of certificate was to be prepared by the Excise; the Excise authorities were entrusted with the administration of the law and seeing that it was carried into effect. Perhaps I may say, further, that the principle of the Act was this, that the number of dogs which were allowed to be kept free from duty bore a relation to the number of sheep or cattle that there were upon the holding. In the year 1906 there was this modification introduced into the Act, that in England before a dog could be exempted from duty the previous consent of a petty-sessional Court must have been obtained, and in Scotland the previous consent of a sheriff. Your Lordships will see that the duty of the Board of Customs and Excise to carry out the Act and to see that it was properly attended to was in no way interfered with.<lb/>
<col>252</col>
How have these Acts been administered in England, in Scotland, and in the Hebrides? Those of your Lordships who are magistrates know quite well that at almost every meeting of the Bench there is brought up a list of claims for dog exemption which have been previously examined by the police. The Bench ask the superintendent of police whether he has satisfied himself that they are all <i>bona fide</i> and genuine applications, and any to which he may happen to take exception are at once refused, leaving it to the person who claims the exemption, if he chooses, to come to the Bench and renew his claim. In Scotland the course is, generally speaking, the same. The list of applications is given to the sheriff clerk, and he sends the list to the police and also to the Excise authorities. I believe that in most cases in the counties on the mainland the police, at all events&#x2014;I do not know so much about the Excise authorities&#x2014;inquire into this matter and see that the conditions of the law are strictly observed.<lb/>
Now we come to the Hebrides. How have these Acts been administered in the Hebrides? From the commencement of the Act, from the year 1878, so far as I have been able to ascertain, the Excise have never moved hand or foot in the matter. They have never given the slightest attention to it. They have never raised an objection, and they appear to have regarded this matter as one in which it was' better not to interfere. What about the police? They likewise have not interfered up to the present time. It is quite true that the present Chief Constable of Inverness-shire last year instructed his constables to inquire into all these matters, but in the present year they have taken no action, giving as their reason that they understood that some private landowners had taken the matter up. I do not think it is a good excuse for a public authority not doing their duty to say they understand that other people are doing it. What has been the result? For years every single application has been granted because there has been no opposition. The Acts which govern this matter state that the application itself is to be regarded as <i>prima facie</i> evidence in favour of the application provided there is no opposition. There has been no opposition, and therefore these applications have been granted in scores and hundreds.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0131"/>
<col>253</col>
That brings me to the present year. In the present year a different course was taken. The Act states that any person may offer opposition to an application for exemption from duty, and certain private persons, notably among them the Congested Districts Board&#x2014;for it had not at that time been merged into the Board of Agriculture for Scotland&#x2014;have taken action. The Board was advised by its own officers to undertake to oppose some of these applications. They were not the first to move. I believe a private gentleman in the person of Sir Arthur Orde initiated the matter. Following him the Congested Districts Board took it up and invited several private proprietors to intervene. With all due respect to these private proprietors I venture to think that they showed considerable simplicity, and I am especially surprised at the conduct of the Congested Districts Board in the matter. I should have thought that a Public Department might have known that the proper way to proceed was by calling on the Excise and the police to do their duty, and I should have thought further that they might at all events have had sufficient worldly wisdom to have known that when private persons undertake to enforce a public Act, however public-spirited their motives may be, they are always attacked and regarded as having some private object of their own in view. However, these bodies objected, and they took some hundreds of objections&#x2014;1,400 or 1,500 in all.<lb/>
The matter then came before the sheriff, who issued a somewhat remarkable decision. It is this, in substance&#x2014;that every person who owned more than one sheep or more than one cattle beast was entitled to keep a dog without the payment of licence duty; and, further, that it was not to matter whether he bad any land or not upon which to keep these cattle or whether he paid rent or not to anybody. That surely is a somewhat extraordinary decision at first sight. But the sheriff did not stop there. He proceeded to give costs against all the objectors. I have never heard of costs being given in such a matter in England, but the sheriff in Scotland is empowered to give costs in cases where he thinks it reasonable to do so. What his reasons were in this case we do not know, but what we do know is that he decreed costs in no fewer than 1,354 cases, and when the agent for the applicants presented his bill he had drawn up an account which
<col>254</col>
amounted to&#x00A3;5 10<i>s.</i> in each ease, the total bill coming to between&#x00A3;7,000 and&#x00A3;8,000. What makes the thing more absurd is that the sheriff clerk, who is an official of the Court and also auditor of the accounts, had inserted a little bill of his own amounting to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in each case, and which came to&#x00A3;170. There are limits to everything in this world, even to the patience of the Scottish Board of Agriculture, and the Board and all the private owners naturally kicked and refused to pay, and they were quite right. Therefore this matter is hung up at present. I do not know that we are likely to hear of any very early decision&#x2014;probably we shall hear of a decision at about the same time as we hear that arrangements have been made with the doctors in this country.<lb/>
It is, therefore, actually the law in the Hebrides that every person who has more than one sheep or inure than one beast is entitled, whether he has land or not, to keep a dog without a licence. It is not the law in Scotland; it is not the law in Inverness-shire, of which the Hebrides form part; but it is the law in the sheriff-substitute district in which the Hebrides are situated. In the county of Inverness there are no fewer than six of these sheriff-substitute districts, and therefore if this ease were to arise in any one of the other districts it might, and very probably would, be decided in quite a different way. This is a case in which there is no appeal whatever from the decision of the sheriff-substitute. His Majesty's Government are always fond of preventing appeals. There is no appeal in this case, and this is actually the law in the Hebrides though not in any other part of Scotland. I am not learned in the law and the sheriff is, and what his reasons may have been I do not know. But this I do know, that the decision is clearly opposed to the spirit of the Act of 1878, which stated that the exemptions were to bear a certain proportion to the stock which was upon the holding in question.<lb/>
I am sure, after what I have said, your Lordships will not be in the least surprised to hear that there has been great lamb-worrying. This decision was given in March, and at the end of May fifty lambs had been worried and destroyed by crofters' dogs. Curiously enough, the place where this occurred was in the island of Harris and the inhabitants of the village there had been among the most strenuous applicants for the exemption of dogs from duty.
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0132"/>
<col>255</col>
I find myself in rather a difficulty because we have no longer in this House any member of the Government who has official experience of or responsibility for what, goes on in Scotland, and I do not know whether what I am saying will ever reach the ears of the Secretary for Scotland. If the Secretary for Scotland had been here, as he was last year, we should have endeavoured to explain it to him in his presence, but now what sort of satisfaction are we likely to get? And pray, my Lords, what are we to do? Because that is the practical question. Is it possible that in these islands this law should be allowed to continue to prevail? I can suggest at once one thing which ought to be done. It is this. The Excise should be called upon to do their duty. Why don't they? They never have done it, but that is no reason why they should not be called upon to do it and why they should not do it. We all know that in these islands it is unpopular to enforce any law, but that is no excuse why the Excise should not do their duty.<lb/>
I am empowered to speak on behalf of my noble friend Lord Lovat, who understands more about Inverness than I do and probably more than any other member of this House. Lord Lovat holds most strongly that there ought to be an inquiry into the conduct of the Excise, and that they ought to be called upon to do their duty. If that cannot be done, and if there are no means of altering this law, then I think the Government ought to take the matter up and bring in a Bill which will put matters in a more satisfactory state. I think I have said enough to show your Lordships that at the present time these laws which govern the exemption of dogs from duty are being administered in the Hebrides in a way which is the very reverse of satisfactory.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00670"><member>LORD WILLINGDON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who has just spoken is quite correct in one of the observations lie made&#x2014;namely, that I have not any very intimate knowledge with regard to Scotland&#x2014;but I hope I shall be able to show him that neither the Scottish Office nor the officials who have to deal with this particular matter are to blame, but rather the parties concerned. The noble Earl has given your Lordships a pretty full account of the law as it exists at this moment. Originally, as he has suggested, under Section 22 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1878, the Commissioners of Inland Revenue were
<col>256</col>
responsible for the giving of these exemptions in respect of people who owned dogs for stock purposes. Under Section 5 of the 1906 Act this responsibility was delegated to the sheriff, under the supreme control of the Excise authorities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00671"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00672"><member>LORD WILLINGDON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl's Motion has arisen out of the various claims for exemption to which he has referred, and although in the main he was perfectly accurate in his statement there are one or two points to which I should like to claim exception. It is quite true that the Congested Districts Board and various owners, thinking that there were too many dogs in this particular part of the Outer Hebrides, decided to oppose applications for exemption. There were 1,750 applications in all; of these 1,596 were opposed, and the sheriff, after hearing both parties, decided to uphold the objections in 142 cases and to repel them in 1,454. It is perfectly true, as the noble Earl said, that the agent for these various applicants claimed a very large sum for expenses and compensation. The noble Earl expressed some surprise as to how he could do this and asked under what law it was done.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00673"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I can assure the noble Lord I did not mean to do that. The sheriff, I know, has power to give expenses where he thinks it reasonable to do so. I did not question that. What I said was that I should very much like to know his reasons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00674"><member>LORD WILLINGDON</member><membercontribution>: I beg the noble Earl's pardon. It is the fact that the sheriff can give expenses when he considers it reasonable to do so. In this case it is perfectly true that a very large sum has been claimed; but the whole matter is now under negotiation, and I think it would be obviously very unwise for me to say anything further with regard to the negotiations while they are pending. But if the noble Earl thinks there has been much delay in the matter there is an obvious remedy. One or other of the parties concerned can object to going on with the negotiations and can refer the whole matter to the auditor of accounts, who will refer to the sheriff and deal with the question of compensation at once. The noble Earl has rather suggested, I think, that the Excise officers and the police do not do their duty with regard to this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0133"/>
<col>257</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00675"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Certainly the Excise do not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00676"><member>LORD WILLINGDON</member><membercontribution>: Under the Dogs Act of 1906 there is no liability upon the police to deal with this question at all; but the fact that over 1,700 applications were made for exemption by the individuals concerned rather goes to show that either the police or the Excise, or both, must have done a good deal in the way of seeing that licences were produced and getting these individuals to claim exemption. There is only one other matter to which I think I need refer, and that is the question of the policy of the sheriff in deciding that an individual can have ogle dog free from licence duty if he is the owner of one sheep or one bullock.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00677"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: To put it correctly, the decision was that he must own more than one sheep or more than one bullock.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00678"><member>LORD WILLINGDON</member><membercontribution>: That is so. In this case the sheriff has followed absolutely the Customs and Inland Revenue Act of 1878 and the practice of the Commissioners at that time. He has taken up their line of action in this particular district and has followed on their lines. Therefore I hardly think that much need be said with regard to that matter. As regards the general question, the noble Earl has suggested that the law should be altered. I am bound to say I should have thought that he would realise as much as anybody else that it would be difficult in the present session at all events to deal with this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00679"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I quite agree with the noble Lord's last remark. It would be very difficult in the present session to go into this extremely interesting question of the exemption of dogs from licence duty. At the same time, I do not see that the noble Lord has attempted in any way to justify the state of things which at present exists. There is a great deal which the Scottish Office can very well look after in the Hebrides. A great deal is going on in those islands to which I may have to call your Lordships' attention on a future occasion. The state of social life there at the present time is a perfect disgrace to civilisation in a variety of ways. I do not to-day move my Motion for Papers.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CABINET REPRESENTATION IN THE<lb/> HOUSE OF LORDS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00680"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member> rose to call attention to the manner in which the great Public Departments are officially represented in this House; and to move to resolve&#x2014;
<quote>"That this House condemns any departure from the well established usage under which the more important of those Departments have in past years been represented in this House either by the Secretary of State for the Department or by one of his Under-Secretaries."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00681">The noble Marquess said: My Lords, the matter which I desire to bring before your Lordships this evening is one which has attracted a good deal of attention out of doors, and has, I know, given rise to feelings of very considerable dissatisfaction in your Lordships' House. I wish to mention the manner in which the different Government Departments are represented in this House, and I am going to suggest that that representation is at the present time inadequate, that it has never been so inadequate as it is at the present moment, that it is inconsistent with the proper conduct of Parliamentary business, and that it is conceived in a spirit wanting in respect for your Lordships' Home. I am not going to discuss the legal aspects of these Ministerial appointments. I prefer to rest my case, not upon technical grounds, but upon grounds of broad commonsense and Parliamentary usage. So far as strict legality is concerned, I believe I am right in saying that there are in force Acts of Parliament from which it may be reasonably inferred that this House is not strictly entitled to more than one Secretary of State and more than one Under-Secretary. But I will acid this. If the noble Marquess, who will no doubt follow me, intends to base himself upon legal considerations, I will ask him whether he can tell us how it has come to pass that, whereas under the Acts of Parliament to which I have referred the House of Commons is entitled to only four Under-Secretaries, there are at this moment in the House of Commons not only four Under-Secretaries of State but four Parliamentary Under-Secretaries, who, so far as I am aware, are absolutely undistinguishable from the Under-Secretaries of State. A good illustration is the case of Lord Lucas, who a very short time ago was an Under-Secretary of State and who is now no longer an Under-Secretary of State, but, strictly speaking, a Parliamentary
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0134"/>
<col>259</col>
Under-Secretary. I dare say the noble Marquess will make a note of that point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00682">But, as I said just now, I have no intention of resting my case upon legal considerations. I wish to say a word rather about the unwritten conventions, the time-honoured usage which has governed the conduct of successive Governments in dealing with this question of Ministerial appointments. That usage was, in my belief, inspired by the conviction that the representatives of the Government of the day ought to be reasonably divided between the two Houses of Parliament. And when I say reasonably divided I do not for a moment suggest that they should be equally divided, because there are reasons, which must be obvious to all of us, why the House of Commons is at certain points entitled to the lion's share of these appointments. There are, for example, appointments connected with financial administration which are the peculiar property of the other House. Then there is apparently a well-established usage under which both the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary of the Home Office sit in the House of Commons. I do not know how that usage has been established, but I admit that it exists. But, my Lords, the bedrock of this question is that we live under a double-Chamber system, and that legislation has to be justified in each House of Parliament; that opportunities for discussion and criticism have to be brought within the reach of each House of Parliament, and that therefore there should in each House of Parliament be representatives of the different Departments familiar with the business of those Departments, concerned in the preparation of the measures which those Departments produce, having had throughout constant access to the papers and documents upon which such legislation is based, and therefore in all respects competent to discuss and to defend the policy of the Government of the day.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00683">Until quite lately these principles certainly prevailed in the case of the five great Departments which I proceed to enumerate&#x2014;the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, the India Office, the War Office, and the Admiralty. I have not pursued my researches into a very remote past, because what I think concerns us most is the more modern practice, but I
<col>260</col>
have taken a period beginning with the year 1886 and lasting until the present time, and I find that during that period in the case of these five great Departments it has been an almost unbroken practice that there should be either the head or the Under-Secretary of the Department sitting in this House. In order to justify my case I will give your Lordships the facts as I have ascertained them. I take, in the first place, the Foreign Office. Up to the year 1906 the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs sat constantly in this House, and when Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Government was formed the duty of representing the Foreign Office in this House fell to a relative of mine who had had long experience of Foreign Office work as Under-Secretary in the House of Commons and whose knowledge of foreign affairs was probably equalled by very few living statesmen. That takes us up to the year 1908. But in the year 1908 both the representatives of the Foreign Office had seats in the House of Commons. The Department was until a few days ago represented, unless I am mistaken, by Lord Herschell, although I understand that some other arrangement is now in contemplation, but, at any rate, neither the Secretary of State nor the Under-Secretary of State is to sit in this House. In the case of the Colonial Office during the same period, except under the Governments of 1895 and 1902, we have had the Secretary of State sitting in this House, and when he sat in the House of Commons at the time when he was not in this House we had the Under-Secretary of State&#x2014;Lord Selborne was, I think, one of them, and the Duke of Marlborough was another&#x2014;sitting in this House. At this moment we are fortunate in having at any rate the Under-Secretary of State here, and we have therefore, I freely admit, no right to complain of the manner in which the Colonial Office is represented. In the case of the India Office, during the same period that Department has been constantly represented here either by the Secretary of State or by his Under-Secretary. At the present moment it is, as we know, represented by the noble Marquess who leads the House, and I need not say we cannot complain of that arrangement, and my noble friend Lord Curzon may be congratulated that on the occasion of the important discussions which he has lately initiated he has found opposite to him a foeman worthy of his steel.</p>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0135"/>
<col>261</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00684">Now I come to the Admiralty. Again during the period from 1886 up to the present the First Lord has usually, but not always, been a member of this House. At the present moment the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Civil Lord and the Parliamentary Secretary all have seats in the House of Commons, and the Admiralty is without any representative here who is really connected with that Department. I have been endeavouring to ascertain who is likely to represent the Admiralty in the immediate future. I understand that these arrangements have not yet been completed. Now I come to a Department in which this House takes a special interest&#x2014;I mean the War Office. The noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack and myself are the only Peers who have lately held the office of Secretary of State for War, but there has always been until now an Under-Secretary of State to represent the Department here. Now the Secretary of State for War, the Under-Secretary, and the Financial Secretary, the three representatives of the Department, all have seats in the House of Commons, and we shall have to depend in any debate concerning the affairs of the War Office upon the information which we can elicit from a member of the Royal Household, Therefore, taking stock of these five Departments, we may say that in the case of the Colonial Office this House has lost the Secretary of State but keeps an Under-Secretary, and that in the case of the India Office we have got the Secretary of State, but in the case of the Foreign Office, the War Office, and the Admiralty the whole of the eight representatives of those Departments now sit in the House of Commons. We remain in the case of those Departments without any representative who can properly be described as belonging to the Parliamentary staff of those Departments.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00685">I do not know whether it will be suggested to us that we ought to find consolation in the manner in which other less conspicuous Departments are represented in your Lordships' House. My researches have not resulted in giving me any consolation of the kind. I take the office of Secretary for Scotland. To the lasting regret of my noble friend Lord Camperdown, Lord Pentland has been removed to another post, and we know that the business of the Scottish Office will be transacted here by a noble Lord who told us a few moments ago that he certainly did not plead guilty
<col>262</col>
to any acquaintance with Scottish business. Then there is the Post Office. The Post-master-General sits in the House of Commons, and a member of the Household answers for the Department here. In the case of the Board of Trade, a very important Department, both the President and the Parliamentary Secretary sit in the House of Commons, and I understand that we are to rely upon the good offices of the Master of the Horse for any information as to the affairs of that Department. In the case of the Local Government Board the President and the Parliamentary Secretary both sit in the House of Commons, and one of the Lords-in-Waiting will represent the Department here. As to the Board of Agriculture, this House again remains inconsolable for the departure of the noble Marquess, Lord Lincolnshire, and we shall, I have no doubt, find our suggestions carefully attended to by- Lord Lucas, who has left the War Office for a more peaceful Department. As to the Board of Education, both the President and the Under-Secretary sit in the House of Commons, and the Department is to be represented here by a noble Lord who is also Chief Commissioner of Works and who, so to speak, will double those two parts. And, my Lords, it is a little remarkable that while all these offices are given to members of the House of Commons the old practice of putting the Chancellor of the Duchy into this House and treating him&#x2014;the phrase was Lord Bufferin's&#x2014;as "maid of all work" of the Government of the day seems to have dropped into desuetude. If I may again summarise the facts in a rather different way I may say that in the year 1907, when Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman formed his Government, we had six Cabinet Ministers in this House and two Under-Secretaries of State; that when Mr. Asquith became Prime Minister we still had six members of the Cabinet in this House and one Under-Secretary of State; but that under the new distribution we have only four Cabinet Ministers out of a total of, I think, nineteen or twenty, with one Under-Secretary of State and one Parliamentary Secretary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00686">I maintain that, having regard to these facts, this House is placed at a very serious disadvantage when we have to discuss questions affecting any of these important Departments in the absence of a Minister really entitled to speak on behalf of the Department concerned. I need not dwell
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0136"/>
<col>263</col>
upon the importance of discussion in your Lordships' House. The subject has often been treated, and we all know what an immense body of authority and experience this House can produce whenever any subject of public interest comes forward for examination. To illustrate my meaning, let me suppose that an important debate on naval policy takes place. We know what a very large space in the foreground of our political life this question of naval policy now occupies. Questions of strategy, questions of finance, questions of international relations are all mixed up with these questions of naval policy. Now supposing my noble friend Lord Selborne desires to raise a question of naval policy. There is no representative of the Admiralty here. I believe it is the Master of the Horse who would answer?</p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00688"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I think it has been the Master of the Horse who has replied hitherto, but some other arrangement is evidently in contemplation. But let me suppose a military discussion. This House is particularly interested in military topics. The noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack and I have both known what it is to be heckled in this House over military questions, and there are undoubtedly a number of Peers who have made military questions their special study. Suppose that a debate is initiated by my noble friend Lord Methuen, or by Lord Roberts, or by the distinguished soldier whom you have just added to the roll of this House&#x2014;for you are always continuing to add distinguished men to the roll of this House&#x2014;I mean Sir William Nicholson. If any of these distinguished soldiers chooses to raise some important question of military policy he has to be content with a reply from a member of the Household. I venture to suggest that debates of this kind lose their reality when the protagonist for the Government is not an official of the Department concerned but some perfectly honourable and perhaps not undistinguished Peer connected with an appointment about the Royal Court. He comes down here coached for the occasion, armed with a brief with which he does his best, but I do not think any one will impute to me want of respect for these noble Lords when I say that in spite of their courtesy, which is unfailing, in spite of the obvious industry with which
<col>264</col>
they apply themselves to mastering the subjects which are committed to their charge, it is quite impossible for them, merely on the strength of an office brief, no matter how voluminous, to speak with weight and authority in defence of the Department whose case they are bidden to take up. We have all seen the thing happen. The noble Lord does the best he can with his brief; he gets to the end of it, and then he is at the end of his tether. I noticed a very frank statement which was made to us two nights ago by Lord Herschell, of whose excellent work in this House I desire to speak in terms of the highest praise because we all appreciate it. He announced to us that he was going to represent the War Office in this House, and he told us, with evident candour and a sincerity which pleased us all, that he intended to do his best to represent the case of the War Office to us, and that if he found himself faced with any point which was not familiar to him he would not fail to convey the substance of your Lordships' remarks to the Secretary of State. We want, however, something rather more from the representatives of these Departments than that they should merely take note of what is said on these Benches and communicate it to the Department, with a view, perhaps, to a renewal of the discussion at some future time.<lb/>
I hope, then, that I have said enough to show that this departure from the old practice is opposed to the whole spirit of our Parliamentary system and inconsistent with the respect due to this House of Parliament. I should like to remind the noble Marquess opposite that he and his colleagues are two-Chamber men. They often proclaim it. They are at this moment pledged to deal with the constitution of this House, and to deal with it at an early date. That has been said again and again. But in the meantime we still have our place in the Constitution, and we still have powers which, although they may be not a little diminished, are not inconsiderable powers, and which some members of His Majesty's Government have told us are even too considerable. At any rate, it is conceded to us without question that we have the right to discuss the proposals of His Majesty's Government, to revise Bills, and, within certain limits, to delay their progress through Parliament. If that is so, is it not necessary, if we are to discharge these duties in an efficient manner,
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0137"/>
<col>265</col>
if the whole proceeding is not to be a sham, that there should be in this House representatives of the great Departments whose affairs have from time to time to come before us? If we are to have a Second Chamber at all, is it not right that it should be properly equipped in respect of the representation of these Departments? We have, I venture to think, a right to ask for an explanation of this marked departure from the old usage. I hope we shall have from the noble Marquess opposite not only an explanation, but some kind of assurance that these arrangements are likely to be reconsidered, and that it is the intention of His Majesty's Government to revert to that sounder practice which until quite lately they themselves did not fail to observe.<lb/>
<i>Moved</i> to resolve, That this House condemns any departure from the well established usage under which the more important of the great Public Departments have in past years been represented in this House either by the Secretary of State for the Department or by one of his UnderSecretaries.&#x2014;(<i>The Marquess of Lansdowne.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00689"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I certainly have no desire to protest against the action of the noble Marquess in bringing this Motion before the House, and if I had entertained any such desire it would have been dissipated by the exceedingly genial and almost friendly manner in which he made his criticisms, strong though in effect those criticisms were. I can assure the noble Marquess that I have no desire to lay any stress or to attempt any defence on the ground of mere legal considerations. I fully recognise the importance of this question, and I recognise also that it is one which must be dealt with on general grounds of fairness and commonsense, and not in mere obedience to rules and laws which the wisdom of our forefathers may have laid down. I think it is important to note that the noble Marquess practically confines his Motion, as lie also did his speech, to a condemnation of our action in leaving the more important of the great Public Departments unrepresented in a form in which they have been represented in some past years in this: House. I think the word "important" demands a certain degree of examination, because the classification made by the noble Marquess seems to me a somewhat arbitrary one.<lb/>
<col>266</col>
It is quite true that in the official hierarchy a Secretary of State ranks above other Ministers, but it does not necessarily follow that the office which he represents is more important than any other. For example, we should bracket together the War Office and the Admiralty in degree of importance, but the one is represented, as we all know, by a Secretary of State and the other by the head of the Board. As time goes on the attitude of political observers towards various Departments in this matter of relative importance is liable to some alteration. There was a time, for instance, when it was hardly thought necessary to represent the Irish Office in Parliament at all. The last occasion, I think, on which the Irish Office was altogether unrepresented in the Cabinet was in Mr. Disraeli's Government when it was formed in 1874. Noble Lords opposite in later times generally had three representatives of Ireland in the Cabinet. Therefore the fate of a Department in public estimation, judging by that single instance, changes as time goes on. To take another instance, both the Board of Trade and even more markedly the Local Government Board have attained a rank in public estimation which when some of us were young they by no means enjoyed. Therefore the noble Marquess's classification, if he will forgive my saying so, appears to me from that point of view a little wooden, and I think it is advantageous to examine somewhat more closely what the representation of different Departments in this House has been in the more recent past and to endeavour to extract from those facts what has been the governing principle of Governments during that period in allocating representation here.<lb/>
The noble Marquess began by alluding to the Foreign Office. It is quite true that in the appointment of my right hon. friend Sir Edward Grey to the Foreign Office the late Prime Minister made an almost new departure. It has been the almost invariable practice within living political memory for the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to be a member of your Lordships' House, and the noble Marquess pointed out that, although we were deprived of the presence of the Secretary of State here, yet for a considerable period we had the advantage of the services of his relative Lord Edmund Fitzmaurice, whom we miss from this Bench more than I can say,
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0138"/>
<col>267</col>
and who entirely for all practical purposes filled the place here usually filled by the Secretary of State. But from that time my noble friend Lord Morley, since he has been Lord President of the Council, has taken the care of Foreign Affairs in this House under his special charge, and I think it may fairly be claimed that their conduct here has suffered nothing in my noble friend's hands. As your Lordships will realise, this particular matter of foreign affairs when discussed here practically always involves questions of Cabinet policy, and the Peer who for the time being is leading the House has always been accustomed to take a more or less prominent part in debates on foreign affairs. I do not think, therefore, that it can be said with any approach to reality that foreign affairs have been discussed with less information in this House since Sir Edward Grey has been Secretary of State.<lb/>
I will venture to run rapidly through some of the other Departments. The Colonial Office, as the noble Marquess stated, has always been represented in this House since 1886, except a during a few months in the life of the present Government when my right hon. friend Mr. Harcourt and Colonel Seely were for a short time both together in the House of Commons as Secretary of State and Under-Secretary. But it is only fair to add in respect of those few months that I had myself only just given up charge of the Colonial Office, and therefore I was, I hope, fairly competent to answer any Questions which noble Lords might put on Colonial affairs. Then as regards the India Office. Only twice since 1886 has the India Office been unrepresented directly in this House. In the years 1902 and 1903, when noble Lords opposite were in power, there was no India Office representative in this House. Lord George Hamilton and the late Lord Percy were the Secretary of State and the Under Secretary, and I have no doubt that the reason which would have been given for that is the same as that which I have just indicated in regard to our experience at the Colonial Office. The noble Marquess himself was on this Bench, and with his Indian experience I have no doubt he felt fully competent to receive from the India Office any information which they could give and to deal with it fairly&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<col>268</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00690"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: But after a year the noble Marquess insisted that we should revert to the old practice. When I became Secretary of State he particularly asked that there should be an Under-Secretary in this House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00691"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I do not dispute that for a moment. I simply drew attention to the fact that that interval of want of representation did exist. Then the noble Marquess mentioned the Home Office, and he said there appeared to be an unwritten law that the officials of the Home Office were always in the House of Commons. The same has usually applied to the Local Government Board. As a matter of fact, the Home Office has, if I remember right, never been directly represented in this House since 1886, which is the date the noble Marquess took. It was represented before that, because my noble friend Lord Rosebery was Under-Secretary at the Home Office for a period, as the noble Marquess will remember; and I shall have later on to draw attention to the curious omission of representation of this Office and to suggest a possible reason for it. The War Office has, as the noble Marquess accurately stated, been always represented in this House by either the Secretary of State or by the Under-Secretary until this moment. But the case of the Admiralty is altogether different, and perhaps some noble Lord opposite will be able to explain why. I notice that during the time noble Lords opposite were in power after we were turned out in the middle of 1886 until we came into office again in 1892 Lord George Hamilton, Mr. Ashmead-Bartlett, and the Financial Secretary were all in the House of Commons; and what the representation of the Admiralty was in this House during those years I confess I do not recollect. Then, again, after our second expulsion in 1895, for five years when Mr. Goschen, as he then was, was First Lord, he and Mr. Austen Chamberlain and the third representative all sat in the House of Commons and nobody represented the Admiralty here. It is quite true that the Admiralty has been poorly represented in this House in an official sense, except, of course, during the few years during which our lamented friend Lord Tweedmouth was First Lord.<lb/>
Then I come to the Board of Trade, which, after all, I think, ought to be
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0139"/>
<col>269</col>
ranked among the important Departments which the noble Marquess mentioned. During our tenure of office from 1892 to 1895 it was not officially represented here. But then equally from between the years 1902 and 1905 Mr. Gerald Balfour and Mr. Bonar Law divided between them the offices of the Board of Trade. Almost the only- Department which has been invariably favoured in this House and has always had a Parliamentary representative here is the Board of Agriculture, since the foundation of which this House has always enjoyed the presence of either its President or its Secretary. I ought, perhaps, to mention the Scottish Office, to which allusion has been made. It is true that it is our misfortune that with the exception of my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack we possess nobody who can by the furthest stretch of imagination be described as a Scotsman holding any kind of office in this Government, and to that extent I heartily sympathise with the chagrin expressed by the noble Lord opposite at the departure of my noble friend Lord Pentland, whose company here I am bound to say did not always appear to be so much appreciated by noble Lords opposite, because I do not think he always received the most handsome treatment from the Benches opposite in spite of his complete knowledge of the subject, and, I venture to say, the sympathetic manner in which he dealt with the various subjects raised by noble Lords of the Opposition.<lb/>
It seems to me desirable to attempt to draw some conclusion from the facts which the noble Marquess and I have laid before the House, and I think that the moral to be drawn is that this House has expected direct representation of this kind, not so much in relation to the intrinsic importance of the particular subjects as to the fact that the subjects were those over which this House has thought itself entitled to exercise a particular degree of control. The fact that the Navy has been so much less represented in this House than the Army is, I take it, largely due to the fact that we are always favoured here with the presence of far fewer Admirals than we are of Generals and Field-Marshals. It so happens that the sea Service, for one reason or another, does not seem to lead, either by way of inheritance or by way of creation, to these Benches so often as the sister Service does, and consequently this House has regarded the Army as being in
<col>270</col>
some respects its special province, dating probably from the days when the class from which the officers of the Army were almost exclusively drawn was the class which is represented in this House. Now there has been, as noble Lords are all aware, a considerable change in that respect. The classes from which officers in the Army are drawn are far more numerous, and I am sure we do not regret that fact. Still the tradition remains that this House has some peculiar kind of interest in the Army over and above that which it would claim in respect of other subjects, and which is considered, as I gather from what the noble Marquess said, to give it some special title for discussion here, and discussion which has to be met by a regular representative of the Office. If you come to importance you have the Home Office, and nobody will say that a Department which has to look after all the prisons of the country, to look after all the factories in the country, and which has the charge of the conduct of the Metropolitan Police can be treated in any respect as a less important Department than either the War Office or any other. One might say much the same of the Board of Trade, so often unrepresented here. Is anybody going to say that a Department which has charge of all the railways in the country, of the whole of the mercantile marine, which is continually concerned with matters affecting both the Dominions overseas and foreign countries everywhere yields in point of rank to any other? On the other hand, the Board of Agriculture, as I have pointed out, has been permanently and regularly represented here, and for very obvious reasons&#x2014;because noble Lords are intimately concerned in that matter, and because the bread and butter of many of us depends on the prosperity of agriculture; consequently the concession has been made of always placing a direct representative of the Department here.<lb/>
But I am disposed to ask, Is this direct representation quite so important as the noble Marquess has indicated that it is in his opinion? Anything in the nature of autobiography is al ways rather offensive on an occasion like this, but I cannot help recalling my own experience when I represented a Department here. I held an office in the Household and represented the Board of Trade. It happened to be a very busy and a somewhat anxious time
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0140"/>
<col>271</col>
at that Department, because it was the time when the first Electric Lighting Bills for London and other great towns were being introduced. They were introduced in some cases into this House by the Department of which I was the unworthy representative, and I can well recollect the consideration which I received from noble Lords opposite who knew so much more of the technical aspects of the subject than I did. All I could claim was, as the noble Marquess was kind enough to say is the rule, that I did my best to answer the questions and argue the points when they were raised in debate, but I cannot see that I should have been in a very much better position if I had been the Parliamentary Secretary of the Board of Trade. As it was, the Department were good enough to give me a room there and I had the use of a clerk as private secretary. I worked there regularly. If I had been the Parliamentary Secretary I should have been no more competent to argue the question of volts and amperes with scientific noble Lords than I was merely as a Lord-in-Waiting. I cannot help thinking, therefore, that the importance which appears to be attached, not to the work a man does or the time he gives to it, but to the particular title which is conferred on him, may be rather too great.<lb/>
I come to the particular case of the War Office, and in this matter I am quite in agreement with the noble Marquess opposite that the departure is an unfortunate one; and I think so for the reasons that he has stated&#x2014;namely, that War Office questions are raised in this House with such a degree of knowledge by many noble Lords, in addition to those who sit on the Front Bench opposite, that it is desirable that so far as possible they should be dealt with in an expert manner. At the same time, my Lords, I revert to the opinion which I have ventured to express that the office which a man holds or the title conferred upon him is not the only thing to be borne in mind. I do not feel certain that my noble friend on the Benches opposite, Lord Portsmouth, when he was Under-Secretary for War entirely enjoyed his experience on this Bench. That may have been&#x2014;I do not ask him to say whether it was so or not&#x2014;that he was not in reality in full sympathy with all the policy of the Government of the day. He has shown that this may
<col>272</col>
be the case by crossing over to the other side of the House. But I do not feel certain if the noble Lord had been a member of the Household and had undertaken the War Office business, or if he had been in some other office and some other noble Lord had taken the conduct of the War Office business, that there would have been any practical difference as regards the conduct of the debates. Having taken this departure, which, as I have stated, His Majesty's Government do not think in the abstract a fortunate one&#x2014;it was taken for reasons of the particular experience possessed by the various members of the House of Commons who now hold the three offices&#x2014;having taken that step I am prepared to state that it is not one which we should desire to regard as a precedent or one which we should desire to regard as permanent in itself. I quite agree that as matters are it is a desirable thing that there should be a direct representative of the War Office in this House, and I hope it may not be very long before we are so favoured again. But in the meantime I am certain that my noble friend Lord Herschel], who I am sure will he grateful for the kindly manner in which the noble Marquess spoke of him, will not merely do his best, but will do his work well, and he will have every advantage, in the sense of access to the office and the use of the services of those who are accustomed to instruct Ministers, which he could enjoy if he was holding the office or had conferred upon him the title of Under-Secretary.<lb/>
The noble Marquess drew a picture of the unhappy fate of a noble Lord, not a member of the Department, furnished with an ample brief which he has, perhaps, barely been given time to study, being asked upon such a brief to carry on a discussion in which skilful speakers take part. I should be sorry to consider that picture true of any of my noble friends who represent Departments, and I am quite certain that it will be in no way true of my noble friend Lord Herschell, who, coming new to the work, which, after all, might be equally true of an Under-Secretary, will I am sure give his time and his remarkable ability to the purpose of satisfying the needs of debate on subjects so difficult as these War Office matters often are in your Lordships' House. I may add that when it is not merely a question of the number of men whose time will expire on a par-
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0141"/>
<col>273</col>
ticular date or of the number of rifles of a particular pattern served out to a particular corps, and when we get on to a wider area, the area of policy, whether in connection with the Regular Forces or with the Territorial Army, we can hardly suppose that my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack will remain altogether silent, and the House will enjoy the benefit of a knowledge which in some respects noble Lords will admit to be unique.<lb/>
I do not know whether the noble Marquess desires to press his Motion of condemnation. If he desires to press it in the sense that it is intended to censure His Majesty's Government for this particular appointment and to lay direct blame upon the Prime Minister and his colleagues for the manner in which these arrangements have been made, then we should be obliged, of course, to take a Division on the subject. But if the noble Marquess merely desires to express the opinion that there ought to be in general a proper representation of the great Departments in this House we certainly have no quarrel with him there, and in such a case, if we are so assured, we should not put your Lordships to the trouble of a Division.<lb/>
I cannot before I sit down help reflecting how entirely different is the fate of noble Lords opposite. Speaking generally, it is no doubt true that in the formation of Governments and the allocation of appointments a Liberal Government has to think more of the House of Commons than the Conservative Party is compelled to do, and equally noble Lords opposite think more of the House of Lords. As I say, I cannot help reflecting that if and when the time comes when noble Lords opposite find themselves in office in how different kind of difficulty they will be placed. When one thinks of all the capacity and experience on the Benches opposite, quite apart from the drafts which the Opposition may be able to make, for all I know, from the Cross Benches, one wonders whether when a Conservative Government is formed any place will be found in it for members of the House of Commons, except, I suppose, possibly one or two for the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the right hon. friends of noble Lords opposite, including their new leader in another place. When the time comes and noble Lords opposite sit here certainly it will not be our lot to raise any complaint
<col>274</col>
of the kind which the noble Marquess has raised, because the House will be simply crammed with Secretaries of State and Presidents of Boards, and we shall only wish that our numbers were larger and that we were able to carry on more sustained discussions with them.<lb/>
Speaking quite seriously I desire to say, and to say in all sincerity, that there is not the least idea or intention of inflicting any slight upon the House in this particular allocation of War Office business, which, as I understand, is the allocation that has given rise to the noble Marquess's Motion. That is the last thing we should desire to do if only for this reason, that we have taken the line throughout the recent Constitutional changes that I his House ought to depend more upon argument and discussion and less upon mere voting than it has in the past. Holding that view it would be obviously altogether wrong and also foolish of us if we were not to do our best to see that that discussion, by which it is desired to justify the exercise of that important power of delay which, as the noble Marquess has stated, is still the possession of this House, is not merely full and free, as it always is, but that it is carried out in the best possible manner before the country; and I can assure the House that so far as I am concerned I shall always do my best to see that this House receives its proper meed of consideration in the representation of the different Departments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00692"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I question very much whether the so-called explanation of the noble Marquess will afford any more, satisfaction to his followers than it has done to noble Lords who sit on this side of the House. It is quite evident that the noble Marquess is not going to do anything for them. Their aspirations, it is evident, are going to remain ungratified, and the explanation of the noble Marquess has been nothing more than a laborious and totally unsuccessful attempt to show that regard has been had to equality of representation in the two Houses. I submit, and I think everybody here will agree, that the noble Marquess has entirely failed in explaining away the fact that the representation of the Government in this House at the present moment is infinitesimal compared with what it has been under former Administrations.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0142"/>
<col>275</col>
I would like to be allowed, if I may, to submit some additional explanations of my own. The first explanation which occurs to me, and I expect it has occurred to a good many other people besides myself, is that the Government, not the whole of the Government, perhaps, but a certain very influential portion of the Government, desire nothing so much as to make this House look ridiculous, and I am bound to say I think they have largely succeeded. What they have done is to increase our numbers to positively portentous dimensions, and the more numerous the membership of this House is the less important become its duties, and no doubt this policy of humiliation and discredit is extremely palatable to a section of the Radical Party. There is another reason. When offices fall vacant and it is possible for them to be filled by a redistribution of Under-Secretaryships, you avoid by-elections&#x2014;things which Governments are very glad to be able to avoid on certain occasions.<lb/>
The third explanation is that, oddly enough, the action of the Government is largely due to one of the most meritorious qualities of this House. Whatever may be the faults of this House there is one thing that you can most emphatically assert about it, and that is that it is infinitely the most good-natured and long-suffering Assembly in existence, so much so that the biggest bore might die without ever discovering that he was anything but the most acceptable speaker in the House. Nobody can have sat here without being struck by this fact, that no resentment is ever shown&#x2014;at all events it has never been shown in my experience&#x2014;against any evidence of ignorance on the part of noble Lords who are supposed to represent Government Departments. Over and over again we have most of us heard minor Court officials glibly reading off opinions on the most abstruse subjects and delivering equally confident opinions upon intricate legal points, and it is no exaggeration to say that if they were called upon for an explanation of the sentiments which they had delivered themselves of they would be no more capable of giving it than if they were faced with Sanskrit or Hebrew for the purpose of translation. Nobody ever thinks of worrying noble Lords in those circumstances. It is considered bad form. I admit myself that I have in a private capacity been responsible for Bills which I should have been very sorry to have been
<col>276</col>
forced to interpret. That is a state of things which does not prevail anywhere else, and any member of the House of Commons who was in charge of a Bill which he did not thoroughly understand would have his life made so thoroughly miserable for him that he would be glad to escape here or anywhere else to avoid the persecution to which he would be subjected.<lb/>
When, therefore, vacancies occur in the Government&#x2014;and vacancies, whether created by death or not, are, I expect, generally hailed with great satisfaction by Governments&#x2014;they argue to themselves somewhat in this fashion. "Now is the time for rewarding our friends. This is a stroke of good luck which we must take advantage of. Here is Mr. A., for instance, a well-connected gentleman who has done a great deal of work for the Liberal Social League. We ought to give him something. Then there is Mr. B., who has been stumping the country on behalf of the Insurance Act or some equally unpopular measure. Something ought to be done for him." Then there is another gentleman who is capable of making himself disagreeable. It may not be possible to get rid of him by making him a Peer as he may have an unsafe seat, but it is quite safe to make a gentleman of this kind an Under-Secretary because there is no risk of a by-election involved. And suppose anybody ventures to suggest that, after all, there is the House of Lords, and that there ought to be some sort of representation there, of course the answer would be, "The House of Lords&#x0021; What does it matter whom you send there? Anybody will do for them. Lord So and So, we believe, is in the habit of reading the lessons in his parish church; he will do perfectly well to represent one of the great spending Departments."<lb/>
So little value is attached to expert knowledge or to previous training that Governments have been known to commit the enormity, I might almost say, of appointing noble Lords to the position of Master of the Horse who were absolutely ignorant of the art of equitation, and therefore it is not the least incongruous, when a representative has to be found for the War Office, that a noble Lord, admirable in every other respect, is selected for the appointment who has never done ten minutes' drill in any sort of capacity, even as a Volunteer, in former days. I observed in a newspaper only a day or two ago that
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0143"/>
<col>277</col>
the principal measure of the session&#x2014;the Home Rule Bill&#x2014;is going to be committed to the charge of a noble Lord who, I believe, is not even a minor Court official; and unless some alteration is foreshadowed the Mediterranean policy will be replied upon, or the Government statement with regard to it will be read out, by the noble Lord who I think acts as Master of the Horse at the present moment. I therefore feel inclined to suggest that the second great Liberal measure should be committed to the charge of the Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, who has not had, so far, any opportunity of distinguishing himself.<lb/>
This practice of deputing noble Lords not to answer for Departments because they do not do it but to read for Departments, is a practice which detracts enormously from the interest and value of debates in this House; and there are debates in this House which are not only interesting, but, strange to say, valuable as well, and I believe that the intelligent public pays more attention to debates on certain subjects, perhaps not many, in this House than it does to debates elsewhere. Take, for instance, the Department which has been so frequently referred to this afternoon&#x2014;the War Office. The great difficulty with regard to military questions in this country is to arrive at facts, and there are only two ways, so far as I can see, of arriving, not at the truth, but at simple facts. One means is when military gentlemen are entertained at banquets and blurt out the truth, and then their official chiefs have, if they can, to explain away their statements. The other method, and the sole efficacious method, is to pursue a Minister by cross-examination, as is frequently done in this place with successful results. Those long and imposing statements on behalf of the War Office, or, in fact, of other Departments, which are made by Ministers in charge really often convey little or no information at all, because they are not intended to do so. For instance, I am perfectly certain&#x2014;and I think I am paying the noble and learned Viscount a high compliment when I say so&#x2014;speaking for myself I have been no wiser at the end of one of his long speeches regarding certain military facts than I was at the beginning. Those speeches are made for the purpose, first of all, of dishing their ex-official political opponents, and, in the second place, of throwing dust in the eyes of the public.<lb/>
<col>278</col>
As I said before, the only way of arriving at what the French call the real truth is by the process of cross-examination. But you cannot cross-examine a noble Lord who knows nothing whatever of the subject, whatever his merits may be. He is really in the position of a gramophone or any other mechanical instrument which has run down and has to be set up again at some future period. It is not fair, of course, to blame those automatic noble Lords too much, because it is ridiculous to expect that they can become thoroughly versed in the affairs of a Department with which they have no real connection. I desire on this occasion to be, as I always desire to be, as impartial as possible, and I must admit that it seems to me that we are partly to blame for the mean and shabby treatment to which we are exposed at the present moment, again largely owing to our own virtues. The one quality which I personally admire more than anything in this House is the superb reticence which is displayed by it as a body. Here we are some 600&#x2014;perhaps it is more correct to say 700&#x2014;Members, for our number is tending steadily to increase. Any Member can come down here four times a week during eight months in the year and can make a speech upon any subject that he fancies. Under the guise of asking a Question he can deliver himself of any opinion under the sun. And yet he does not do so. The number of people who do it is infinitesimal. Where in the civilised world will you find a similar example of self-restraint? It is not surprising that we are still able to extort the unwilling admiration oven of some of our opponents.<lb/>
Even this virtue, which we must all admire, has its drawbacks. I often wish that members of this House were animated by rather less modesty. Nobody can ignore the fact that during the present session, for instance, there has been a want of activity amounting I might almost say to lethargy. I should be inclined to guess that during the present year we have sat less and enjoyed longer holidays than upon any previous occasion, and I should also be inclined to suspect that the average attendance had been also smaller than in previous years. I confess it strikes me that it will not be very creditable to us as a Party, in view of this somewhat scanty and sparse attendance, if large numbers of Peers flock down here in the autumn should their services be required for the purpose of

defeating a Government measure. In short, my Lords, I venture with great respect to point out that if we displayed rather greater activity and more obvious interest in current proceedings the stronger would be our case against the mean and vindictive treatment which has been commented upon this afternoon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00693"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the concluding words of my noble friend who has just sat down did not seem to me to contain as strong an argument as the rest of his speech. Lord Newton is inclined to argue that by an abnegation of your rights your Lordships had encouraged the Government in the course for which we have received so ample an apology from the noble Marquess who leads the House. But in that respect Lord Newton is going too far. This House, it is true, has sat less this year, but the number of military debates has been in excess of those in former years, and yet this is the Department of which, under this new arrangement, we have not a single Parliamentary representative in this House. It is difficult, after the speech of the noble Marquess the Leader of the House, to press home many of the points on which we feel strongly. The noble Marquess has disarmed us by the candour with which he has expressed his disapproval of what had taken place, though with much ingenuity he endeavoured to make out that practically no change had taken place in the representation of the great spending Departments in your Lordships' House. So great has been the change during the last five years that the representation here of Public Departments has practically fallen by fifty per cent.; and if you look at the representation in the House of Commons you find that at this moment there are thirty-two representatives of Departments there, whereas in this House there are only six or seven. My noble friend Lord Lansdowne did not claim that there should be equality between the two Houses in this matter; but certainly an arrangement by which four-fifths of the Ministers sit in the other House is an unreasonable one.<lb/>
I should like to take, first, a point personal to the noble Marquess the Leader of the House. I shall be prepared afterwards to deal with the argument which he used, which I think was a false one, with regard to the position of Under-
<col>280</col>
Secretaries. I wonder if the noble Marquess has ever considered how great a burden has fallen upon himself owing to the present arrangement. I have taken the trouble to pick out the topics with which, in little over a Parliamentary month at the beginning of last year, the noble Marquess was forced to deal in this House through the absence of any official spokesmen, except on what Lord Newton called the gramophone principle, which has been so largely adopted. The noble Marquess at that time was carrying a pretty heavy burden. In the year 1910 he had the control of one of the heaviest Departments and he had, like other Ministers, a large accession of business through the change owing to the demise of the Crown. Then there were his duties as a member of the Cabinet and of the Defence Committee, and he also had the special duty, which went on for many months, of acting upon that Conference from which so much was hoped with regard to the relations of the two Houses but which unfortunately came to no agreement. But in that single month at the period to which I refer Lord Crewe made a speech in this House of some length covering the whole field of foreign politics, and he also made important speeches on the Parliament Bill, on the Referendum, on House of Lords Reform, on the Territorial Army, on beet sugar, on local rating, on the Finance Bill, on Sir Arthur Wilson's Memorandum, on Colonial Governments, on Persia, on the <i>Ne Temere</i> Decree, and on half a dozen other questions&#x2014;all matters requiring careful consultation with different Departments of State. Within a few weeks of the last of those speeches, to our great regret, the noble Marquess's health broke down, and our pleasure at seeing him with us again is tempered in my. case with astonishment that his colleagues, having seen the effect of that process before, should have laid upon the noble Marquess such an intolerable burden by the changes they have made in reducing the number of Cabinet Ministers in this House from seven to four, and the number of Under-Secretaries of State from two to one.<lb/>
I ask myself, On what ground is this action taken? The noble Marquess has assured us that it is not taken from any desire to humble this House or to withhold information. I take leave to say that no case can be made out, from the point of view of the business in the other House,
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0145"/>
<col>281</col>
for the enormous increase in the <i>personnel</i> of the Government in that Chamber. The debates in the other House are not as prolonged as they were twenty years ago, and the time allotted to Departmental criticism on the Estimates is less than it was twenty years ago. The attendance in Parliament on average evenings, we learn from the newspapers, has been lessened greatly by the continued interposition of the Closure and the consequent unreality of the debates; and so much has the practice arisen of leaving matters to Under-Secretaries in the other House that it has frequently been my experience to read in the newspapers that the Under-Secretary has been the previous night defending his Department in the House of Commons and also parrying, in his absence, attacks upon his chief, whom one has had the advantage of seeing in more congenial atmospheres in a costume betokening the festivities of the hour. The habit is growing of Ministers absenting themselves even when the business of their Department is under consideration. I venture to think that this requires explanation and defence, but we have not heard one word with regard to it to-night. The particular instance of the War Office is only one of a long series of changes in the hitherto well-established usage of Parliament. May I ask the noble Marquess to bear with me for a moment while I contest the argument which he set up, that it does not very much matter whether a man is in the Department or merely briefed by the Department so far as regards his effectiveness in dealing with experts in this House?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00694"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I might, perhaps, state the argument rather differently. I should be far from saying that a man who merely received a brief for a Department was in the same position as one who was working in it. My object was to call attention to the fact that it is quite possible for the representative of a Department who may hold an office, for instance, in the King's Household to do regular work for the Department, and I ventured to instance the way I had done so myself in 1886.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00695"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My point is that I think the noble Marquess undervalues the objects which we set before ourselves in the discussions which we initiate. I am quite certain that Lord
<col>282</col>
Herschell will give us on all War Office matters as complete and as courteous an answer as he can, but he lacks one important function of an Under-Secretary. The object of these debates is not merely to extract information from the Government, or, as Lord Newton said, to cross-examine a Secretary of State, but to influence the course of procedure in the future. I speak with some little knowledge of the work of an Under-Secretary. I believe I hold the record in this House, for I do not think any other noble Lord has ever served as I did for nearly twelve years as an Under-Secretary under five different chiefs. Therefore I have some knowledge of what the functions of an Under-Secretary are. Lord Beaconsfield, complaining of an Under-Secretary for War, said to him. "You are not aware of the details of your office which it is your business to master for the benefit of the Secretary of State, who is occupied with other subjects." An Under-Secretary has this advantage, that every paper comes before him before it goes to the Secretary of State, and it would be impossible for Colonel Seely not to be made aware by his Under-Secretary in this House in his Minute of anything which had been forced upon the mind of the Under-Secretary here and which properly ought to find its way to the Secretary of State before he gave his decision; and if that is neglected one of the most important objects which are achieved by the criticism of the Government is lost.<lb/>
I cannot help asking myself, On what ground was the present appointment made? I do not wish to say a word derogatory of the new Under-Secretary of State for War. I sat with him in the House of Commons and I know he was a most conscientious student of many sides of public activity. He was an authority on many social questions and questions connected with the Home Office, but I am not aware that he took the smallest interest in military matters or had in any way specially marked himself out for that particular Department. Therefore I ask why should not Lord Herschell have been appointed Under-Secretary of State for War? What was there which forced Mr. Asquith to select Mr. Tennant? Although the House of Lords has from time immemorial had a representative of the War Office, yet the Prime Minister, a few months after he has laid on this Chamber
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0146"/>
<col>283</col>
the severest stigma which it was within the power of any man to lay on any Assembly, deprives this House of the opportunity of first-hand communication with the Department dealing with a subject of which it happens to have the greatest knowledge. There are in this House six Field-Marshals and nearly fifty chairmen of Territorial Associations, not to speak of ex-officials of the Department; and I am afraid that even the prospect held out by the noble Marquess the Leader of the House that before long the representation may be improved does not prevent our feeling that we have been hardly used in this matter.<lb/>
It has been suggested in some quarters that it would be well if Ministers had the opportunity of sitting in both Houses. I believe that rule obtains in some other Assemblies. But there are two sides to that question, and the one which pre-dominates to-day is the practical side. How are you to add to the labours which a Minister now has to undergo? He is already forced to speak all over the country in defence of the Government. I hardly think that the plan of Ministers going from one House to the other would be feasible, and I am quite sure that, unless the temper of the present Government altered very materially, it would only result in this House being further deprived of the representatives of the great Public Departments, seeing that we should be told that if any difficulty arose some one would come across the Lobby and explain matters to us. I hope the result of this debate will be a little more than appeared in the speech of the Leader of the House. I cannot help thinking that in this matter not merely have we a serious grievance but that serious public inconvenience will follow unless some change is made in regard to representation in this House. What occurred last year certainly robbed the legislative power of this House of considerable force, but, as Lord Newton said, there are a large number of people who follow the debates in this House. I know many departments of the Government which have profited by the criticisms addressed in this Assembly, and I trust that the noble Marquess who leads the House will take pains to see that the downhill progress which has been so rapid of recent years with regard to effective representation in this House is brought to an end.</membercontribution></p>
<col>284</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00696"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: There are a few words which I should like to say in comment on the speech to which we have just listened. We all appreciate the terms of acknowledgment in which the noble Viscount spoke of the laborious duties which were discharged by my noble friend who leads the House and the thoroughness with which he covered the vast variety of topics with which he had to deal. But I do not think that the situation is so serious as the noble Viscount would have us believe. It is true that the Ministry is at the present moment somewhat inadequately represented in this House, but the inadequacy I think is more superficial than real. The impression has got abroad that the important thing is numerical proportion, and that because somebody happens to be an Under-Secretary he can therefore in this House discharge equally well the functions which would be fulfilled elsewhere by the Minister who is actually at the head of the Department. I wish to contest that by a case with which the noble Viscount and I are both familiar. The organisation of the War Office has considerably changed since the noble Viscount was there. At that time the Under-Secretary- might be said not only to represent the views of his chief but to be a sort of deputy to the Minister at the head of the Department in regard to all the subjects with which he was concerned. But since the Order in Council which was the result of the Esher Inquiry that state of things has disappeared.<lb/>
To-day the functions of the Ministers who represent the War Office are very different from what they were in the days of the noble Viscount. Besides the Secretary of State there are other members of the Army Council, of whom the Civil Member (the Under-Secretary) and the Financial Member are only two. The various duties are partitioned out very definitely. The Civil Member, for instance, deals with questions connected with the Territorial Force and with land, and he has nothing whatever to do with a subject which has been much discussed in this House&#x2014;mobilisation. I take that as an illustration. The Civil Member has no more opportunity of knowing about mobilisation than an outsider would have provided that outsider had equal access to the office. It is not in his department, and it was not intended that the various
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0147"/>
<col>285</col>
members of the Army Council should interfere in each others business. Again, the Financial Member has no official cognisance of the general conduct of business throughout the War Office. The only Minister who does know all that goes on in the War Office is the Secretary of State, and the only exception to that rule is when there is somebody of sufficient energy and capacity to go beyond the duties assigned to him and make himself master of all that is going on. The material bearing of that is that if a noble Lord who is a member of the Government is given facilities for making himself acquainted with the business of the War Office he will be at least as well qualified to discharge the duties which have to be discharged in this House as would be the Civil Member. The intention in the present ease is that Lord Herschell should make himself familiar with the whole organisation of the Army. He has a room at the War Office, I understand&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00697"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Will Lord Herschell be in a position, as the Under-Secretary would be, to attend the meetings of the Army Council?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00698"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: No; Lord Herschell will not be in a position to attend the A ruin Council. But the noble Viscount if he had had my experience during the last six years, would know that the work actually done before the Army Council is not a hundredth or even a five hundredth part of the work done in formal consultations which go on between members of the Army Council and the Secretary of State, and Lord Herschell will have at least as good an opportunity of access to the Secretary of State as will any of his colleagues, and I venture to think that my noble friend will show himself equal to the duties which will be cast upon him. The whole question of the changes which have taken place cannot be considered apart from the enormous increase of work in the House of Commons. Parliament sits for a large part of the year now and business has increased enormously in the House of Commons. Ministers are overworked; they have more to do in the country outside the walls of Parliament than ever before; and it is natural that there should be a gravitation on the part of the ranks of the Ministry to the place where the work is so enormous. I quite agree that this House should be guarded
<col>286</col>
against unfair treatment in this matter. It is one of the Houses of Parliament; all matters have to come before this House equally in theory with the other, and every Government ought therefore to be represented adequately here. But I think I have shown that as regards the Department to which I have referred the arrangement which has been adopted ought to provide this House with adequate means of informing itself minutely on the various matters of policy which from time to time must form the subject of debate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00699"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this discussion really raises a question of great Constitutional importance, because it is one that must affect the future prestige and character of this House. We have had replies from two important Ministers&#x2014; from the Leader of the House and from the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack. The latter noble Lord dealt in the main with the question of the Department with which he has been so long associated, and there, of course, I shall not endeavour to follow him. I will say in a moment a sentence or two about his reference to the increasing gravitation, as he called it, towards the House of Commons. The noble Marquess the Leader of the House dealt with us, as he always does, with great courtesy. He gave us an interesting historical account of the representation of the Departments in both Houses of Parliament, and he drew a distinction, which seemed to me a fanciful and rather irrelevant, distinction, between the degrees of intrinsic importance which particular Departments might be supposed to possess in the eyes of this House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00700"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I only did that in view of the particular words used by the noble Marquess in his Motion and the enumeration which he made of certain Departments as specially important.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00701"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Marquess the Leader of the House seemed to be of opinion that my noble friend behind me had based his case upon an arbitrary selection of Departments. I am sure I am expressing the view of Lord Lansdowne when I say that that was not in the least the case. He is quite prepared to take any Department, or any group of Departments, or the Departments as a whole, and whichever
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0148"/>
<col>287</col>
test be applied he would equally make good his case. Conciliatory as have been the replies, no sort of answer has been given to the main gravamen of the charge that has been made. As I understand the charge it is this, not that His Majesty's Government have violated the law&#x2014;though my noble friend did say that in respect of the appointment of Parliamentary Secretaries he thought that it had been evaded&#x2014;but that the unbroken Constitutional practice of Parliament, which has existed for a hundred years or more, has been broken down in the hands of the present Administration.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Lansdowne went on to give evidence which was incontrovertible. He took the case of Departments of Government which have two Parliamentary representatives&#x2014;the Home Office, the Foreign Office, the Board of Trade, the Local Government Board, the Board of Education, and the Irish Office. Each of these Departments has two Parliamentary representatives, both of whom at present sit in the House of Commons. Then there are two other Departments each of which has three Parliamentary representatives&#x2014;the War Office and the Admiralty&#x2014;and each of those three representatives now sits in the House of Commons. That is a state of affairs unprecedented in our Parliamentary history, and I really think I should not be using extravagant language if I said it almost amounted to a Parliamentary scandal. The noble Marquess the Leader of the House said he would communicate to us what he held to be the governing principles of the matter. I listened carefully to the whole of his speech to learn what they were supposed to be, but he vouchsafed us no explanation on the point.<lb/>
Now what are the governing principles? The noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack said there was an increasing gravitation towards the House of Commons. Let us admit that. Let us say at once that none of us would wish to draw up our code of principles with anything like the rigidity which would have been demanded fifty or a hundred years ago. We concede at once that as regards the great spending Departments it is only right that they should be adequately represented in the House of Commons. I think we should concede that it is not
<col>288</col>
unreasonable that a majority of the Secretaries of State should sit in the House of Commons, and, further, that it is not improper that the majority of the members of the Cabinet should be found in that House rather than in the House of Lords. That was not always the case. If you go back exactly 100 years from the present date to the Administration of Lord Liverpool you will find that a large majority of the members of his Cabinet were in your Lordships' House, and there was an even more famous case when Mr. Pitt formed his first Administration and was the solitary Cabinet Minister in the House of Commons. All that was inevitably changed with the Reform Bill. With the Reform Bill came a second era, in which Cabinet Ministers were fairly evenly divided between the two Houses. This went on until the latest phase began with Mr. Gladstone's Government in 1892. Then for the first time there was a marked disparity, and a large majority of Cabinet Ministers had seats in the House of Commons. That process has continued unarrested till the present day, and the movement&#x2014;as I think a downward movement&#x2014;has been so rapid that we have now got to the point, according to the figures given by the noble Marquess, when out of a Cabinet of twenty members no fewer than sixteen sit in the House of Commons and only four in your Lordships' House. That is what we protest against.<lb/>
And this brings me to the last of the governing principles which I, at any rate, would venture to lay down. Making all the concessions to the House of Commons which the natural political gravitation demands, it is nevertheless entirely right and proper and becoming that this House so long as we have a bicameral system should, as regards all the important Departments of State, have a representative here. And by a representative I do not merely mean a courteous and amiable spokesman drawn from some Court appointment. I mean au official working in the Department, cognisant of its affairs, familiar with its papers, and capable of interpreting the mind of his chief.</membercontribution></p>

<col>289</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00703"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I was not in the country myself at the time. There may have been special reasons, just as there was a special reason, as stated by the noble Marquess, for the failure to represent the India Office during a short time in this House. My noble friend behind me tells me that the Admiralty was at that time represented in this House by Lord Hopetoun, who was specially qualified to deal with the matter and had special knowledge upon it. It may be that there have been departures on this side from what I hold to be the correct practice. But whenever started the process has been steadily pursued by His Majesty's present Government to the destruction, as I think, of the prestige and privilege and authority of this House. I am one of those&#x2014;and I hope the sentiment is common to most of your Lordships&#x2014;who even in our present condition, maimed and mutilated as we are, feel a pride in belonging to the House of Lords. I feel that such rights as we still possess it is our duty to exercise. I feel that we have a right to all the information that the Government in its various Departments has to place at our disposal. Ministers come here not to please themselves; they come here because the House has a right to demand their presence. Ministers answer equally to both Houses of Parliament so long as the double-Chamber system continues, and this House has every bit as much right to authoritative information from any Department of Government as has the House of Commons. Destroy us if you will, take away our power altogether, drive this country into single-Chamber government, but as long as we retain a bicameral system you have no right to make these stealthy inroads upon the authority of the House of Lords and to rob us of the rights to which we are entitled.<lb/>
I do not wish to pursue the matter, but there was a question put by the noble Marquess the Leader of the House at the conclusion of his remarks to which I think he will expect a reply. He said that his attitude and the attitude of his supporters would be governed by what was the real meaning of the Motion put down by my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition. The object of the Motion was not to censure the Government or the head of the Government for any individual appointment or group of appointments. What my noble
<col>290</col>
friend desired to do was to state again the correct principles which have always hitherto been observed as regards the distribution of offices between the two Houses of Parliament, and to place on record our disapproval of the utterly inadequate arrangements which, as it appears to us, have been made by the Government in recent years in the representation in this House of the great Public Departments. If the noble Marquess, as I understand he will do, accepts the Motion in that sense, then I imagine there will be no necessity to put your Lordships to the trouble of a Division, and this Motion will remain on record as a demonstration of the strong views entertained by your Lordships on a matter really of no mean importance.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE NAVAL POSITION IN THE<lb/> MEDITERRANEAN.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00774"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member> rose to call attention to the naval position in the Mediterranean, and to move for Papers. The noble Earl said: My Lords, it fell to the lot of my political colleague a year or two ago to have to attack His Majesty's Government on the subject of their naval policy. There is nothing further from the wish of my friends or of myself than that the naval policy of this country should ever be a Party question. Whether we are in opposition or in office, it is our most sincere hope that the naval policy of this country shall be a national policy. Therefore, while I shall endeavour to-night to express the grave anxiety which we feel in respect of the situation, as we understand it to be, in the Mediterranean, and while I shall not hesitate to lay our view of the case before His Majesty's Government,
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0154"/>
<col>299</col>
I have no intention of indulging in a Party attack. I hope it never will be necessary. If, unfortunately, His Majesty's Government should fail at some future time to rise to what we believe to be the height of national naval policy, it would be our duty to criticise them, and, if need be, to attack them; but it will be a far more agreeable prospect for us if we can give them and the present Board of Admiralty our whole-hearted support in pursuing a national naval policy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00775">I do not know how far His Majesty's Government will be able to give us information to-night. It is not my intention to embarrass them in what I know to be a very difficult situation, bearing, as they do, a great responsibility, but my friends and I thought that we should be failing in our duty if we did not take the earliest opportunity of laying before your Lordships' House our views on this question. In saying what I have to say I shall endeavour not to trespass into detail. I shall only deal with the broad aspects of the case. But before passing on I do wish to say a word on a matter that may be considered to be in the nature of a detail, but a detail so important that I should not like to omit mention of it. As far as I can judge, at present the most urgent need of the Navy is more men. There never has been any difficulty in recruiting the Navy or the Royal Marines, and I have no reason to suppose that there is any difficulty now. But the shortage of men which I fear does undoubtedly exist arises from the fact that the recruiting for the Navy is in boyhood, and the shortage exists to-day because sufficient boys were not taken into the Navy four or five years ago. I see that Lord Charles Beresford, who never wearies in endeavouring to remind his fellow-countrymen of the naval position as he sees it, has stated, in one of his communications to the Press, that this shortage began as long ago as 1904, and that in that year 10,000 additional boys ought to have been taken for the Navy, and that the necessary Vote was reduced for financial considerations. I had the honour to be First Lord of the Admiralty in 1904, and I do not know from what source Lord Charles Beresford derived his information. I can assure him and also the House that there is no foundation for that statement. I never during the time that I was at the Admiralty failed to ask my colleagues in the Cabinet to agree to
<col>300</col>
that increase in the numbers borne in the Fleet which my naval advisers in each year considered necessary, and my colleagues never refused the addition asked for. It is possible that we made a mistake and did not ask for enough in 1904, though I am not prepared to admit that. But the statement is quite unfounded that knowing a larger addition to be necessary we chose a smaller number for financial considerations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00776">Before I pass on to deal with the principles at issue in connection with the Mediterranean, let me remind your Lordships what must always be the basis of the naval strategy for our country in time of war. The Navy should have one task and one task only, and that is to find the ships of the enemy and to destroy them. There never has been, there never can be, such a thing as local defence in connection with our Empire. In time of war the frontiers of our Empire are the sides of the enemy's warships and nowhere else, and the single task of the Admiralty and of the naval Commander-in-Chief must always be to seek those ships and to destroy them. That is why on another occasion and in another place I expressed the matter thus&#x2014;
<quote>"The sea is all one; therefore the Navy must be all one, and the command of the Navy in time of war must be all one."</quote>
There cannot possibly be divided commands in the Imperial Navy in time of war, for no effective offence can be made against any part of the Empire except through the ships of the enemy, and if those ships are destroyed in the Mediterranean, let us say, Australia and New Zealand are just as much protected in their territory, in their interests, and in their trade as is the United Kingdom; if, on the other hand, the enemy's ships are destroyed in the Indian Ocean, the United Kingdom and Canada are just as much protected in their territory, trade, and interests as South Africa or India.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00777">But where, my Lords, will the enemy's ships be found? That will depend upon where the enemy of the moment think they can do this Empire the most damage. If they think that they are strong enough to meet the combined forces of the Empire on the high seas the enemy fleets will come out of harbour and seek battle without circumlocution; but it is more probable that the enemy will endeavour to effect
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0155"/>
<col>301</col>
a temporary superiority in some one sea in order to overwhelm a portion of our Fleet, with the hope of repeating the operation later on in another sea. Therefore as a necessary preliminary the enemy would endeavour to deceive us, to make a feint as it were, so as to draw our power asunder with the object of concentrating themselves and attacking one part of it. Or the enemy might think that we were most vulnerable in our territory, and that an invasion of some part of the Empire offered the best chance of inflicting a serious blow against our power. In that case, too, the object of the enemy would be to deceive us as to their real intention and to draw our Fleet to the wrong spot in order that the blow might be directed with success. Or, finally, the enemy may think that our trade and our food supply is our most vulnerable point, and they may turn all their attention to the destruction of our trade and the interception of our food supply.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00778">Bearing these considerations in mind&#x2014;for, my Lords, I believe them to be sound, and that naval authorities would admit them to be so&#x2014;let us consider generally our position in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean is the shortest route and the easiest connection with our Indian Empire. It is the shortest and the easiest route to the Australasian Dominions and for the whole of our Eastern trade. It is the only route from Europe to Egypt, the only route by which, if necessary, reinforcements and succour could be given to Egypt in time of difficulty. The volume of trade coming to the United Kingdom through the Mediterranean every year is simply immense. I am not going to throw statistics at the heads of your Lordships, because I do not think that that description will be disputed or considered to be an exaggeration. The volume of our Empire trade in the Mediterranean every year is, as I say, immense, and of that trade a very large proportion is food for the people of this country&#x2014;not only food coming from the East, but food from the Mediterranean basin itself and from the Black Sea. This importance of the Mediterranean is not dependent only on the existence of the Suez Canal. The existence of the Suez Canal has immensely increased the importance of the Mediterranean to us, but our fathers long before the Suez Canal was even contemplated found the Mediterranean of such importance to us that they
<col>302</col>
went through great sacrifices and made great efforts to acquire Gibraltar and Malta and to keep them when acquired. They acquired Gibraltar and Malta, and they retained Gibraltar and Malta because even in those days they regarded our influence and our power in the Mediterranean as essential for the well-being of this country. If that was so in the eighteenth and in the nineteenth centuries, how far truer, my Lords, is it to-day in the twentieth century?</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00779">And let me remind your Lordships of two things in connection with Gibraltar and Malta. Gibraltar is Continental, and therefore it is liable to attack in the same way as any Continental fortress may be at any time according to the country in which it is situated and the Powers that are at war. But Malta is an island, and as such it is more, not less, liable to invasion than this country. After all, the seas round Malta may be fairly described as narrow seas in no very different sense from that in which we use the term in connection with England; but whereas the United Kingdom can only he invaded from the east, Malta is surrounded by military Powers, and invasion might come from north or south, from east or west, according to the Power with which we were unfortunately at the time at war. I can think of no island fortress in the world more surrounded, now happily entirely by friends, but more surrounded by Powers which have the strength for attack if it should unfortunately be their wish to do so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00780">That being what I may describe as the eternal and permanent position in the Mediterranean, how does the grouping of the Powers exist in it to-day? What is our strength in the Mediterranean to-day, according to our latest information, as compared with what it was in the year 1904? I take that year because it was the last complete year in which I had the honour of being First Lord of the Admiralty, and I think your Lordships will admit that that is a not insufficient reason for my taking that as any standard of comparison. In the year 1904 the famous Navy of France was very strong in the Mediterranean; so it is to-day. Italy had a Navy of great efficiency, but not of equal size to that of France; to-day the Navy of Italy is more important, more powerful, and larger than it was in the year 1904. Austria-Hungary had in 1904
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0156"/>
<col>303</col>
a small Navy, always an efficient and brave Navy but a small Navy; next year or the year after the Navy of Austria-Hungary will be a very powerful factor in the Mediterranean, composed of a squadron of the best and largest and heaviest armoured battleships in the world. The Russian squadron in the Black Sea remains to-day in very much the same position in which it was in 1904. The Navy of Turkey is in process of resurrection. Therefore the material change so far as other Powers are concerned which has taken place in the Mediterranean in the last eight years is this: Austria-Hungary is emerging into a really important naval Power, and Italy is a stronger naval Power than she was eight years ago.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00781">My Lords, what about ourselves? Let me take first of all the garrisons of Gibraltar and Malta. They are of secondary importance compared to the naval strength, but they are a necessary complement of and auxiliary to it, and they must not be omitted from oar calculations. The strength of the Artillery is the same to-day as it was then. There is, I believe, one company of Fortress Engineers fewer in Malta to-day than in 1904. But the great change has been in the battalions of Infantry. In that year the establishment of the garrison of those two fortresses was eleven battalions of infantry; at the present moment there are five at Malta and two at Gibraltar&#x2014;a reduction of four battalions, or more than thirty-three per cent. of the strength. When I was at the Admiralty this question of the garrisons was gone into very carefully, and our advisers at that time were quite clearly of opinion that eleven battalions of infantry were the minimum for the requirements of Malta and Gibraltar. Yet at that time there was in the Mediterranean a magnificent British Fleet. There were no fewer than twelve battleships of the Line of the best type, four armoured cruisers and twelve other cruisers. To-day, according to the information we have at present, with these reduced garrisons there are no battleships of the Line. The squadron of battleships has for the moment disappeared from the Mediterranean. There are still four armoured cruisers; the other cruisers have shrunk from twelve to three in number. So in place of twelve battleships and sixteen cruisers, of which four were armoured, there are now no battleships and seven cruisers,
<col>304</col>
of which four are armoured. I have not said anything about the torpedo craft, in which I believe there has been a reduction.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00782">Before I pass on let me say a word about torpedo craft. It has been suggested, not, so far as I know, by His Majesty's Government, that our strength in the Mediterranean might be largely rehabilitated by an increase of torpedo craft. Torpedo craft are of very great importance as the complement of battleships and cruisers, but they never can be a substitute for either the one or the other. A much larger force of torpedo craft, even when supported by cruisers, can never maintain itself permanently against an inferior strength of torpedo craft if supported by cruisers and battleships. That is why all the great Powers in the world are united in their policy. If you want to be strong at sea the foundation of your strength must be in battleships, and battleships of the largest and most powerful type. Never let it be said, I hope, in our Parliament that torpedo craft can be regarded as otherwise than a mere auxiliary to the power of battleships.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00783">If that is the position, let us apply the principles of naval warfare which I endeavoured to lay down in the first part of my speech to the situation in the Mediterranean if unfortunately we should be at war. If we were at war with a Power which had no strength in the Mediterranean, and during the whole of that war all the Powers in the Mediterranean remained neutral, a dangerous situation would not arise for us; but if we were unfortunately at war with one or more Powers, and those Powers had some strength in the Mediterranean, and if we had no allies on our side, the position would obviously be very serious. The seven cruisers could make no possible headway against the enemy forces in the Mediterranean, and it is quite obvious that the enemy would see that it was in the Mediterranean that they could deal us deadly blows. They would lay themselves out to destroy our trade, to intercept our food supplies, and to take Malta from us if they could. They would lay themselves out to send an expedition, if they could, to Egypt. I say nothing about the possible effects on India. But given the condition I have for the moment supposed, I do not think there is any responsible man who will not agree that
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0157"/>
<col>305</col>
our position in the Mediterranean would be deplorable. Now let us suppose that while unfortunately we were at war with Powers which had some naval strength in the Mediterranean we also had the good fortune to have on our side another Power or Powers which also had naval strength in the Mediterranean. It is quite clear that the position then would be immensely improved for us&#x2014;it would be a very different position.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00784">But, my Lords, there is no Power with naval strength in the Mediterranean which has not vast responsibilities in the Mediterranean of its own. In those circumstances we should be asking that Power to give its protection, not only to all its own vast interests in the Mediterranean, but to our interests there in addition. I ask your Lordships whether that would not be an enormous burden to put upon any Power; and however efficient, however loyal, that Power might be. I could not regard without the gravest uneasiness our position in the Mediterranean in those circumstances, because I am confident that the enemy would still regard the Mediterranean as our vulnerable point. They would still endeavour to get troops to Egypt. They would still endeavour to seize Malta by a <i>coup de main</i>. They would lay themselves out to destroy our trade in the Mediterranean and intercept our supplies of food. This country ought never to be in the position of having to depend exclusively, or practically exclusively, on the loyalty and efficiency and courage of some ally for the protection of all our interests in the Mediterranean. It is quite reasonable that there should be some division of responsibility between us&#x2014;that whereas we should with their assistance be more responsible for our joint interests in another sea, in the Mediterranean they should be more responsible for their interests and ours, but not without some help from us. Never can it be right for us in the Mediterranean to depend only on the strong right arm of some friend.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00785">After all, we have to look at this matter not only from the point of view of war. We hope that we never shall find ourselves engaged in a naval war. We are, happily, now on terms of excellent friendship with all great naval Powers in the Mediterranean, and we trust and pray that those terms of friendship will never be disturbed. Therefore let us consider the position through
<col>306</col>
long years of peace. I should be the last man to say that the Battle Squadron should never be withdrawn from the Mediterranean for exercise in the Atlantic or elsewhere with the other Fleets. I think that would be a wholly unreasonable proposition. It is quite right from time to time that the Mediterranean Fleet should join with the other Fleets in great naval man&#x0153;uvres. But I would ask your Lordships to consider how the prestige of this country would be affected if through long years of peace we cease to have any squadron of battleships in the Mediterranean. The word "prestige" has often been abused. I admit that. But it can also be used legitimately, and I do not think any more legitimate occasion for using it can be found than in connection with our position in the Mediterranean. The prestige of this Empire in the Mediterranean is just as solid a material asset to this Empire as the coal-mines of England or the gold in the Bank of England. It is a reality&#x2014;a reality built up by two centuries of position in the Mediterranean. Through the whole of the eighteenth and the whole of the nineteenth century the races living round the basin of the Mediterranean have seen our Fleets, not in a position of arrogance, but pacifically, and now and again in time of war with success, bearing the traditions and the power of Great Britain with them, and that constant sight of our Fleets through generations has produced a profound effect on the minds of the people, civilised or uncivilised, who live in the Mediterranean basin&#x2014;and far beyond the Mediterranean. That great historical fact is known to the peoples of India, it is known to the Far East.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00786">What must be the effect on the minds of those people, on their imagination, on their estimate of our power, when after all these years, suddenly as it were, the flag of our country disappears from the Mediterranean? Let us not deceive ourselves. There will be no mistake on the part of other people or other races, however uncivilised or however ignorant, if we merely keep an inferior squadron of cruisers in the Mediterranean. They will know that something has happened. What they will not be able to tell. They can only form their own estimate that we would not have done it if we could have helped. Therefore, my Lords, I do not think that this question can be considered only from the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0158"/>
<col>307</col>
war point of view. It must be considered from the point of view of our diplomatic strength in the civilised world, and from the point of view of our prestige in India and elsewhere, where we have such great responsibilities for the government of peoples. Only the other day the First Lord of the Admiralty, following up a train of thought which has been held by his predecessors for some time past, addressed an eloquent appeal to the peoples and the Governments of the Dominions, pointing out to them how they could most usefully and most efficiently take their share in the naval burden of the Empire. I thought that appeal was very wisely expressed, and with the thoughts at the bottom of it I am in hearty concurrence, because I believe that if we fail to organise an intelligent co-operation between ourselves and the Dominions in this matter we and they will also fail to have the power to work out our own national development without the interference of the foreigner. I believe that the whole future of the independent national development of the Empire depends upon the success of the organisation of co-operation in naval matters between the Dominions of the Empire and the Mother Country. What the First Lord of the Admiralty said to the Dominions was this&#x2014;
<quote>"If you will take the outer guard of the Empire on your shoulders, we will be responsible for the inner guard."</quote>
My point to-day is that the Mediterranean is part of the inner guard and not of the outer guard. In the Mediterranean the Dominions cannot help us except in the same way that the people of New Zealand helped us by putting their ship at the sole authority of the Admiralty in peace or war. That is the only form in which the Dominions can help us in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00787">So far, my Lords, I have endeavoured to express the anxiety we feel on this side of the House about the position as we understand it. It is for the Government and the Admiralty as the advisers of the Government, if they admit the accuracy of the diagnosis, to bear the responsibility for the remedy. To-night I would only state briefly the conclusions to which I am forced. The first is that the garrisons of Malta and Gibraltar ought again to be increased. I do not speak of Egypt, because I have not that knowledge of Egypt which I have about Malta and
<col>308</col>
Gibraltar, and because I know that the Prime Minister himself has recently had the advantage of communication with Lord Kitchener. But trading on the experience and the knowledge which I had at the Admiralty, I do appeal to the Government not to leave the garrisons of Malta and Gibraltar as low as they are now. But there is something more important than that. Behind there is a dilemma from which I can see no escape. Either it is necessary to withdraw the squadron of battleships from the Mediterranean or it is unnecessary. If it is not necessary to withdraw that squadron, then that squadron ought not to be withdrawn; it would be indefensible to withdraw that squadron if it is not necessary so to withdraw it. If it is necessary to withdraw it, then I say that we are one whole squadron of modern battleships short of what the requirements of the Empire demand. I can see no escape from that dilemma&#x2014;none. If that squadron must be withdrawn, then we are short of ships and men. The situation is exposed to the whole world, and our duty is to replace that squadron at the earliest possible moment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00788">On the assumption that the withdrawal is necessary, then, my Lords, I plead most earnestly with His Majesty's Government for a national policy of replacement, of the enrolment of men, of the building of battleships once more to establish that position in the Mediterranean which we ought never for one single day to have lost. If you regard the Mediterranean, as I put it to you, as part of the inner guard of the Empire, if you estimate our interests in the Mediterranean in peace as in war as I have endeavoured to estimate them, then so long as this Empire exists and we are a great Power we ought never to be unrepresented in the Mediterranean by a squadron of modern battleships. I do not speak only for myself. I can say without hesitation that this is the view of the whole of the Party to which I have the honour to belong. Immense and intense as are our differences with you on the subject of domestic policy, if you will make that your national naval policy we will give you our whole-hearted and ungrudging support.</p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00790"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I ought to apologise for intervening at once in this debate, but I think it is better to do so in order to make clear to the noble Earl and to the House what are the limitations under which we are for the moment compelled to conduct it. We should have preferred, if possible, that the debate on this subject should have been postponed until the time, which I hope will not be a distant one, when we are in a position to describe our policy on the points to which the noble Earl has alluded more fully, and at the same time in the House of Commons and here. I gather, however, that I shall not be disappointing the noble Earl if on this occasion I do not make any definite declaration of policy. I desire to assure the House that that is not because we desire to conceal our views in any degree, but because the exigencies and course of business in another place render it impossible for us to make an immediate announcement of the various facts and matters which we have been engaged in considering. But, as I say, I hope that will not be long postponed. I entirely appreciate the desire which the noble Earl has expressed in no way to embarrass the Government in a matter which is as far removed from Party politics as any subject can be, and I thank him for the uniform discretion which he exercised in the course of his speech in travelling sometimes over very thin ice indeed.<lb/>
I think it is desirable to point out that, vast as the importance of the questions raised by the noble Earl is, yet in one sense their discussion is not momentarily urgent, because as far as our existing position in any part of the world is concerned we are not afraid to declare that we consider that the security of the country is achieved. Of course there is a perpetual difference between ourselves and those in and out of the House who believe that this country is at any time subject to a sudden invasion in force; but I leave that topic aside, because not only is it not concerned with the particular matter raised by the noble Earl, but if those who hold that view are right no additions, however liberal, which we could possibly make to the Fleet would be a safeguard against that danger. Those who believe in that danger have a military remedy, and therefore the particular question does not fall within our purview to-day.<lb/>
<col>310</col>
I would say a word first, in speaking of this question of our present security, upon the one point of detail which the noble Earl mentioned&#x2014;namely, that with regard to the manning of the Fleet. He will remember that in making his statement on the Estimates my right hon. friend the First Lord laid special emphasis on this point. He announced that, in view of the exertions to increase their <i>personnel</i> which some rival navies had been making, he proposed an average addition of 2,000 men, which, if I remember right, enabled him to work up to 3,000, and he expressed his intention to make the fullest demand which necessity could require upon the House of Commons for an addition to the number of men. On this question of our present security, our security, that is to say, for the next two years, I will mention one or two facts. It has become the habit to describe the relative strength of the different naval Powers of the world exclusively in terms of great battleships, which, although they are perpetually advancing in size and in power, are still called after the first of their type and generally though loosely styled Dreadnoughts. But we have to remember that for the period of the next two years we can look to our pre-Dreadnought ships&#x2014;such battleships as the Formidables, the King Edwards, and the two Lord Nelsons which almost approach the Dreadnought type&#x2014;as being battleships which are not equalled in the navies of any part of the world except by the few of the latest type afloat. Then when we come for a moment to the Dreadnought type, taking March 31 of this year and the next, that being the agreed date which is taken for the purposes of comparison in most of the publications on the subject, we find, taking all Europe in the one column and ourselves in the other, that this year, 1912, we have sixteen battleships and battle cruisers of the Dreadnought type as against fifteen possessed by all the other Powers in European waters. For purposes of this comparison I am leaving out the United States and all the other Powers which have ships not in European waters. Next year, taking the same basis of comparison, we shall have twenty-four ships of this type as against twenty-one possessed by all the other naval Powers in Europe. Those numbers it is also important to mention represent a distinct margin over the two-Power standard by which in the past we have been used to count. In these calcula-
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0160"/>
<col>311</col>
tions I am leaving out the Australian and New Zealand ships, although I could not pass by without agreement the acknowledgment which the noble Earl opposite expressed to the Dominion of New Zealand for the manner in which she placed her battleship at the disposal of the Admiralty.<lb/>
It has been a somewhat common lament that the Dreadnought type of battleship was ever invented or built, on the ground that although when those ships were first on the sea they gave us an almost unprecedented paramouncy in naval strength, yet as time goes on and other Powers build similar ships we become relatively in a weaker position than we should have been in if that type had never been invented. That may be so, although I think there is a good deal to be said on both sides; but in any case it was, I think, clear that the invention of the turbine engine, the various improvements in the manufacture of steel, and many other causes made the construction of ships of that type practically unavoidable. The word "inevitable" has sometimes a rather unhappy significance. History points to a number of inevitable wars, of inevitable, partitions, of inevitable combinations of States in which in some instances the term has merely served either to gloss over unsuccessful diplomacy or to mask sinister ambitions of aggression or of acquisition. But when you come to changes which are due to the march of science I think it is reasonable and fair to use the word. Such changes as have taken place due to the making of the great ship canals of the world; such changes in warfare as may take place owing to the intervention of flying machines, and I venture also to think those changes which have taken place in conditions of warfare and in the <i>status</i> of different nations owing to the changes in the type of battleship&#x2014;those may all properly be described as unavoidable changes. Therefore if I thought more hardly than I do of the existence of the Dreadnought type I should not venture to throw blame upon any Board of Admiralty for having been the first to initiate it in this country.<lb/>
That is the present position, and it explains why, looking at the matter as a whole and apart for the moment from the particular question of the distribution of
<col>312</col>
the Fleet, on which the noble Earl has dwelt, this question is not an immediately urgent one. But when we come to the immediate future, to such years as 1914 and 1915, the figures tell us a somewhat different story, and may compel us, if not to revise our old beliefs, at any rate to revise some of the old formulas upon which we have been in the habit of relying. The undisputed predominance which we now possess in ships of the pre-Dreadnought era will diminish as those ships grow older and in the battleships and battle cruisers of the Dreadnought type the figures will cease to be the favourable figures which I have read out for this year and the next. In the year 1914 the British Empire will possess thirty Dreadnoughts against thirty-nine of that type possessed by the other Powers in Europe.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00791"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: Does that include the Australian ships or not?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00792"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQEESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I was again omitting those ships. In 1915 the British figure will be thirty-six, and for the rest of Europe fifty-one. As the noble Earl has pointed out, on those figures the two-Power standard becomes something of an unmeaning term. The two-Power standard was founded on the fact that there were at one time no more than two naval Powers whose combination we might possibly have to meet. It becomes evident from these figures that, without inventing what may be called in practice impossible combinations of Powers, you may conceivably find yourselves confronted with a combination which to meet at any particular point, or rather to meet at all points, might require the possession of a three-Power or of a four-Power standard, <i>plus</i> a margin. All the ships I have spoken of are being built of the same terrific type as the modern battleships and battle cruisers invariably are, and it is on that fact, of course, that the new conditions hinge. I am again confining myself to ships of the Dreadnought type in European waters, and not saying anything of the United States or of the South American States, some of which are also building them.<lb/>
Now in view of these figures and of this assured future there are, it appears, three schools of thought upon whose beliefs the British policy might be framed. The
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0161"/>
<col>313</col>
first school in its most extreme form would say that at whatever cost we must maintain, and maintain everywhere, the same predominance which we have possessed in the past, and maintain it for immediate purposes. The second school of thought, taking a precisely opposite view, would argue that times have so completely changed that it is necessary for us to engage in definite military and naval agreements whereby particular areas may be, so to speak, guarded and policed by friendly Powers. The third school, taking a less extreme view than either, would trust to the almost certain outcome of any dispute which is likely to occur in Europe to provide us with support either for the complete safeguarding of our interests in a particular area, or at any rate for support sufficient to make up a deficiency in which we may find ourselves in a particular locality or sea.<lb/>
There are no subjects like foreign policy and questions of Imperial defence for fulfilling the unhappy condition in which one finds oneself with various courses, three or more, open, to all of which not inconsiderable objections may be taken; and the disciples of these three schools&#x2014;I think it cannot be denied&#x2014;lay themselves open to criticism and to objection. Those who contend that it is necessary for this country to maintain naval predominance everywhere are necessarily confronted with the question of cost&#x2014;a cost which may be almost by common agreement prohibitive, and cost of a kind which no Government would venture to suggest to the people of this country, if that predominance is to be carried out everywhere and to the fullest extent. The second school, those who are for alliances, have to encounter the whole weight of criticism which is directed against them for desiring to depart front the almost immemorial tradition of this country of not allying ourselves with any great European Power, a criticism which draws attention to the fact that if you undertake alliances with European Powers you can only do so by engaging in reciprocal obligations which may be of an onerous and dangerous kind. The third school, those who rely upon what is actually going to happen if unhappily a European war should occur&#x2014;namely, that the almost certain outcome would be that it would be somebody's interest to assist or support us or take our place as a combatant&#x2014;run the obvious risk of being
<col>314</col>
told that they are relying far too much on chance, and are liable to be told that they are distorting the theory, mentioned by the noble Earl at the beginning of his speech, which was first prominently insisted upon by Admiral Mahan&#x2014;namely, that the sea is all one and you cannot fix boundary lines to different oceans: that the different seas, whatever their colour, whether they be Red, or Black, or Yellow, or White, are still all parts of the same sea, and that if you have the command of the sea where-ever the enemy are, you have it everywhere. The partisans of this particular school will be told that they are distorting that theory for this reason, that they are assuming, not only that they will obtain the command of the sea, but that they will obtain it almost at once, and that they are forgetting that an interval may occur during which they are delayed or prevented from obtaining full command of the sea in the theatre of war which they choose to be the decisive one. During such an interval they may sustain almost irretrievable losses in some other parts of the world, even though, at some future time, they may be able to establish naval predominance in those also.<lb/>
Those different schools appear to me to exhaust all possibilities of the coming state of things, if noble Lords will be so good as to apply those different theories to the particular subject which the noble Earl has brought up&#x2014;namely, the Mediterranean. I told the House that I should not be able to make any further declaration of naval policy or distribution beyond that which has been made already, and, therefore, I will just venture to repeat to the House what the First Lord of the Admiralty said on March 18 with regard to this particular question of the Mediterranean. He pointed out, in the first place, that the Atlantic Fleet would for the future be based on Home ports instead of on Gibraltar, and that it would become the Third Battle Squadron, and would cease, therefore, to possess that share of interest in the Mediterranean which, when it was the Atlantic Squadron, it possessed. The Fourth Battle Squadron, Mr. Churchill went on, will be formed of the battleships now stationed in the Mediterranean, which will step into the place of the Atlantic Fleet and be based on Gibraltar instead of Malta. He added&#x2014;
<quote>"This Battle Squadron will also be raised ultimately, and if necessary, to a strength of eight
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0162"/>
<col>315</col>
ships from six at which it stands at present. This Fourth Battle Squadron will, from its strategic position at Gibraltar, be able to give either immediate assistance in Home waters or to operate in the Mediterranean should naval combinations in that sea render its presence necessary or useful. Its movements will be regulated by the main situation."</quote>
That is how the matter stands at this moment, and it is for the House to consider whether, in view of my right hon. friend's statement, it is proper to speak of the Mediterranean as having been evacuated. I think there is, if I may say so, a certain danger in taking a particular date, such as the noble Earl did in taking the date 1904, and making comparisons with the present date upon that basis. However, I pass that by, because I am not able to tell the House all our precise future arrangements in regard to the Mediterranean.<lb/>
But I can assure the House that the importance of our general position in the Mediterranean and our needs and obligations there by no means escape us. The noble Earl said he would not give any figures to enforce that fact. It is not necessary, of course, to pile up figures to show that our trade from and through the Mediterranean is an enormously important one. My impression is that it is estimated that our trade, taking, of course, trade both ways&#x2014;exports and imports&#x2014;with the Mediterranean Powers, trade which is actually due to their Mediterranean position, is somewhere about &#x00A3;125,000,000 a year, and it is also, I believe, estimated that that part of the trade from beyond which comes through the Mediterranean&#x2014;trade from India and from the Far East&#x2014;amounts to something like &#x00A3;200,000,000 sterling more. And it must be remembered that this trade includes a substantial portion of the wheat which comes to this country, that it includes practically all the jute&#x2014;I should think indeed all the jute&#x2014;practically all the tin, and probably all, or nearly all, the rice. That being so, we are not likely to under-estimate the importance of safeguarding our Mediterranean trade.<lb/>
Then there is the further point on which the noble Earl dwelt and upon which I have no dispute with him at all&#x2014;namely, the point of what he rather reluctantly described as prestige, because he knows that that word has, in some
<col>316</col>
connections, an unpopular sound, but which might be described as our moral credit which, in Europe and in our own possessions in the East and in other countries beyond the Mediterranean, may be held to be deeply involved by our policy there. At the same time, it is, I think, only fair to remind the noble Earl that for many years past, when the whole European political situation was an altogether different one from that which it is at present, and when European combinations and dangers to us in Europe were conceived to be of an entirely different kind, that, even in those days, it used to be a frequent subject of discussion whether in certain circumstances of war it might not be our wisest course to evacuate altogether the Mediterranean for the time being. I do not say that in order to, give the noble Earl or the House the impression that that evacuation is the course which I or which His Majesty's Government favour, but it is, I think, useful to mention the fact, which I think would be generally agreed as having existed, in order to point out that the whole subject of our position in the Mediterranean has been one which has been under discussion for fifty, or, for all I know, for a hundred years, and that varying opinions have been held upon it.<lb/>
If the House will forgive me, I do not propose to touch in any way upon the points of great moment, I fully admit, which the noble Earl mentioned in relation to the military garrisons at Gibraltar and at Malta, or of that portion of the British Army which is now in Egypt; but I can assure him that these are points which we have been most carefully considering in relation to the whole subject, and that we fully recognise their bearing upon the entire problem which the noble Earl has dealt with. I have, in fact, no more to add under the limitations which I have, as I have explained, imposed on myself. I merely desire to repeat that we fully recognise the duty which rests upon us of giving, at the earliest possible moment, to the country and to Parliament the result of the inquiries, the investigations, and the consideration which we have been able to give to this subject of the Mediterranean.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00793"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I find very little comfort in the speech of the noble Marquess. The withdrawal of
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0163"/>
<col>317</col>
our Fleet from the Mediterranean while a war is in progress on its coasts has attracted a certain amount of attention and has been much criticised. I do not blame the Admiralty for this withdrawal. Under present conditions it would have been inevitable at the commencement of a war, and I think it wise strategy to concentrate in time considering the smallness of the naval forces at our disposal. Unfortunately it has become necessary to admit in the face of Europe that we shall be unable to keep the Suez Canal open in war time to our trade and all that that implies without the assistance of an ally. When we abandoned the Mediterranean in 1796 there was no Suez Canal at the other end of it. On that canal we are now dependent for Australian beef and New Zealand mutton, to say nothing of grain from India and the East. In 1910 over 2,500 British ships passed through the Suez Canal of a gross tonnage of 14,000,000. Nor can we expect to get grain from the Black Sea if the Mediterranean is closed to us.<lb/>
I think that our Chambers of Commerce might endeavour to bring home to the people the real effect of the abandonment of the Mediterranean, and I would suggest that their members should read over the evidence given before the Royal Commission on Food Supply seven years ago and take note as to how far the naval situation has been altered since then. I say the evidence, because I consider it more valuable than the Report, to which nearly all the members of the Commission made reservations. Two combined Fleets of different nations have, when acting together, never been as efficient as a single Fleet of the same numerical strength. Last year we were in imminent danger of immediate war. From our withdrawal from the Mediterranean and the further increase of German armaments I gather that the war clouds have not yet passed away. In case of a sudden outbreak it is infinitely better that the French and the British Fleets should act at a distance from one another, and that the British concentration in the Channel should be accompanied by a French concentration in the Mediterranean. At present the danger of acting together would be very great, as the battleships of one Fleet would run a great risk of being sunk by the torpedoes of the other. Not only would there be a loss of ships, but mutual
<col>318</col>
recriminations might break up the alliance. The difference in language, signals, and signal books would be insurmountable unless the two Fleets had previously practised man&#x0153;uvres together in time of peace. Think how quickly a naval officer must make up his mind as to whether to open fire or not. It is a question of seconds of time. M. Lanessan, a former Minister of Marine, in a recent article in the <i>Action</i>, talks of the necessity of the French Fleet being stationed in the Western Mediterranean so as to protect France against attacks made by the Triple Alliance, and deplores the departure of the French battleships from the Channel and Atlantic coasts as much as we deplore the abandonment of the Mediterranean.<lb/>
Mr. Churchill said in the House of Commons that in the Mediterranean we had at present no battleships and only seven cruisers, ten destroyers, six torpedo boats, and five submarines. I hope that in the presence of this withdrawal from the Mediterranean no one will continue to assert that we have the command of the sea. We had it in 1906; we have lost it now&#x2014;not by defeat, nor by the mismanagement of the money voted for the Navy, but by not spending money enough to keep us sufficiently ahead of Germany. Still, that command has not yet passed definitely into the hands of another Power. At present the command of the sea is in dispute, and in the case of war will have to be settled by the ordeal of battle. Unfortunately too many writers and speakers always assume that it will continue to be ours, especially in their discussions on the various Eastern questions. I would ask those who think that we still have the command of the sea if they think that our shipowners would dare to send their ships across the North Sea or to the Baltic at the commencement of a war with Germany. Would they run the risk of sending their ships through the Mediterranean if we were at war or in danger of war with a naval Power on that sea? Have they thought of the possibilities, risks, and difficulties of getting coal if we had to substitute the Cape route for that of the Suez Canal? It is the first step in the abandonment of our position as a Great Power; yet in the present state of our Navy as compared with that of other European Powers I believe it to be correct strategy. What
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0164"/>
<col>319</col>
is the use of spending money on Uganda if we are unable to keep the road open to that Colony?<lb/>
Governments have never yet attempted to keep before the minds of the people the importance of our naval supremacy, and the present Government have with the utmost recklessness embarked in financial schemes which will make it almost impossible for the country to find the money necessary to maintain a sufficient Navy, yet they have received ample warning, both from Naval men and from competent civilian writers, of the danger they were incurring. In July, 1906, I told the First Lord of the Admiralty in this House that&#x2014;
<quote>"The slackening off of ship-building on our part will have the opposite effect to that looked for. It will cause other countries to strain every nerve to get level with us. Therefore I submit that these reductions do not increase the chances of maintaining peace."</quote>
And on April 17, 1907, I said&#x2014;
<quote>"I was in Germany last autumn. The comments of the Germans sounded like a p&#x00E6;an of victory. England was showing signs of giving up the struggle &#x2026; I ant afraid that for every &#x00A3;100,000 we have saved this year we may have to spend &#x00A3;1,000,000 afterwards."</quote>
This was an under-estimate on my part. And on March 18, 1908, I warned the Government that the German newspapers met the reduction of our Navy Estimates in 1906 with derisive shouts of enjoyment at the sight of England putting her "hands up" to Germany at the first sign of the commencement of the financial struggle for the command of the North Sea; and that the departure from the Cawdor Programme was the greatest mistake that a Government could make.<lb/>
I thought that the First Lord's speech when moving the Navy Estimates was an admirable exposition of the naval situation. He made, however, a still better speech at the Royal Academy Banquet. In some of the earlier paragraphs of that speech our naval position is described in language so accurate and terse that I cannot venture to improve upon it. These paragraphs give a faithful representation of the views of many seamen and civilians who have studied naval questions. And, as I cannot better the wording, I shall, with the permission of the House, repeat his words here before commenting on them, for I
<col>320</col>
do not think they can be published or printed too often in a country in which a statesman has to convince an electorate of the soundness of his policy before he can carry it out. The First Lord said&#x2014;
<quote>"At the Admiralty everything contributes and converges on one single object&#x2014;namely, the development of the maximum war power at a given moment and at a particular point. Upon that precise object are directed all the sciences our age can boast, all the wealth of our country, all the resources of our civilization, all the patience, study, devotion to duty and the sacrifice of personal interests which our naval officers and men supply; all the glories of our history in the past, everything is directed upon this one particular point and object&#x2014;namely, the manifestation at some special place in the compass of a few minutes of some shattering, blasting, overwhelming force."</quote>
To grasp the full meaning of this passage it is necessary to have read the accounts of the Battle of Tsushima, especially that written by Captain Semonoff. Imagine the state of England if we were suffered a defeat of that magnitude. The First Lord of the Admiralty then went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"Under the shelter of this manifestation we may agree or quarrel as we please. We may carry on our own Party polities in perfect security."</quote>
In fact, Mr. Churchill appears to agree with me in looking upon the political disputes of our different Parties as being of no more importance than the quarrelling of little children in a perambulator, who remain safe from material injury provided that their natural protector, which in this case is the British Navy, takes care that they are not run over by motor-cars driven by foreign chauffeurs.<lb/>
In a further passage the First Lord said&#x2014;
<quote>"The best way to make war impossible is to make victory certain."</quote>
These words should be hung up as a motto, not only at every public meeting called by Navy Leagues, but at every assembly of Quakers and of peace associations. So far so good. But we expect from a First Lord not only words but deeds; and when we come to see what the First Lord means to do, I can only conclude that he intends to allow himself to be hampered by some of his colleagues. He unfortunately concluded his speech by saying&#x2014;
<quote>"We see no difficulty in maintaining the main security of the country and in providing an effective margin for our security at all the decisive
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0165"/>
<col>321</col>
points without adding very greatly to the generous provisions which Parliament has made in the past year, and which it will doubtless renew in the years which are to come."</quote>
When I first read those words I looked again so as to be quite certain that it was the same person who had said them, as they appeared to me to be quite inconsistent with the previous utterances. We have a great deal of lost ground to pick up, and it will cost a large sum of money to restore us to that undoubted command of the sea which we held when the present Government came into power six years ago. At the present moment the command of the sea is in dispute, and in case of war will not be decided until after severe fighting, as to the results of which the fickle goddess "Fortune" may have something to say. At present the success of an enemy is not impossible.<lb/>
On June 26 the First Lord of the Admiralty stated that since 1908 Great Britain had launched nineteen armoured ships, and Germany had launched eighteen. It does not require much arithmetic to show that these figures do not constitute a two-Power or even a sixteen to ten standard, and that we have not ships enough "to make war impossible by making victory certain." Germany is to add about 15,000 men to her <i>personnel</i> during the next three years, while we are apparently intending to add only 3,000 to ours. There are two reasons why we require at least a two-Power standard "to make victory certain." The first reason is that only three-fourths of our ships can be counted upon as being always ready for an emergency, as under normal circumstances they spend an average of three months in dockyard hands. This is shown in detail in a Return which I moved for in 1909. Now, an enemy with a vastly superior military force would not require to have the use of the sea for more than four or five days, and could easily arrange to have all his ships ready on any one day, the exact day being a State secret. We therefore require to have at least four ships to an enemy's three on our coasts if we wish to be always able to meet him on terms of equality. As victory ought to be certain, it would be safer to have five than three. Had the Russian Baltic Fleet been able to reach the Eastern seas before Port Arthur had fallen, or before the Japanese had had time to refit, that battle might have
<col>322</col>
had a different result. The Japanese lost very few men at Tsushima; that victory was bought with the blood of her army, who lost thousands of men in repeated assaults on Port Arthur&#x2014;a sacrifice demanded by a Fleet that wanted time to refit before meeting a second enemy. Now, nineteen to eighteen does not allow a sufficient margin for vessels refitting during war.<lb/>
The second reason why we require a two-Power standard in men as well as in ships is that many vessels must be detached to protect our commerce. There are also other classes of vessels to be considered besides battleships. We require commerce protectors, and it may be that the victory may be won by the side that has the best system of mine-laying and mine-sweeping or aviation. The recent proceedings at the Dardanelles are a useful object lesson. The Turks laid down mines in a panic without taking proper precautions, and for a whole month they were unable to send either their own or neutral ships through those Straits. It is to be hoped that we have better mine-laying and mine-sweeping systems than those in use in the Dardanelles. Innumerable accidents may happen, and we have at present no margin to draw upon. Had the result of Trafalgar been reversed Villeneuve, with his damaged Fleet, would have had to fight at least two more successful battles before he could have appeared off Boulogne, but under present circumstances our first defeat at sea would be our destruction.<lb/>
I gather from his recent speeches that Mr. Churchill is thoroughly aware of the importance of the points to which I have referred. He has evidently assimilated the teaching of the naval officers with whom he has come into contact; but I am afraid that he has been hampered by other members of the Cabinet&#x2014;by men who have seldom looked at a globe, and whose geographical studies since they left school have been limited to an examination of the boundaries of constituencies. Even if we escape total defeat we shall have to endure great suffering from loss of commerce and food supply. I warn Mr. Churchill's opponents in the Cabinet that their lives will not be safe in face of a starving and infuriated population; that the men responsible for defeat, if they escape being impeached for high
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0166"/>
<col>323</col>
treason, are very likely to be lynched, and even if they succeed in leaving this country they will have the finger of scorn pointed at them to the end of their days. Though it may sound strange, I think I may venture to say that I was present at the rocking of the cradle of the German Navy. For fifty years ago, when serving in the "Highflyer," and later on when serving in the "Shannon," I was a messmate and on friendly terms with two German military officers, who after several years' service in the Prussian Army had been sent to serve on board our ships of war to learn seamanship and naval discipline. One of them was Count Waldersee, a relative of the late Field-Marshal. Both of them were zealous students, and I admire the persistency of a nation which, from so small a beginning and within the limits of a lifetime has been able to bring into existence a Navy strong enough to imperil the existence of Great Britain. At the same time, I think that it would have acted more wisely if it had been satisfied with a Navy of one-third of its present strength and had left the cost of the remaining two-thirds to fructify in the pockets of its people.<lb/>
In this century there is a financial strategy as well as a military strategy, and I should think it good financial strategy to expend the whole of our surplus of &#x00A3;6,500,000, not on ship-building only, but in increasing the number of our seamen. Then we may be able to reoccupy the Mediterranean. Strategy of that description would show Germany that her endeavour to make a Navy strong enough to destroy our food supply and thereby reduce us to the position of a vassal state is not likely to be successful. Then, again, I look upon it as legitimate finance to build the docks at Rosyth by means of money borrowed on terminable annuities, with about twenty years to run. After twenty years of existence a modern man-of-war is of little value, but the docks that I recollect in 1854 are still in use. Those that held the line-of-battle ships of that day have been lengthened and are now used for torpedo boats and for what are now considered to be small ships. A third method of raising the money necessary to hold the Mediterranean would be to expend on the Navy the money that is to be spent on that "rare and refreshing fruit" which is to be sold at the rate of 9<i>d.</i> for 4<i>d.</i> Let the Navy have the 5<i>d.</i>;
<col>324</col>
let the 4<i>d.</i> remain in the pockets of the poor. If we are defeated at sea there will be no money available either for old age pensions or for insurance, as it will be wanted for the enemy's indemnity. I think it improbable that if we are once struck down we shall be ever allowed to get up again. Parts of Essex and Kent, including the North of the Thames, Dover, Folkestone, and the Isle of Thanet will be made into an Alsace-Lorraine so as to reduce Great Britain to the permanent position of a vassal state.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00794"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I doubt whether the noble Earl who initiated this debate will have had his anxiety allayed by the reply of the noble Marquess who leads the House. The noble Marquess seemed to think he had made a point when he said that in time of war it might be necessary to evacuate the Mediterranean. I do not suppose that anyone would dispute that for a second. The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, carefully stated that he was considering the position as it is in time of peace, and he added that it was just as essential in time of peace that our naval strength should be maintained in the Mediterranean as it might or might not be in time of war. The whole <i>crux</i> of the question is whether the Fourth Battle Squadron should have for its base Malta or Gibraltar. The Admiralty have decided that it shall be Gibraltar. In itself, if it were merely a question of the disposition of the squadron, no objection could be raised if the naval authorities or the Committee of Imperial Defence thought it necessary that the squadron should be moved to Gibraltar in place of Malta; but the fact of giving publicity to this intention shows that they really regard the abandonment of Malta as a strategic point. Otherwise it would have been perfectly unnecessary to make any statement on the matter.<lb/>
There can be no doubt that this action will be greatly to lower our prestige. In his description of the three schools of thought as to what our naval strategy should be the noble Marquess implied rather that the second school of thought found favour with His Majesty's Government, and apparently the noble Lord who has just spoken approved of that policy. I confess I am one of those who view with great misgiving this desire to support ourselves and look for protection on a series of indeterminate alliances. We all
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0167"/>
<col>325</col>
favour <i>ententes</i> with foreign countries, but alliances, which so far as I know have no direct or immediate limits, seem to me full of danger and may bring us into serious entanglements. Therefore it was with great apprehension that I listened to the statement of the noble Marquess.<lb/>
As regards the general question of our trade passing through the Mediterranean, the noble Earl who raised the question pointed to the various possibilities of raids being made on Malta, but I do not think he mentioned the Suez Canal. That is a point where it is most vital and essential to afford naval protection. For whilst the noble Earl described carefully the various trade routes affected&#x2014;East Africa, Australasia, the Far East, India, the Persian Gulf, and so on&#x2014;it must be remembered that there are 1,300 miles of Red Sea down which all this vast trade is concentrated, and also that trade route of 3,000 miles from Suez to Bombay, which is only protected by the East India Squadron, which has a further range as far as Singapore in the East. The result is that for months together the important port of Aden is often without a single ship of war. Before the Tripoli War broke out there was a time when there were seven Italian men-of-war concentrating at Aden Harbour, but not a single vessel flying the White Ensign. But apart from that, the returns at any time show that a far greater number of foreign warships go up and down the Red Sea or pass through by Suez than of His Majesty's ships. I am not wishing to argue that the East India Squadron should be increased. But if you have a weak and attenuated squadron in those waters, it is all the more essential to maintain our strength in the Mediterranean. It is dangerous indeed if you are going to withdraw the headquarters of the squadron from Malta to Gibraltar.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, gave us a very eloquent passage regarding the value of our prestige in the Mediterranean, and how far its influence made itself felt towards the East. I fully endorse those remarks of the noble Earl. I feel that our prestige there has very gravely fallen during the last few months. At the present time we do not give that protection to our commerce in the Mediterranean which France is able to give to hers; and when it is realised that our parlous condition there is due to weakness the effect upon our prestige will be much greater.</membercontribution></p>
<col>326</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00795"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF BRISTOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this question of our naval position in the Mediterranean seems to me to divide itself into two parts. The first is one of high policy&#x2014;namely, as to how our Fleets should be distributed; the second is how any alteration in the present distribution will affect the safety of our interests as we have known them in the Mediterranean of late years. As to the first, why is it considered necessary to make any vital change? I take it that our present relations with France and the recent naval activity of our German neighbours are primarily responsible for the shifting of the centre of naval activity from the Mediterranean to the North Sea. But granting that there is some reason to increase our power in the North Sea, why should that be a reason for withdrawing all our battleships from the Mediterranean? What is the reason for this step? If there is a good reason why cannot it be given? And if there is no reason, why in the name of fortune do you not leave in the Mediterranean that squadron which has been our protection there for years?<lb/>
I think the answer to that question is that those responsible for our safety think that, desirable as it may be for us to have a strong squadron in the Mediterranean, yet with things as they are in our political relations with certain countries it is even more desirable that we should have a certain strength in the North Sea. To secure that strength in that neighbourhood our Fleet is, I suppose&#x2014;that we have not had from the noble Marquess in his reply&#x2014;in their opinion insufficient without denuding the Mediterranean of the Mediterranean battleships. The question, therefore, hangs upon whether we have enough ships, not only to safeguard ourselves in the North Sea but also to keep a good strong Mediterranean Squadron. With every ship that has been added of recent years and every ship that is going to be added under the new Navy Law by our German neighbours to their Navy, the position is made increasingly difficult. It seems that, even with our present friendly relations, the Government believe that they require the whole of our strength available for the North Sea. What then would happen if, instead of one country only being our enemy, we were faced with a combination of that country and a European Mediterranean Power? In short, the Fleet
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0168"/>
<col>327</col>
is not up to that standard, either in ships or in men, which would be necessary to preserve safety in both of the areas I have mentioned. I am quite sure of this, that I have the whole of the Navy behind me when I say that it is in men principally that we are deficient at the present moment, and that it would be perfectly useless for you to go on building big ships unless you immediately enter a very large number of extra men so that they may be efficiently trained for these ships when you have built them. I feel that I am somewhat at a disadvantage in discussing this question, because as a retired naval officer I have not at my disposal any information as to what the plan of battle would be in the event of an outbreak of hostilities. I assume that the plan would be to concentrate the Fleet in the first instance somewhere to the west of Gibraltar. If after hostilities had begun we found that we had an enemy with a Mediterranean base, then I take it the Malta base which you are so lightheartedly abandoning now would become of immense value.<lb/>
I now come to my second consideration as to how the safety of our interests will be affected by the withdrawal of our battleships from the Mediterranean. As we stand at present, I believe that the whole of the battleships have gone from the Mediterranean. But if I read aright the answer given by the First Lord of the Admiralty in another place, he said that this matter had not been finally determined, but that the ships had gone in a perfectly legitimate way&#x2014;the way in which they had for years past been temporarily withdrawn from the Mediterranean to join up with the other Fleets for man&#x0153;uvres. I certainly find no fault with that, if that is so. It is right and proper that our Mediterranean Fleet in conjunction with the other Fleets should carry out man&#x0153;uvres. I was under the impression that the First Lord had said that no action would be taken which would prejudice the return of the battleships to the Mediterranean after the man&#x0153;uvres until a debate had been held and the question threshed out. But I understand the reserves of ammunition, of guns and mountings and warlike stores generally, have been transferred from the Malta base to Gibraltar in contemplation of the carrying out of the scheme of redistribution foreshadowed by the First
<col>328</col>
Lord of the Admiralty. That is a very serious matter.<lb/>
In the course of this debate it has been pointed out that the ships of the Third Battle Squadron would, after this redistribution, be based upon some English port, but the ships of the Mediterranean Squadron would be based upon Gibraltar. I wish to point out what that really means. Whereas before, in case the real centre of the fighting was in the Mediterranean, you had two squadrons based on Gibraltar and Malta, you will now have only one squadron, and that probably a denuded squadron, based on Gibraltar alone. I have not been serving afloat for some time, so that I am not in touch with the latest development of these matters, but I knew something about the reserves and the building up of the reserves in Malta and Gibraltar. In the old days we used to store two-thirds of the reserves of gun mountings, stores, and ammunition at Malta and one-third at Gibraltar for the Mediterranean Fleet alone, and there was great difficulty at Gibraltar to find space in which to place that one-third. You are not allowed to put more than a certain amount of powder in one magazine, and the magazines have to be at a certain distance apart. There is very little available space for this at Gibraltar, and yet you are trying now to put a great deal more at Gibraltar than was ever placed there before. I do not believe you will be able to store at Gibraltar the reserves that will be necessary even for the Mediterranean Fleet alone, and much less for that Fleet and another Fleet in case of any necessary reinforcement of the Mediterranean Fleet. Then by your rearrangement you have what was the Atlantic Squadron but which is now the Third Battle Squadron, based in England. That means that if it was necessary in time of stress to get the stores for a reinforcing Fleet out to the Mediterranean again the whole of the stuff would be on the seas and open to the attack of the enemy. I call that a serious matter. For every ship you have to have special reserves according to the special armament and the special things that each ship ought to have, and they are also carefully arranged as to numbers so that the reserves for the same class of stores will give the right numbers when divided out amongst all the ships carrying that class of
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0169"/>
<col>329</col>
stores. It may be sometimes that ships arrive on the station requiring special reserves, in which case the reserves that they have out there are not suitable and have to be replaced by others. I remember that when I was out there as gunnery-lieutenant in the "Victoria" there was a ship called the "Australia" there. We went very carefully into the question of her reserves; she had a special type of mounting for a 9.2-inch gun. After I had left the Mediterranean I received a letter to this effect&#x2014;
<quote>"You will be glad to hear that the mounting for which we have been agitating for the past three years for the Australia' has just arrived on the station."</quote>
And the writer added&#x2014;
<quote>"As you know, the 'Australia' has just left for America."</quote>
If that delay is going to take place in time of peace, what is likely to happen in time of war when a whole new Fleet may suddenly be ordered into the Mediterranean? I submit that the Admiralty ought to be ready in peace time in the Mediterranean with the reserves for the ships they intend to use in the Mediterranean.<lb/>
There is another point on which I desire to say a word or two, and that is with reference to the training of the officers and men. Gathered round the coast of England as they are at the present moment, they do not learn anything in comparison with what they ought to learn. They can only be efficiently trained by going abroad. Many officers seldom go in the smaller ships. There are big ship officers and small ship officers. You want various places abroad where you can train your officers and men and train them well in all their varying duties. They will not get that training by being kept concentrated together practically entirely off the coast of England. That is one reason, and I believe a vital one, for keeping a Fleet in the Mediterranean. We rightly place a great deal of reliance on our Intelligence Department, and we know how carefully they tabulate the coming and going of every ship, but that does not make up for the certainty that comes of having a Fleet on the spot when a crisis occurs. I will tell your Lordships a little story to illustrate my meaning. At the time of Fashoda, when, as we know, things were pretty strained, I was in command of a small ship in the Mediterranean, and just at the very height of that critical time I was sent from Malta to Genoa. I had started off
<col>330</col>
in the early part of the afternoon, and just towards sunset, when I was off the south coast of Sicily, I saw a fleet of ships steaming eastward along the coast well out to sea. I put on all steam and made towards it to try and find out what it consisted of. As far as the Intelligence Department was concerned we had no notice that any fleet was in that neighbourhood. I steamed towards it and found it was a fleet of twelve battleships steaming due east. Having found this out, I made for the nearest port and telegraphed to the Admiral at Malta. The Admiral telegraphed to Lord Cromer, to the Foreign Office and to the Admiralty, to say he knew nothing about this squadron, and he asked what it was; did they know anything about it? Of course they very soon did know, but they had not got the information beforehand. This story shows how desirable it is to have a Fleet on the spot with steam up to be ready for perhaps the unexpected.<lb/>
Then I want to know something as to the Government's real intentions. Do the Government really believe that what they are doing, apart from the question of trying to get out of building ships and increasing the men to the required number, is for the safety of the Empire? Quite recently there has been a change of Admirals in the Mediterranean. The late Commander-in-Chief was a full Admiral with a very large command under him. He has been succeeded by another full Admiral, but all the battleships have been withdrawn, and all that the present Commander-in-Chief has is an attenuated command fit only for a Rear-Admiral. What is the meaning of that? Do you mean to send the ships back into the Mediterranean or not? Are we in future to see a full Admiral steaming out of Malta with his flag at the main with two or three small cruisers? And that to show the flag in the Mediterranean&#x0021; That is not the way to run the British Navy, and I am sure the British Navy will not appreciate a full Admiral being in command of such a squadron as that. Neither is it the way to maintain our prestige. Foreigners will understand the meaning of it mighty quickly. In conclusion, I would like to quote that well-known saying of Nelson's, that "there is no better negotiator for peace than a squadron of line-of-battleships." Is that the Government policy? If it is not the Government policy, I am quite sure it is the policy of the nation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00796"><member>EARL BRASSEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture briefly to address your Lordships on the important subject fittingly introduced by Lord Selborne. His services to the Navy will always be remembered. I desire to associate myself in the fullest sense with the noble Earl in his observations on general policy. Strong at sea we should be friendly with other Powers, and depend on none. Our fellow-subjects across the sea are the only allies we need. We appreciate their loyal desire to help the Motherland. It is agreed on all sides that we cannot abandon the Mediterranean. We have an extensive trade. It is the highway to the Suez Canal.<lb/>
It is possible to regard too seriously the changes proposed as affecting the protection of British interests in an emergency. The battleships which will be linked up with the Home Fleet as a Fourth Squadron will be based on Gibraltar. Fast battleships can steam from Gibraltar to Malta in less than three days. It is not necessary to cut down our force in the Mediterranean in order to bring up our Fleet in home waters to a sufficient standard of strength. There is a natural tendency at the Admiralty to over-estimate the forces which we may have to meet and to under-estimate our own resources. In the chapter on comparative strength in the last issue of the <i>Naval Annual</i> especial attention is given to the situation in Northern Europe as regards ships in commission. Our Home Fleet and the High-Sea Fleet are reviewed in detail. It is shown that the Fleets maintained by Great Britain in these waters are sufficient to meet any reasonable contingency. The comparison in the <i>Naval Annual</i> is limited to battleships. The cruisers should not be omitted. In all types, and especially the most powerful types, we have an overwhelming preponderance.<lb/>
In the class of armoured cruiser we have seven ships of recent date, of battleship dimensions, 15,000 to 14,000 tons, heavily armoured and armed, with a speed of 23 knots. The list includes the "Shannon" and six of the "Duke of Edinburgh" type. We have ten more armoured cruisers, chiefly of the "County" class, highly efficient as ocean cruisers. These armoured cruisers, built at an aggregate cost of &#x00A3;17,000,000, are comparable in fighting efficiency to pre-Dreadnought battleships and should not be excluded from com-
<col>332</col>
parisons of strength. The German North Sea Fleet has no ships to set against our armoured cruisers. It is not necessary to extend the comparison to the smaller vessels. In all classes we stand well. In conclusion, I am a supporter of the shipbuilding policy announced in Mr. Churchill's Glasgow speech. The laying down of ships is not resented in Germany. The discussions and comparisons are distasteful. If we steadily build the ships we require alarmists will be silenced and international relations will be improved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00797"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess at the outset of his remarks indicated to the House that in his view this discussion might well have been postponed for a time. I think he proceeded almost immediately to give us what seems to me a very good reason why the debate should not have been postponed. The noble Marquess told us&#x2014;I think I quote his words correctly&#x2014;that because certain matters were still under the consideration of his colleagues it was not possible for him to give the House any definite declaration of policy this evening. I infer from that that to some extent, at all events, this important question is still under consideration, and if that inference is one which I am justified in drawing I say it amply justifies my noble friend Lord Selborne in bringing the question before the House and the public, with the hope&#x2014;I trust the reasonable hope&#x2014;that the strong case which with all his expert knowledge he is able to lay before your Lordships will receive some attention from His Majesty's Government before their mind is finally made up.<lb/>
The rejoinder of the noble Marquess, if I may be permitted to say so, though full of interesting matter, did not so far as the greater part of his speech was concerned meet very sufficiently or fully the argument of my noble friend. The noble Marquess gave us a disquisition upon naval strategy; he indicated at some length the opinion of the three different schools amongst which naval strategists may be divided, and he gave us a synopsis of the present naval strength of this country. But I observed that he was very shy of coming to close quarters so far as the Mediterranean was concerned, and it was really not till he had spoken for a full half-hour by the clock that he even referred by name to the Mediterranean at all. The noble Marquess
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0171"/>
<col>333</col>
objected very much to the expression the "evacuation" of the Mediterranean. I do not know whether evacuation is precisely the word which I should have suggested, but I am very much afraid that, although the mind of His Majesty's Government is still open with regard to certain matters of detail, the policy of the First Lord of the Admiralty holds the field, and although I do not want to describe that policy as a policy of evacuation, it certainly seems to me to come uncommonly near it.<lb/>
My Lords, what are the facts? At this moment there are no battleships at all in the Mediterranean, and we are given to understand that if any are sent back they will be based on Gibraltar, and that duties and obligations will be assigned to them which will make it impossible for us to count them as really available for use in Mediterranean waters. That is, of course, a complete departure from our old policy. As the noble Lord who spoke just now told the House, we were used to a squadron based on Gibraltar and another squadron based on Malta. That is all to be changed. We are now to have only one squadron based on Gibraltar and available for occasional use only in the Mediterranean. We are making this change at a moment when other Mediterranean Powers are stronger than they ever were, and at a moment when war is actually proceeding in the Mediterranean between two Mediterranean Powers. I am bound to say that in my view the announcement of this new policy has had an almost bewildering effect upon all those who attach importance to the reputation of this country as a great Mediterranean Power. It is a complete departure from our old policy. Our old policy has been based upon the view that the control of the Mediterranean was essential to us. And not only is it a departure from our old policy, but it seems to me to amount virtually to an admission that that two-Power standard with a margin upon which we were encouraged to rely is completely abandoned. We are now apparently to be content with a one-Power standard, in this sense at all events, that in order to maintain a sufficient margin of strength in the North Sea we are compelled to take away from the waters of the Mediterranean the Fleet which throughout the whole of recent times has been stationed in those waters.<lb/>
<col>334</col>
I wonder whether this new departure has really been considered in all its aspects by His Majesty's Government? I noticed a somewhat remarkable phrase in the peroration of the First Lord of the Admiralty when he announced this new policy to the country. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Whatever the times may be, I hope this island and its people will Come safely through them."</quote>
Well, my Lords, some people may ask whether even the British Isles will come safely through such times if our principal trade route is liable to be closed against us. As my noble friend Lord Selborne pointed out, it might be possible for a foreign Power to strike us the heaviest blow of all in the waters of the Mediterranean. We have recently had some experience of the effect of the closing of the Dardanelles for a few weeks only. What will be the effect upon this country if that great trade route upon which we depend for nearly half of the wheat and corn which comes into this country is closed against us?<lb/>
But, my Lords, the matter is surely one which not only concerns the British Isles but concerns the whole British Empire. And do not let us forget that this is not the first step in the policy of concentration and denudation which now finds favour with the Admiralty. A few years ago there was a wholesale withdrawal of the British flag from all the remoter stations, a general dismantling of remoter naval bases, a general disarmament of our defences. Now comes this further step. My Lords, what will be the effect of this policy upon our great Colonies, upon the Dominions who at this very moment are considering what they can do to help us to meet our Imperial obligations, when they find that while we are making these proposals to them we are&#x2014;I am afraid it will so seem to them&#x2014;shirking the old obligations which until now we have always honourably fulfilled? Then what of the effect which will be produced in India? What will the people of India think when they find that we are unable to hold the great highway which connects India with the British Isles? We were told not long ago in connection with the creation of a new capital in India that one of the recommendations of the step was that it was an intimation to the people of India that we intended to remain there. My Lords, I am by no means convinced that, even if we
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0172"/>
<col>335</col>
are to assume that this expectation is well founded and that the change of capital will create a favourable impression, as the noble Marquess anticipates, upon the minds of the peoples of India, this abdication nearer home will not produce an unfavourable impression of a much more serious description. Then consider the effects of this great change upon our international relations. What kind of an impression will be produced, for example, upon the mind of our allies in Japan, a maritime Power keen and quick to appreciate any failure of maritime strength on our part. With regard to France and Russia, I will only venture to say that I entirely concur with what was said by my noble friend Lord Selborne when lie reminded the House that those Powers have their own responsibilities, and I agree with him in thinking that it would be highly improper for us to expect them under any conditions to relieve us of responsibilities which are properly ours.<lb/>
What, again, will be the result upon our diplomacy in the Near East. What of our position with regard to the Balkan Peninsula and in Asia Minor? What of the part we have taken in the affairs of Crete? Surely in regard to all these matters there is all the difference in the world between a diplomacy which is supported by a sufficient force at sea and one which is not. I do not know whether we may expect from the noble Marquess's statement that we shall be promised naval or military rearrangements which could be represented as in any sense countervailing the results of this withdrawal from the Mediterranean. There is the question of the Mediterranean garrisons, to which reference was made. They were, I believe, reduced by a third in 1906 and the defences were to some extent dismantled. But am I not right in believing that those changes were made upon the understanding that the Navy was strong enough to see that the proper reinforcements were provided for each different basis at the proper time? You may, perhaps you will, restore the garrisons to their old strength. But what will be the position of any additional troops whom you may place in Malta or in Egypt if the naval strength is not there to see to their safety? It would be a loss and not a gain of strength
<col>336</col>
if we had a number of British troops locked up for a time either in Malta or in Egypt.<lb/>
I must, I am afraid, add this further observation, that after listening to this discussion I remain with an uneasy feeling in my mind that after all, even after this disastrous withdrawal, we may not really be strong enough at sea. I can come to no other conclusion than that we have for some time past been lagging behind in the matter of naval construction, and I am still more convinced that in the matter of men there is a very serious deficiency to make good. In time of war it will not be possible to man ships as you may man them at a great Review by borrowing men from one ship or one squadron and putting them on board another. I earnestly trust that if this question be indeed still under the consideration of His Majesty's Ministers they will find it possible to do something to allay the profound uneasiness which has been created in the minds of most people by the announcement of this new policy. I agree with my noble friend Lord Selborne that the only solution to which we can look forward with a feeling that it will be a sufficient one is to be found in the re-establishment of our old position in the Mediterranean. We cannot in my view afford to retire from the honourable position which we have in the past occupied in Mediterranean waters. In the meantime, I trust that we may learn that His Majesty's Government have in contemplation some measures which, by adding to the strength of the Mediterranean garrisons, by re-establishing our defences, and by adding to the number of our ships, not perhaps battleships, in the Mediterranean, may mitigate the blow which I cannot help thinking has been struck at the reputation of this country as a great naval Power by the course which His Majesty's Government have, I think most unfortunately, determined to adopt.</membercontribution></p>

<title>FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00824"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I venture to ask the noble Earl opposite whether he is able to give the House any fresh information with regard to the regrettable outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00825"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Lord Lucas, who represents the Board of Agriculture in this House, has gone to attend the Show at Doncaster, and in his absence I am glad to give the noble Marquess the information for which he asks. There are four districts in which outbreaks have taken place. In regard to the first distriet&#x2014;Cumberland&#x2014;in the course of yesterday a further outbreak was brought to light at Petterill Bank Park, Harraby, in the vicinity of the previous outbreak at Harraby. Six cattle and 126 sheep in the field where the outbreak was detected have been ordered to be slaughtered. There are in adjacent fields thirty-two beasts and forty sheep which will be isolated and kept under constant veterinary observation. No further reports have been received from this district. The total number of outbreaks confirmed in the Cumberland district is now three.<lb/>
In the second district&#x2014;South Lancashire and Cheshire&#x2014;disease was found in the case reported from Cams Farm, Cheadle Heath, near Stockport, yesterday in a cow which had been exposed for sale at Salford Market on the 25th ult. It is stated that the other animals on the farm have not been in contact with this cow, but a further report is awaited. The reported case from Dukinfield, referred to in yesterday's report, was not confirmed. Later in the day a report was received from a farm near Altrincham, in Cheshire, which on investigation was found to be not foot-and-mouth disease; and a further report was received from the neighbourhood of Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, which is still under investigation. The total number of outbreaks in the Lancashire and Cheshire district is now five&#x2014;namely, three in Liverpool, one in Manchester abattoirs, and one near Stockport, Cheshire.<lb/>
In regard to Wakefield, the third district, of the reported cases referred to in yesterday's report that at Ackworth, near Pontefract, was found not to be foot-and-mouth disease. The disease was, however, detected at a farm at Lower Blacup
<col>340</col>
Heights Hill, Liversedge, in an Irish bullock that had been exposed in Wakefield Market on June 26. In connection with this outbreak the slaughter of five milking cows which were in the same field as the Irish bullock has been ordered, and the eighteen pigs and four sheep on the farm will be kept under observation. There is also an Irish bullock on the farm which it is understood will be slaughtered by the owner. Disease has also been found at York House, Purston, Pontefract, as regards which full information as to the animals on the farm has not yet been received. Since the issue of yesterday's report a further outbreak of the disease has been detected at Summer Lane, Barnsley, in the carcase of an animal in a slaughter-house, which animal had been exposed in Wakefield Market on June 26; and also at Netherfield Farm, Ackton, Normanton, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, in two cows pasturing in a field on the farm. The only other information at present available is that five cattle are pasturing on adjoining fields. A suspected case was also reported from Stainforth, Doncaster, which on investigation proved to be not foot-and-mouth disease. The total number of outbreaks which have now been confirmed in the Wakefield district is six.<lb/>
With regard to the fourth district&#x2014;Northumberland and North Durham&#x2014;both of the reported outbreaks referred to in yesterday's report from Kirk Whelpington parish have been confirmed&#x2014;namely, one at a farm at Catcherside, Kirk Whelpington, on which there are eighty-two cattle, 600 sheep, and two pigs, and the second at Cornhills Farm, Kirk Whelpington, on which there are 133 cattle, 659 sheep, and two pigs. Further particulars as to these animals are awaited. The suspected case at Chollerton Farm, Chollerton parish, has also been confirmed (particulars as to the animals on this farm are not yet to hand), as well as that at Nedderton South Farm, Bedlington. In this latter case further information is also awaited. The suspected outbreak Benwell Newcastle-on-Tyne, has also been confirmed amongst a herd of thirty-nix cattle pasturing in a field. In this case further particulars are awaited. Reported cases of the disease from Ratcleugh, near Alnwick, Northumberland, and from Snipe House, Alnwick, are still under investigation. The total number
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0175"/>
<col>341</col>
of outbreaks confirmed in this district is now seven.<lb/>
Up to date there have been six reported cases investigated which have turned out to be not foot-and-mouth disease&#x2014;namely, one in Leicestershire, one in Renfrewshire, two in Cheshire, and two in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Three reported cases are still outstanding and await investigation&#x2014;namely, two in the Alnwiek district of Northumberland and one in the Holmes Chapel district of Cheshire. In consequence of the fact that it has now been definitely ascertained that some of the suspected Irish bullocks were exposed in Nottingham Market an Order has been made scheduling the area surrounding Nottingham as regards the holding of markets within, and the movement of animals out of, the district.<lb/>
My right hon. friend the President of the Board of Agriculture has been anxious to obviate as far as possible any difficulties as regards the supply of meat in populous districts, and he therefore proposes to-day to issue Orders allowing fat animals for immediate slaughter to be brought from outside the scheduled areas into some of the larger towns in the West Riding and in the district of Liverpool, and also to allow movement within those towns to slaughter-houses. He hopes to be able, in the course of a day or two, to make a similar concession as regards other towns in the scheduled areas. I will read to your Lordships the towns to which the Orders allowing movement for slaughter will apply. They are: In the Wakefield area&#x2014;Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield, Leeds, Pudsey, Wakefield, Dewsbury, Batley, Ossett, Brighouse, Morley and Pontefract; in the Liverpool district&#x2014;Bootle, Birkenhead, St. Helens, Wallesey and Widnes.<lb/>
I regret to say that further outbreaks have been reported, although the news is not yet confirmed, in four other districts&#x2014;one in Lincolnshire, in the Lindsey division; one in Morpeth; one in Gateshead; and one in Christchurch. Hampshire. Your Lordships will see the gravity of the outbreak in Lincolnshire and in Christchurch because neither of these areas up to now has been affected. The total number of outbreaks reported is thirty-four&#x2014;of these twenty-four have been confirmed; four cases have been found to be not foot-and-mouth disease, and six are still open and under investigation.</membercontribution></p>

<title>BISHOPICS BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00834" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00835">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00836"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill I hope it may not be necessary for me to detain your Lordships at any length in explaining its provisions or defending the principles on which it is based. Under the present law it is impossible to found a new bishopric in the Church of England or even to alter the boundaries of an existing bishopric without a special Act of Parliament for that purpose. There are not a few cases in England where, owing to the growth of population, and, perhaps, also owing to the change in the conception of the duties of a Bishop, which is, if I may say so, very much to the advantage of the Church, the work of a diocese has become entirely beyond the strength of any single man. Some dioceses have been already divided. I think there have been nine such cases within the past few years, hut in each of those cases it has been necessary with great trouble and with great difficulty to pass through Parliament a separate
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0176"/>
<col>343</col>
Act. The proposal of this Bill is that in future, where it is desired to found a new diocese by the sub-division of an existing diocese or to alter the boundaries of a diocese, it shall be done by an Order in Council. The Order will first pass through the office of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, who will have to satisfy themselves that sufficient funds, not arising from their common fund, have been subscribed or obtained for the purpose of the new bishopric; that being done, the draft Order will be submitted by them to the Secretary of State and then to the Privy Council, and there is a provision that if the Privy Council approves of the Order it shall lie on the Table of both Houses of Parliament for thirty days, and if objected to it would, of course, be withdrawn.<lb/>
I need not dwell, I think, on the necessity for the sub-division of several dioceses. If any of your Lordships would look into the question I am sure you would be satisfied of the necessity. But perhaps I may say that, if this Bill should happily become law, there are some very important cases in which its provisions might at once be carried into effect. The great arch diocese of York would be sub-divided by the creation of a Bishopric of Sheffield, for which I believe practically the whole of the funds have been already provided; and the dioceses of Norwich, Ely and St. Albans would also be sub-divided by the creation of two new bishoprics for Suffolk and Essex, in addition to the Bishoprics of Norwich, Ely and St. Albans, whose boundaries would, of course, be altered. There also I think I may say that practically sufficient funds have been provided for the purpose if Parliament would only give the necessary authority for the foundation of these new bishopics. It has been my lot to bring forward this Bill three times already, and your Lordships have been pleased to give it your assent. The only obstacle in the way is the difficulty of securing time in another place for its discussion, which I believe would not take very long. I commend it to His Majesty's Government, who I know wish it well, in the hope that they may be able to take some steps which will provide time for at any rate a short discussion if your Lordships see fit to pass it and to send it down to the House of Commons. I beg to move the Second Reading of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00837">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.(<i>Viscount St. Aldwyn.</i>)</p>
<col>344</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00838"><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on behalf of those who sit on the Bishops' Benches I would repeat what I have on each previous occasion been allowed to say as to the growing urgency of this matter. It is really vital to the well-being of the Church and to the efficiency of its working that facilities of this kind should as speedily as possible be given. The problem of managing dioceses on the scale which some dioceses have at present reached is becoming one that cannot be solved by the strength of any man, and the strength of the most valued kind in the Church of England has already been impaired most seriously by the overwork of some of the best and most effective among the Bishops of to-day. It is not merely a question of efficiency of work. It is a question of discipline; it is a question of raising money; it is a question of all the varied administration of a great area. In all these matters the Church would be the gainer and no human being could possibly be the loser by the passing of this Bill into law. I earnestly endorse the wish expressed by the noble Viscount that every facility will be given to enable this Bill to stand as soon as may be on the Statute Book.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00839"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad to repeat what His Majesty's Government have said before when this Bill has been on previous occasions in your Lordships' House&#x2014;namely, to express entire approval of it and to wish it well. But I am sure the noble Viscount would be the last person in this House to expect from me any pledge as to what is likely to take place with regard to this Bill in the other House, or whether His Majesty's Government will be able to find time for it. For myself, I venture to hope that the efforts of the noble Viscount will this year be crowned with success.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00840"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD KINNAIRD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to re-echo what has already been said as to the great necessity there is that there should be a multiplication of Bishops, but I consider that it should be carried out in a way which should command the assent of the majority of Churchmen, and not in any way against the feelings of any large number of members of the Church of England. On the other hand, there are some who think that the precautions with reference to the carrying out of the details
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0177"/>
<col>345</col>
of this Bill are not such as would give sufficient protection to those who desire that certain illegal practices should not be carried on in the new dioceses to be formed under the Bill. They also think that until the recommendations of the Ritual Commission have been carried out, or are in a fair way of being carried out by the Bishop, the manner in which these proposals are now effected&#x2014;namely, with the consent of Parliament&#x2014;is probably the better way to protect the interests of laymen in the Church of England than the way proposed in this Bill. It is quite possible, I admit, that certain Amendments may be inserted in Committee so that these safeguards should be given. But I appeal to many of your Lordships whether it is not the case that the mere lying on the Table of an Order does not give that publicity to the proposal for the breaking up of old dioceses or the transferring of patronage or of property from one body to another, and I consider that safeguards are necessary before the power which Parliament now has to veto new Bishoprics is surrendered. As the noble Viscount has said, Parliament has shown every disposition in the past to consent to these proposals. I admit that the present process may be a little slower than that proposed in this Bill, but there are many who feel that there are certain questions which it is desirable in the interests of the whole Church should not be hurried through, and that Parliament is the best place in which the matter can be ventilated, so that there should not be a rapid carrying out of any transfer without its having been duly considered. May I again say that I agree with what has been said with reference to the great need of at once giving facilities to increase the number of bishoprics. The question is whether the scheme of this Bill is the wisest way of doing it and whether the safeguards are sufficient. I venture to hope that in Committee the noble Viscount will accept certain Amendments which will possibly meet the feelings of many who desire to see this carried out, but think the safeguards are not sufficient in view of what is going on in many parts of the country in certain dioceses where it is impossible to get what we believe to be the present law carried out because of the opposition of those in authority.</membercontribution></p>

<title>NATIONAL INSURANCE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00842"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government the following Questions with reference to the National Insurance Act, 1911&#x2014;&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. Whether it is the intention of the Insurance Commissioners to consider the applications of the small rural societies on their own merits respectively, apart from any other larger societies, and, if so, when they may expect some reply to their applications to become approved societies as independent units?</li>
<li>2. Whether it is not unnecessary for clerks, governesses and domestic servants to obtain cards before 15th of July who are paid their wages quarterly, and whose first contribution after the Act comes into operation cannot be before October next unless they leave their present service previously?</li>
<li>3. Whether the Government will consider the advisability of supplying stamps representing monthly and quarterly contributions?</li>
<li>4. Whether the Government will take the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown as to the legality of deducting from wages the cost of the stamps which constitute the contribution of workmen or domestic servants against their wishes, having due regard to the Master and Servants Act?</li>
<li>5. What is the position of a domestic servant or workman whose employer continues to pay his or her wages and to look after him or her during temporary illness? Does he or she forfeit sick benefits under the Act?</li>
<li>6. Are employers expected to pay for persons employed by them who are themselves exempt because they have a private source of income in addition to their wages or are above sixty-live years of age; and, if so, are employers also to pay for employees over seventy years of age who are in receipt of a pension but desire to continue to work half-time or occasionally each week?</li></ol></p>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0178"/>
<col>347</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00843">The noble Lord said: My Lords, before putting the Questions which stand in my name on the Paper I should like to refer for a minute or two to the notorious leaflet about which we had a discussion last week. Your Lordships will recollect that the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack described that discussion as a very useful conversation, although the leaflet itself was unanimously condemned on all sides of the House. The noble Earl who represents the Treasury in your Lordships' House promised that there should be issued a new and amended leaflet, and if I recollect rightly he read the substance of that leaflet to the House. But, my Lords, another voice has spoken since then, and I should like to ask whether this new leaflet has been issued or is going to be issued. The Secretary to the Treasury, who is also one of the Commissioners and Chairman of the Joint Committee, was asked in the House of Commons on Monday last the following Question by the Member for Salisbury&#x2014;
<quote>"Whether he would publish a correction of the 'N.H.' Leaflet issued by the Insurance Commissioners which states that it is of the greatest importance to every employed person that he should join an approved society without delay, and so avoid becoming a deposit contributor."</quote>
That is precisely the same Question as I put in your Lordships' House last week. But Mr. Masterman did not reply to the Question as the noble Earl did to me, in a courteous manner. On the contrary, he said&#x2014;
<quote>"The advice given in the 'N.H.' Leaflet to which the hon. Member refers is entirely justified."</quote>
And he went on to justify it in his own way, I do not think doing any practical good to his side of the question. Now, my Lords this is the very question we discussed last Wednesday. What I want to know is whether we are to take the answer that was given us by the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, or whether we are to take the voice that spoke in the House of Commons. We are told in your Lordships' House that our conversation was extremely useful, notwithstanding the colossal difficulties which have been caused by bringing the Act into operation on July 15. The Commission are not to blame for any change of opinion amongst those who are responsible for these answers. There is only one person to blame, and he says that we cannot get at him. Mr. Lloyd George is alone to blame for
<col>348</col>
the unworkable character of the Act, and alone to blame for the colossal difficulties which have arisen in consequence of the Act being brought into operation on July 15.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00844">But that is not the only question to which I should like to call attention. The Secretary to the Treasury, in his capacity as Chairman of the Joint Committee, wrote a very able letter to the Press last week, and I for one desire to congratulate him on the clear and straightforward way in which he put the whole question of domestic servants&#x2014;until he came to the last paragraph. I do consider that the last paragraph was one of the meanest paragraphs I have ever read. What was the meaning of that paragraph? It meant that rich people, in order to save themselves trouble and in order to save being tax gatherers, should pay both the servant's contribution and their own, and thus leave those who are poorer than themselves and could not do this to be called mean. I do not think that is a statement which ought to be made by the Secretary to the Treasury, but I have for a long time been suspicious that that was the object of the Government in all this hustle and hurry, and now the cat is out of the bag. What would be the effect if the advice given by the Secretary to the Treasury was taken by what Mr. Lloyd George has called the "idle rich" and if poorer mistresses and masters were to follow their example. Why, the servants would not be taught thrift as we were told was the object of bringing in this Bill. But they would be told at the next election, "Look at your benefactor Mr. Lloyd George, who has got pensions for you for the future without one single farthing expense to you, but entirely at the expense of your masters." That is no doubt the object of this hustling and the object of this advice, but I must leave it to your Lordships, having brought it to your notice, to form your own opinions about it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00845">With regard to the Questions standing in my name on the Paper, I think the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack was hardly accurate when he said that a number of small societies had been already approved. I think if he will inquire, as I have taken the trouble to do, at Buckingham Gate, he will find that very few have been approved up to the present

<col>349</col>
time. Out of 100 that have applied in Lincolnshire only three have been approved. But that is not the fault of the Commissioners. The Commissioners have great difficulty in approving societies owing to the provisions of the Act. Most of these societies for rural labourers and domestic servants want sonic alternative benefits, but the difficulty is to give them the alternative benefits within the four corners of the Act. What is wanted is an Amending Act, a simple Act to amend Section 13, where alternative benefits are allowed for persons who do not wish to take the sick benefits of the Act. My second Question is a simple one and stands on its own merits, and the third Question is a matter of convenience. The fourth Question has already been asked twice before, but I should like to point out that the real point is not whether under the insurance Act employers can recover the cost of the stamps from the servants, but whether they can deduct them from their wages under the Master amid Servants Act. The fifth Question is a very important one. There is a strong feeling throughout the country, I am informed, that if the employer continues to pay the domestic servant or workman his or her wages and to look after him or her during temporary illness he or she will not be allowed to have the benefits under the Act. It is difficult to understand the meaning of the pamphlet, and I should very much like, not so Much for my own benefit but for the benefit of the great number of others who are in perplexity on the point, that we should have a clear and definite answer to this Question. The sixth Question arises out of the misleading leaflet, and I desire that there should be some clear information on this point. I now ask the six Questions which stand in my name, and I hope the noble Earl will be able to give the answers in such a clear light that I may not have to refer to them again.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00846"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask a few supplementary Questions of which I have given the noble Earl private notice. In the first place, wish to ask what insurance premium is payable (1) by employers, and (2) by employees where the latter are employed partly in Great Britain and partly in Ireland? Secondly, what insurance premium is payable by the employer and employed where the latter resides permanently in Ireland, but, being a
<col>350</col>
Scotsman or Englishman, is a member of a friendly society in Great Britain which has become an approved society under the Act? My third Question is somewhat of a corollary to Lord Heneage's sixth Question. It is this. In the event of employers being expected to pay the contribution of an employee who has above &#x00A3;26 a year of his own, what becomes of the contribution paid by him and also the contribution made by the State in such a case?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00847"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in returning to this rather thorny subject I should like to thank noble Lords for their courtesy in putting their points so clearly, and I in my turn will do my best to answer their Questions as clearly as I can. Before coming to the actual Questions I should like, as 'regards the promise which I gave that another leaflet would be issued to say that that leaflet is going to be issued very shortly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00848"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: Before July 15?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00849"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: I cannot give any pledge as to the exact date. In his first Question Lord Heneage asks whether it is the intention of the Insurance Commissioners to consider the applications of the small rural societies on their own merits respectively, apart from any other larger societies, and, if so, when they may expect some reply to their applications to become approved societies as independent units. Last week I was taken to task by noble Lords opposite in connection with a remark I made about tire smaller societies. It was said that the larger societies were going to swallow up the smaller societies, and I explained that such was not the case. I. now wish to say, in reply to the noble Lord's Question, that the Commissioners give equal consideration to all applications for approval from societies great or small. They have approved a society with as few as thirty-five members. Lord Heneage raised the question that some of the applications of these societies to become approved societies had not been replied to. I have been very carefully into the matter, and as far as I can see an answer has been in every case returned to the societies which have made application. The Commissioners attach special importance to the preservation of rural societies, believing that under the Act they can continue and extend their usefulness as centres of village life.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0180"/>
<col>351</col>
The Commissioners wanted to get into touch with as many of these rural societies as possible. But they found that these societies had great difficulty in grasping the intentions of the Act and taking the necessary steps to become approved, especially in preparing rules. The Commissioners therefore decided to use the co-operation of county organisations which were being started all over the country, and to approach the rural societies where possible through them; and also to simplify the rules and procedure for becoming approved. This has led to some delay, but has had these advantages. It has secured voluntary helpers throughout the country. Lord Heneage, for instance, has expressed his appreciation of the work being done in Lincolnshire by the Rural Workers Association, to whom small societies in Lincolnshire are being referred for advice by the Commissioners. Lord Fortescue started a similar society in Devon. Both these societies are now approved, and between them they already embrace over fifty village clubs, whose independence and tradition will remain untouched. In East Sussex it is hoped to approve thirty societies in a few days, and as many or more in Bedfordshire. It has also led to co-operation between the small societies themselves, which will strengthen them when they come to work the Act. It has resulted in societies whose existence was not even known to the Commissioners coining forward at the invitation of the county organisation to take their share in the working of the Act.<lb/>
To remove any apprehension as to the ill consequences of delay the Commissioners have sent Circular 45 to every society which has been in correspondence with them. This circular has also been published in the Press and sent to every Member of Parliament. The Commissioners have prepared a much simpler form of rules, which can be sent to any one who is interested. They have sent out Circular 45 to the societies and an attached covering letter to all county organisations. The fact that approval is sometimes delayed is regretted by the Commissioners, but it is often due to causes over which they have no control. It has frequently happened that a society has failed to pass the proper resolution to become approved, or that wrong rules are sent in, or that the rules require much amendment. In such cases a fresh meeting of the society
<col>352</col>
often has to be summoned to put matters right, and time is then lost. In any case the examination of rules by the staff of the Commission is a lengthy process, because the existing rules, often very old and complicated, have to be studied to make sure that the government of the society is in order, and as far as possible cases must be taken ill order. But I can assure the noble Lord that everything is being done to expedite the approval of these small societies.<lb/>
In his second Question the noble Lord asks whether it is not unnecessary for clerks, governesses and domestic servants to obtain cards before July 15 who are paid their wages quarterly, and whose first contribution after the Act comes into operation cannot be before September next unless they leave their present service previously. The answer to that Question is both Yes and No. The general position is as follows. A contribution accrues from the first moment of employment after July 14, and the fact that it is not necessarily made payable until some later date should not be allowed to obscure the fact that the employee is an insured person from that moment, and should therefore have a card, which he may require at any time, as a token of his insurance. The "N.H." Leaflet in stating that a contribution card must be obtained before July 15 was framed in consideration of the vast number of cases in which it will be in fact necessary that the card should be so obtained. It is true that in certain instances&#x2014;for example, where the employed person's wages are on a quarterly basis and he will not be receiving wages until September 30&#x2014;no harm will, except as I shall state in a moment, be done if the card is not in fact obtained until the payment is made, and I am glad to make this plain to your Lordships.<lb/>
But I still think that the leaflet was wisely phrased, for the following reasons. It must be noted that these cases of quarterly payment are few as compared with the many million cases to which the leaflet was necessarily addressed, and the special exceptional cases in question could not have been effectively explained in the leaflet without causing wide misapprehension as to the general necessity. Even in these cases of quarterly wages it is certainly safer that the card should be obtained from July 15, for various reasons.
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0181"/>
<col>353</col>
For instance, the employed person might unexpectedly need to apply for sanatorium benefit, in which case the production of the card would be necessary, and such person would have a right to complain at having been misled if the leaflet had stated, as I understand is suggested, that in some instances no card need be obtained until September 29. It would, in fact, be necessary to have the card from July 15 in every case where, even on quarterly wages, the individual had other employment at the same time under a different employer. This point again it would have been impossible to set out precisely in the leaflet. It would have been wrong also for the compilers of the leaflet to overlook the possibility of unexpected dismissal in the case of any employed person. In these circumstances the possession of the card is necessary. I think, therefore, your Lordships will see that the leaflet was wisely worded, and that widespread misapprehension would have been created if any attempt had been made to set out in the leaflet these few special cases in which the obtaining of the card might conceivably have been postponed without any detriment necessarily arising.<lb/>
The noble Lord's third Question is whether the Government will consider the advisability of supplying stamps representing monthly and quarterly contributions. Employed persons, at whatever intervals their wages are paid, may at any time after July 15 require their cards for production to an employer&#x2014;<i>e.g</i>., if they change their employer or take employment under a second employer. It is necessary, therefore, for them to obtain their cards at the commencement of the Act, and the regulations provide accordingly. There are serious objections to placing high value stamps representing monthly and quarterly contributions on sale at Post Offices generally. The Post Office would take strong objection to increasing the already very large number of varieties of health and unemployment stamps which they are required to sell, and this especially applies to stamps of high value. To limit the public sale to head offices would be of no great advantage to employers generally. Further, the issue of high value stamps generally would probably lead to the stamping of cards at the end of the quarter without the prepayment of the contributions which the Act requires,
<col>354</col>
and this would mean a loss of interest to the Fund or a. great increase in the amount of inspection necessary to prevent irregularities of this nature from becoming general. Moreover, the general issue of high value stamps over periods other than thirteen weeks would create very serious accounting complications for the societies, because it is necessary to know the actual weeks for which contributions have been paid. But for large employers who have been granted facilities for quarterly stamping on prepayment, and undertake to fulfil the necessary conditions, high value stamps will be available. I may add that the Insurance Commissioners would be prepared to consider the question of supplying thirteen-week stamps to any employer on application to them if there were any evidence that the supply of such stamps upon special application to them would be of general convenience. No such evidence is, however, at present available.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord opposite, Lord Ashbourne, the other day asked the same point as that contained in Lord Heneage's fourth Question, which is whether the Government will take the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown as to the legality of deducting from wages the cost of the stamps which constitute the contribution of workmen or domestic servants against, their wishes, having due regard to the Master and Servants Act. The answer is that Section 3 of the Third Schedule of the National Insurance Act authorises the employer to deduct from wages paid by him the workman's part of the contributions payable under Part I of the Act, notwithstanding the provisions of any contract to the contrary. This provision would definitely override the provisions of any previous Act with which it might be in conflict. The Commissioners have, however, taken further legal advice, and are informed that the question admits of no doubt whatever. It would be unfair to add to the present burden of work of the Law Officers of the Crown by referring it to them.<lb/>
Lord Heneage asks in his fifth Question, What is the position of a domestic servant or workman whose employer continues to pay his or her wages and to look after him or her during temporary illness? Does he or she forfeit sick benefits under the Act? The answer is that if the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0182"/>
<col>355</col>
employer guarantees to pay full remuneration during the first six weeks of illness, then under Section 47 the contribution is reduced&#x2014;for a female servant by 1&#x00BD;<i>d.,</i> the employer paying 2&#x00BD;<i>d.</i> and the servant 2<i>d.</i> (instead of 3<i>d.</i> each); and for a male servant by 2<i>d.,</i> the employer paying 2<i>d.</i> and the man 3<i>d.</i> (instead of 3<i>d.</i> and 4<i>d.</i>). In this case no sick pay is given while wages are continued for these six weeks. The servant is, however, entitled to the other benefits, including medical benefit, from the first, and to sick pay from the end of the six weeks. If adequate provision is made for the sickness of the servants by their employers it will be possible to commute sickness benefit for other benefits&#x2014;<i>e.g</i>., pensions. The Commissioners will within a few days issue tables showing what other benefits can be so provided. Employers whose servants would benefit by coming under a scheme of this kind would do well to remember, before they adopt a scheme for lower contributions under Section 47, that the payment of contributions at this lower rate would necessarily penalise their servants in respect of their substituted benefits&#x2014;<i>e.g</i>., pensions, &amp;c. If neither contributions are reduced under Section 47, nor a scheme of substituted benefits accepted under Section 13, then sickness benefit would be payable at the ordinary rate, whether or not the employer paid wages during illness.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00850"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: Am I to understand that they do forfeit the sick benefits under the Act, but that they have alternative benefits?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00851"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: In the case put by the noble Lord in his Question it is suggested that there should be an alternative benefit instead of sick benefit. If that alternative benefit does not come into force, then the domestic servant or workman can have the sickness benefit. I now come to the noble Lord's sixth and final Question. In the first part of that Question he asks, Are employers expected to pay for persons employed by them who are themselves exempt because they have a private source of income in addition to their wages or are above sixty-five years of age? Under Section 4 (4) of the Act employers are required to pay their contributions in respect of persons who have either (<i>a</i>) obtained a certificate of exemption nailer Section 2 (1) as being in receipt of
<col>356</col>
&#x00A3;26 per annum or more, or being ordinarily and mainly dependent on some other person, or (<i>b</i>) not being previously insured become employed for the first time after sixty-five, and are therefore not insured. Such contributions are required under the Act in order to prevent discrimination by employers, in engaging their workmen, against persons who are compulsorily insured. The contributions are to be dealt with in accordance with Regulations, which may provide for applying them for the benefit of the employees in respect of whom they have been paid in the event of their subsequently becoming employed contributors. Many persons who enjoy an allowance which now entitles them to exemption will doubtless lose that allowance and require to be insured in future years, and many others, such as married women, who are now mainly dependent on their husbands, will become widows and also require to be insured. Unless some money were available to help these people to re-enter insurance they would necessarily have at later ages in life (if more than a year after the commencement of the Act) to suffer reduced benefits or pay higher contributions. Contributions for exempted persons are therefore required for the double reason of preventing unfair discrimination in the engagement of workpeople, and also to help a class of persons many of whom will in future years be greatly in need of assistance. I should like to say a word on the question of people of sixty-five years of age. In brief, if a man or woman is sixty-five on July 15 and is or becomes employed he or she is insured and comes under the full conditions of insurance; but he or she does not get any reserve value, and only gets such benefits as the society can then give. But if a man or woman is under sixty-five on July 15 and does not become employed until he is over sixty-five, then he is not insured and the employer would pay on him as on an exempt person. In the second part of his last Question the noble Lord asks whether employers are also to pay for employees over seventy years of age who are in receipt of a pension but desire to continue to work half-time or occasionally each week. No, they are not insured. No contributions are paid in respect of people of and over seventy years of age.</membercontribution></p>

When I desired the noble Earl to explain that phrase he asked for further notice. As he has reverted to the subject to-day I hope he can now explain the meaning of that phrase. What is the exact process? How do you reach the small society through the large society? Have the large societies any regular means of correspondence or communication with the small societies?

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00871"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid I have nothing further to add to what I have said on this point. I have already given a full explanation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00872"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: I understand from the noble Earl that the Government will keep their eye on the approved societies, and if they find it necessary to do so will, I suppose, withdraw their approval. I take it they will look into the status and financial position of approved societies with a view to considering whether they should remain approved. Supposing the investigation shows that a society should not remain approved. What then will be the position of the people who have joined that society on practically the invitation of the Government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00873"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: The noble and learned Lord has raised a question similar to that put by Lord Faber just now, and I then asked to have notice of it. As regards the point put to me by Lord Oranmore and Browne with regard to servants who ply between England and Ireland, the contributions and benefits under the Act are the same in England, Scotland and Wales, but in Ireland the contributions are&#x2014;For men, 5&#x00BD;<i>d.</i> (employer 2&#x00BD;<i>d.,</i> worker 3<i>d.</i>) instead of 7<i>d.</i> in England; for women, 4&#x00BD;<i>d.</i> (employer 2&#x00BD;<i>d.,</i> worker 2<i>d.</i>) instead of 6<i>d.</i> in England; and there is no medical benefit in Ireland. Contributions and benefits vary with residence, but would be the same whether the servant belongs to an English or an Irish society. If she is permanently resident in Ireland she would naturally belong to an Irish society or to the Irish branch of an English society. If she moves about between England and Ireland the position is as follows. While she is actually in England, for however short a time, she pays English contributions and receives full benefits, including medical benefit. While she is actually in Ireland she pays Irish contributions and receives no medical benefit. If her journeys from England to Ireland and <i>vice versa</i> are for such a long period each time as to involve a change of residence, it is desirable that she should belong to a society which has both English and Irish branches, as her membership would then remain constant. If her residence, however, is usually in England and she accompanies her employer to Ireland merely for short holidays, then no change of residence is involved; she retains her membership of the English
<col>360</col>
society, and no particular object is served by joining a society which has an Irish branch. On the whole, however, if questions as to change of residence are likely to arise, it would seem desirable for a person who moves about from one country to another frequently to become a member of a society with branches in both countries, so as to avoid unnecessary changes of society. As to the other Question put to me by Lord Oranmore and Browne, I would ask the noble Lord to give me notice of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00874"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member><membercontribution>: May I ask whether societies exist which have branches in England and Ireland? I do not see how servants going over to Ireland for three or four months can be forced when in Ireland to pay more than the contribution which is obligatory in Ireland, nor how an employer can be forced to give a larger contribution. As to the answer given to Lord Heneage's sixth Question, I wish to know whether I clearly understood it. In the case of a servant having over &#x00A3;26 a year, is it quite clear that the employer has to pay the 3<i>d.</i> or 2<i>d.</i> a week for him, and that if the servant has a pension or something of that kind he never can get any benefit, and that therefore the employer is paying into a general fund for the benefit of other individuals who are in less fortunate circumstances?</membercontribution></p>

It is only within the last week or so that societies have been ready to issue cards in large numbers to their members, and, as I have said, the Commissioners desire to give them every opportunity of providing their members with their cards, which, they are exceedingly anxious to do before the commencement of the Act. The Commissioners hope, therefore, that the number of employees who fail to obtain cards through the ordinary channels by July 15 will be comparatively small, and for the present the supply of cards to employers is limited, as a rule, to ten per cent. of the number of employees. If, however, by next week any employers find that there are still large numbers of their employees who are without cards, the Commissioners will be prepared to supply emloyers with as many cards as are necessary to secure that every employee shall have a card on July 15.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00882"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl who has replied on behalf of His Majesty's Government told us, in answer to Lord Heneage, that it was not proposed to add to the present burden of work on the Law Officers of the Crown by asking for their opinion on the point contained in the fourth Question. It seems to me an extraordinary answer that the Law Officers of the Crown are not to be bothered on such an important matter. What are the Law Officers of the Crown for except to clear up doubtful points of law? If the noble Earl had said that the Government
<col>362</col>
did not think it necessary to make the reference because the Act is perfectly clear that would have been an intelligible answer, but the answer that was given is one of the most extraordinary that has ever been vouchsafed in this House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00883"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: I said there was no doubt upon the point. I made the other observation as supplementary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00884"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: I do not know whether the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack can inform the House what would be the position of the contributors of an approved society which, on further investigation, was found to be no longer worthy of being approved and the Government withdraw their approva from it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00885"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: I think there is a little misapprehension in the minds of noble Lords as to the financial arrangements of the Act. It is not contemplated that an existing society should be allowed to mix up the new insurance with its old funds. On the contrary, the Act contains a code under which it will be obligatory upon every approved society to separate its insurance business from business which docs not fall within the purposes of the Act and which has been done before the Act came into operation. The society will have to invest the money it receives under the Act, whether from employee, employer, or the State, in a manner which is carefully provided for. It will have to give security for its handling of the money or else invest it in approved securities. Therefore it can hardly go wrong unless there is some very gross breach of trust. There will be careful supervision of the societies from time to time, and though the State does not guarantee their solvency it prescribes means under which it is made certain, as far as ingenuity can make that possible, that nothing can go wrong.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00886"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: The point I wished to have made clear was this. Suppose, as the result of the supervision which the Government will exercise, a society which has been approved is found to be a society no longer worthy of being approved and the Government withdraw their approval, what will be the position of the contributors?</membercontribution></p>

<col>363</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00887"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: In the case of insolvency on the part of a society due to defalcation the same rules would apply as apply now in the case of a benefit society in which there is a deficiency&#x2014;the members will have to contribute in order to make up that deficiency. It is conceivable that the whole thing might be wound up, but that is not in the least probable, because the machinery which requires the keeping of the funds separate is such as to make it as far as possible certain that the funds will always be forthcoming. If there were any difficulty it would be from some act for which the other members of the society were liable. It is to see that there is no insolvency and no danger of insolvency that the inspections to which reference has been made take place.<lb/>
The answer to the Question put by Lord Ampthill as to why the opinion of the Law Officers had not been taken in this case is that the point was so plain and simple that it was not necessary to do so. When provision is laid down in an Act of Parliament that deductions are not to be made from the wages of persons employed, and following upon that there is a special Act of Parliament directed to a special case which directs that in that special case deductions shall he made, then the subsequent Statute prevails. If the noble Lord refers to the Schedule of the Insurance Act he will find that there is a specific direction as to deductions; that, of course, overrules the direction in the general Act. The point was so simple that the Commissioners did not think it necessary to refer the matter to the Law Officers. It is quite true that the Law Officers are available to answer such questions, but their duties are very heavy, and it is not a service to the State for a Department to add unnecessarily to the burdens of the Law Officers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00888"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: I understand the noble and learned Viscount to say that these small societies, when they take up the insurance business, will have to keep it quite separate from their ordinary business, and that the Government will frame rules as to what they are to do with the funds which they receive under this insurance scheme. [The LORD CHANCELLOR nodded assent.] Then I suppose the Government mean to tell these societies to invest their funds in Consols? I will take that case.
<col>364</col>
They invest their money in Consols, a call is made on the society to pay money to insured persons, they sell Consols, for which they had to pay seventy-six, at seventy-two&#x2014;and we know what has been going on in Consols during the last six months&#x2014;and a state of insolvency is set up at once.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00889"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: The societies are not restricted to investment in Consols or in any other particular security. The obligation put on them is to see that the securities are either Government or trustee securities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00890"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: They are all under the same banner. If Consols fall they all fall.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00891"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: At the present time, if in the case of a registered benefit society the funds are insufficient to meet a claim, there is a levy. The same thing would apply in this case. The rules laid down are directed to making sure that the funds of the society shall be administered in such a fashion that these deficiencies shall not take place. As a rule they have arisen not at all from investment in Consols, but through investment in a very different class of securities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00892"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Are we to understand that the conditions under which these small societies will obtain approval will be of so strict a kind as to make it in the opinion of His Majesty's Government almost out of the question that they should hereafter become insolvent?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00893"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Yes. After the closest consideration we could give to the subject we think the result of the provisions made will be as nearly as possible absolutely to secure solvency.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00894"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: As regards the Post Office Savings Bank, whether there is a deficiency or not it does not matter, because the State comes in.

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00895"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: What the Government have done is to work the insurance system through voluntary societies, and the step taken to secure the soundness of these societies is to lay down a code of rules which the Government consider will render it as nearly as possible certain that there should not be a deficiency.</membercontribution></p>

<col>365</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00896"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I wish to ask what steps the Insurance Commissioners are taking at the present time towards constituting the Insurance Committees under Section 59 of the Act, Your Lordships will remember that under this section Insurance Committees were to be appointed under certain regulations, and that these bodies were to be local bodies to administer the Act. These committees were not appointed because of the hurry in which the Act was brought into force, and it was found necessary by the Commissioners to establish bodies of their own to start the Act. These bodies, of which no mention is made either in Section 59 or indeed anywhere else in the Act, are purely temporary bodies appointed for temporary purposes, and, as we were told, to be superseded very shortly. In fact in Scotland the Commissioners, in appointing these provisional committees, said that the Insurance Committees themselves were to be appointed very soon, perhaps before July 15. I do not know whether anything has been done towards appointing these Insurance Committees, but I would point out that, so far at all events as I can see, the Insurance Committees alone have the power of making binding agreements, and anything which is done in the meantime has no legal force. The provisional Insurance Committees can no doubt make suggestions and recommendations, but they cannot go further than that, and unless these Insurance Committees are appointed and are in operation it cannot be said that the Act is actually in working. I wish to ask whether any progress has been made with regard to, these Insurance Committees.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00897"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: At present no steps are being taken as regards the permanent Insurance Committees. The Act provides that the representatives of the insured persons shall be appointed in such manner as may be prescribed by the regulations of the Insurance Commissioners, so as to secure representation of the insured persons resident in the county or county borough who are members of societies and who are deposit contributors in proportion as nearly as may be to their respective numbers. Since no person will be insured before July 15, when the Act comes into operation, and since it is necessary that Insurance Committees should be constituted before the Act comes into
<col>366</col>
operation, the Commissioners had to use the powers conferred on them by Section 78 of the Act and make arrangements for setting up committees which will hold office until committees can be regularly constituted in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The general composition of the committees as prescribed by the Act has been carefully preserved in forming these provisional committees&#x2014;that is to say, three-fifths of the members of each committee will represent insured persons, one-fifth will be appointed by the county or county borough council, and the proportion of the other members will also be in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00898"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Then it appears from the noble Earl's answer that Section 59 was so drawn that it was absolutely impossible to appoint the Insurance Committees before the Act came into force. I do not think a stronger condemnation could be pronounced of the way in which the Act was drafted. I now wish to call attention to the hardship of requiring employers to advance the contributions of their employees, and to ask whether the Commissioners will, acting under Section 78 of the Act, direct that when an employee presents his card to his employer he shall have placed upon it a stamp equal in value to the contribution for which he is liable. Your Lordships must be aware that at the present time a point which is causing perhaps the greatest dissatisfaction and concern throughout the United Kingdom with regard to every kind of employer is that he is obliged, as he chooses to phrase it, to collect taxes for the Government. I cannot suppose that the Government wish to create any unnecessary friction. One sees that many meetings are held at which persons say they will not obey the Act, and so on, in which, if I might express an opinion, I think they are not very wise; but at the same time there is no doubt that enormous discontent is excited throughout the country&#x2014;you find it wherever you go&#x2014;with regard to this particular provision. It seems to me that it is really unnecessary, and I would make this suggestion&#x2014;that when an employee presents his card to the employer he should simply have to place upon it a stamp equal in value to the amount for which he is liable. This is not an idea of my own. I took it from a letter written
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0188"/>
<col>367</col>
to the Scottish newspapers by the chairman of an indignation meeting in Scotland on this matter. He pointed cut that all this friction was quite unnecessary and might be avoided in that way. I do not know what the Government will say, but there is one answer which I hope they will not give. I hope they will not say that it is contrary to the principle of the Act. The Chancellor of the Exchequer last Saturday, in a speech which some of your Lordships may have read, said that there were three principles in the Act&#x2014;one was the principle of contribution, the second was the principle of compulsion, and the third was the principle of working through voluntary societies. This proposal does not offend against any one of those three principles, and unless the Government want to create friction without necessity I cannot see why they should not accept it. It is not sufficient to say to me that this is going against the words of the Act, because the Commissioners have, under Section 78, overridden the Act in every sort of way; and there is no reason that I can see why in this case they should not exercise their powers under that section and adopt this plan, which certainly would facilitate the working of the Act and make things easier for everybody.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00899"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid the answer I have to give to the noble Earl will not be, from his point of view, a very satisfactory one. No system under which a workman would himself be responsible for affixing a stamp representing his own share of the contribution is possible under the Act. Section 4 (2) explicitly provides that "the employer shall, in the first instance, pay both the contributions payable by himself (in this Act referred to as the employer's contributions) and also on behalf of the employed contributor the contributions payable by such contributor." Under this section and the Third Schedule he is entitled to recover the workman's share of the contributions by deduction from wages, if wages are paid, but not otherwise. The Commissioners have no power to require or allow the employee to pay his contribution during employment in any other way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00900"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: It appears to me that the powers of the Commissioners vary very much according
<col>368</col>
to their convenience. Section 59 stated in the most positive way that Insurance Committees were to be appointed who were to work the Act. The Commissioners found not the slightest difficulty in overriding that section altogether and appointing a different body according to their own liking. Why they could not do that in this case, too, I confess I cannot understand.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00901"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: It is a fundamental principle of the Act that the employer shall deduct the workman's contribution and add his own contribution. That is the system under every scheme of national insurance of which I am aware. It is the system in Germany. The proposal of the noble Earl would strike at the very foundations of the Act and at the very means by which it is hoped to make the insurance system a universal system, working completely.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00902"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble and learned Viscount will find that the result of this in the country will be by no means pleasant to the Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00903"><member>LORD MONK BRETTON</member><membercontribution>: I should like to know, with reference to these provisional committees, whether there is any obligation on anybody to serve as clerk to the provisional committee, whether there is any fund out of which these clerks can be paid, and whether there is any obligation on anybody to issue an agenda or minutes to the members of the provisional committees.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00904"><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: That Question hardly arises out of those put by Lord Camperdown. If the noble Lord will give me notice of it, I will give him a reply on a future occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00905"><member>LORD ST. LEVAN</member><membercontribution>: Is there any other way by which the employee can contribute his quota otherwise than by having it deducted from his wages by his employer?</membercontribution></p>

My noble and learned friend has called my attention to the fact that the magistrates have by Statute already the power of determining the question, and he has assured me that he will assure himself of that condition of things, and that if it should turn out not to be so he will take care that the Bill does not pass its final stage without that being put right.

<quote>"(2) Any covenant or contract made by a person (hereinafter called the settler) in consideration of marriage, either for the future payment of money, or for the future settlement on or for the settler's wife or husband or children of property, wherein the settler's had not at the date of the marriage any estate or interest, whether vested or contingent, in possession or remainder, and not being money or property in right of the settler's wife or husband, shall, if the settler is adjudged bankrupt and the covenant, or contract has not been executed at the date of the commencement of his bankruptcy, be void against the trustee in bankruptcy, except so far as it enables the persons entitled under the covenant or contract to claim for dividend in the settler's bankruptcy under or in respect of the covenant or contract, but any such claim to dividend shall be postponed until all claims of the other creditors for valuable consideration in money or money's worth have been satisfied.</quote>
<quote>"(2A) Any payment of money (not being payment of premiums on a policy of life assurance) or any transfer of property made by the settler in pursuance of such a covenant or contract as aforesaid shall be void against the trustee in the settler's bankruptcy, unless the persons to whom the payment or transfer was made, prove, either&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>"(<i>a</i>) that the payment or transfer was made more than two years before the date of the commencement of the bankruptcy; or</li>
<li>"(<i>b</i>) that at the date of the payment or transfer the settler was able to pay all his debts without the aid of the money so paid or the property so transferred; or</li>
<li>"(<i>c</i>) that the payment or transfer was made in pursuance of a covenant or contract to pay or transfer money or property expected to come to the settler from or on the death of a particular person named in the covenant or contract and was made within three months after the money or property came into the possession or under the control of the settlor:</li>
</ol>
but, in the event of any such payment or transfer being declared void, the persons to whom it was made shall be entitled to claim for dividend under or in respect of the covenant or contract in like manner as if it had not been executed at the commencement of the bankruptcy."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00952">(2) The following subsection shall be added at the end of the said section forty-seven&#x2014;
<quote>"(4) Nothing in this section shall affect or prejudice the title or interest of any person who before the date of the receiving Order and without notice of the presentation of a bankruptcy petition has <i>bond fide</i> and for value purchased or acquired from the person or persons entitled to the benefit of any such settlement, covenant., or contract as aforesaid the money or property the subject thereof or any interest in such money or property.</quote></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-00953"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member> moved to amend the proposed new subsection (2) to be substituted for subsection (2) of Section 47 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1883, by omitting from the end of the subsection the words, "but any such claim to dividend shall be postponed until all claims of the other creditors for valuable consideration in money or money's worth have been satisfied."</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00954">The noble and learned Earl said: In order to make this Amendment intelligible I should call your Lordships' attention to what is the state of the law at present, and what is the amendment proposed in respect of it. This section has reference to marriage settlements, and the provision, which appears to me to have been very carefully worded, and but for the developments that have taken place since I should have thought would have effected the object, is this, that marriage being valuable consideration the settlement made upon marriage was as good as the ordinary course of dealing in which valuable consideration is exchanged and property exchanged for what is valuable consideration in law. The authors of the Act, I think, had a very clear idea of what they meant, and one of the first things they did was to prevent a man, simply by the expedient of a covenant in a marriage settlement, covenanting for a large sum of money to settle on his wife when he had no such property at all, so that any property acquired afterwards should be treated as if it were already settled and handed over. That is not really the truth of what is suggested to be the danger here. I am bound to say that since the previous discussion I have made some inquiries, and I have found out that it is not a fanciful suggestion, and that such a thing has been known as a person entering into a covenant to settle on his wife a very large sum of money without any such property being in his possession or expectation, but that when bankruptcy is imminent he has settled a very large amount, which, of course, under the covenant made on the marriage would be protected against the trustee in bankruptcy. I am not certain that the original provision is not sufficient, but at all events I think that was not one of the ideas which my noble friend beside me (Lord Salisbury) was considering when we discussed this question last. It is to be observed that the first part of the section we are dealing with is untouched by this Bill; it is only
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0192"/>
<col>375</col>
the second part, and when you look at the second part you find that what it really does is to prevent a fraudulent attempt to take what has been described as creditors' goods away from them under cover of a covenant in a marriage settlement. I cannot deny from what I hear that it has grown into a practice to covenant in this way and so protect the debtor's goods. I confess the only thing that I think they have done about it is this. They omit from this section the word "fraudulent," which I should have thought was a necessary qualification for such a proceeding and which I certainly should have inserted myself if I had been drawing up the section. On the one hand, if it is not a fraudulent transaction, I think it is right that the claim of the person interested should not be postponed until all the claims of the other creditors have been satisfied; but, on the other hand, on the hypothesis that the covenant is fraudulent, I see no reason in the world why it should not be made void altogether. That is what I should have done; but instead of that they say in this clause that notwithstanding this, which by hypothesis is fraudulent, the only thing to be done is that after everybody else is paid then the persons entitled under this fraudulent settlement are to come in. It should be one thing or the other. If it is fraudulent it ought to be set aside. If it is not fraudulent I do not understand why this colourable provision that they may come in for dividend when everybody else is paid&#x2014;circumstances in bankruptcy not often known&#x2014;is put in. In these circumstances I move to leave out the last three lines of the subsection, in order, if it is possible that the covenant may be honest although it has every symptom of fraud about it, that then the person so entitled might come in for dividend like everybody else and not be postponed until everybody else is paid.</p>

<quote>Clause 13, page 8, line 26, leave out from ("contract") to ("2A") in line 30.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Halsbury.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-00956"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: The reason why the words were inserted is this. There is really a class of cases which you cannot say are fraudulent but which are totally contrary to what public policy ought to allow. It sometimes happens when a young man is married that his father-in-law, being of a careful
<col>376</col>
disposition and more careful of his own interests and the interests of his family than those of the persons with whom the young man will be engaged in business, gets a general covenant put in to settle all the property and all the money that may come to him in the course of his business or otherwise hereafter. You cannot say that the young bridegroom is fraudulent in that case. He is acting under great pressure. The hypothesis is that he is perfectly solvent at the time and he may continue solvent for a long time. You cannot say that the covenant in this case is fraudulent, but what you can say is that it is a most objectionable covenant and one that ought not to be allowed. In a case which came before this House, sitting on the Judicial side, some of the worst features of this practice were brought to light, and great surprise was expressed that attention had not been called to the evil before. That, however, is not a reason for making the covenant absolutely and altogether bad. It may be quite a proper covenant as between the husband and his future wife. The point is that it ought not to be allowed, on grounds of public policy, to prevail so as to withdraw the husband's estate from the creditors. It was from that point of view that the draftsman acted in drawing this clause as it is now. It seems to me that that footing is a justifiable one on the ground of public policy&#x2014;that as it is not a case where fraud necessarily would arise the covenant should not be rendered void altogether. Therefore while I fully appreciate my noble and learned friend's point I suggest that the words are really most useful in the form in which they stand at the present time. They were only adopted after a great deal of consideration and examination of cases in which this kind of question had arisen.</membercontribution></p>

The Lord Chancellor will understand what it means. It is a question of the debtor's summons. It has been, I think unfortunately, decided that unless the debtor's summons is exactly accurate in respect of that matter, the Order making the adjudication may be set aside. This Amendment is only to provide, in the event of there being a tender of what the debtor really admits to be due, and that if that has been given according to the accurate fact of what is due, and he has tendered it, that that ought to prevent adjudication in bankruptcy. But unfortunately some decision has been given that it must be accurately correct. I do not understand the ground on which the decision formerly was come to, but those familiar with bankruptcy wish this Amendment to be passed. I am only intervening here for the sake of the bankruptcy official, and I think that this Amendment is right.</membercontribution></p>

The result is that unless we amend the law as it stands, even if the Amendment were inserted it might not carry out the object which my noble and learned friend has in view.

<title>UNIFORM TIME (IRELAND) BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01026" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01027">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01028"><member>THE EARL OF S HAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in asking your Lordships to give a Second Reading to this Bill I need not, I think, detain the House at any length. The principle of the Bill is a perfectly simple one. The Bill enacts that there shall be an extension of the application of British time to Ireland&#x2014;in other words, it brings about a uniformity of time between all parts of the United Kingdom. I ought, perhaps, to say by way of explanation, in case there are any noble Lords who are ignorant of the fact, that owing to the longitude of Dublin being 6&#x00B0; 20' 17" west of Greenwich there is, reckoning according to the moon four minutes to a degree, a difference of twenty-five minutes twenty-two seconds between the time of Greenwich and that of Dublin. The proposal in this Bill is to change that system and to have a uniform time, and it is a proposal which naturally must tend to unify the conditions of life between the two countries. At a time when the Government of the day are occupying the greater part of the session in passing a Bill providing separate treatment for Ireland under a. Parliament of her own for the management of her own affairs a proposal of this character may seem to some rather Utopian, and perhaps to noble Lords opposite somewhat inopportune; but apart from political grounds&#x2014;and I submit that political considerations should not enter into a proposal of this kind&#x2014;I think
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0198"/>
<col>387</col>
I can prove to your Lordships that upon every other ground the alteration is eminently desirable in the interests of the public generally and also in the interests of commerce and industry.<lb/>
This is no novel or new suggestion. As long as sixty years ago the suggestion was put forward, and pressure was brought to bear upon the Government of the day to establish a uniform time. I am bound to say that during the early portion of those sixty years all the agitation came from the commercial communities in the North of Ireland. In the year 1850 a memorial was signed and sent to the Postmaster-General on the subject, and in reply he stated that he did not deem it expedient in the then circumstances to sanction the alteration suggested. At that time I believe the Postmaster-General could have brought about the desired change on his own initiative. But owing to some legal difficulty that arose in regard to the time of the signing of a particular legal document, an Act of Parliament was passed in 1880 which legally fixed Irish time as distinct from English or Greenwich time. In foreign countries and on the Continent the desirability of a uniform time has long been recognised. Indeed, it is not long that France, Spain, and Portugal adopted Greenwich time, and to suit the convenience of industry on the Continent of Europe there is a uniform standard of time for every fifteen degrees of longitude. As it has been considered expedient on the Continent of Europe to adopt a uniform standard of time, I fail to understand why it is that we have not come to some arrangement of that sort as between all parts of the United Kingdom. Is it due, my Lords, to an innate sense of conservatism or to the fact that probably the matter has really never had serious consideration? The fact, however, remains that there are some very curious anomalies with regard to time in the United Kingdom. Take, for instance, Penzance. Penzance and a good deal of the west coast of Scotland which is on the same longitude as Dublin have no difference in time with Greenwich, and even Stornoway, which is west of Dublin, has no difference of time with Greenwich; but in Dublin we find a difference of twenty-five minutes and twenty-two seconds.<lb/>
The Chief Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland has received a great many memorials in favour of this change.
<col>388</col>
In fact, I really think that public opinion in Ireland is all in favour of a uniform system of time. All the chambers of commerce in Ireland, all the railway and steamship companies, all the county councils, urban councils, rural district councils, and the industrial and agricultural communities of the North, South, East, and West have approached the Chief Secretary for Ireland on this matter, and I believe the Government have given a sympathetic reply in every case. With regard to telegrams and telephones a uniformity of system would be, of course, of great advantage. I believe it is the fact that Greenwich time is applied to all telegrams which ate sent from Ireland at the present time, and inasmuch as telephonic communication between Ireland, England, and Scotland is very largely on the increase, it surely would be most desirable that we should have a uniform system of time. I believe I am right in saying that the Dublin Chamber of Commerce has adopted Greenwich time.<lb/>
There is another advantage which would be brought about by a uniform time. It is this, that there would he one hundred hours of daylight saved during the year, which, taken at twelve hours a day, would give the working classes, supposing the time of ceasing work is six o'clock, eight days more for recreation. As far as the saving of light is concerned it would, of course, mean a very big difference. One hundred hours of artificial lighting saved during the year would be a great boon to occupants of cottages and other humble dwellings. These, my Lords, are the principal reasons in favour of adopting a uniform system as to time, and I sincerely trust that your Lordships will agree with the principle of the Bill and give it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01030"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise to oppose this Bill, but I must say I regret that it is proposed to change Irish time. Even if this change is made there is one gratification, and that is that we still have Irish miles, Irish stew, and other Irish things, which I hope no attempt will be made to alter. The noble Earl, in moving the Second Reading of his Bill, stated that all the railway and steamship companies had agreed to this extension of the application of Greenwich time to Ireland. I am told that, on the contrary, some of the railway companies do not at all agree to
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0199"/>
<col>389</col>
this change, and that it will entail upon them a great deal of inconvenience in altering their time tables. The noble Earl said nothing about the Post Office in Ireland. What do they say about this proposal? After all, the Post Office is a most important Department with regard to time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01031"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: The Post-master-General is in favour of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01032"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: If the Post-master-General is in favour of it, then I have nothing more to say with regard to the Post Office. But from opinions I have received from various parts of Ireland I know there is opposition to this Bill. I will not, however, divided against it; but it hope the noble Earl will not attempt to alter any other Irish things.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01033"><member>LORD INVERCLYDE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when I brought this matter before the notice of your Lordship's House last March in the form of a Question, I quoted the words which the Postmaster-General has used on this subject, and if you will allow me I will read them again. On November 7 last the Postmaster-General wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"I find that the change would be of some advantage as far as Post Office arrangements are concerned provided it is made general throughout Ireland."</quote>
In reply to the noble Earl who has just sat down I cannot say that all the Irish railway companies are in favour of the proposed change, but I am prepared to say that all the big companies are in favour of it, because I have had communications from them to that effect. Personally I look at this matter entirely from a commercial point of view, and I know that there is a very general feeling in Ireland that it would be a great advantage indeed if this change were brought about. Nowadays means of communication have been so much shortened and so much increased that in respect of travelling we really are one country, and there should be uniform time. Moreover, in connection with questions with which we deal daily in commercial life I find mistakes often arise in consequence of the present difference of time. We are in communication by telephone daily with Ireland, and if a young clerk who may be telephoning forgets about the difference of time sometimes it raises serious complications. Again, under the Merchant Shipping Act we are obliged to keep a log of each steamer, and in that log Greenwich time is used; but there is a
<col>390</col>
provision in the contracts of those shipping companies which carry mails that Greenwich time must be used on this side and Irish time on the other side; and I have known occasions when returns have been asked for when confusion has arisen, and the voyage has either been made twenty-five minutes longer or twenty-five minutes shorter owing to this confusion. I am confident that if the House passes this Bill it will be a great boon to the commerce of the two countries, and will enable us to work more closely and more beneficially together than at the present time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01034"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say a word in deprecation of the passage of this measure. I cannot but imaging, however, that it will be opposed by His Majesty's Government, because they have introduced into another place a measure enabling Ireland to deal with her own affairs, the discussion of which, though temporarily postponed, is to be renewed in the autumn. They will naturally think it wrong to take time by the forelock and decide a matter which ought most properly to be left for decision to the Irish Parliament. I am very strongly opposed to the creation of an Irish Parliament, but I think this is one of the very few matters which might safely be left for it to deal with, and I would therefore strongly suggest that we should not interfere with what would come within its proper sphere of influence. It seems to me that nowadays there is zeal for decentralisation where centralisation is desirable, and, on the other hand, for centralisation where decentralisation is allowable. As an instance of the former, might I quote the zeal which some people display to revive, if possible, dialects which are only spoken by few hundred people, and whose only merit seems to be that they enables one to retain a memory of the Tower of Babel, whilst other matters like this question of time are all to be forced into drab uniformity. At any rate I think in this case we have truth on our side, because the sun when it shines in Ireland, which it does not do very often, will bear witness to this last instance of Saxon tyranny and this new grievance which is being created for Ireland. Personally I object to being obliged to get up twenty-five minutes earlier that I should do otherwise; and as far as this proposal is concerned I must declare myself a Home Ruler.</membercontribution></p>

<col>391</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01035"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, some months ago, I think in the month of March, a Question was addressed to me on this proposal, and then suggested that it might well form the subject of a private Member's Bill. Therefore I congratulate the noble Earl opposite, if I may, on having brought in his measure. I said at the time that I thought it would have the effect of ventilating the subject, and that though it was conceivable that the Bill might not get through in one session it would not do any harm to have the subject discussed. This proposal, as the noble Earl has said, is not a new one. It was first brought to the attention of the Irish Government in 1898, by I believe the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. The Irish Government consulted the Astronomer Royal for Ireland, who reported favourably on the subject and since then there has been a great volume of opinion forthcoming in favour of the proposed change. The attitude of His Majesty's Government upon this measure is that we offer no opposition to it, but in view of the fact that there is not complete unanimity on the subject we cannot promise to give it any special facilities or to make the Bill our own. The noble Earl who introduced the Bill made a speech which I think must have convinced the great majority of your Lordships of the wisdom and desirability of the proposed change. It is true that it has met with some opposition to-day in your Lordships' House. The noble Earl, Lord Mayo, seemed to think that it would affect the flavour of Irish stew.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01036"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: I did not say that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01037"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: And the noble Lord on the Cross Benches, Lord Oranmore and Browne, objected to it on the ground, with which I have very great sympathy, that before very long an Irish Parliament will Le in existence and that it might properly be left to that Irish Parliament to decide the point. I do not know that there is any national objection to the adoption of Greenwich mean time for Ireland, because a great many Continental countries have adopted Greenwich mean time. The noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, mentioned some of those countries. Let me add Belgium to the countries he mentioned. It has also been adopted in Gibraltar. The noble Earl referred to what he called the zones of time on the
<col>392</col>
Continent, and it may be interesting to know what the late Astronomer Royal for Ireland said on that subject. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"A glance at a map of Ireland shows that the meridian of 10 west longitude cuts off towards the West only very small portions of the counties of Kerry, Galway and Mayo. The local time for this meridian differs by forty minutes from Greenwich tune, and if the westernmost part of Kerry is considered the difference there is about forty-two minutes. Now I observe that on the eastern extremity of Austria the difference between standard and local time exceeds forty-five minutes; on the western boundary of Germany it is nearly thirty seven minutes; on the West of Portugal it is thirty-eight minutes; on the East of the Kingdom of Norway and Sweden it is about sixty-four minutes, and on the West nearly forty-two minutes; and on the West of Switzerland it is slightly over thirty-six minutes. I think these figures show that even at the westernmost part of Ireland the difference between local and Greenwich mean time cannot be regarded as excessive."</quote>
That is the opinion of the late Astronomer Royal for Ireland, and so it seems that, whatever difficulty may be anticipated from the difference between Greenwich and the West of Ireland, in view of Continental experience it should not be regarded as a serious drawback.<lb/>
But there is a further point to consider. Of the two extremities of Ireland&#x2014;the West and the East&#x2014;the East is by far the more important both in the matter of population and trade, and the difference between Greenwich time and that of the East of Ireland is not forty-two minutes, but twenty-five minutes twenty-one seconds. This fact is, I think, appreciated by the inhabitants of Ireland. Numerous memorials and resolutions have been received petitioning in favour of Greenwich time for Ireland. I have in my hand a list of twenty-eight, which includes, amongst others, the Chamber of Commerce of Limerick; the Chamber of Commerce of Dublin; the Chamber of Commerce of Liverpool, which I think is significant; the County Council of Dublin; the Chamber of Commerce of Waterford; the County Council of Londonderry, and the Association of Trade Protection Societies of the United Kingdom. That is, I think your Lordships will agree, a considerable body of opinion, and there are others of less importance. The noble Earl, Lord Mayo, said that many of the railway companies were opposed to this change.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01042"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: It is the opinion of one of the leading officials of that company.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01043"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: However that may be, I think we may say that the great majority of opinion in Ireland, both commercial and residential, seems to be in favour of this change. The point was raised by Lord Mayo as to the opinion of the Post Office authorities. I understand that they are favourable to the change, and think that considerable advantage would result from it; but my noble friend Lord Liverpool will be ready to inform the Home what the official opinion of the Post Office is on the subject. The noble Earl was quite right when he said that in telegraphic communication the standard of Greenwich mean time is followed. Personally I am quite convinced by Lord Shaftesbury's speech, and I think that the facts as I have been able to state them support his view.<lb/>
But when we come to the form of the Bill I ask leave to suggest certain modifications. If the noble Earl had studied the Act to which he alluded, the Act of 1880, which governs and defines the standard time for Great Britain and for Ireland, he would have seen that rather different phraseology is employed. I think it would be very undesirable to introduce into a measure of this kind language which has no reference to previous Statutes and might cause confusion, and therefore in Committee I shall venture to suggest certain alterations, striking out such words as "official time." "Official time" exists in no Statute, nor is there anything in the Act of 1880 about "rules, regulations, proclamations, or other documents." The introduction of this language is unnecessary to the noble Earl's purpose, and it would be much simpler to stick to the language now on the Statute Book. Subject to these Amendments the Government offer no opposition to the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01045"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I took them in their order. I see on again referring to the list that the Chamber of Commerce of Belfast and the railway and steamship companies and many manufacturers and merchants of Belfast have petitioned in favour of this change. I thought that the mere fact that the noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, had introduced the Bill was enough to show that Belfast was not against it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01046"><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to state the view of the Post Office regarding this Bill.

<title>FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01102"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government how it happened that cattle that were in a diseased state were shipped from Dublin to England for sale. In putting this Question I do not wish to say anything about the seriousness of foot-and-mouth disease and how the outbreak has practically dislocated the cattle trade both of England and Ireland, but I desire to draw attention to some occurrences which took place before the outbreak of the disease was reported to the Irish Department of Agriculture. On Saturday, June 22, cattle from a farm at Swords, near Dublin, were shipped to Liverpool, and on that very day a quack veterinary doctor, not a veterinary surgeon, was called to that farm and treated some of the cattle there for what he chose to call "timber tongue." In answer to a Question put to him in the House of Commons on July 3 the Vice-President of the Irish Department of Agriculture said&#x2014;
<quote>"We ascertained the fact that certain cattle which were sick had that very day been sent to Dublin from this farm. That is a fact of very great importance. It was concealed from the Department; none of the local authorities were aware of the disease on this farm."</quote>
I quite admit that if the Department had been aware of this disease they naturally
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0204"/>
<col>399</col>
would have taken the very stringent action which they have since taken.<lb/>
But the question I wish particularly to ask is this. How was it that on the day when these cattle were in the port of Dublin, before being shipped to Liverpool, the veterinary inspectors in Dublin did not notice that the cattle were suffering from disease? I am told on the best authority that when cattle land at Liverpool they are not examined; and the whole thing was not found out in this case until Thursday, June 27&#x2014;five days after the cattle had been shipped from Dublin&#x2014;when it was discovered by the inspectors of the Liverpool Corporation abattoirs after the animals had been slaughtered. They communicated, of course, with the Dublin authorities, who took the necessary steps. There is no doubt whatever that the disease was taken from Dublin to Liverpool and so distributed throughout the country, because all the animals were not slaughtered on arrival. I do not wish to blame the Department of Agriculture in Ireland in any way, because since they knew of the existence of the disease they have issued most stringent orders, so much so that at present you actually cannot even move a beast across the high road from one field to another in the counties of Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare, and Meath. I should also like to ask whether there is likely to be any prosecution in regard to this matter under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, because there is no doubt that the herd on this farm must have known of the existence of disease. Whether he knew it was foot-and-mouth disease or not, that is another question. I believe the answer given in the House of Commons by Mr. T. W. Russell, the Vice-President of the Irish Agricultural Department, was that if a prosecution would lie no doubt there would be a prosecution.<lb/>
We have not had foot-and-mouth disease in Ireland since the year 1884, and it is conceivable that a generation of herds and also veterinary surgeons have grown up who have not seen this disease in existence and are only aware of it from writings and from their studies. I therefore venture to suggest to our Department&#x2014;and I hope the suggestion will be taken in good part&#x2014;that a notice for the information of farmers and others should be inserted in all the Irish newspapers, and alto posted on all the police barracks, setting forth clearly the
<col>400</col>
symptoms of this disease. I am strengthened in this desire by the fact that the Board of Agriculture in England issued last week a description of the symptoms of foot-and-mouth disease. I wish our Department would also publish particulars of the symptoms of the disease for the use of farmers and others concerned in Ireland. I hope we shall have a clear answer as to the inspection of these cattle before they left Dublin. It has never come out whether or not some of the cattle actually inspected by the quack veterinary doctor were shipped from Dublin to Liverpool.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01103"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl asks, in effect, how it was that this epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease, which apparently originated in Ireland, was not detected by the veterinary officers appointed for the purpose of inspecting cattle shipped from Ireland. To answer that is to explain how it is an epidemic of any kind or description ever originates. The reply is that in all these diseases there is a period of incubation of greater or less duration during which, or during part of which, and especially during the initial stages of which, no symptoms exist which would enable anybody to diagnose the disease. Of course, when once aware that there is an epidemic raging people are more on the look out, periods of quarantine are established, and it is possible to hem in and restrict the epidemic; but in the early stages before any suspicion exists&#x2014;and no suspicion did exist in this case&#x2014;it is extremely difficult to detect the symptoms. That is actually what happened in this case.<lb/>
The noble Earl knows very well that all cattle exported from Ireland are subjected to veterinary examination and are branded. In this case the contaminated cattle coming from the Swords farm were purchased in Dublin Market on June 20 and were shipped on June 22. Therefore all the cattle with which they were brought in contact could only have acquired the disease two days and five hours previous to their being examined for export. The period of incubation in foot-and-mouth disease varies, I am told, from two to ten days; the minimum is two days, and I suppose the average lies somewhere between that and the maximum of ten days. Our theory is, and indeed it seems perfectly obvious, that in this case the disease had not declared itself in the minimum period
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0205"/>
<col>401</col>
of two days during which these particular cattle had been subjected to infection. Consequently as there were no symptoms the disease was not detected. There is some confirmation of this view in the fact that the cattle which were shipped to Liverpool and examined on being landed there were passed by the authorities as sound; and, further, the Liverpool butchers who slaughtered the cattle failed to detect the disease, and it was only subsequently that some evidence of it was found in the offal. It therefore seems clear in this particular case that the disease could not have developed at the time when the cattle were subjected to veterinary examination in Ireland. Another batch of infected cattle were shipped to Holyhead and then conveyed to Oldham. Those cattle were slaughtered at Oldham, but no evidence of the disease was found there. In this connection I am told that it is quite possible for cattle to convey the disease without being infected themselves&#x2014;that an animal may carry it without ever showing any symptoms of it; and it is quite conceivable that these particular cattle from the Swords district, which did, in fact, infect other cattle with which they came in contact, did not have the disease themselves and therefore would not show any symptoms which would enable the veterinary authorities to guard against the disease.<lb/>
The noble Earl has asked whether any prosecution is in contemplation. I am informed that the Irish Government have laid the case before the Law Officers of the Crown, and that if it appears that there is a case for prosecution a prosecution will follow. Then the noble Earl suggested that notices giving particulars as to the symptoms of foot-and-mouth disease should
<col>402</col>
be circulated in Ireland through the agency of the Press for the information of farmers. I will bring the noble Earl's suggestion to the attention of the authorities, and I have no doubt they will be prepared to give it favourable consideration.</membercontribution></p>

About ten years ago I ventured to introduce a Betting Bill. Your Lordships did not agree with that Bill, but you appointed a Committee to consider the subject, of which Committee the noble Earl, Lord Durham, was chairman. That Committee took a great deal of valuable evidence and presented a Report which resulted in Lord Davey's Street Betting Bill, which passed through both Houses and became law. That Act has produced, I think every one will allow, very valuable results, but it only touched the fringe of the question and left many mischievous operations undealt with. Conscious that that Act only touched the fringe of the question, we have since then waited patiently in the hope that His Majesty's Government would take up the further legislation necessary. We applied to the Home Office as long ago as the time when Lord (then Mr. Herbert) Gladstone was in charge there, and were told that he had a Bill on the stocks. Consequently we waited with patience for that Bill to appear. We are still given to understand that the Home Secretary has a Bill on the stocks, but the delay has been so long that we have some of us almost come to believe that Ministers live on hope deferred and expect us to do the same. Consequently I have ventured to introduce this Bill, for which I am now asking a Second Reading.<lb/>
I should have hesitated to introduce this Bill because I am conscious that I have no influence with your Lordships, and I am an old man and increasingly disinclined to take any part in matters of controversy; but I have been led to introduce it on the suggestion of one of the greatest and most distinguished of English living jurists, Sir Edward Fry. The first draft of this Bill was his draft. I have modified some of the provisions and added some others, but the whole of the Bill, I think I may venture to say, has Sir Edward Fry's sanction, and it is on that high authority, my Lords, that I ask you to give it a Second Reading to-day.
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0209"/>
<col>409</col>
I desire noble Lords to bear in mind that I am asking no more to-day than that the Bill should be read a second time. I am well aware that there may be this or that particular in the Bill to which some reasonable objection may be taken, and I should like to say at the outset that I would welcome any reasonable Amendment. The Bill has a good deal of popular support behind it.<lb/>
I think it is not necessary for me to detain your Lordships by dwelling upon the need of some such Bill. I have in my hand a letter which I received yesterday from a gentleman in Manchester. Not long ago an Anti-Gambling League was formed for Lancashire and Cheshire and the neighbouring district, and hearing that I intended to introduce this Bill they asked to see a copy of it, and in the very short interval that has intervened they have secured no fewer than 21,000 signatures in support of the Bill, and the secretary informs me that if he had had a little longer time he could have got 100,000 quite easily. He also informs me that the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> and the <i>Manchester Evening News,</i> two of the most important newspapers in the country, and nearly all the Lancashire and Cheshire journals are giving the Bill their support, so that I think I may fairly ask your Lordships to note that in the only part of England in which opinion upon the Bill has been taken it has received a very large amount of influential support. This support comes, I am told, from employers of labour, from the various churches, from the wage-earners, and, in fact, from every class of society in Manchester and the neighbourhood. With regard to the need of such a Bill, I am sure your Lordships would feel that it is not necessary for me to take up your time with any lengthy remarks on that subject. I will only on that point refer you to what the same writer says with regard to Manchester and the neighbourhood. During the last three years, he says, they have had no fewer than ninety-five cases of women bookmakers and betting agents carrying on a considerable business with other women and with boys and girls in Lancashire and Cheshire and the Midlands. He mentions that in order to show that this is not only an evil but a growing and spreading evil, and one that is likely to do more and more harm if we leave it unchecked.<lb/>
As to the provisions of the Bill, I should like to say that its central and essential
<col>410</col>
part is contained in the first subsection, which deals with advertisements and similar notifications with regard to any betting business. Then, again, it deals particularly with betting odds and starting prices. With regard to most of these provisions it deals, of course, with prospective events&#x2014;information which is given with a view to induce persons to bet on coming events. It is necessary, however, if the great evil of popular betting and gambling and the craze of it is to be put an end to, that starting prices should no longer be published after a race is run because they thus become instruments of gaming. Another provision deals with lotteries and such like gambling competitions. I think it possible that a good many of your Lordships may wish the word "competition," as being possibly liable to certain ambiguity, to be omitted. If the Bill should reach the Committee stage and any one will show that it will be an improvement to omit the word "competition" from the Bill or to substitute the words "gambling competition" I shall be quite prepared to accept an Amendment to that effect.<lb/>
The concluding portion of the Bill deals with perhaps a more difficult and delicate matter&#x2014;I refer to the clause under which the Postmaster-General is given power, where there is reasonable ground to believe any person or persons to be engaged in receiving money, and so on, and to be spreading inducements for betting, to refuse the facilities of the Post Office to such person or persons. It may be thought that the Post Office should be entirely neutral in such matters, but I venture to think that this abuse in connection with a great Department of State, provided by State means for the good of the people at large, ought to be stopped. Your Lordships probably know better than I do the sort of abuse to which betting agents put the Post Office, but some little time ago there came into my hands two entirely mischievous circular letters. One had been sent to a great Manchester engineering firm and the other to a great engineering firm in Hull. Those circular letters set forth all sorts of attractive inducements to working men to bet, and each of them was addressed to the foreman fitter in that great firm and the inducement they held out in each case was that if the foreman fitter would become their agent in the firm he should have so much per cent. of all the takings. I venture to think that that is
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0210"/>
<col>411</col>
an abominable kind of trade, and I cannot but feel that it would be reasonable for the Postmaster-General to have power to stop persons conducting that kind of trade from availing themselves of the facilities of the Post Office.<lb/>
I have also added a clause with reference to the facilities of the telegraph and telephone service. I am told that it is quite common in connection with races for special telegraphic arrangements to be made chiefly for the benefit of bookmakers and betting tradesmen, and I am told also that the telephone, on the occasion of certain races, is practically monopolised by the betting fraternity for the greater part of the business day, thus interfering with the natural operations of wholesome and useful business; so that I think there is a very strong case made out for some action which should restrict the use of the Post Office by these betting traders. Again I venture to say that if the Bill reaches the Committee stage and any one has a better proposal to suggest than that contained in Clause 4, I for my part shall gratefully accept it. Those are the main provisions of the Bill. I am well aware that the Bill has been called in certain quarters a drastic Bill, but, my Lords, the word "drastic" only means effective. If a Bill is to be worth anything it ought to be effective, and not a mere pretence or sham or a thing that could be easily evaded, and what may seem to be somewhat sweeping in some of the clauses is really only an endeavour to stop the loopholes of evasion and to secure that the bookmaker and the betting agent and all that class of persons shall no longer be free without restrictions to pursue their trade.<lb/>
I know it may be said by some persons that we have here an attempt to stop betting by Act of Parliament. I venture to think that this Bill does nothing of the kind. It is aimed simply at the betting trade; it leaves every man, to whatever class of society he may belong, perfectly free to ruin himself if he likes by betting, and I venture to think that it interferes with no reasonable liberty on matters of sport. It is not in any way directed against English sport. Its aim is to purify and cleanse our English sport. There are no greater sportsmen than many who belong to this House, and they are particularly careful, every one of them, to have their stables and
<col>412</col>
their kennels thoroughly cleansed and purified, and I venture to think we ought to do no less for the atmosphere of our public life. Therefore I would press this point, that this Bill is simply intended to restrict the operations of the betting trade, which is mainly a noxious and parasitic trade having no real virtue or benefit in it at all. I venture to put it to your Lordships that it is the business of the Legislature to make wrong-doing harder and a good and honest life easier. That is no sentiment of my own, but an old sentiment that Mr. Gladstone uttered long ago upon some occasion.<lb/>
I observe that three noble Lords have given notice of their intention to move the rejection of this Bill to-day. I have observed it with some surprise, because I feel that any one reading the Bill with a dispassionate mind will see that if there are any lines in it to which he objects they could be easily cut out without interfering with the substance of the Bill. I venture to think that those noble Lords who thus take up an attitude of uncompromising opposition are, if they do nothing more, assuming a grave responsibility in view of the evil for which this trade is responsible amongst the masses of our people. Two of the noble Lords who have given notice of an Amendment to reject the Bill are well-known patrons of the Turf. They are great authorities on all matters connected with the Turf, and your Lordships will naturally be inclined to give more weight to their views than to mine. I make no complaint of their opposition to the Bill on one condition, but on one condition only. If they oppose my humble efforts and frustrate them, then I say they are in honour bound to produce something better to cure the evil. They are well acquainted with the mischief which this noxious trade is doing in our public life. They are bound, I say&#x2014;<i>noblesse oblige</i>&#x2014;to do something to cure the mischief if they will not allow other people to do so. That is my plea to those noble Lords who, as I understand, are about to move the rejection of this Bill. And I will make the plea in the familiar words of a Roman poet whose authority I venture to think may be placed very high. My plea to each of them is simply this&#x2014;

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01162"><member>THE EARL OF DURHAM</member> had given notice, on the Motion for the Second Reading, to move "That the Bill be read a second time this day six months." The noble Earl said: My Lords. I deeply regret that I left school so long ago that I cannot translate the concluding sentence in the right rev. Prelate's speech. I am disappointed that the right rev. Prelate spoke with so little conviction. I did think that in bringing forward a Bill like this he would show to your Lordships that he entertained some belief that it was a good Bill and one to which the House might accord a Second Reading; but all that I could gather from the Lord Bishop's speech was that he had consulted certain persons in Manchester and that these persons had expressed their approval of a Bill which he has not submitted to the approval of any one else in the United Kingdom. I suppose he was acting on the old saying that what Lancashire thinks to-day England will think to-morrow. The right rev. Prelate said that if longer time had been allowed the writer of the letter to him could have obtained 100,000 signatures in favour of the Bill. I have not canvassed for any vote against the Bill, but I venture to say that I could without any difficulty have obtained 500,000 signatures against it. I attach no importance to the fact that Sir Edward Fry is more or less responsible for the clauses of this Bill. I think I shall be able to show your Lordships that the Bill is not only drastic, but is tyrannical and preposterous. The right rev. Prelate made the appeal that he did not wish to enter into controversial matters at his age, and he said he knew that his views were not, perhaps, acceptable to this House. I do not wish to be offensive in any way to the right rev. Prelate. As he informed the House, I served on the Betting Committee with him for many months and we were on those terms on which two gentlemen should be with one another; but I am afraid I must charge him with disingenuousness in introducing this Bill. He has brought forward the Bill to destroy a great evil. What is the evil which he wishes to destroy? I presume he wishes to destroy betting.</p>

Prelate tries to induce this House to accept a Bill which deals with advertisements, competitions, and so on, inflicts grave penalties on the unfortunate people who run newspapers, and imposes upon the Postmaster-General a new statutory duty. I am no authority on law, but there are other noble Lords in this House who are great authorities and whose judgment in that respect I accept. I would remind your Lordships that when Lord Davey brought in his Betting Bill in 1903 I moved the rejection of that measure and my Motion was accepted. Towards the end of that debate the then Lord Chancellor, Lord Halsbury&#x2014;and I am very glad to see the noble and learned Earl here to-day&#x2014;made a very short but effective speech, and I would ask your Lordships to allow me to read a short portion of it and what I am going to read will bear me out in the statement I made that the right rev. Prelate is disingenuous in bringing forward this Bill. Lord Halsbury said on that occasion&#x2014;
<quote>"It is said the Bill proceeds on the principle of abolishing street betting; and against that practice there is much to be said, for it comes within the ordinary description of a nuisance. If it were confined to this object I would have some hesitation in voting against the Bill; but it is not so confined, and the authors of the Bill have not the courage of their opinions. If they mean to make betting an offence to be visited with penalties, why do they not bring in a Bill to prohibit betting? It is an extremely awkward thing to impose a number of penalties with ludicrous conundrums for His Majesty's Judges to solve, because the framers of the Bill will not say what they mean. If betting is to be made an offence, why not say so? The authors of the Bill have not the courage to say what they really mean; and the House is asked to go into legislation not dealing with the substance of a subject, getting rid of the responsibility for dealing with the substance, and going about the edge of it without touching it. Whether betting is right or wrong is a question I will not discuss&#x2014;I will only say that betting is not the only form of gambling, and if we are going to make it an offence for any person to do something ancillary to betting, which is not an offence, treating him as a rogue, then we are embarking upon a very objectionable species of legislation; and I shall unhesitatingly vote against the Second Heading of such a Bill. I protest against the idea that after discussion among the members of a divided Committee the House should give a Second Reading to a Bill on the understanding that two-thirds of it should be struck out."</quote>
The right rev. Prelate has invited Amendments. He said he would be quite prepared to accept Amendments so long as the House agreed to the principle of the Bill.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0212"/>
<col>415</col>
I was surprised to hear him say "we" did this; "we" submitted this Bill to Manchester. He did not say who "we" were. We do not know who his supporters are; we do not know who drew up this Bill except that he named in that connection Sir Edward Fry, whom I have never seen on a race-course. When the right rev. Prelate was serving on the Select Committee on Betting he had some advisers there who are well known to a good many people, and they used to supply him with the information he required, and amongst other things they gave him their advice upon tipsters' advertisements. There is no man in this House, and I do not think there is anybody outside this House, who dislikes what are known as tipsters' advertisements more than I do. I think they are most objectionable, and I should like to see them abolished. That was the feeling of the whole of the members of the Betting Committee. My noble friend Lord Newton is here, and he will remember perfectly well that we all agreed on that Committee that these advertisements were objectionable and ought to be suppressed. It is easy for the right rev. Prelate to say that this is an innocent Bill. It is nothing of the sort. He confounds these tipsters with the men who write in the high-class newspapers and give expert information on various events which are of popular interest. It is ridiculous to confound the two. The right rev. Prelate ought to know that as well as anybody, because he constantly came to the meetings of the Betting Committee with his pockets stuffed full of tipsters' circulars. One well-known gentleman who gave evidence at great length and very fairly before that Committee was Mr. John Hawke, the hon. secretary of the National Anti-Gambling League. The right rev. Prelate used to be very fond of the Anti-Gambling League&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

I notice by <i>The Times</i> of the 4th instant that you are opposing the Bill to be introduced this week, and on going through it I am not in the least surprised, for although we look upon you as one who wishes to curb the system of professional betting, which, now that it has got a firm hold on football, is worse than ever, we could not expect or wish you to concur in a measure that apparently subjects any boy selling a newspaper describing Henley Regatta or the Bisley Rifle Meeting to a penalty of &#x00A3;100 or hard labour. You would do prudent reformers a service if you would make it clear, should you speak upon the subject, that the League deprecates the bringing fore and of this ill-drawn Bill."</quote>
The right rev. Prelate gave a sketchy account of this Bill and made out that it was harmless and would not have any deterrent effect on people who wished to ruin themselves by betting. It is misleading to call this a Gambling Advertisements Bill only, because it is not confined to advertisements in the ordinary acceptance of the word.<lb/>
The right rev. Prelate also, in the very first subsection of the first clause, departs from the recommendation of the Betting Committee. There again he may be right, and the remainder of the Betting Committee may be wrong. We thought it was not in the interests of morality that starting prices should be abolished, because it was thought that fraudulent bookmakers would thereby be enabled to mislead the public. We on the Betting Committee therefore thought that the publication of starting price odds should not be prohibited. Then the right. rev. Prelate provides that no one shall advertise or describe any competition for which the prize or reward exceeds &#x00A3;5 in value unless he obtains the consent of the Home Secretary or the President of the Board of Trade. I do not think the right rev. Prelate can contradict me when I say that this clause would prevent advertisements for competitions for entrance scholarships to public schools unless they were authorised by the Home Secretary or the Board of Trade; and as to racing, it would be absolutely impossible for any newspaper to advertise any race, for no race is run of less value than &#x00A3;100. It
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0213"/>
<col>417</col>
would be impossible, therefore, for anybody to know what races were taking place, and the result would be that horse-racing would be abolished altogether.<lb/>
What is the good of abolishing horse-racing after all? The right rev. Prelate's object is this. He thinks that if he can destroy horse-racing he will destroy betting, but he has only to study contemporary history to know that he is quite wrong. Recent legislation has practically stopped horse-racing in the State of New York, but the effect has not been to suppress betting. I read in a newspaper the other day that betting took place in a house in New York as to which lady had the greatest number of gowns. These ladies proceeded upstairs and appeared at intervals in different gowns, and one lady who made her fifty-first appearance in a decorated nightgown was given the prize on condition that she wore it for the rest of the evening. If the right rev. Prelate by this Bill were to put a stop to horse-racing there might be betting on ladies' dresses. And then his course would be quite clear. He would have to bring in a Bill to this effeet&#x2014;"Be it enacted that on and after a certain date women shall wear no clothes." That would be a very effective way of stopping a good deal of speculation. Clause 4, imposing a statutory duty upon the Postmaster-General, is really so astounding that I hope His Majesty's Government will not express their approval of it. It is not a discretionary power which is proposed; it is a duty to be imposed upon the Postmaster-General to deprive me, if I wish to bet with a bookmaker, of the facilities of the Post Office. Again, taking these wretched boys into custody for selling newspapers is really an action which I should hardly have thought a dignitary of the Church would propose. Does the right rev. Prelate expect every boy who sells newspapers to read through the newspaper from one end to the other to see whether it contains any advertisement which is a misdemeanour under this Bill? It is incredible that anybody should suggest such a thing. Yet these boys have to be their own Press censors, and the police can arrest them summarily and march them off to the police station.<lb/>
The right rev. Prelate attacks every event that takes place in this country&#x2014;racing, games, sport, competitions and lotteries. He has inserted most absurd restrictions. I hope your Lordships will
<col>418</col>
not accept such a foolish Bill as this. There are a great many social, economic and industrial questions which have to be solved, and it will require all our patriotic co-operation with all classes to carry these out satisfactorily. I am one of those who are sanguine enough to think that we shall be able to solve them, and I base my belief on my faith and confidence in the love of fair-play which is characteristic of the British nation. That love of fair-play has been fostered and encouraged for generations by free and honourable indulgence in sports which the country loves so much. Our very language shows what an influence these sports have had upon our national character. If you say that a politician is "hitting below the belt," everybody understands the allusion. If you mention that we are to have a "fair field and no favour," every one knows what that means. In bringing forward a Bill like this, attempting to stop an evil which he describes as the gambling trade but which I prefer to call by the shorter name "betting," the right rev. Prelate is disingenuous. He is trying to get your Lordships to pass what he says is a harmless Bill, but in reality he wishes to prohibit betting and make it a crime. I ask you to tell the right rev. Prelate to leave these amusements to the people who understand them, to those who are anxious and active in trying to keep these sports up to a high standard, to those in whom the people have confidence, to those who by their high sense of honour are trying to keep up the reputation we have throughout the world as straightforward, honest sportsmen. I also ask your Lordships not to sanction such a Bill as this, which imposes such restrictions on our Press. Our Press is the most reliable and the most independent and most decent in the world. Why are we to impose upon them all sorts of foolish restrictions? Speaking in the House of Commons yesterday Sir Edward Grey said that in Western countries there is a general understanding that there is to be freedom of the Press. "I do not like," he said, "Press prosecutions; I should like them to be as few as possible." I venture to say that we should have endless Press prosecutions if we accepted this reactionary Bill. Many of us are fortunate enough to be able to afford to hunt, shoot, and fish. We cannot, in the nature of things, share these recreations and indulgences with hundreds of thousands of other men who are just as good sportsmen as we are ourselves. But in racing, in football, in cricket, and in other
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0214"/>
<col>419</col>
sports we do share our recreations and we all meet on common ground. We are in common sympathy with exhibitions of skill, pluck, and endurance. One motto unites us all, and that is, "Let the best man win." I ask your Lordships not to break up that fellowship by passing this Bill. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01170"><member>LORD ST. DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that the right rev. Prelate was actuated by the most excellent motives in bringing in this Bill, and that he intended it really to hit at gambling advertisements. He very kindly offered to accept Amendments, and if that really was the intention of the promoters of this Bill and the people behind it I should say it certainly needed amendment. I have been reading the first clause of the Bill and endeavouring to understand it. What it does, among other things, is this. It says that whosoever shall print, publish, &amp;c., any newspaper or document which advertises or describes any competition offering money or valuable things as prizes or rewards exceeding the sum of &#x00A3;5 in value shall be guilty of a misdemeanour. What does that cover? I have been trying to think what it does not cover. It certainly covers the advertising of every single race of every kind where a money prize or reward is offered. In other words, if you want to get up athletic sports or races you must not advertise the fact. Then if you get up a cattle-show there is, of course, a competition for prizes, but if this Bill passes you must never advertise your local agricultural show. Down in Wales we have a great national institution which we call the Eisteddfod which involves contests for money prizes for singing, &amp;c., but if this Bill became law we could never hold an Eisteddfod again. These illustrations alone show that this Bill does stand in need of amendment at any rate.<lb/>
The noble Earl who moved the rejection of the Bill spoke in favour of sport as a whole, and it is not necessary for me to add a word to what he said upon that subject. But I should like to say this. Those of us who go racing know that the great bulk of private people who bet do not bet with any idea of making money in the long run. They put on small sums&#x2014;if they are poor
<col>420</col>
men, a few shillings; if they are rich men, a few pounds&#x2014;they put this money on as an expression of their individual opinion. If you asked nine out of ten or nineteen out of twenty of the men who make bets, they would tell you that they know that in the long run they will lose money by it, but it amuses them. They lose a little on balance, but it is an amusement to them as an expression of opinion. That is what betting is with the great bulk of the people who go racing. I submit to your Lordships that betting which constitutes a very small item in a man's expenditure is a perfectly harmless amusement which ought not to be stopped.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01171"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF HEREFORD</member><membercontribution>: This Bill will not stop it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01172"><member>LORD ST. DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: The right rev. Prelate says this Bill will not stop it. In that I differ from him. What is the object of the Bill if it is not to stop it? I think it will stop it, because a man who wants to go racing and to have a few shillings on a horse is not to know when a race is to take place, for advertisements of races are to be put an end to. The right rev. Prelate stated that he would allow any man who wanted to bet in a big way to ruin himself. My view is that a man who bets in a small way is doing a harmless act, but the man who bets in a big way is doing a foolish act. But you cannot stop him. If you prevent his betting on horses he will bet in some other way. The right rev. Prelate said he had support for this Bill, and he gave us an illustration from Manchester. My view is that the love of sport, and particularly the love of racing, which this Bill would hit, is deep-seated among the people. For years before I was a member of your Lordships' House I represented a Welsh constituency in another place, and in that constituency during those years I bred horses, trained horses, and raced horses, and not one single person all those years ever objected. I believe that the bulk of the people of this country, whether they bet or not, like racing, like sport, and like the opportunity of a man putting a few shillings on a race if he chooses.<lb/>
This Bill, if passed, would undoubtedly stop all speculation that took the form of betting, and, if so, it must undoubtedly stop racing. Racing is a very expensive amusement for owners of race-horses. It is a very expensive amusement even now
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0215"/>
<col>421</col>
when stakes are large, but the giving of high stakes for races is only possible because you have a large attendance of the public. If the public are not allowed to have a little money on a race when they go racing the attendance of the public will cease, there will be no funds available for the sport, and racing will undoubtedly dwindle away in this country as it has dwindled away in parts of America where betting has been made illegal. The right rev. Prelate spoke with great admiration of the Street Betting Act, with which I myself bad a certain amount of sympathy. I think it is not at all a bad thing that street betting, which gets hold of a number of poor people, should be made at any rate somewhat difficult. But I would like to tell your Lordships an experience of my own. During the winter after the Street Betting Act became law I went to a steeplechase meeting in the Midlands. The weather was singularly unpleasant, and I was surprised to see, in spite of the weather, a much larger attendance of the general public than I had ever seen at that particular place before. I asked one of the officials why it was. "Oh," said he, "we have to thank the promoters of the Street Betting Act for it." He said that before that Act was passed workingmen in the Midland towns used to put a shilling on with a bookmaker when going to their work in the morning, but now that they were not allowed to do this the men knock off work one or two days in the week and went racing where they could bet as they liked. That is one of the results of the Street Betting Act.<lb/>
I would point out to any noble Lord who is thinking of supporting this Bill that it is not only racing you have to think about. If you are to stop people betting you must stop cricket, football, foot races, and every form of athletics. People will bet on one thing or another. I cannot argue in favour of betting any more than I can argue in favour of any other form of speculation. The instinct to speculate is in the human race. Why is it any more wrong to have an opinion on a horse and to back it with money than to have an opinion on stocks and shares, or on iron or tin or sugar or any other article of produce and bet on that? because that is what you can do in the City any day to any extent. Betting is one of the humblest forms that the desire to speculate takes among mankind. I used to know a gentleman who made a large fortune by speculating in cotton. He had
<col>422</col>
a most pious horror of betting. He regarded it as the device of the evil one. Yet he carried on operations in cotton compared with which the wildest betting would be conservative business. What is the good of trying to stamp out a thing that is in the open The betting trade has not much sympathy; but, after all, the bookmaker is only the medium between hundreds of different people who want to make bets but cannot conveniently bet with one another. If you were to altogether stamp out betting in the open, what you would do would be to drive it indoors. We know that in London there are plenty of places where foolish people gamble at cards all the afternoon and evening, and gamble probably at very unsatisfactory odds with the chances all against them. You can stop betting out of doors if you like, but the result will be to drive it indoors.<lb/>
If this Bill were to pass, any newspaper that published the betting on, say, an election in America could be prosecuted. There is a Presidential election about to take place in America. You constantly see in the English papers that the betting on one of the two candidates is so and so. If that announcement appeared in a newspaper after this Bill had become law it would be illegal, and the editor might be sent to prison. But you could go to Lloyds, and, if you liked to pay a premium, they would give you a policy against the contingency of a particular one of the two candidates winning that election. That would still be left by this Bill. And when you think of that, can you wonder that foreigners, watching our English way of conducting our affairs, say that we are the most astounding race of hypocrites the world has ever produced? There are many other reasons for voting against this Bill. I rejoice that the rejection of it has been moved and seconded from this [the Liberal] side of the House, because I for one should be very reluctant that people outside should believe that the Party to which we belong are a party of kill-joys.<lb/>
As a whole it seems to me there is too little pleasure and amusement in the world, not too much. We take our pleasure in different ways. People outside may think that the members of your Lordships' House are largely occupied in racing and in amusements of that kind. Those of us who go racing know that the members of
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0216"/>
<col>423</col>
your Lordships' House who indulge in this form of amusement are very few indeed. It is a very small minority of this House who are ever seen on a race-course. I am afraid that the majority of you are like the psalmist in that you have no pleasure in the strength of a horse. I hope, whether your Lordships care about racing or not, you will vote against this Bill, and will take the advice of an old poet and not&#x2014;

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01173"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is pretty evident that a Bill which unites in opposition to it my noble friend Lord Durham, the noble Lord who has just sat down. Mr. John Hawke, and the Anti-Gambling League is one which is not likely to be crowned with much success, and, to make use of sporting parlance, the chances of the Bill are represented at the present moment by that 1,000 to 3 figure with which some of us are familiar. But the harsh and unfeeling manner in which this Bill has been received by the two political associates of the right rev. Prelate impel me to discover whether there is not some good in this measure, and I am bound to say that so far as I am concerned it appears to me, whatever its demerits may be, to be a perfectly honest and straightforward measure. Now the public attitude towards gambling and betting is the exact opposite; it is not honest and it is certainly not straightforward.<lb/>
Consider for a moment the method in which we act. We enact with great pomp and solemnity that although betting is not a penal offence, a gambling house is a thing which ought not to be allowed to exist; that gambling in public places ought to be prohibited; and that incitements and facilities for betting in public places should be severely punished. In pursuance of these views we harry street bookmakers and prevent them plying their trade in streets and places of that kind. But, on the other hand, we tolerate betting on race-courses because, owing to some ingenious legal jugglery, a racecourse is not a "place." We tolerate betting offices on the ground that you do not "resort" to them if you confine your operations to letters, telegrams, and telephonic communications instead of paying money over the counter. And, in addition to that, we allow every kind of inducement
<col>424</col>
to every kind of gambling and betting to appear in the most public place of all&#x2014;namely, in the columns of the daily newspaper. We go further, because in order to give still greater facilities for gambling the Post Office, as was pointed out by the right rev. Prelate, places all its facilities at the disposal of people who want to make bets.<lb/>
But the most striking instance of national hypocrisy was afforded lately by an organ for which I expect the right rev. Prelate entertains considerable admiration&#x2014;namely, the <i>Daily News.</i> The <i>Daily News</i> is a paper which considers that it has a special mission to elevate mankind, and a considerable portion of the <i>Daily News</i> was, at all events up to a short time ago, devoted to denouncing the vices and the sins of gambling; yet the proprietors of the <i>Daily News</i> were at the same time the proprietors of a paper called the <i>Star,</i> which is solely a journalistic success on account of the successful advice which it is supposed to give to speculators. I do not think you can discover an instance of more slimy hypocrisy than this. Here is the <i>Daily News</i> able to denounce gambling on the one hand, with the satisfaction, on the other, of being able to make a large profit out of gambling intelligence and gambling prophecies. This burden of hypocrisy eventually proved too great even for the <i>Daily News</i> to bear, and this paper I observe has fallen from grace and now publishes racing news and starting prices like every other unregenerate organ; and I think the only thing they draw the line at is that, so far as I know, they do not own a sporting prophet. As a matter of fact, the solitary journalistic worshipper at the anti-gambling shrine is the <i>Manchester Guardian,</i> and I think that paper, much as I dislike it, is entitled to a certain amount of admiration on that score.<lb/>
For my part I am quite unashamed in this matter. I sat on the Betting Committee with the noble Earl opposite, and I came to the conclusion, as every other member did, that betting could not be stopped however much you tried to stop it. If you cannot stop betting, and admit, as we all did unanimously, that it is not a crime in itself, then it seems to me that the obvious thing to do is to recognise the fact and to regulate it, and, I am not ashamed to say, tax it; and I should like
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0217"/>
<col>425</col>
to tax it to such an extent that the revenue of bookmakers would be very much reduced. It is argued that if you did this people might be encouraged to bet more than now because there would be greater responsibility attached to the person they bet with. Therefore the main argument in favour of our present hypocritical system is that it is a good system because a number of people may bet who run the risk of being welshed and swindled.<lb/>
To return to the Bill&#x2014;and I apologise for my excursus&#x2014;the Committee of which I was a member came unanimously to the conclusion that, whilst betting was not a crime in itself, there was a great deal too much of it, and that its spread was largely due to the advertisements and to the help so largely given to it by the Press. Even my noble friend opposite, Lord Durham, agreed, if I remember right, to those words. There was certainly a general agreement that betting, if possible, should be confined to race-courses. I will go further and say that everybody on that Committee was agreed that betting and gambling were really made far too easy for the general public. Everybody knows what the position is at the present moment. We are all, even respectable persons like myself, inundated with circulars, and judging from the number that we receive ourselves it can well he imagined what numbers are received by the rising generation. Then, as has been pointed out, there are innumerable inducements to bet upon all sorts of games. There are innumerable guessing competitions of a singularly futile character, and which I think are not infrequently won by the staff of the paper which organises them. On the top of this you have temptation literally staring you in, the face in the shape of the daily Press and the halfpenny so-called evening newspapers which appear in the middle of the day and which are really nothing but racing sheets. The newspapers, whatever may be said, really teach people how to bet, and they make things as easy as possible for people who want to bet.<lb/>
With regard to the particular point of sporting prophets and racing tipsters, nobody that I have ever encountered has had a single word to say in favour of this class. If they were only fairly accurate there would not be the same feeling against them, but I remember an instance in which
<col>426</col>
a certain noble Duke, a member of this House, followed the advice of one of these prophets for a considerable time and found himself a heavy loser at the end. Luckily he was a person of substantial means, and it made no difference to him; but nobody that I have ever discovered, on the Turf or off it, has had a single word to say in favour of inducements of this kind; indeed they have been severely condemned by the noble Earl, Lord Durham, this evening. If this Bill dealt only with these forms of inducement it would be very difficult to oppose it, and for my part I certainly should not oppose it. But this Bill does a great deal more than that. This Bill, whether the right rev. Prelate realises the fact or not, is directed against racing itself. We have been told to-day what a good many of us knew before, that racing and betting are inseparable; and I am afraid it is a painful fact that the so-called sport of kings would come to an end if there were no bookmakers to keep it going. This fact has been recognised by the law, and if the Anti-Gambling Acts which have been quoted were really enforced in, the spirit in which they were intended racing would have come to an end long ago. It was only because legal pundits were turned on when it was recognised that racing was in danger and we were able to obtain these extraordinary definitions of "places," "resorts," and so on, that the cause of racing was saved.<lb/>
If this Bill became law it is evident that racing would not go on in this country much longer. I do not know whether the right rev. Prelate realises that fact, but I am sure anybody who has the slightest practical acquaintance with racing would bear out what I say. In conclusion, it is hardly necessary for me to point out to the right rev. Prelate that it is no good to try and go in advance of public opinion. It is perfectly evident that the vast majority of the people of this country do not want and are not going to allow racing to be abolished. Therefore if the right rev. Prelate would allow me I would venture to offer him this advice, that he should try again, and try on a much more modest scale, and that he should not spurn advice even if it comes from the Anti-Gambling League and should not place too implicit confidence even upon the judgment of Sir Edward Fry, to whose reputation he seems to me to have inflicted a disastrous blow this evening.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01174"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD STRACHIE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House would no doubt like to hear what view the Home Office takes of this Bill. The Home Office view is this, that the Bill goes a great deal too far, however good the intentions are&#x2014;and the intentions of the right rev. Prelate are undoubtedly very good indeed. As regards stopping gambling advertisements and illegitimate forms of inducement to bet, we are entirely with the right rev. Prelate; but I venture to say that the Bill mixes up two distinct questions. If you look at the first clause you will notice that, it deals with lotteries and prize competitions and also with betting on horse-racing. I think it would be better to deal first of all with lotteries and prize competitions. The Home Office would be perfectly ready, following on the recommendations contained in the Report of the Joint Committee on Lotteries and Indecent Advertisements who reported in 1908, to deal with advertisements connected with lotteries and competitions of an undesirable nature founded on mere chance and having nothing whatever to do with skill of any kind. This Joint Committee made two recommendations as regards lotteries and prize competitions. Recommendation No. 7 was as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"The Committee consider that the provisions of Section 41 of the Act of 1823 should be made to apply both to the publishing and printing in this country of any circular relating to a foreign lottery, and also to the sending or causing to be sent through the post or by any other means the distributing or publishing any circular or advertisement relating to a lottery in this or any foreign country."</quote>
Recommendation No. 15 ran&#x2014;
<quote>"They recommend, therefore, that it should be made illegal for any proprietor publisher or editor of any newspaper or periodical to charge any form of entrance fee, including the purchase and return of coupons, for prize competitions ill his paper."</quote>
If the Bill now before the House had only dealt with questions of that sort the Home Office would have been quite ready to give it their support, but as the Bill is mixed up with other matters which they certainly could not support it is very difficult for them to take the line of supporting the Bill generally owing to the enormous difficulties there would be in dealing with it even if Amendments of a drastic nature were inserted.<lb/>
Subsection (3) of Clause 1 deals with questions of competitions of a lottery
<col>428</col>
nature, and also with competitions of an educational, scientific, or literary character. It is difficult to exactly know what that subsection means, but I take it that it would have the effect of preventing Art Union lotteries. As regards that question the Joint Committee to which I have referred reported that they were not prepared to recommend the repeal of the Art Unions Act of 1846, although they were of opinion that the Board of Trade should exercise a stricter supervision over the proceedings of Art Unions. Therefore again I find myself in antagonism to the proposal contained in this clause. If, however, it was only a question of lotteries and competitions founded on mere chance that would be a different matter, and I expect the majority of your Lordships would be only too anxious to do everything possible to stop those objectionable circulars and advertisements which are spread throughout the country and encourage the desire for gambling and speculation. As the right rev. Prelate has said, there has been on the stocks for some time at the Home Office a Bill dealing with these lotteries and competitions, and I think that a Bill of that sort would find general acceptance in this House.<lb/>
Then subsection (2) of Clause 1 prohibits newspapers publishing the betting upon races. I ask myself this question, How is it possible to say that newspapers are not to be allowed to publish betting odds as long as betting is allowed upon racecourses? It seems to me that that is a matter which can only be answered in one way. No difference is drawn in this Bill between newspaper articles written by men who have a knowledge of horse-racing and the productions of racing tipsters. As regards that it would, of course, be impossible to prevent, say, <i>The Times</i> or the <i>Morning Post</i> from publishing the odds upon the Derby or upon the Oxford and Cambridge boat race, or to make it such an illegal offence that any person selling the newspaper containing those odds could be arrested without a warrant. It is clear that a great distinction has to be drawn&#x2014;and it is not drawn by this Bill&#x2014;between what might be described as legitimate speculation upon a race-course and the Stock Exchange in contradistinction to illegitimate speculation in lotteries and bucket-shops. This Bill goes out of its way to prohibit what I think is legitimate&#x2014;namely, the publishing of
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0219"/>
<col>429</col>
racing odds in the great newspapers. I desire most cordially to recognise the good objects of the right rev. Prelate, and to express my regret that, although his aims are admirable and deserving of support, yet the provisions of the Bill are drawn in such a way that it is impossible for the Home Office to give it their support.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01175"><sup>*</sup><member>Lose KINNAIRD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after what we have just heard from the representative of His Majesty's Government I have no doubt that the right rev. Prelate will think that he has served his purpose in having brought this matter to the attention of your Lordships. I venture to think that the majority of your Lordships will not agree with the statement which has been made in the course of this discussion that betting in itself is a very harmless recreation, and that any one who can afford to lose is perfectly entitled to carry on any amount of betting. One noble Lord suggested that there was a good deal of betting on cricket, on ordinary 'Varsity sports, and on amateur races. I venture to demur very much to that. I doubt whether there were many bets made at Lords on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, or whether there will be many made on Friday or Saturday. I submit for your Lordships' consideration that there have been sports in which betting has come in; the consequence has been that those sports have died out as sports in which any large proportion of the population takes any interest. Though the wording of this Bill apparently does not commend itself to your Lordships at all events the principle of it is deserving of attention, and I am glad to hear that we may possibly expect a Government Bill on the subject in another session. The noble Lord who replied on behalf of His Majesty's Government said nothing about Clause 4 of this Bill, which lays an extra duty upon the Postmaster-General in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01176"><member>LORD STRACIHE</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend who represents the Post Office will state the view of his Department regarding that clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01177"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD KINNAIRD</member><membercontribution>: The sport I know most about is football, and attached to that is the danger that those who carry on the betting trade at which the Bishop of Hereford aims are doing what they can to spoil that game, and their efforts are

largely helped by the Post Office. These people have been turned out from many well-ordered towns in the north of England, and, being unable to carry on their coupon business there any longer, they go abroad, and from Belgium or Holland or Switzerland they send out these well-known circulars by the hundred thousand. The Post Office know them perfectly well, but I understand that they do not consider that they are justified in stopping them. They have occasionally done so, but they do not carry out a consistent policy in the matter. I can only say, on behalf of the Football Association, that we thank the Department for the little help they have given us, and we hope that they will do a great deal more in the future. Sympathy was expressed by Lord Newton with some of the provisions in this Bill, and I venture to hope, if the right rev. Prelate withdraws it now, that the Government will take the matter up, and that before long steps will be taken to put a stop to what I am convinced is doing a great deal of harm to true sport. We call upon the Government to help us to keep our sport clean and pure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01178"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I desire to interpose for a moment only. I awaited with the keenest interest the statement which we should hear, and now have heard, from the Government Bench upon this really important, and, in my judgment, very urgent matter. Ten years have passed since the Report of the Select Committee which sat on this subject was issued. That Report, as has been mentioned to-night, while it did not recommend the kind of legislation, certainly not in detail and possibly not even in principle, which is embodied in the Bill presented to-night by the right rev. Prelate, did contain perfectly definite recommendations that legislation on some of these points was necessary. We have been told to-night and on previous occasions that there is a Home Office Bill on the stocks. It has been a long time on the stocks; and I venture to say that we are entitled, when opposition is taken to proposals brought forward, wise or unwise, such as those which my right rev, brother has brought forward, to join in the appeal which he made to those who oppose him to know what are the steps which they propose to take to give effect to the recommendations definitely made by the Select Committee.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0220"/>
<col>431</col>
I honestly confess that I cannot accept this Bill in the least as it stands. I did not know anything of it until it was published and circulated. It seems to me to go far in advance of public opinion, probably in advance of what public opinion will ever actually reach. The Post Office provisions seem to me absolutely out of the question, and there are other provisions in the Bill which I would rather characterise as ill-drawn because I cannot suppose that their intention was what appears on the surface. But, while I say that, I entirely endorse the appeal made by the Bishop of Hereford to-night to those who are opposing him as to whether they do or do not intend to take any steps to give effect to the recommendations to which their names are attached. It seems to me unfair that a discussion in this House should be shelved by the reference of the matter to a Select Committee, and when that Committee make a Report containing perfectly definite recommendations that then those who signed the Report should leave it to others to bring forward legislation while they themselves do nothing whatever to give effect to their recommendations.<lb/>
The difficulty aimed at in this Bill is far larger and far more grave than most of the speakers to-night have recognised. We are not really dealing with what Lord St. Davids, with a guileless simplicity which surprised me greatly, described as the wholesome custom of betting in the healthy open air. We are dealing with the insidious mischief which is permeating our factories, our workshops, and our schools&#x2014;even the elementary schools&#x2014;by the mischievous circulars which are being spread broadcast, which this Committee recommended the stopping of, and which no step has been taken for bringing to an end by what I agree with the Bishop of Hereford in thinking must be necessarily drastic legislation on that subject. It does seem to me to be not quite fair simply to criticise proposals because they go too far. It has been said more than once that some amendment of the law is necessary and that a Government Bill is on the stocks, but in the meantime nothing is being done. Therefore while I could not possibly vote for this Bill as it stands, I do endorse my right rev. brother's appeal to those who are opposed to him to-night that they will take the matter into their own hands&#x2014;for it must be experts who do it&#x2014;and endeavour to frame a measure which will put the

I had taken no steps or made no suggestions whatever for reform, and that therefore I ought not to have opposed this Bill. No doubt he was led to that by the observation of the right rev. Prelate this evening, that those who oppose this Bill must accept the responsibility and themselves bring forward a measure on the subject. The Bishop of Hereford knows that I wrote a letter to him a few weeks ago on the matter. He sent me a draft of this Bill and asked my opinion upon it. I replied that the measure was too drastic, and that I should be obliged to oppose it; but I added that he could do some good if he brought in a simple Bill dealing with tipsters' advertisements which we all agree are objectionable and should be stopped. Therefore the most rev. Primate is not entitled to say that I am indisposed to do anything towards remedying the evil.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01180"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF ST. ASAPH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to make an appeal to my right rev. brother the Bishop of Hereford. I entirely sympathise with a great part of what he has in view, but I hope he may be induced to withdraw this measure, which does not seem to meet with support from any quarter of the House. But I should be sorry if this debate should leave in the mind of the country any idea that this House is prepared to defend betting in all its aspects. I am thankful to his Grace for having brought forward the point of the vastness of the evil brought about by betting. It was with dismay that I listened to the speech of Lord St. Davids, in which he talked of the thing being purely art amusement and of the people putting money on horses not caring whether they won or lost. The betting evil among those who cannot afford to lose a shilling is deep-seated, and has, to my own knowledge, done infinite harm. I earnestly hope that the result of this debate will not leave upon the mind of the country the impression that this House is unconscious of, or still worse indifferent to, the magnitude of the evils which gather round betting at the present time. I admit I could not possibly support this Bill as it stands. I was sorry to hear Lord St. Davids say that if you did not have betting you could not have horse-racing. I should
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0221"/>

hope that the sport might live without betting. I hope the right rev. Prelate will consent, in the interests of the objects he lots at heart, to withdraw the Bill to-day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01181"><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as regards Clause 4 of this Bill, which concerns the Post Office, I am desired to say that the Postmaster-General feels that this duty of discrimination ought not to be imposed upon him. He thinks it would be absolutely impossible to discriminate, for instance, between the various betting code telegrams and those code telegrams which have nothing to do with betting. Further, he does not see that it would be possible for the officers of the Post Office to determine what individuals ought to be refused the use of telegraphic and telephonic facilities, and what letters ought to be stopped.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01182"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to say one word, and one word only, in defence of the vote which I shall give if the right rev. Prelate asks for a Division on the Second Reading of this Bill. In the first place, I am sure he will not doubt my sincerity when I tell him that I am much in sympathy with what I conceive to be the object of his Bill. I venture to agree with the most rev. Primate when he told us just now that in his opinion there was in one or two of the speeches to which we have just listened&#x2014;I refer notably to the extremely able and interesting speech delivered by Lord St. Davids&#x2014;a tendency to make too light of the public evil and scandal which arises from betting, particularly by people who cannot afford to bet. I am under the impression that many homes have been ruined in consequence of betting, and that if you were to ask those who have the best means of knowing they would tell you that betting is answerable for a good deal of the crime which prevails in the days in which we live.<lb/>
But, my Lords, for all that I cannot support the Bill of the right rev. Prelate. It seems to me to be, in the first place, open to the great objection that it is an ineffectual Bill. It is a Bill aimed at betting, but if this Bill were to become law betting would still survive with this difference only&#x2014;that it would have to be carried on in secrecy. I cannot believe that it is an advantage to drive evils of this kind, if they be evils, below the surface. Again, the Bill is ineffectual because it fails altogether to touch other forms of gambling every whit as reprehend-
<col>434</col>
sible as the particular form of gambling at which the Bill is aimed. Gambling by card playing and that extremely pernicious form of gambling to which reference has been made&#x2014;I mean gambling by means of margins on securities&#x2014;would be untouched by this measure. Apart from that, this Bill is, I cannot help thinking, framed in a much too vexatious and unrelenting spirit. I do not think I at all exaggerate the combined effect of the clauses of this Bill when I say that if any quite respectably-conducted newspaper were to publish a paragraph on the eve of the University Boat Race to the effect that the odds were three to two, let us say, upon the University of Oxford, the publisher of that paper would find himself liable under the penal clause of this Bill to a penalty which might amount to a fine of &#x00A3;25, or, at the discretion of the Court, imprisonment with hard labour for a month. That seems to me to be a monstrous possibility; and it is not made less monstrous when further on in the Bill you find that the perfectly harmless person who might be hawking the newspaper in question for sale in the streets would himself be liable to be summarily arrested by a constable without warrant. It is also remarkable that both the public Departments concerned in the administration of the law affected by this Bill&#x2014;the Home Office and the Post Office&#x2014;have come forward through their representatives to tell us that in the view of those Departments the Bill is an unwisely framed Bill and not one for the administration of which those Departments would care to make themselves responsible.<lb/>
If I may sum up my view of the measure, I would do so by saying that in my belief the love of sport is innate in the people of this country, and that in the minds of many of them you cannot entirely dissociate the idea of sport from the idea of wagering upon that which in the language of this Bill is called "an event"; and I am persuaded that although it should be our object in any legislation of this kind to enlist public opinion on our side, the effect of passing such a Bill as this would be to alienate public opinion and that you would find it bitterly, and I cannot help thinking rightly, opposed to us. For this reason I venture to support the entreaty which has been addressed to the right rev. Prelate that he will not ask the House to divide upon this Bill, reserving, of course, to himself full liberty to return to the subject at some future time.</membercontribution></p>

Primate I have no desire to put the House to the inconvenience of dividing on this Bill. At the same time I should like to be permitted to say that I scarcely recognised the Bill in the description of it which was evidently in the minds of the first two speakers in opposition to it. I could not but feel that they had set up a sort of caricature of the Bill in their minds, and of course it was easy to knock it down. I desire to repeat that this Bill in its essentials is not intended in any way to interfere with English sport, but to cleanse and purify that sport and make it worthy of the country to which it belongs. We are all agreed, I think, that English sport is preyed upon by a trade which is both parasitic and demoralising. As there seems to be a general disapproval of the Bill which I have ventured to put before the House, I would appeal to your Lordships to take some positive steps to cure the mischief which is eating into the vitals of the country in this connection and which experienced people say is a growing evil. After what we have heard from the noble Lord who represents the Home Office I have a hope that that Department may take some early steps and produce a Bill which will, at any rate, do something to lessen the evil and to lessen the temptations to gambling with which so many of our fellow-countrymen are beset.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01186"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask the noble Lord who represents the Agricultural Department the Question standing in my name&#x2014;namely, whether it is their intention to fill the vacancy caused in the chief inspectorship of the Sea Fisheries Department by the resignation of Mr. Archer, and if not, what provision they propose to make to enable the sea fisheries to have a responsible chief officer of the Fisheries Department of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01187"><member>THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: It is proposed to appoint to the vacant assistant secretaryship Mr. H. G. Maurice. Mr. Maurice is at present acting as private secretary to my right hon. friend the President of the Board, a post which he has filled for nearly three years. I hope it may be possible for him to take up the duties of the post at an early date. Mr. Maurice has been selected solely for his administrative qualifications, of which my right hon. friend has had exceptional opportunities of judging. We believe that the work of the division can best be carried on under an administrative head supported by an expert staff, and we have obtained the authority of the Treasury for a modest increase in the strength of the technical and scientific staff of the division by means of which I hope we may be able to give it a more effective organisation than at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01188"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: I should like to ask whether Mr. Fryer remains in the Department. Two thoroughly practical experts, Mr. Archer and Mr. Fryer, both of whom had the confidence of the sea fisheries industry, were appointed by Lord Onslow when the Fisheries Department was first instituted. What we want to know is whether there will really be one practical man left in the Fisheries Department. Mr. Maurice, I understand, comes from the Board of Education, and there is a rumour that Mr. Fryer is dissatisfied at having Mr. Maurice put over his head and is going to retire. If so, we want to know whether the opinion of some of those who have a right to speak on behalf of the trade will be consulted in the matter. At the present time the whole of the staff are theorists.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01189"><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: We have only recently had the Treasury decision both as to the appointment of Mr. Maurice and as to the increase they are going to give us to enable us to extend the technical and scientific staff. It is too early for me, therefore, to make any announcement with regard to that staff; but I can inform the noble Lord that we are fully impressed with the importance of having in the technical staff really first-class technical men and in the scientific staff first-class scientific men, the whole of them combined under one adminis-

As to his other question, whether my right hon. friend will consult with gentlemen interested, I can give no pledge. I can only say that I will undertake to lay that request before my right hon. friend.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01240"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I have to apologise to your Lordships for not being in my place on Wednesday last when this Bill was under discussion, on which occasion a number of Government Amendments were inserted in the Bill on Report with a view to the Bill being reprinted and re-committed. The effect of the Government Amendments then inserted was in some respects to diminish the stringency of the Bill and in other respects to increase it. The principal form in which diminution has taken place under those Amendments is that the absolute prohibition of underground workplaces in the future, as the provision stood in the original draft of the Bill, is done away with. A broad distinction was made on the face of the Bill itself between existing workplaces and those started after the commencement of the Act. In regard to existing workplaces, what we originally proposed was that they should be subject to stringent regulations, but that any workplace hereafter established should not be permitted at all if it was underground within the meaning of the Statute.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01247"><b>1.</b>&#x2014;(1) On and after the first day of January one thousand nine hundred and fourteen, or such later date, not being later than the first day of January one thousand nine hundred and fifteen, as the Secretary of State may by order appoint, no underground room in a factory, workshop, or workplace shall be used for the purpose of any of the processes or occupations specified in the Schedule to this Act unless duly certified by the district council to be suitable for the process or occupation named in the certificate, and unless the regulations made under this Act or the conditions contained in the certificate are complied with.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01248">(2) For the purposes of this Act an underground room shall mean any room any part of which is so situate that the surface of the floor is more than three feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street, or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the room.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01249"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: The first question I wish to raise on Clause 1 is that of the meaning of the word "workplace." There is no definition of "workplace" in the Bill, and what I venture to submit to the Government is that they would be well advised in agreeing to some definition. I know that there is great difficulty in the matter, and therefore I have not put an Amendment on the Paper dealing with this point, but I shall be ready to do so at the next stage. It is true that the word "workplace" has already received Judicial interpretation, and that that interpretation is of a very wide character; but we have to think not merely of the legal effect of the words in the Bill but of the indication which its provisions will constitute to the local authorities who have to carry it out. The local authorities who will primarily have to carry out the provisions of this Bill are the district councils, and if they are presented with a Bill dealing in rather a drastic way for the first time with workplaces of a certain character and are not told what a workplace means, they may feel rather bewildered, and may take what, after all, is the easiest refuge for a bewildered local authority&#x2014;namely, do nothing at all. That is the most likely issue of any doubt on their part as to what "workplace" means. Therefore as we are all anxious, and I am sure the Government are, to make this Bill effective, it is necessary that some definition of "workplace" should be inserted, so that there should be an indication on the face
<col>446</col>
of the Bill as to the scope the local authorities are intended to take in administering it. I do not know whether the noble Lord who represents the Home Office has had time to consider this point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01250"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD STRACHIE)</member><membercontribution>: As the noble Marquess is aware, there is a great deal of difficulty in regard to this question. The danger is that you may either be too elastic in your definition or too limited and too narrow, and you may raise difficulties in that way. At present there is no definition of "workplace" in the Factories Acts. Parliament so far has not thought fit to frame any definition of the word, although it has been in use in Public Health Acts for something like thirty years, during which period there has been only one case brought before the Courts for an interpretation of the word "workplace." The point in that case was whether or not a cabyard was a workplace, and the learned Judge held that in that particular case the cabyard was a workplace, but he refused to give any precise definition of what a workplace was. If the noble Marquess, between now and the Report stage of the Bill, can make any suggestion on the point&#x2014;and it must be remembered that any definition inserted in this Bill would have to be read with the existing Factories Acts&#x2014;the Home Office will be ready to consider it. But I would urge him, seeing that this legislation has worked so well during the last thirty years, whether it is not wise to leave well alone in this particular case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01251"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I will not press the matter further at this moment, but I should be glad of a conversation with the noble Lord upon it. The first Amendment standing in my name on the Paper is to Clause 1, and it deals with the definition of what constitutes, if I may coin a word, "undergroundness." As the Bill stands, it says that an underground room shall mean any room any part of which is so situate that the surface of the floor is more than 3 feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street or of the ground adjoining or nearest the room. That, in fact, does not make a room underground, and it clearly cannot be said to be such a distinction as to justify putting such a workroom under the drastic provisions of this Statute. I venture to think we shall make a great mistake if we pass
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0228"/>
<col>447</col>
such a definition, which is on the face of it inadequate. What is important is not where the floor of the room is but where the ceiling is. If the ceiling is nearly on a level with the ground outside, then, indeed, the room is underground; but the position of the floor is of much less importance. In the words which I have ventured to place on the Paper I have endeavoured to strike a compromise by providing that it should depend neither upon the floor nor the ceiling, but that the definition should be that an underground room shall mean any room any part of which is so situate that half or more than half the whole height thereof measuring from the floor to the ceiling is below the surface.</membercontribution></p>

<col>448</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01259"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: On the Question that Clause 2 stand part of the Bill I wish to lay a point before the Government. In the Amendments which they inserted on the last stage of the Bill they provided that in cases where there are no regulations under the Bill the district council shall act without regulations. That appears to me, if I may say so, an almost indefensible proposition. This Bill provides that in certain circumstances an underground workplace is to be suppressed. If such a step is necessary, it is very proper that it should be taken, but Parliament has always been very jealous that this shall only be done with every precaution. Consequently in I think almost all Statutes of this kind there is the ordinary rules clause, containing certain provisions for regulations which govern the operation of the Act, and this Bill, like other Bills, has the rules clause. Those regulations are to be made under the authority of the Home Office, and it seems astonishing that if Parliament should think it right to give the Home Office power to make regulations Parliament should also say that if the Home Office do not make regulations district councils may act without regulations. I am afraid that cannot be defended. Under the rules clause every conceivable precaution is taken that injustice is not done. There has to be an advertisement in the local newspaper, and there has to be an inquiry if it is called for by any persons who think they have a right to object. The regulations themselves have to lie on the Tables of both Houses of Parliament so that they may, if necessary, be objected to. All these precautions are taken in the case of regulations which are made by the Home Office. But it a district council is to act alone, none of these precautions are to have effect. If the Home Office makes regulations they are to be made with the greatest precaution, but if the Home Office makes no regulations then this drastic Statute is to operate on the <i>fiat</i> of the district council alone. I know that there is an appeal to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction, but that is not an exalted authority to which to entrust the rights and privileges of His Majesty's subjects in a Statute of this kind. If we attempt to go in front of public opinion to that extent we shall defeat our object, and the result will be that the Bill will not get through both Houses of Parliament. What we should say is that underground rooms are un wholesome and insanitary if they do not comply with certain regulations; that those
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0229"/>
<col>449</col>
regulations should be made by the Home Office; and that the Bill should not operate until the Home Office makes the regulations That is the right course, and I urge His Majesty's Government to consider the point before the next stage of the Bill is taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01260"><member>LORD STRACHIE</member><membercontribution>: With a good deal of what the noble Marquess has said I agree, but I would point out some of the difficulties. It would be perfectly impossible for the Home Office straight off to make regulations dealing with every one of the various trades which have been included in the schedule of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01264"><member>LORD STRACHIE</member><membercontribution>: Well, that is the opinion held at the Home Office. I would remind the noble Marquess, as regards some of the various classes which he desires to include in the schedule, that at the present moment there is no power for Home Office inspectors to deal with these classes. For instance as regards typewriting offices and restaurant kitchens there is no power of inspection by the Home Office. The only people who have that power are the officers of the local authorities. Perhaps between now and the Report Stage the noble Marquess can bring forward suggestions which may make it possible for the Home Office to undertake this work. I must say I was rather surprised at the fear shown by the noble Marquess of local authorities. I have served upon every kind of local authority, and I certainly have no dread that local authorities are going to be too active in this matter. I think the promoters of the Bill would rather have to fear that the local authorities would not be sufficiently active. If local authorities are too active, all they do is done in sight of the electors who return them, and where any injustice is likely to be done there will be a good opportunity of correcting those people who go in front of public opinion. For myself I have not the slightest fear that local authorities are likely to be too active or unfair or unjust in this matter. The noble Marquess not only appears nervous of local authorities but he also seems to think that there is not much faith to be put in Courts of Summary Jurisdiction. These
<col>450</col>
Benches carry out their duties with the greatest care, the greatest circumspection, and the greatest fairness, and I cannot see anything wrong in the provisions of Clause 2 in regard to this matter. But I will see that the point is carefully considered and will bring the remarks of the noble Marquess before the Home Secretary between now and the Report stage.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01275"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: On this clause I should like to represent one matter to the noble Lord who speaks for the Home Office. The regulations are perfectly elastic; they may be good or they may be bad&#x2014;we trust the Home Office for that&#x2014;but there is one particular about which I think there can be no doubt, and that is the question of artificial light. I do not think it is possible to defend a system under which workpeople have to work always under artificial light. I am confident that the whole public opinion of this country is against such a thing. There ought to be natural ventilation and natural light. The former it is somewhat difficult to define, but natural light is perfectly possible to define. I know that some ingenious persons have said that what I suggest would have the effect of shutting up mines and underground railways, but I would point out that neither one nor the other is included in the schedule. Moreover, they could, if necessary, be specially excluded from being brought in hereafter. But for people to go year in and year out working all day permanently in artificial light must be bad for their health and ought to he prevented by Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01276"><member>LORD STRACHIE</member><membercontribution>: Here again I am quite ready to consider any suggestion which the noble Marquess may bring up on Report dealing with the question of artificial light, but I have some doubt whether his views on this question are not too stringent. He has already said that some people might say that by so stringent a regulation you would shut up mines and underground railways which are lighted by artificial light. The noble Marquess said that neither of these was in the schedule, but he must not forget that the Home Office has power indefinitely to extend the schedule. I think we ought very carefully to consider whether it is desirable to do this. The noble Marquess must also remember that it might be held that basements in London houses come under the Bill, and we are all aware that there are many houses in London where work is carried on in basements which are lighted by artificial light, if not during the whole of the day, at any rate during nearly the whole of the day. I am doubtful, if artificial light is of a proper kind and properly shaded and if there is proper ventilation, whether a great many trades cannot be carried on perfectly well, just
<col>452</col>
as coal-mining is carried on, in artificial light&#x2014;that is to say, if other conditions are satisfactory; but we are quite ready at the Home Office to consider this question between now and the Report stage. I urge upon the noble Marquess, however, that it is important to see that the provision does not interfere unduly with any trade which may be carried on perfectly well under artificial light.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01284"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: On the Schedule as a whole I wish to represent to the Government that there is a great omission. We have typewriting included, but not other clerical work.
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0231"/>
<col>453</col>
I think that is a great omission. It is true that you cannot apply to clerical work all the conditions that you apply to other trades in the schedule, but the Home Office have reserved to themselves complete power to vary the regulations according to the difference of occupations to which the regulations are to apply. It would be perfectly possible for them, therefore, when dealing with other clerical work to apply only regulations which were applicable to that work. When you consider that the object of this Bill is as far as possible to prevent underground work, it is a serious omission to leave untouched the great branch of clerical work. The health of clerks, both male and female, is as much entitled to protection by Act of Parliament as the health of typists and those engaged in the other trades mentioned. I therefore think the Government would be well advised, between now and the next stage, to consider whether it would not be possible to add the words "and other clerical work."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01285"><member>LORD STRACHIE</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid I cannot give the noble Marquess any hope that the Government will do this. It seems to me that he is opening a very large area indeed and making a very serious addition to the schedule. I should like to warn him that there is great danger in adding other clerical work. You would have to increase, not only the number of inspectors working under the Home Office, but you would certainly have to increase those under local authorities. I am sure none of us are anxious to increase the number of inspectors. In fact, I have been rather shocked to-day at the light way in which the noble Marquess has been ready to increase the number of inspectors and add to the cost not only upon the taxes but upon the local rates. I always thought that the principal charge against His Majesty's Government was that they were setting up too many officials, but here the Home Office is being urged to further extend this Bill and set up additional officials.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE TRANS-PERSIAN RAILWAY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01288"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member> rose to call attention to the project of a Trans-Persian Railway; to inquire as to the policy of His Majesty's Government and the views of the Government of India in relation to this proposal; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01289">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I propose to confine myself very strictly to the terms of the Notice on the Paper. Though the question of Persian railways does touch the general position in Persia, and though the customary latitude of debate in our House would allow me, I imagine, to raise that question, I propose to resist the temptation altogether this evening. Neither shall I say anything about the cognate question of the Baghdad Railway except this, that it seems to me that, if we are going in for a Trans-Persian line, such a line must react unfavourably on the prospects of the Baghdad Railway; for this reason, that if by this railway you place your passengers or your goods at the Indian end of the Arabian Sea, obviously there is less inducement either for passengers or for goods to take advantage of a railway which will deposit them at the other or Turkish end of the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01290">My first point is this. I doubt whether your Lordships realise the extraordinary and almost unsuspected rapidity with which this question is moving. I wonder whether Parliament, and, still more, the public, has any idea what is going on and what has already been done. This is not a question of an ordinary line being built in a foreign country, whether for the development of communications, the connection of cities, or the advancement of trade. This is a question of a great trunk line running all the way through Asia to India, necessarily altering the whole position in India itself and the future security of our rule in that country, and compelling us&#x2014;this will be part of my argument&#x2014;to revise the principles upon which the defence of India has so far been based. How many are there, even of the public who follow the affairs of Asia, who realise that such a line as I speak of is now being surveyed, that a sum of nearly &#x00A3;100,000 has been subscribed by financiers in this country and in Russia and in France for carrying out these preliminary proceedings, and, what is more important, that His Majesty's Government have agreed "in principle"&#x2014;these are their
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0232"/>
<col>455</col>
own words&#x2014;to the creation of this line without having in any way received the authority, the approbation, or the consent of Parliament?</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01291">A year ago nobody would have dreamt that such a thing would be possible, and the witness that I call is the noble Viscount (Lord Morley) who sits opposite me, and who, I believe, is to follow me this evening. He will recall that we had a debate here in March, 1911, upon the question of Persia, the Baghdad Railway, and other cognate subjects. In the course of that debate I asked him whether the idea of a Trans-Persian railway was seriously entertained by the Government and whether it occupied any place in the field of international politics, and the noble Viscount replied to me as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"Any ideas or designs on that subject are far too immature for any sensible, or useful, or instructive observations to be made upon them."</quote>
The noble Viscount added that he himself was inclined to share my doubts as to the workableness of the particular design to which I had referred. These observations were, I think, calculated to lull any suspicions that might have been entertained by any of us as to this project. The same effect was produced by the answers of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House of Commons up till quite a recent date. As recently as May 14 he was found saying in the House of Commons, in reply to a Question, that matters with regard to this railway were still in a very inchoate state. I do not know the precise degree of rapidity with which they have advanced between May 14 and to-day, but all I can say, if my information is correct, is that they are not at all in an inchoate condition now.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01292">Let me state the facts as they are known to me, and, of course, if I am wrong I am liable to correction at the hands of the noble Viscount opposite, who has access to information much superior to that which is at my disposal. I believe the facts are as follow. There has been founded, with the knowledge and approval of His Majesty's Government, a body called the Soci&#x00E9;t&#x00E9; d'Etudes. This is an international body composed of financiers, politicians, and engineers drawn from the three nations&#x2014;Great Britain, France, and Russia&#x2014;to which I referred. At the head of this body is a council of administration consisting of twenty-four gentlemen,
<col>456</col>
eight drawn from each of the three nations, the British representatives upon which were appointed with the knowledge and approval of His Majesty's Government. There is to be a committee of directors of twelve chosen by the larger body. And this society has, I think, already begun to meet in Paris. Their functions are, broadly speaking, these. Their business is to conduct the surveys for the railway, to obtain the requisite concession from the Persian Government, and to submit to the Governments concerned definite estimates and plans. I believe that to be a correct account of what their functions are. For the preliminary purposes that I have described a sum of &#x00A3;90,000 has been raised by these three financial groups, and I think we may rest assured that this money would not have been found unless there was some substantial belief that the Government were behind the undertaking.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01293">Now, my Lords, let me state in a few words what the scheme, so far as I understand it, is. This great Trans-Persian railway is to start from Baku, the Russian port on the western shore of the Caspian Sea; or rather the railway, in so far as it is a Persian line, will start from Astara, but will be connected by rail with the Russian port. From there it is to run <i>via</i> Resht and Kazvin to the capital, Teheran, and onwards to the old capital Isfahan. From that point there would appear to be some difference of opinion as to the alignment. One idea has been to take the railway down by the town of Yezd to Bundar Abbas on the Persian Gulf, but I believe that that idea is not now favourably entertained. The other idea is to take the railway more to the East, through Kerman down either to the Persian port of Charbar on the shores of the Gulf, or, more easterly still, either to Gwattar or to Gwadar, which are ports in British Makran and therefore in Indian territory. The total length of this line is estimated by the promoters at 1,800 miles, but knowing the country fairly well through which it will go and remembering that you start at the sea on one side and end at the sea on the other, and that in the interval you have to climb at least 6,000 feet to cross the passes in certain sections of the Persian plateau, I venture to say the line will be nearer 2,500 miles in length than 2,000. The cost has been estimated at from &#x00A3;15,000,000 to &#x00A3;20,000,000; but I have no doubt that the actual cost, if the railway is ever constructed
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0233"/>
<col>457</col>
will be much nearer &#x00A3;30,000,000. It is said that this railway will reduce the journey from England to India from twelve and a-half to seven or eight days.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01294">Such, my Lords, as far as I can give it, is a brief outline of the scheme of which I am asking your Lordships to discuss the political, strategical, and commercial aspects to-day. I think there have been evidences of Government sympathy beyond those to which I have already referred. I think I am right in saying that the British and Russian Ministers have been in consultation at Teheran with the Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs in order to procure an option for the survey, and, later on, the construction of the line. The Indian Government have deputed one of their Engineer officers, no doubt with the knowledge and approval of the Government at home, to examine the country lying to the west of Karachi, between Karachi and the eastern border of Persia, and I have seen it stated, apparently on good authority, in <i>The Times</i> newspaper that the Russian promoters have agreed&#x2014;I call the House to notice the words "Russian promoters," because they indicate the source from which the active inspiration for the railway comes&#x2014;that the Russian promoters have agreed to an equal participation at a later stage of the three countries concerned in the finance of the scheme. If I have been incorrect in any of my particulars no doubt the noble Viscount will put me right when he speaks later on.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01295">Now we come to the attitude of His Majesty's Government. Fortunately, since I put down my Notice on the Paper this has been defined in circumstances of some precision by the Secretary of State, Sir Edward Grey, in the other House of Parliament, and I will ask your Lordships' leave to read what he said on the matter. These are his words&#x2014;
<quote>"His Majesty's Government do not in principle oppose the Trans-Persian railway, and should under proper conditions be favourable to the principle."</quote>
He went on to say that His Majesty's Government must reserve to themselves full freedom of action with regard to certain points&#x2014;namely, the alignment of the railway, the constitution of the board, the representation of British interests upon it, freight, passenger rates, and in regard to the break of gauge. Further, the Foreign Secretary said&#x2014;
<quote>"Before it receives support from His Majesty's Government we should have to come to an agree-
<col>458</col>
ment with Russia with regard to the branch lines to be made, with regard to the retention and control of lines in the British spheres, and with regard to equality of treatment for British trade."</quote>
The question of guarantees had been raised in the House of Commons, and the Foreign Secretary agreed that no guarantees should be given without the consent of Parliament. Finally, Sir Edward Grey said that he would at a later date lay the report of the Soci&#x00E9;t&#x00E9; d'Etudes before the House, and that the Government would state to the House under what conditions they were prepared to consent to any definite scheme before the country was absolutely committed. All these are sound and valuable assurances. I do not thank the Foreign Secretary for having given them, because in the circumstances of the case they were inevitable and indispensable. He might have given more; no Foreign Minister could possibly have given less.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01296">The question I have to ask is, Do these assurances go far enough? I cannot help thinking&#x2014;and I should be only too pleased to be disabused of the belief if it is wrong&#x2014;that when the Government have encouraged, as they have done, the group of British financiers; when they have interested themselves, as I believe they have, in the appointment of members of the council; when they have set their diplomatic machinery working in the interests of the Scheme; and when, lastly, they have declared their sympathy with it in principle&#x2014;when they have done this I cannot help thinking that they have gone a long way in the direction of support of this proposal. Their attitude seems to me to be more than an attitude of benevolent neutrality and to be really an attitude of implied support if not of positive encouragement of the scheme. So much so that I can quite believe that it may be a matter of rather serious difficulty for them to retreat at a later date, and if they come with definite proposals before the House of Commons it may be a matter of difficulty for their supporters in that House not to see them through in this affair. It may even be a matter of difficulty for the country, not fully informed upon the case, not to support the Government in the line that, according to my hypothesis, it may have taken. And thus, my Lords, it may be that, starting from these inchoate proceedings to which I referred just now we may end by finding that we are more or less committed to a measure of which I will only at this moment
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0234"/>
<col>459</col>
say this, that whether it be right or whether it be wrong it involves a more fundamental change in British policy towards India and the defence of India than any event that has taken place in the history of India since the days of Lord Clive.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01297">In these circumstances I think your Lordships will agree that it behoves this House to look rather seriously into the grounds for this great departure, and to inquire what is the attitude of those who are really best qualified to advise about it. As regards the grounds, Sir Edward Grey, in the speech to which I referred, only found time for one, and that was the argument of inevitability. He said this railway must come; it is sure to be made sooner or later, and therefore we had better join. I should like to make these observations upon the argument of inevitability. If I were asked for my private opinion, I think I would truthfully say that some day or other the overland connection with India will come. I do not say that it will come now or in ten years or in twenty years, but I think some day it will come. But because you may look upon it from that point of view, because you may regard it as inevitable to that extent, it does not follow that the railway ought to be made now. It does not follow that because it is inevitable to that extent it will be good for us or good for India. It does not follow that because it is inevitable we ought to take an active part in joining at the present stage. In fact, it does not follow in the least that because it is some day certain to be made this Government or any British Government ought to be favourable to the scheme. There are, for instance, other ways to approach India overland which have met with favour in some quarters. The shortest overland route to India is through the Russian territories of Trans-Caspia and through Afghanistan. I think that less than 500 miles intervene which are not now covered by rails. There are many people who think that that is the line by which Europe ought to be united to Asia. The arguments for that line are just as strong or just as weak, whichever way you like to put it, as those for the Trans-Persian line. The argument of inevitability applies equally to that line with the other. Yet no British Government has brought forward a concrete proposal for such a line, because we know that the Ameer of Afghanistan, as was his predecessor, is inflexibly opposed to it. There is another scheme&#x2014;that of running a railway from Egypt <i>vi&#x00E2;</i>
<col>460</col>
Port Said across the Peninsula of Sinai and then across Arabia to the Persian Gulf. I make this observation to show that there is nothing in the argument of inevitability, for what it is worth, which applies particularly to the Trans-Persian scheme.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01298">Upon this question of inevitability may I recall to your Lordships a memory which is probably fairly fresh in the minds of many of you&#x2014;I mean the construction of the Channel Tunnel. How easily it used to be shown in the House of Commons that the Channel is an artificial and superannuated obstacle which ought not to be allowed to continue, in so far as the action of man could counteract it, in view of the wider and more cosmopolitan ideas of modern days. When first I entered the House of Commons I was rather affected by those views myself, and I fancy I gave a foolish vote in favour of the construction of the Channel Tunnel. But as soon as the military authorities had been heard on the matter, and when they demonstrated, as they did, that the Channel Tunnel would make England not safe, that it really would amount to a sacrifice of the incomparable frontier presented to us by nature, and that this little tube running under the sea, instead of merely being an instrument of amity and of commerce, might become an engine of invasion and destruction, from that moment public opinion changed and the Channel Tunnel scheme was overwhelmed with complete annihilation, an annihilation from which our friendly regard for France was not able to rescue it. And yet precisely the same reasoning was used about the inevitability of the Channel Tunnel. Therefore I am not impressed in the least degree by that argument.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01299">I venture to say that the decision of a great issue of this sort ought not to be made on <i>a priori</i> grounds, nor on the fatalistic principle of accepting what will one day come. The sole test is whether the railway will be for the advantage of England, India, and Persia. Is this railway wanted for any of those three parties? Will it do good to any of them? Will it materially improve their security, their peace, their prosperity? If so, let us go ahead with the railway. If not, let us desist. If you look at the matter from this point of view I think you cannot fail to be impressed by the attitude so far taken up by those who may fairly be called experts on the matter. I have only myself met one man who can
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0235"/>
<col>461</col>
properly claim that title with regard to this question who is in favour of the Trans-Persian scheme. In the debate in the House of Commons last week not a single speaker on either side of the House gave it anything like a whole-hearted support. In fact, I think every speaker who alluded to it was against it. There are some newspapers which ordinarily support His Majesty's Government with unswerving fidelity&#x2014;for instance, the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>&#x2014;which are strenuously hostile to this proposal, on the perfectly worthy ground that it conflicts with all the ideas they have always entertained as to the principles of Indian frontier defence. Then we come to the military authorities. I can only speak for those whom I have come across, but among them there has not been a dissentient voice; and I dare say your Lordships may have noticed that there have been during the past few days two letters in <i>The Times</i> by a military authority who certainly speaks with great ability and with great weight and to whom His Majesty's Government are indebted for many kind acts of written support&#x2014;I mean the Military Correspondent of <i>The Times,</i> Colonel Repington. Last week he had a letter in <i>The Times</i> of which I will only read one paragraph, because it really contains the objections entertained by many people to this railway in a very convincing way&#x2014;
<quote>"My opinion is that this scheme, if carried out, will gravely alter the conditions under which India must be defended will enable external pressure to be applied to India and will therefore be politically unacceptable; will not materially benefit Persia nor British and Indian interests in Persia, except by affording a quicker route for mails; will divert mails and some passengers from the sea to the land route through Germany and will correspondingly injure our maritime carrying trade and industries; will reduce the profits which the public derives from the Suez Canal; will probably burden the finances of England or India or both; and, while being of no conceivable military service to us in any circumstances that can be foreseen, may in certain contingencies aggravate the military risks of India, increase the front which the Army in India has to defend with relatively weak forces, inflate expenditure upon defence, and render India more liable to foreign aggression by depriving her of the shield of her desert frontiers."</quote>
That argument has been reinforced by the same writer in another and longer letter which many of your Lordships may have read in <i>The Times</i> of this morning; and I must say this, that to the criticisms to which I am referring no answer whatever has yet been given either by Sir Edward
<col>462</col>
Grey in the House of Commons or by any other spokesman of His Majesty's Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01300">You will expect me, perhaps, to examine a little more closely these various points&#x2014;namely, the manner in which this railway, if built, will affect the security of India, will affect our communication with India, will affect Anglo-Indian trade with Persia, and will affect the security of Persia itself. First let me take the defence of India. I imagine that it would be true to say that the history of the frontier defences of India during the last hundred years has, broadly speaking, passed through twophases. First there was the time in which the Government of India were spreading their conquests over the level plains of India until they came up to the mighty barrier of the mountains, which stand like an artificial palisade around our borders. Sometimes, of course, as in the case of the first Afghan War, we were tempted to cross that barrier, but usually to our detriment. Then came the period, beginning about fifty years ago, when either because of the depredations of the tribes in the mountains or the existence of hostile and intriguing influences beyond we were driven forward in search of what used to be called a "scientific frontier." The consequences of those forward movements pursued over a wide circumference were these. In parts we took completely into our own hands the country beyond the palisade; such was the ease with Baluchistan; elsewhere we put the mountain passes in charge of Militia levies, or military police raised from the tribes themselves, and we gave subsidies to the tribes; and as regards the countries beyond we contrived, by treaties or other arrangements, to protect or guarantee or neutralise the whole of the surrounding kingdoms to which I refer. Such was the case with regard to Persia, to Afghanistan, to Tibet, and, more in the East, Siam. But the whole point throughout in both these phases has been this, that India ought to be surrounded for the purpose of safety by a belt, be it of mountains or be it of desert, which it would be difficult to cross. You really may compare the position to that of a fortress with a great glacis stretching around it, cleared by the treaties and political arrangements which have been made, and swept by our guns. The theory has always been that no one should be at liberty to advance across that glacis
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0236"/>
<col>463</col>
up to the walls of the fort except by great expenditure to themselves and at the risk of open hostilities with the British Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01301">I do not know whether anybody will dispute my summary of Indian frontier policy. Rightly or wrongly, I believe that has been the accepted policy of British Governments and Governments of India for the best part of 100 years. To support that policy we have fought wars, we have indulged in great expenditure of men and money, and on one occasion in 1885 Mr. Gladstone almost went to war with Russia. This has hitherto been the accepted policy of both political Parties in this country. There has been very little difference on broad ground of principle between us. I do not say that this policy has saved India from scares or from great expenditure. It has not. But it has saved India from attack, for during that time no single enemy has marched across the glacis of which I have been speaking or has crossed the protective zone. Now if this railway is built, if the theories upon which it is to be constructed are accepted, all these views are wrong. They are to be relegated to the limbo of obsolete and mistaken ideas, and we have now to acclaim and to accept the opposite theory&#x2014;that the right frontier policy for India is not to close but to open her frontiers upon the west. We are, if assent be given to this railway, to assist in a proposal which will directly connect India on its most vulnerable side&#x2014;that is, on the west&#x2014;with the outside world; which will destroy the value of Afghanistan as a buffer State&#x2014;and His Majesty's Government should consider the effect which will be produced on the Ameer by this proposal; which will span the desert upon which we have hitherto relied; which will turn the flank of Quetta, and will provide a route direct from the Russian military base to the borders of India. It is the fact that if this railway be made the Russian troops will be brought 1,000 miles nearer to India than they are at the present moment, and that the Russian War Department at St. Petersburg, should the unhappy circumstances ever occur that we should be again at disagreement or at war with that country, will be able to put their troops on the India frontier before reinforcements sent from England could get to Bombay round the Cape. I see that Colonel Repington, in his letter in <i>The Times</i> this morning, sums up the situation
<col>464</col>
as regards Russia in these words. Assuming the construction of the railway, he says&#x2014;
<quote>"Russia could, in my opinion, deploy within three months such a powerful military force on or near our frontiers that the Army in India would be unable to resist it even provided that all our Field Divisions were available, which I do not think is likely to be the case."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01302">The only ground on which we are invited to run this very considerable risk is that of our present friendly relations with Russia. I rejoice at those relations. There is not a man in this House who does not regard our <i>Entente</i> with Russia as of extreme value, and supposing by any accident the Front Bench opposite were suddenly denuded of its present occupants and we were to step over and take their place we should be as loyal to our engagements with Russia as the Government are at the present time. About that let there be no doubt at all. But, my Lords, history shows too often that international understandings are not eternal. National sentiment, after all, is largely determined by national interests, and national interests are things that vary from year to year and from decade to decade according to the conditions of the hour. Therefore whatever may be our hopes or desires, it by no means follows that because we are on friendly terms with Russia now we always shall be, or that what we used to call the Russian bogey may not again show its features in the East. Let me put it in a rather more general way. There are two approaches to India&#x2014;by land and by sea. Hitherto we have had command of both. We have had command of the sea route because we were supreme upon the sea; we have had command of the land route partly because of our treaties but still more because without a railway it was impracticable to any invader. But now it is doubtful whether, under your new naval arrangements, you are going to keep command of the sea, and at the moment when that command trembles in the balance you propose, if you agree to this railway, gratuitously to surrender your control of the route by land. There are many instances in history in which nations have been compelled by war or defeat to surrender or modify their frontiers, but I honestly do not know of any case in which a great Power, for no reason at all except surrender to what is called the inevitable, has abandoned a frontier so unique as that which is presented to us by nature in those parts.</p>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0237"/>
<col>465</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01303">I may be pardoned for saying that even in this breathless and staggering age I am too slow to be able to make these rapid changes myself. I am too slow to be willing to abandon, almost at a moment's notice, all the convictions of my lifetime about Indian defence, all the teachings of all our Generals and Statesmen and Viceroys during the last fifty years, all the accepted dogmas of both political Parties in this country. Before His Majesty's Government invite us to take such a step&#x2014;I do not, of course, say they will do so&#x2014;but before they contemplate inviting us to take such a step I hope they will think, not once, or twice, or twenty times, but a hundred times. I hope they will show better reasons than they have up to now advanced, and I hope they will give us the opinions of their military advisers on the matter. When I was in India a few years ago a scheme, almost identical with this which I have been examining, and which was at that time identified with a Russian officer named Captain Rittich, was sent out to us in India to be reported upon by the Government of India. We advised very strongly against it, and if I remember aright no one was more strong about it than Lord Kitchener, the then Commander-in-Chief.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01304">What is the opinion of the Government of India now? What are the opinions of the military authorities in India and in this country? What is the advice of the Committee of Imperial Defence? Sir Edward Grey has been asked in the House of Commons for the opinions of his military advisers, but has answered as if the opinions of those officers were secret oracles which belonged to the Government to be treasured up by them and not revealed to any one else. I do not take that view of the opinions of our military advisers. Our military advisers are paid by the nation, and their views on matters of great urgency like this are, in my opinion, the property of the nation. That was the case in regard to the Channel Tunnel. There the military advisers were examined before a Parliamentary Committee; and if that was done in a matter affecting the security of England, surely we have a right to demand the same in a matter affecting the security of India.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01305">One other point before I pass away from strategy. The strategical danger to India is not confined to the opening of her frontiers in the manner I have described. There are many people who fear that we shall be
<col>466</col>
drawn forward into the open and driven to undertake responsibilities which I am sure every one of us would wish to avoid. We may very likely find ourselves, with this great railway running through Persia, compelled to send out garrisons to defend it without the soldiers in India to do it and without the money which would render such a scheme possible. I do not regard such a situation as fantastic. Let us conceive what might very likely arise. It might very well be, the railway having been constructed, that the Persian Government would be powerless to guarantee its security. Russia would obviously&#x2014;and I do not say wrongly&#x2014;undertake the policing of that portion of the line which affected her. What about the railway that lay in our sphere? We could not tolerate Russian guards in our sphere. We should inevitably be compelled to take similar steps on our own side; and it seems to me not unlikely that in this way our Government, whose one desire has been to keep out of these complications, might have to send Indian soldiers to Persia. So much for the question of strategy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01306">Is there any other way in which India would benefit by the construction of this railway? There is the question of the acceleration of the mails. I dare say there would be some acceleration of mails&#x2014;a reduction of two or three days, though I doubt very much whether the Government would welcome the transmission of Indian mails exclusively through foreign countries in the future, and in the event of war I imagine that such an arrangement would have to be suspended at once. There may be some convenience to passengers in the reduction of the time spent on the journey, but against this you have to set the fatigue and heat of the journey, impossible at some periods of the year, the certainty almost that women and children could not travel by such a route, and the certainty that the steamship companies would at once make, as they could make, in my judgment, a corresponding reduction both in time and fares to meet the competition with which they would he faced. Anyhow, I think your Lordships will agree that in respect of mails and passengers there is nothing on the side of advantage which justifies us in accepting any risk or sacrifice of Imperial security.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01307">Then I pass to the interests of commerce. If this railway were made, how would it benefit Anglo-Indian trade? The gross
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0238"/>
<col>467</col>
value of Anglo-Indian trade with Persia at the present time is something less than two millions sterling per annum. The greater part of this trade consists in piece-goods and in tea which is taken from Indian ports, deposited at the Persian harbours, and then put on pony-back, or camel-back or donkey-back and sent up to the towns in the interior. We know that that trade has to suffer many difficulties, difficulties arising from the severity of the passes, the insecurity of the country, and the cost of the caravans. But supposing this railway to be constructed. How is it to benefit that trade? How are our goods to do better when they are placed upon the railway at Karachi, or the harbour, wherever it be, and when they have before them the necessarily heavy freights of the railway before they reach the Persian towns? If you take that part of Persian territory contiguous to our border which the railway would first touch there are only two cities of any size, Yezd and Kerman, distributing centres of some but of no very considerable importance, with a population in neither case of more than 50,000 persons. After that there is nothing until you get into the Russian sphere, and when once you enter that sphere Russia will be able, by her system of rates and rebates at her end of the railway, to destroy any advantages which British or Indian trade may have obtained. I remember when I was in India I had as my financial and commercial adviser that very able man, the late Sir Edward Law. Before coming to India he had served as commercial <i>attach&#x00E9;</i> both in Persia and in Russia, and was warmly attached to both countries; and discussing as we did this question of a Trans-Persian line he always stated as his emphatic opinion that such a line, if made, could only act as a feeder for Russian commerce and would be a great detriment both to British and Indian trade. The fact is that if this railway be made we shall really be doing very much the same thing in the sphere of commerce as I have been contending we shall do in the sphere of strategy&#x2014; that is to say, we shall be reversing the whole of the traditional policy on which we have so far acted. Hitherto our trade with Persia has been seaborne. Now you are going to substitute landborne traffic for seaborne. You are going to divert the trade from the routes which we do command to the routes which we do not.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01308">There is one other country that has to be considered, and that is Persia herself.
<col>468</col>
I am sure that if the construction of such a railway as this were to be of benefit to Persia there is no one who would be better pleased than the members of your Lordships' House. But I wonder if this will be the case. I have been a little struck, in so far as I have been able to follow this matter, with the extent to which Persia seems to have been left out of consideration. I have heard nothing of Persia in connection with the Soci&#x00E9;t&#x00E9; d'Etudes. There is no Persian member upon it, and I have not heard of any Persian finance in connection with the scheme, probably for the very good reason that there is no Persian money forthcoming. Sir Edward Grey, I think, said in his speech that the construction of such a railway would be an advantage to Persia because it would strengthen the central authority and enable it to deal with disturbances. It needs only the slightest acquaintance with the history and geography of Persia to know that the main centres of disturbance are far away from the projected line; and this railway running through the heart of Persia, from West to East, will no more enable Persia to grapple with the particular difficulties with which she is now confronted than would, for instance, the London and Brighton railway enable His Majesty's Government to put down a riot in Bodmin or Penzance. Even if Persia were enabled by this scheme to acquire a greater control over her territories&#x2014;and I am sure we should be glad to see it&#x2014;she may have to pay a heavy price for it. We have had some experience in recent years of international railways. International railways are apt to Le followed by international guards, and international guards involve some form of foreign protection, and foreign protection very easily merges into foreign control. Therefore I doubt whether Persia herself will really gain by this railway any substantial addition to her authority, her means of pacifying her own country, or her power.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01309">There is only one other matter to which I will refer before I resume my seat. Issues such as those of gauge and of alignment&#x2014;the reserved topics mentioned by Sir Edward Grey&#x2014;can very well be postponed until the matter matures. But ought we not to say one word on the question of finance? I should like to impress upon your Lordships in my concluding sentences that the financial burden will be very much greater than anybody
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0239"/>
<col>469</col>
at present apprehends. I said just now that estimates of &#x00A3;15,000,000 and &#x00A3;20,000,000 had been published. I have no time to lay before your Lordships the grounds which lead me to think that the expenditure will probably not be less than &#x00A3;30,000,000. But the question I want to put is, whether it be &#x00A3;20,000,000 or &#x00A3;30,000,000, where is the money coming from? Or, if the money is found by the financiers of the three nations to whom I have referred, who is to give the guarantee? Because you may be quite certain that without a guarantee the money will not be forthcoming. Will Russia give the guarantee? At an early stage I saw a statement to the effect that Russia would not accept any obligation on the Russian Treasury for this line, but it is now said that out of the surplus on the Russian railways she may be willing to guarantee a loan for the northern section of the line. But when we come to the British section or the Indian section, who is going to give the guarantee? I confess I cannot imagine the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, or I may add his successor, coming down to the House of Commons and asking the consent of that House to a guarantee for a great railway outside of England, outside of India, in the heart of Persia, about which a great many people will tell him that its construction will add very much to the future burdens of India and of this country and will materially impair the defensive strength of our Indian Empire. I do not see an English Chancellor of the Exchequer making any such proposal, and I do not see any Indian Finance Minister going down to the Council Chamber at Calcutta&#x2014;I ought now to say Delhi&#x2014;and explaining to the more representative body created by the noble Viscount opposite, at a time when India is called upon to bear the heavy burden of the cost of the transfer of the capital to Delhi and of the suspension of the opium traffic, and when railway finance is so stinted that there is no money to build more than 100 miles of railway in the present year, that it is proposed to take Indian money and spend it upon a guarantee in respect of a continental line. I cannot imagine an Indian Finance Minister making any such proposal, at any rate with any chance of success. And if neither this country nor India will give a guarantee, then I want to know where the security for the money is coming from. I venture to say that if the scheme, should it eventuate,
<col>470</col>
does not perish before that point, the rock of finance is the one upon which it will founder.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01310">May I ask the noble Viscount who will answer me to consider another point '? May it not be said that in the treatment of the railway question in Persia His Majesty's Government are beginning at the wrong end? Here they are apparently contemplating presenting to Persia, a country- so poverty stricken and so backward that it has no railways at all&#x2014;it has, I believe, not more than ten miles of railway&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01311"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: Six miles.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01312"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON of KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: Here they are apparently contemplating presenting to this country a full-blown continental system without any regard to the commercial interests or the requirements of the country itself, and in complete ignorance of the fact that in many parts of Persia railways are waiting to be built (the promoters are actually forthcoming), which would add to the security of the country, diminish the burdens resting on the Government, and add to Persian trade. Is it not rather an absurd thing at such a moment to force upon that country a great continental scheme which is only introduced in other countries after long years of development and when the conditions of the country are those of peace and prosperity advanced to a very high degree? I should like to hear from the noble Viscount that His Majesty's Government are prepared to take advantage of the rights which we possess in respect to Persian railways. When we had our last debate here he will remember quoting with some satisfaction the terms of the Rescript of Nasr-ud-Din Shah, under which, if a concession for a railway be given to others in the North, the Shah&#x2014;and the promise has been confirmed by his successors&#x2014;undertook to give a similar concession to the British in the South. The case for such a railway has, I think, already been brought into existence. The Russians have obtained their concession in the North. I speak of the concession for the railway from Teheran to Khanikin on the Baghdad line, and there is no reason whatever, therefore, why British proposals should not materialise in the South. I believe that His Majesty's Government have taken steps in this matter. I have heard of a syndicate
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0240"/>
<col>471</col>
being formed and of powerful groups connected with Persia taking part in it with a view to a concession from Mohammerah to Khoremabad. I hope that this may be true, and that His Majesty's Government may be able to give us some information about it.<lb/>
Here in this smaller policy of internal railways in Persia is a scheme which I think is practicable, which will not excite any jealousy, which will not raise any alarms in India or anywhere else, and which you may pursue with the knowledge that all parties are agreed upon it. I hope His Majesty's Government will curtail their ambitions in regard to the larger scheme, and will devote themselves to the humbler task which I have dared to suggest to them. And, above all, I hope that they will not involve this country or the Government of India in the great responsibilities that would result from a change of policy in regard to the defence of India without placing before us in the fullest manner the opinions upon which they propose to act, and that, whatever views they may entertain themselves, they will not proceed to convert those views into action without giving both Houses of Parliament an opportunity of expressing an opinion upon them. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

I am at a loss to know how, after reading Sir Edward Grey's speech in another place, the noble Earl should have taken up the attitude that he has done in respect to the Government. It is no discredit to him at all that he is not accurately informed as to the immediate relations of the Government to this Soci&#x00E9;t&#x00E9; d'Etudes. The noble Earl has fallen into various errors as to the facts and circumstances connected with that body and our relations to it, which I must point out to him and to your Lordships. The proposal&#x2014;there is no concealment about it&#x2014;was initiated in Russia. The promoters of this body were Russian
<col>472</col>
promoters in the first instance. They have had no support whatever from His Majesty's Government beyond the negative refusal to veto their existence and to prohibit their operations so far as we could. Not one atom of money has found its way from our Exchequer to the chest of that body. The noble Earl has been entirely misinformed when he tells your Lordships that the two Ministers at Teheran, the Russian Minister and our own, approached the Persian Government and invited them to give facilities for the operations of this commission. There has been no communication of that sort.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl said that we had encouraged this body and its operations. That is entirely imaginary. We have not encouraged it beyond the fact that when the proposal was presented to us we examined it&#x2014;the fact of the proposal, not the contents of it&#x2014;and in describing that as encouragement and in taxing us with using diplomatic machinery the noble Earl is entirely wide of the mark. The noble Earl made a point that supposing this body were to report in favour of some through line of which we, when the time comes, disapprove, it would be impossible for us with diplomatic decency and consistency to withstand the report of that body. I cannot imagine anything that has been said by any member of the Government&#x2014;certainly not by Sir Edward Grey, who is the only person, I think, who has spoken officially&#x2014;which could warrant the view that we should not be justified in dealing with perfect freedom with the report of this body. The noble Earl talked of the rapidity with which this proceeding had gone on, and he said that last year when I had the honour of following him in debate&#x2014;in March, I think&#x2014;I gave him a sort of assurance that nothing was on foot. My language does not bear that&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

He knows better than anybody in the House, from his experience in two Government Offices and in
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0241"/>
<col>473</col>
India, that since the year 1872 the question of railways in Persia, including the Trans-Continental railway, has been a thoroughly live issue. In 1872 there was, if I remember aright, a Committee of the House of Commons appointed. That was the first Committee which inquired into this question of Persian railways. From 1872 to 1888 there was a stream of applications from Germans, Russians, Frenchmen, Americans, to Persia for concessions, some of them on a grand and magnificent scale and others entirely insignificant. Still there was a constant series of applications; and at the end of it all&#x2014;as I interrupted the noble Earl towards the end of his speech to say&#x2014;at the end of it all Persia possesses only six miles of railway, which runs to the shrine of a Persian saint. Then came the period from 1888 to 1890. The noble Earl must be fully cognisant of the stream of telegrams and despatches that went on during those two years between the late Lord Salisbury and his Ministers both at, St. Petersburg and Teheran, all going fully into the very kind of arguments&#x2014;the more important of them, at all events&#x2014;which the noble Earl has brought forward to-night, and coming to a conclusion. There was a pause from 1890 onwards, and then came the pamphlet of Captain Rettich, referred to by the noble Earl, on which the noble Earl himself wrote a very elaborate antagonistic Memorandum. I submit, therefore, that the noble Earl greatly exaggerated when he suggested that we had sprung something upon Europe or upon this country or upon Parliament.<lb/>
The question entered a new phase about the end of 1910, and this proposal was submitted for our consideration. I would like to ask the noble Earl what he would have done if this proposal for a Soci&#x00E9;t&#x00E9; d'Etudes had been brought before him. Were we to say, "We will not look at it; we have a frontier policy in India consecrated"&#x2014;as the noble Earl would have put it most eloquently&#x2014;"by the decisions of great men for many generations; we will not listen to this?" That would have been a very heroic attitude. There is not a man in this House who is not fully conscious of all the arguments that the noble Earl has brought forward to-night about keeping as long as ever we can a frontier on the Persian side of mountain and of desert. The military advantage of preserving that frontier, if we could do it, is quite obvious, and we do not want all this trumpet-
<col>474</col>
blowing&#x2014;I am not referring for the moment to the noble Earl&#x2014;all this trumpet-blowing in the newspapers and so forth as to the dangers to which we are exposing India.<lb/>
Let me go back. What would you have done? There is no doubt that any detriment to that frontier of mountains and desert does expose India to some disadvantages. But suppose we had said, when this proposal was made, "We will turn our backs upon all proposals of this kind; we will not listen." Would that blunt and bluff negative have been an extinguisher to the whole business? The noble Earl is a great deal too well acquainted with the currents and sub-currents, diplomatic, commercial, and political, which are running to suppose for a moment that the business would remain under that extinguisher. It would not be so; and anybody must have a very superficial knowledge of the political and diplomatic conditions and relations of this country in connection with India, among other things, who would dream for a moment that nothing would follow. The question which has been left all these years would undoubtedly remain, but it would have assumed a new aspect; and when the noble Earl says, and says truly enough, that this may involve a change in the conditions of frontier policy, I would point out that you would not have avoided that by simply giving a point-blank refusal to this proposal. A man must have a very superficial knowledge&#x2014;I am not thinking of the noble Earl&#x2014;of the diplomatic state of Europe and must have a very narrow power of political imagination if he does not see, after we had declined, gruffly or with polite evasions, to assent to anything involving the principle of the Trans-Persian railway, that a set of arrangements easily and naturally devised, in view of all the political and military consequences involved in them, would or might have led&#x2014;I think would have led&#x2014;to a very large extension in other ways from those which now alarm the noble Earl of frontier defence and military expenditure in India. That is a point that. I do urgently press upon your Lordships. The Government of India is just, as sensible as we are that a point-blank refusal to assent, not to the railway, but to an examination of the present proposal, might have led to combinations that would involve disadvantages to our Indian position much more serious in their character than the disadvantages that could arise from this limited co-operation. The noble Earl talked a
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0242"/>
<col>475</col>
great deal about fatalism, and of the idea of this Trans-Persian railway being inevitable. I could not but remember that last year the noble Earl himself told us of a "great scheme of inter-continental communication which in the belief of all of us will some day be realised." Is not that fatalism? Why are we to be reproached with a cowardly sort of fatalism when we really do not go far in advance of the line taken by the noble Earl himself only a year ago?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01317"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: You go about fifty years in advance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01318"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: But how does anybody know&#x2014;I certainly do not&#x2014;that this railway will be made fifty years hence? We have not committed ourselves to it. We have committed the Government to nothing except to this examination, and we are perfectly free to deal with the results of that examination without any fatalistic intention of precipitating the noble Earl's own expectation that some day or other the Trans-Persian railway will be constructed. I leave this point by repeating the question which I put to the noble Earl, "Would you have had us say when this proposal was brought before us, No, we will have nothing to do with it; we will use all our influence in the way of vetoing, and, so far as may be, prohibiting it'?" If he speaks again I wish he would be kind enough to say whether he would or would not have had us say that.<lb/>
Now with a great deal of what the noble Earl has said about trade and the effects of this railway, if it be made, upon trade, I am bound to say I entirely agree. I have had occasion to think a good deal about the scheme, and I agree that the prospects of its financial success would not strike most of us as satisfactory. The noble Earl is perfectly right when he says that, according to the best opinions that can be got, the estimated profits, if they are measured by Indian standards, are put four-fifths too high; they will be only one-fifth of the estimated amount. And the noble Earl is not far wrong, according to Indian precedents, in what he says of the cost of the railway. He puts it at &#x00A3;30,000,000 instead of &#x00A3;20,000,000&#x2014;some people say it will he &#x00A3;40,000,000. We are quite alive to all those considerations. The point has been taken&#x2014;and I confess I do not see any answer to it when I consider the authorities who make it&#x2014;that Russian trade is very likely to get
<col>476</col>
more profit out of this line than we are likely to do. That may be. That is an argument which the Government of the day will have to consider when they have the report forwarded to them. No doubt the cost of construction through a mountainous country where labour is scarce, where communications are very difficult, and where I suppose contracts will not be prepared on purely abstract benevolent principles will be very formidable. But i however that may be, the working of the line and the earning of profits will be a slow and gradual process. All the noble Earl's arguments about the immense difficulty of land transport competing with the cheapness and facility and accustomedness of the sea route will operate.<lb/>
I was rather surprised to hear the noble Earl, after he had very carefully analysed all those elements, then say that the Government were favouring a line which would perhaps carry the mails or not carry the mails, which might or might not carry an increased number of passengers, and so forth. But does he not perceive that when the construction of this line and any support of it by His Majesty's Government is under consideration all those elements will be deciding elements? To suppose that we have already made up our minds to cast them all aside and to neglect these points is really to make us out more rash and heedless than the noble Earl had any right to do. As to this line not benefiting our trade but Russian trade, I would like to observe, in passing, that that very important set of people the Moscow merchants do not think so; they think the exact opposite, and they are now loud in their complaints that this line would lead to a great improvement of British and other foreign trade at their expense. The noble Earl must bear that in mind. Nobody pretends that Great Britain, and India, and the whole general trade of the world will not benefit from the creation of a better state of things in Persia. It is clear that wherever you get a better state of social well-being you get a greater demand for goods. Where you have roads and communications markets are improved. I wish some of my friends&#x2014;the noble Earl referred to them&#x2014;in the Press would realise what the difficulties now are, and how far those difficulties would be affected by railways whether a trunk line, or branch lines from the ports which in many ways we should
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0243"/>
<col>477</col>
be inclined to prefer. I wish they would realise the difficulties of trade in Persia&#x2014;insecurity, inefficient and corrupt administration, maladministration of justice, the great distance between giving an order and its execution, the long delay of exchange remittances, the impossibility of supervising and controlling mercantile transactions&#x2014;all these difficulties will be lessened by improved communications. They will yield to improved communications, and they are very little likely to yield to anything else. If I may venture upon a private observation I am not at all sure that those are not right who, instead of railways, recommend, not caravan roads, but cart roads, as they would be less expensive, and so forth. But that is a question that I have no right to go into to-night. Supposing circumstances compelled the Government of the day, whoever they may be, to adopt the railway policy the precedents are not quite encouraging. Though the overland route from London to Constantinople competes with the sea route, the latter suffers no disadvantage at all in consequence of this competing land route. Then we have been told a great deal during the discussions about the Siberian Railway. I rather think that some of the Russian advocates of this line have pointed to the Siberian railway. There is no real parallel at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01319"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01320"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: I am glad the noble Earl agrees, because there is no real parallel at all between the Siberian railway and this Trans-Persian railway. The Siberian railway shortens the distance from the centre of Europe to the Far East by one-half. Then it gives a direct railway route much shorter than the sea route, not merely to India but to an area infinitely larger in size than India, comprising as well the important seaports of China and of Japan. The only other observation I make about the Siberian railroad is that on that there is an immense emigration traffic. On the Trans-Persian line there is no reason to suppose that there will be any emigration traffic at all.<lb/>
I was disappointed, I admit, at what the noble Earl said about the effect of this line upon Persia. I do not suppose for a moment that this line or any other line or any number of them would bring the millennium to Persia. The confusion in Persia along with the advent of the Baghdad
<col>478</col>
railway and the Anglo-Russian Convention are the elements that have made this proposal actual. As to the effect upon the confusion of Persia one thing is certain, and will not be denied by anybody who has any idea of government in any part of the world and who is at all acquainted with&#x2014;shall I cad it&#x2014;the chaos that exists in many parts of Persia&#x2014;namely, that railways would immensely increase the power of the Persian Government in dealing with disorder and maintaining something a little more like security. I saw the other day some emphatic language of a very competent observer who knows Persia well. He says that to introduce railways, including this trunk line, would be to put the most powerful weapon into the hands of the Central Government in Persia, which is to-day a mere shadow and can be derided with impunity. I was surprised that some political friends of mine who are so anxious that we should be more active on the popular side of affairs in Persia should be the most indignant of all at the idea of a measure which would do more than any other, if it were financially workable and so forth, to put into the hands of the Persian Government the power of managing their own affairs and holding up their heads, in the language of my friends, against both Russia and England.<lb/>
I will not detain your Lordships longer. The whole question of the alignment and the terms on which the railroad is to be administered and controlled, the question of whether the profits made on the northern lines ought to be pooled with the profits made in the south, a much more dubious quantity&#x2014;all these are matters which this House and the other House and the country can consider much more effectively when they have a definite scheme presented to them. It is said, "You have never consulted Persia." It will be quite time enough to consult Persia as to a concession when we and the other Powers concerned have made up our minds as to what is the concession we ought to ask for. Let us then make up our minds what is the best alignment and what all these other subsidiary arrangements ought to be. The noble Earl, I hope, will not think that I have at all shirked the important discussion that he raised about the alignment of the route. He will understand that some of those projected routes involve considerations of extreme danger, and therefore I have not thought it worth while
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0244"/>
<col>479</col>
to detain your Lordships with a long investigation into the competing routes. It is an extraordinarily intricate and complex subject. It is barely intelligible without one of those maps which the noble Earl reproached me for producing last year, and therefore I will not attempt to follow him over that area.<lb/>
I only say that in keeping open to ourselves the option of asking for railway concessions when the proper time comes we have not designed and do not design to shut out all foreign enterprise from Persia. That would be a great disadvantage to Persia, and not any advantage to ourselves. It must be clearly stated that we have no desire to make this railway ourselves in Persia at this moment, but we may well wish to guard against the possibility of waking up some morning and finding that the Persians have placed some important concessions elsewhere involving foreign control which would be detrimental to our political interests and strategically menacing to our frontier. We therefore desire to have the option of making railways of that sort ourselves in case Persia favours foreign enterprise. I hope the House, in considering the noble Earl's speech and in reading the arguments, of which we shall have, perhaps, a plethora in the next few months, will remember the strictly conditional situation in which the Government stands in respect of all these proposals, and will not forget, although there may be drawbacks, which we do not deny, to the Trans-Persian railway, that any Government that might succeed us would think, not twice but a hundred times, before they repudiated and turned their backs upon our action.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01321"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether the noble Earl will think the reply of the noble Viscount opposite has been a satisfactory one. I confess that I am still considerably dismayed with regard to it. It has, however, thrown some light on what has led up to the establishment of this Soci&#x00E9;t&#x00E9; d'Etudes. It is interesting to see that the Government have from time to time desired apparently to thwart this railway project, and equally interesting to see that whenever they have put some obstacle in the way of the project the Russian Government have been quite agreeable, so desirous have they been to see some scheme adopted, to accept whatever this Government have proposed. The noble Viscount opposite referred to the many
<col>480</col>
railway projects in Persia which have been put before the public for a number of years past. He did not say why not one of them has ever come to fruition. And do not the same reasons that prevented those lines from being constructed equally hold good to-day as to why this line should not be constructed? The light which the noble Viscount has thrown upon the present proposal seems to show that the line is not desired by His Majesty's Government, that they have not done what they have done willingly, that they have not done it because they considered it good to Persia or to India but because of some other alternative&#x2014;because some rebuff that they would have had to administer would have led to serious and disastrous consequences.<lb/>
The noble Viscount speaks of the sub-currents of diplomacy that are going on. I do not know of them, being a man in the street, and I do not know what disastrous consequences would have ensued from a polite disclaimer. But I do not see how it is going to improve the position when a few months hence this Soci&#x00E9;t&#x00E9; d'Etudes may possibly furnish a satisfactory report. What then will be the duty of His Majesty's Government? Will they be in a better position to refuse then than they are now? The objections to the line as put forward by the noble Earl and also as stated by <i>The Times</i> Military Correspondent&#x2014;all so powerful and forcible&#x2014;would remain just as great eighteen months hence as they are to-day. How will the Government then be in a better position to reject the scheme? It seems to me only to intensify the evil, and if the line does involve a certain amount of risk to India that risk will be just as great then as now. I share, like the noble Earl, a belief in universal peace between the great nations of the earth and that India will be linked up by railway communication with the rest of the world. But there is no need to anticipate that day. The conditions that have rendered it undesirable in the past are just as strong to-day, and until you change the environment of affairs you are merely putting new wine into old bottles by allowing this line to be constructed.<lb/>
I know of no single commercial body in India or in this country that desires to see this line built&#x2014;with one exception only, the Chamber of Commerce at Karachi. The chairman, Mr. Webb, is a great believer, as I am also, in the future of Karachi as one of the principal Indian ports, and he is
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0245"/>
<col>481</col>
naturally keen to see his hopes realised at once. And in Karachi being made the terminus of the Trans-Persian railway no doubt Karachi would be very much uplifted. But even the Chamber of Commerce realise that there is a risk, and the Government recognise the risk, because, as we understand from the papers, there has been an obligation imposed by the Government and admitted by the noble Viscount that the alignment should, if required, be brought down within reach of the coast with the idea that our naval forces would be able to command that line in case of any emergency. I think that is a sufficient argument without waiting for the utterances of the military experts and others to show what a danger lies in this line when you propose to divert it in order to bring it within command of your sea forces so as to prevent its being used as a hostile instrument in the event of invasion. First of all, it is very obvious you would have to have a much stronger force than you have at the present time in Indian waters if you wish to secure the line by such means. But I am quite content merely to take that argument to show what a great danger there is in having a line to India linked up with the outside world by railway communication, and, as I say, the conditions that rendered it undesirable in the past still obtain at the present moment.<lb/>
I am not one of those who wish to represent that the utterances of the Press are to be taken as indicating the views of the whole of the nation. I would not for a moment think that the carping criticisms which are sometimes uttered in the Press of this country against Germany indicate the feelings of the people of this country against the people of that nation. But there is one very notable Russian journal, the <i>Novoe Vreinya,</i> and that paper recently, just previous to the interview at the Baltic port, published a very lengthy article with reference to the relations of Germany and Great Britain. Let me read two quotations. One is&#x2014;
<quote>"On the other hand, only the loss of India by England, from whatever cause, would establish permanent peace between us and her."</quote>
Then it goes on&#x2014;
<quote>"Russia ought to rejoice that somebody has arisen to fight the enemy who for a hundred years stood in her way everywhere. Is it not England's hegemony at sea which has compelled us to stop dead, as before a stone wall, in all the Easts&#x2014;the Near, the Middle, and the Far East? Is it not this hegemony which will keep us back in our natural evolution on two continents in the future?"</quote>
<col>482</col>
I associate myself entirely with the word: spoken by the noble Earl as to the value of the friendly relations subsisting between us and Russia, but we only have to look back to our foreign relations (luring the last twenty years with the different Powers of the world to see how shifting and how variable these relations are; and really the sole excuse for the putting forward of this scheme at the present time is our <i>Entente</i> with Russia. All the other objections remain exactly as they have been for the last fifty or a hundred years, and whilst we earnestly hope that the <i>Entente</i> may be continued for many long years to come we ought not to consent to the construction of a permanent work of such a character as a railway line on such a very shifting foundation or base as that which I have described. I do not think the noble Viscount vouchsafed any reply as to our having the opinion of the military experts and as to putting ourselves into the position that this country was in when a Committee reported on the project of the proposed Channel Tunnel. Surely we ought to have the views of the Council of Defence on this matter. We ought also to know whether the Board of Trade have considered the commercial advantages of this line. I think we are entitled to have put before Parliament the views of these different bodies. I think it is admitted that there is practically no commercial advantage in this line to India&#x2014;nothing that will pay a half per cent. on capital; and you have this very great risk and also the great expenditure the Government would have to incur by giving a guarantee.<lb/>
I am surprised to find that the noble Viscount has been bold enough to stand up and make an apology for this project. He has refused on two or three occasions to consider a poor little railway in the Aden <i>Hinterland,</i> a railway which would open up the fertile country around and give relief to your sun-baked garrison at Aden by letting them get to a hill station, and which would not cost your Government a single rupee. Lord Morley when the autocratic Secretary of State for India would have nothing to do with that small project; yet here the noble Viscount ventures to defend a project of great risk without any possible advantage to India and with only a minimum of advantage to Persia. The noble Viscount, in his reply, dilated upon the benefit to Persia of improved com-
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0246"/>
<col>483</col>
munications. Every one admits that. But what the noble Earl and others who share my view object to is the extension of any railway communication to a line east of Bandar Abbas to the Indian frontier. The country that wants bringing into order is essentially Laristan and the adjacent districts on the western side of Persia. That is the country where railways are most earnestly desired, and railways, too, by which we could co-operate heartily with Russia if the Persian Government thinks fit&#x2014;a system which would be really to the commercial and political benefit of Persia. This line, if it ever became realised, would in my view only create mistrust between ourselves and Russia. It would not be to the improvement of our relations, and I think on that score alone it is sufficient to inquire whether it ought to go any further.<lb/>
There is another point. If you have a line inter-connected by this railway you will not increase that confidence that is so very necessary for our good and firm government of India you will at once render India more liable to scares. I asked two prominent Indians who were over here lately what they thought of this scheme. One said that he did not know very much about it, but that it certainly should not be done until we have compulsory service in England. The other said that it might lie a nice thing for India because then the Indians would be able to go into Persia and establish themselves there. That gentleman spoke with a great lack of knowledge of the conditions that prevail in Persia if he thinks that Indian labour, which is so scarce at the present time, will find any pleasant outlet into Persia, that dry and and country where in most places they do not find enough water to perform their daily ablutions. There is, to my mind, no advantage to be gained by this line, and, on the ether hand, there is every possible risk. It could be said in favour of the Channel Tunnel&#x2014;it was admitted by the Committee&#x2014;that it would lead to a great improvement in commerce and to a much greater passenger traffic; but neither of those conditions would prevail were this line built. I therefore hope that the Government will not be too benevolently disposed towards the inquiry that is being held, and I think they will only put themselves into a much weaker position if they have to reject the proposal hereafter. There are plenty of other lines
<col>484</col>
that can be constructed-in Persia with the greatest advantage to that country and that can be reasonably undertaken on a friendly basis between ourselves and Russia. Those could be made without violating any portion of those great natural defences with which Providence has favoured India.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01322"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD INCHCAPE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I associate myself with what has fallen from the noble Earl, and I would venture to ask your Lordships to consider for a moment the financial and practical side of this proposed railway through Persia. The British section, or it may be the Indian section, will start from Karachi and run through 920 miles of unpopulated, unfertile, and waterless country, and, as Lord Lamington said, those who promote the line admit that it must be close to the shore through the Makran district in order that it may be shelled by our ships in the event of its being used in a hostile manner against India. The traffic that the line would create would probably be about sufficient to fill a single truck in a fortnightly train. I submit that the Government of India have quite enough on their hands for many years to come in developing their own railway system.<lb/>
With your Lordships' permission I desire to dwell for a moment on the position of Indian railways. Some five or six years ago I was appointed by the noble Viscount who was then Secretary of State for India to be Chairman of a Committee to inquire into and report upon the development of the Indian railway system. One member of that Committee was the Financial Secretary at the India Office, Mr. Lionel Abrahams. Another member was an ex-Financial Member of the Council of the Governor-General of India, Sir David Barbour, a gentleman who was closely associated with Lord Lansdowne, when Viceroy of India, in his great work of putting the currency of the country on a stable basis. Another member was Sir Felix Schuster, an eminent financial authority in the City of London. The unanimous conclusion of that Committee was that India should spend not less than &#x00A3;12,500.000 upon the development of her railway system, and that the expenditure of that sum would be a profitable proposition. A further recommendation was that the money in the first place should be devoted to the equipment of the lines then opened, which were lamentably short of rolling-stock. Since that time there has been devoted to
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0247"/>
<col>485</col>
the railways of India every penny which the Government of India could spare from its surplus balances, and every penny which could be borrowed in England and in India on the security of the revenues of India, and every penny which the railway Companies could borrow in this country, but the twelve and a-half millions have never been reached.<lb/>
I spent last winter in India, and having been appointed President of a Conference between the Government of India and the railway companies to try and settle some long out-standing differences, I had occasion during the course of my investigations to travel sonic 12,000 miles over the railway systems of India. And, my Lords, what did I see? From Bombay in the west to Calcutta and Madras in the east, from the Himalayas in the north to Cape Comorian in the south, practically every large railway station was congested with goods for which there were no means of transport to be found. The mills in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras were dangerously near the end of their coal supplies, ships were hung up in the Hugh for' want of coal, which had gone to famine prices, although at the mouths of the pits in the Bengal coalfields not 150 miles away from Calcutta I saw tens of thousands of tons of coal piled up, which reminded me of that old song "Wait for the Wagon." There were no means of getting the coal down to the seaboard. It was anticipated when I was there in March that things would mend by May, but only the other day an influential deputation waited upon the Secretary of State for India and represented to him that, the state of affairs was still as bad as ever. I impute no blame to the India Office, to the Government of India, to the Railway Board, or to the directors and managers of the great railway companies in India who manage the railways so admirably for the Government.<lb/>
When I went to India about forty years ago there was a cry for more permanent way and more rolling-stock. That cry has gone on every year since then, and the cry exists to-day. The fact is it is difficult to get sufficient money in this country, where the capital alone can be found, to meet the railway requirements of India, and it has been more difficult than ever in the past five years through young countries being opened up and trade being so active all the world over. The Three-and-
<col>486</col>
a-Half per cent. Loans of the Government of India, which used to stand well over par, are now under 92, and so long as trade continues active, and so long as India continues to be a borrowing Government, we cannot expect to see her annual issues absorbed except at constantly dwindling prices. The outlook at the moment for getting more money for Indian railways is by no means bright. The opium revenue is being relinquished, as the noble Earl said, for the supposed moral and material benefit of the blue-robed nation, although, if recent reports are correct, as the poppy cultivation diminishes in Hindustan it increases in the Celestial Empire.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, the Government of India is faced with an expenditure in the immediate future of several millions sterling, it may lie four, it may be six, it may be eight, I think it will probably be ten millions, for the new capital at Delhi. All this means that there will be less money available for irrigation, for railways, and for other reproductive works in India. I have heard it stated&#x2014;although I felt somewhat reassured by the statement of the noble Viscount that nothing was being done in connection with this railway&#x2014; that the survey has either been begun or is about to be undertaken from Karachi to Charbar. It would be a distinct misfortune if the resources of the North-western State railway were to be squandered on a project of this kind instead of being laid out in providing that rolling-stock which is so necessary to enable it to handle the goods which it is now unable to carry. I submit that the time is inopportune for the Government to think of building a line from Karachi either to the centre or to the confines of Persia&#x2014;a line which will never pay its working expenses, far less interest upon the cost of its construction. I submit that the funds at the disposal of the Government of India should be employed in the development of the railway system of that country and not wasted on a silly project of this description. Even if the money is found by outside financiers the effect will be the same. If the interest is guaranteed on the cost of construction and if the guarantee conies from the revenues of India it will be a dissipation of the credit of the Secretary of State and a charge upon the revenues of the country. I strongly urge, therefore, that neither His Majesty's Government nor the Government of India should have anything to do with the building of this
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0248"/>
<col>487</col>
line. I further urge that they should not guarantee a sixpence of interest on the cost of the construction of a railway from which we have nothing to gain either from a political, a military, or a commercial point of view. For, after all is said and done, the first line of a country's defence is solvency; and I think we should refrain from embarking on an enterprise, however attractive the name may be, which is calculated to hang a financial burden round our necks for years to come.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01323"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had no intention of intervening in this debate, but perhaps I might say a word upon one or two of the points which have been raised by noble Lords opposite. I think that my noble friend Lord Morley showed that the picture which the noble Earl opposite drew in his opening speech, a somewhat alarming picture, as to the extent to which His Majesty's Government were implicated in the proposition of a Trans-Persian railway, was not entirely accurate. But, in spite of that fact, I noticed that when Lord Lamington pursued his share in the debate he again accused us in no measured terms of being completely committed to this project, and he seemed to regard the railway as being as good as made and the frontier of India in almost immediate danger. I am bound to say that my noble friend behind me who has just sat down and whose intervention in the debate I am sure we all welcomed, speaking as he does with great authority, also went further than the facts altogether justify in appearing to assume that the Government of India was on the point of undertaking, if it had not already undertaken, serious financial responsibilities in connection with this project.<lb/>
On the question of defence, we should all, I suppose, agree that as a purely abstract proposition, India being what it is and governed as it is, it is a thorough convenience to ourselves and no real disadvantage to the people of India that it should be isolated from direct communication by land with the outer world. The great mountain ranges, the inviolable desert frontiers, the impenetrable stretches of jungle, all have had much to do in making the history of India what it is to-day, and we should all admit, as I say, as an abstract proposition, that a continuance of that state of things could not be altogether
<col>488</col>
distasteful to us. I do not mind admitting a personal view which is of no particular interest to anybody but myself, that I have more than a sneaking sympathy with the objections which Lord Palmerston took to the making of the Suez Canal from the point of view of our Indian Empire. I am quite prepared to admit that if we had had the great sea route to India as our main route and the overland route for those who were in a hurry, crossing the Isthmus at Suez, we in India should not have been greatly the worse. At the same time we have to admit&#x2014;the noble Earl has explicitly admitted it himself&#x2014;that even if we do not like to call a particular railway inevitable, yet the tendency of railway construction, of increased trade, and also of international relations, points in the direction of railway construction in Persia, and that construction, whether it involves or not&#x2014;as to which I will say a word in a moment&#x2014;the construction of a Trans-Persian railway as such, undoubtedly awakes new questions of frontier defence.<lb/>
I might say, for the information of the noble Earl and of the House, that this particular matter of a possible Trans-Persian railway has not been formally considered by the Committee of Defence because it is not in any sense yet a live project. The subject has been considered by the General Staff in India, and in considering it they, of course, expressed marked preferences for certain schemes of alignment in comparison with others. Some they thought far more disadvantageous and even dangerous than others from the Indian point of view. But on the whole subject they took the view that it might be a disadvantageous and even a dangerous thing to pronounce an absolute veto on the proposal when it was made in this quite tentative form, on the ground that if you were prepared not to dismiss the principle altogether, and if&#x2014;which is a very large "if"&#x2014; the money was forthcoming for the making of the railway and preparations proceeded for its construction, then you would be able to secure that it should be made in the way least detrimental to your interests; whereas if you attempted to interpose a veto, and nevertheless the railway was made, it would very probably then be made in the manner least advantageous to Indian interests. From that point of view the General Staff in India did not consider themselves debarred, but quite the contrary, from examining the project
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0249"/>
<col>489</col>
from the defence point of view and expressing a preference for certain alignments and their conviction of the necessity for certain safeguards; because they recognised that it was impossible not to realise, bearing in mind what the noble Earl and other noble Lords have said, the possible destructibility of any existing arrangement as between European Powers, awl that it was impossible to shut your eyes to the possibility of certain other combinations through which or by means of which, the line might be made in spite of our declared intention to have nothing to do with it so far as the Indian frontier part of it was concerned.<lb/>
My noble friend behind me drew attention to the fact that some of those who ordinarily support His Majesty's Government in domestic politics and to some extent also in foreign politics have uttered somewhat severe strictures on the assumed action of His Majesty's Government in this matter of a Trans-Persian railway. One might ask them, as my noble friend asked the noble Earl, What is the precise step which in the circumstances they would have taken? What do they consider to lie the error that we have so far committed&#x2014;I will not say in not vetoing the institution of this Soci&#x00E9;t&#x00E9; d'Etudes, because I do not see how we could have prevented its inception although we might possibly have prevented certain persons from joining it&#x2014;but in somehow not placing a veto on the project in a manner the precise form of which I confess I am unable to conceive? It is one of the curious ironies of history that brings some of those pacific friends of ours into the precise position which thirty and more years ago those very different people enjoyed who delighted in the doggerel song of which the word "Jingo" is, I suppose, the only survival at this moment. I hope they will see that we have not committed His Majesty's Government, not merely to any participation in this proposed line if it be made, but to any definite approval of the line. We are not prepared on principle&#x2014;as the noble Earl reminded us my right hon. friend used the words "the principle of the undertaking" in another place&#x2014;we are not prepared on principle to say that this line shall not be made. But that is a very different story from the kind of participation in the project of which in some quarters we are accused.<lb/>
And on that I should like so far as possible to reassure my noble friend behind me, Lord Inchcape, as to the
<col>490</col>
attitude of the Government of India and the policy of His Majesty's Government in the matter of finance. He said with great truth that all the money that is available for Indian railways is required for those railways. It is required to a very large extent for the improvement of rolling-stock and for the improvement of lines in all manner of ways by widening and the provision of marshalling sidings and a number of other improvements. If money were forthcoming there are also new branch lines in many directions which we should be glad to make. We are entirely alive to the importance of not squandering Indian money which might be devoted to our own railways upon a project of this kind. I certainly have no desire to expend a single rupee of Indian money on such a project as this. And as to the question of guaranteeing a return for the lines, if and when they are opened, altogether apart from the question of assisting in any way in the construction, we have entered into no engagement of the kind. We are under no engagement to the promoters of this line to assist this railway should it be made.<lb/>
To continue the question of the construction of the main line, there is this other point of view which arises out of what fell from the noble Earl when he drew attention to the possible advantage to Persia, in the construction of various railways through districts which, as he stated, needed the service of a railway more than those districts through which a perfectly direct Trans-Persian line would pass. It is certainly not for me to prophesy, but it is, of course, quite possible that the immediate future of Persian railway construction may be brought about in that form. I, for one, certainly should not complain if it were, but would welcome it. It; may come about that railways may be made in Persia piecemeal, and that one day we may wake up and find that a Trans-Persian railway thereby exists just as the London and North Western Railway, to name only one instance, was composed of four or five different lines before you were able to travel by it through to Manchester or through to Carlisle. That is, of course, a possible outcome. But I hope that if the noble Earl proposes to say anything more in replying on the debate he will absolve us from having unduly complicated our position in Persia or of having implicated His Majesty's Government in
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0250"/>
<col>491</col>
this particular project. We recognise as fully as he could the various objections which may be raised on different grounds to the construction of this particular line. But we do await from him any statement that lie may wish to make of what alternative action he would have taken, what policy he would have pursued in the circumstances differently from our own; and I trust that he will be willing to admit that we have done nothing which ought to be treated as detrimental to the interests either of India or of this country in the steps which we have taken so far, or in not vetoing the constitution of this Soci&#x00E9;t&#x00E9; d'Etudes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01324"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will, with the greatest pleasure, answer the challenge which has been directed to me both by the noble Viscount and by the noble Marquess. Both noble Lords said to me, "Had the proposals made by the Soci&#x00E9;t&#x00E9; d'Etudes come before you, what would you have done in the circumstances? Would you have met them with a point-blank refusal? "It is almost impossible for me to give a direct answer to the question, because, of course, I do not know the form in which the proposal first came before His Majesty's Government. I have no idea who started it. It has been assumed more than once that the influence of the Russian Government is behind it. Whether the first proposal came to His Majesty's Government through a group of independent financiers or through the Russian Government I do not know. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, more than once hinted, although in somewhat obscure terms that serious consequences might have ensued if the British Government had taken any other line. He hinted at pressure, diplomatic or otherwise, that might have been put on, either in this country or in Persia or in India.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01325"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: I never used any word that carried pressure with it. I said that combinations might naturally and easily develop&#x2014;arrangements which would be more disadvantageous than any that are now proposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01326"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON of KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: Exactly; but I am no wiser than I was before. The noble Viscount indulged in language of obscurity in his first speech Which I am bound to say he has not in the least degree removed by his subsequent explanation. I cannot say, therefore, what I would have done in the circum-
<col>492</col>
stances. But I think I may say what I would not have done. The noble Marquess seemed to think just now that the action of His Majesty's Government had been confined to not placing a veto&#x2014;I think those were his words&#x2014;upon the scheme. Surely they have gone a great deal further than that. What I would not have done would have been to say what the Secretary of State said in the House of Commons. He distinctly stated that, given the satisfactory conditions required by the Government, the Government were "in principle" favourable to the scheme. That has never been said before by a British Government. It was not the view of the Government of my day, either in England or in India. They were in principle unfavourable to the scheme. Really if you have a Secretary of State making this pronouncement deliberately on behalf of his Government in the House of Commons you cannot be surprised if the result is what it has been&#x2014;namely, that your friends think that you have given to the proposal a support perhaps in excess of that which you have actually done. Certainly that impression exists, as you have admitted, in your own newspapers. It exists in both Houses of Parliament, and I am not certain that a lingering element of it does not exist in my own mind still. To give a concrete example. I think the noble Marquess somewhat dissented from the idea that any active steps had been taken in pursuance of these plans by the Government of India. I would point out that it is notorious that an engineer has been sent out&#x2014;I know his name and all about him&#x2014;by the Government of India from Karachi to investigate the country lying between Karachi and the Persian border. If the Government are merely not imposing a veto on the scheme, why should they take this active step and associate themselves with it? I am bound to say for my own part that if there has been any misinterpretation of the Government's attitude they have only themselves to thank.<lb/>
The noble Marquess was kind enough to give us some information with regard to the opinions that have reached him from the authorities, military and otherwise. He told us that the Committee of Imperial Defence have not yet been consulted. If these plans take a shape later on that will require them to be placed before that Committee I do most earnestly hope that we shall be favoured with their opinion.
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0251"/>
<col>493</col>
As regards the Military Staff in India, it is difficult for me to speak with exactitude about that, because in my day there was no Military Staff that gave an opinion as distinct from the Government of India. The military opinions of the Government of India were given by the Governor-General in Council. There appears to be a difference now. Here, again, it transpires from what the noble Marquess said that the Military Staff were never consulted upon the policy of the line. All that happened was that they were asked to give an opinion as to this or that alignment. They were told that unless the line were made some ulterior consequences of a formidable kind would ensue, and therefore their advice was offered on the scheme on the lines of what would be the least unfavourable to the Government of India. That carries an implication which I would like to dispose of. It seems to lie in the background of the thoughts of the noble Marquess and the noble Viscount that if His Majesty's Government had not signified in some degree their sympathy with these proposals they would have been carried out without them. That has lain behind both their speeches to-night. May I venture, although I have no official sources of information, to state my opinion that it is absolutely impossible that this line could ever be made without the consent of the British Government. It could not be made because the money is not forthcoming; it could not be made because under existing political conditions a railway cannot be made through the British sphere in Persia without the consent of the British Government. How, then, is a railway ever to reach the Indian border? I think that the idea that this railway must in any case be made, that we are, so to speak, on our knees and have to accept what is dictated to us by our rivals, is a mare's nest for which there is not the slightest foundation.<lb/>
I would like to say this in conclusion. There have been two debates upon this matter, one in the House of Commons last week and this debate in the House of Lords. As I remarked in my former speech, not a single Member rose in the House of Commons to support the policy or the attitude of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and not a single noble Lord has risen in this House to-night to support the views or the policy of His Majesty's Government. Perhaps that is not putting it quite fairly. Not a single Member has
<col>494</col>
risen to express any opinion in favour of the construction of the line. I must distinguish between the two, because His Majesty's Government apparently repudiate any responsibility, though after listening carefully for an hour and more to the two speakers opposite I have not at this moment the ghost of an idea what their real attitude towards the railway is. There were moments in the speech of the noble Viscount when he alluded to the cost of the railway, the profits, and so on, when he seemed to me to be, if I may say so deferentially, a disciple in my own school; and yet when he talked of the future of the railway he seemed to contemplate its coming into being. The same mystery ran through the speech of the noble Marquess. He said it was not the intention to place any charge on Indian finances, that he was rather disposed to the old views as to Indian frontier policy; but, at the same time, he asked what more could they have done in the circumstances than what they did do. Whether that will relieve or confirm our apprehensions I cannot say, but this debate has left one very distinct impression on my mind, and that is that should the proceedings of this Soci&#x00E9;tt&#x00E9; d'Etudes take a concrete form, and should a scheme be brought before the British Parliament, such a scheme will have very little chance indeed of ever being carried out. I believe you will find, as Lord Incheape said, that India will be against it; I believe the bulk of public opinion in this country will be against it; and this debate to-night will not have been without its value if, whether His Majesty's Government agree with us or not, it has indicated to them the very- strong feelings that are entertained upon the matter by some of us who have served in the East. I beg to withdraw my Motion.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01372"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on behalf of the London County Council I beg to move the insertion of the new clause which stands in my name. The subject is
<col>498</col>
by no means a simple one, and if I can but make it clear to your Lordships I think the House will agree that the London County Council has a very strong case. Put briefly our case is this. We are desirous of acquiring the lands set out in the Schedule of this Provisional Orders Confirmation Bill and also in the Schedule of the Educational Board Provisional Orders Confirmation (London No. 2) Bill which stands next on the Paper. We desire to acquire these lands as sites for additional schools in London, and where it is proved that these lands are insanitary or can be described as slum areas we ask that we should be enabled to acquire them under the provisions of Part I of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, instead of under the provisions of the Lands Clauses Acts. The effect of this alteration would he that where the arbitrators decide that the site is a slum area, the County Council should be able to purchase the site at a fair price instead of at the exorbitant price due to its overcrowded nature which they would have to pay under the Lands Clauses Act. As your Lordships know, slum property sometimes fetches an exorbitant price owing to its overcrowded nature and owing to the number of families living in each room. Under the Housing of the Working Classes Act we should be entitled to buy that property at the price which it would fetch if used for reasonable purposes&#x2014;that is to say, if the houses were occupied by the number of people they ought to accommodate; and, further, we are allowed to deduct from that market price the cost of putting those buildings into habitable repair both structurally and for drainage purposes. The County Council would also be absolved from paying the ten per cent. extra allowance which would be due in respect of compulsory purchase.<lb/>
Paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of subsection (1) of my proposed new clause virtually reproduce paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of Section 4 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act. 1890, and subsection (2) of my Amendment reproduces in substance subsection (2) of Section 21 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act. In other words, the whole of this new clause is already incorporated in a public Act of Parliament. I have only to add, in regard to the effect, of this clause and the result it would have, that the onus of proving that the property is a slum area would not lie with the present owners but with the County Council should your
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0254"/>
<col>499</col>
Lordships agree to this Amendment being inserted in the Bill. Under these two Bills we require somewhere about fifty sites for different schools in London. Year by year the London County Council is continually coming to Parliament asking for leave to purchase sites for new schools, partly owing to the increase in population and partly to the reduction in the size of classes and the consequent reduction in accommodation of existing schools. It is obvious that it would be of great advantage to London if we were enabled in purchasing sites to get hold of slum property rather than to abolish good houses with which no fault could he found. As any of your Lordships know, the real difficulty in abolishing slum property is the exorbitant price that that property fetches in the market, and it was to meet that point that the Housing of the Working Classes Act was passed into law. Every one in this House, I think, will agree that the more we can clear away slum areas the better it will be for the people of this country. Under the Housing of the Working Classes Act the purchasing authority is, as a rule, compelled to re-house the people whom it displaces. Under my Amendment that would not be the case. But I would point out that where we buy property which cannot be described as slum property we are under no obligation whatever to re-house. Therefore the point I think, can fairly be made that we should not be compelled to re-house those displaced from slum property any more than we are compelled to re-house those displaced from non-slum property.<lb/>
The London County Council has obtained a similar clause to this in a good many of its own private Bills&#x2014;in the Kingsway and Aidwych Improvement Act, in the Rotherhithe Tunnel Act, and on eight other occasions. I think Parliament granted a clause of this character in practically all the London County Council Bills for purchasing land other than Education Bills, up to the year 1905. In 1907 and 1909 the Local Government Board objected to a clause of this character being put into County Council Private Bills. As a matter of fact, their objections were never discussed before a Committee of either House of Parliament, for the reason that objection was taken to the property to which the clauses would apply, and consequently when the property was withdrawn from the Bill this Amendment was also withdrawn as we had no
<col>500</col>
object in putting it in. But the Board of Education have consistently refused to put in a clause of this character in any of their Provisional Order Confirmation Bills, and owing to their decision it is impossible to debate the substance of the principle of this clause in Committee of either House of Parliament upstairs. If it were a Private Bill introduced by the London County Council the County Council could obviously put in the clause and then it would be for the Committee of either House of Parliament to strike it out if they thought fit, but as this is a Board of Education Bill we have no means of getting this Amendment put in except by appealing to your Lordships' House.<lb/>
We have naturally approached the authorities as to the objections they find to this Amendment, and they have been several. On one occasion objection was taken that the proposal was sprung upon the present owners of property and that they had no chance of opposing this Amendment had they seen fit. We have met that case in the notice to owners informing them that we intended to apply for powers to compulsorily purchase their land. There is a clause put in stating at the same time most clearly that we also intended to apply for an Amendment of the nature of the one which I now propose to the House. That notice is dated December 1, 1911. Therefore the owners of property have had as much chance as they would have had if this had been put into a Private Bill to make any observations they choose upon this Amendment. Then the late Chairman of Committees of your Lordships' House, Lord Onslow, raised the objection, in an interview that he had with the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee of the London County Council on July 12, 1910. that the sites that we proposed to apply this Amendment to were named in our Amendment, and that therefore it was really more or less blacklisting those sites before both Houses of Parliament. He went on to say that he had no objection to the clause if it was put in general terms. In this instance we have not named the sites to which it is proposed that this Amendment should apply, and therefore we have endeavoured to meet the views of the late Lord Chairman in that respect. Then last year the Local Government Board objected to its approval being found necessary before this clause was made to apply. Originally as this clause appeared
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0255"/>
<col>501</col>
in a London County Council Private Bill it had not been thought necessary to put in that the Local Government Board should first approve. A Committee of the House of Commons suggested that that should be done, and therefore those words were added. But owing to the Local Government Board having since objected we have left out the words then inserted and as the proposed clause now stands it is riot necessary to ask for the leave of the Local Government Board. I think your Lordships will agree that the London County Council has done its utmost to meet the authorities in this matter, and the Council is prepared to accept any alteration in words or form that the Government may suggest if only it can manage to obtain the principle of this clause.<lb/>
The last situation is this, that the Board of Education, in a letter to the London County Council, have refused to insert this clause on the plea that it is not a model clause in accordance with the undertaking given in the House of Commons in 1907. Perhaps I may be allowed to quote the undertaking then given. Answering a Question, Mr. McKenna said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Board of Education are prepared on the request of the local education authority to insert in Provisional Order Confirmation Bills, where the circumstances, in the opinion of the Board, justify such a course, those clauses which, having been frequently inserted in Local Acts, are regarded in the practice of Parliament as model clauses."</quote>
I venture to think that your Lordships will agree that no more vague undertaking could possibly have been given, and that it is aptly described as a policy of red-tape. After all, what the Board of Education apparently say is this, "We have never put this into our Bills before and therefore we are not going to do it now." Apparently they are going to support the procedure by which we are compelled to buy good house property and pull it down in order to provide sites for our new schools rather than that we should get hold of slum property and demolish it in order to secure the necessary land.<lb/>
After all, if you pull down good house property the cost of purchase is fairly cheap, and that is where we should naturally turn; but I think everybody will agree that a school does not improve the value of the
<col>502</col>
property surrounding it. You get a lot of healthy children rushing out, of school into their playgrounds, and naturally they make a noise and objections are raised by neighbouring owners. That occurs wherever a school is placed. But there is this further point, that we reduce the rateable value of the surrounding district if a school is put in the middle of a really good area, whereas if we pull down slum buildings we not only get rid of an insanitary area but we provide a large and desirable open space in that neighbourhood in the shape of the school playground. We make it less a slum area and consequently more valuable. It may be argued that we are endeavouring to compulsorily purchase the land and then write down the price afterwards. That may be so or it may not but that is the law at present. When the County Council wished to acquire land, for instance, for the Aldwych Improvement or for the Rotherhithe Tunnel they were enabled to acquire it under those clauses; and in the same way if we wish to clear a slum area, as we are doing now, then we have been enabled to purchase the land at a lower price under the Housing of the Working Classes Act. Therefore if it is right in that case I maintain it is also right in cases where we require sites for educational purposes. We hear a good deal on public platforms from members of His Majesty's Government about their great concern as to the conditions under which the working classes live. Here appears to ate to be an extremely good way of putting some of that preaching into practice. This is, however, not a show Amendment, and therefore it is not good electioneering. I venture to say that, unless it is found that it contravenes the regulations of this or the other House of Parliament, if the Government refuse to accept an Amendment of this character it will be shown that all these protestations on their part are really only "window dressing" for electioneering purposes. As I said, this is not going to appeal to the electorate; but opposition to this Amendment means that you allow slum landlords, of whom I think nobody in this House approves, to stick out for a very high price, and you prevent the local authority from clearing areas which everybody will agree should be abolished as soon as possible. Really the Government would place themselves in the position of standing up for the slum landlord, not, in the way of protecting his property, but actually preventing the London County Council from
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0256"/>
<col>503</col>
purchasing it at a fair price. That is all that the London County Council is asking to do. They are not proposing to run down the price inordinately, but they desire that the price which they pay for slum property should be the fair marketable value subject to the condition of its being put into fair marketable repair.<lb/>
Here is an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone&#x2014;to provide sites for our schools and also do away with slum property. Every year we are purchasing a large number of sites. I could quote a case at this moment in which we are anxious to provide a site for a school in one of the boroughs of London. We have scheduled a good house property site&#x2014;that is to say, one or two houses with large gardens behind. Very naturally the borough objects to our purchasing that property, and says it will reduce the rateable value of the surrounding district. The only alternative site is one in the middle of slum property, and the difference in price between those two sites is something like &#x00A3;10,000. The slum property is more desirable for the school; it is situated nearer to the working class population whose children will attend the school when built; but it is obvious that we cannot spend an extra &#x00A3;10,000 on schools all over the place in order to meet the borough councils to that extent in helping them to develop the property in their borough. If this Amendment meets with approval at your Lordships' hands we shall he enabled to get that slum property, not at the same price but at a price approximating to the good house property which we shall have otherwise to acquire. We shall rid that borough of those slums and secure a school in a position in which we require it. I have only to mention that there are something like 700,000 children attending the schools of London, and that we have now undertaken a scheme, which I think will meet with the approval of every member of this House, for reducing the number of children in each class-room to forty for older children and forty-eight for infants, to enable you to realise what an enormous amount of extra accommodation we shall require in ensuing years. This Amendment would be of great assistance to us in that work, and I trust that your Lordships will look favourably upon it, and that the Board of Education may make perhaps an eleventh hour repentance and allow this new clause to be added to their Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01377"><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF DONOUGH MORE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it would probably be for the convenience of your Lordships if I state as briefly as I can the history of this matter as regards your Lordships' Committees for the last six or seven years, because it is to a considerable extent that history which impels me to recommend your Lordships not to agree to the Amendment which has been moved by the noble Earl, and in doing so I am sure he will acquit me at any rate of any desire for "window dressing." This matter has arisen in this way, and I think the fact explains why the noble Earl was able to quote precedents for the case that he submits to your Lordships to-day.
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0257"/>
<col>505</col>
All his precedents&#x2014;I am sure he would admit it quite frankly&#x2014;are anterior to the year 1905, and I believe I am correct in saying that though this clause has been applied for several times by the London County Council since 1905 it has not been acceded to by your Lordships in any Bill which you have passed since that year.<lb/>
That is explained in this way. It was about the year 1905 that your Lordships decided that all these Government Provisional Order Confirmation Bills should go through what is known as the Unopposed Committee. Such Bills had previously been examined by one of the officers of your Lordships' House. Under this new direction the Bills were examined in much more detail than before the year 1905, and as a result it was noticed that this clause, which was certainly opposed to the Private Bill practice of your Lordships' House, was being inserted by the Education Department in some of their Provisional Order Bills. This point was one of the first that was noticed. The object has been quite fairly stated by the noble Earl. The result would have been, if it had been allowed, that the London County Council would have been able to get a lower price fixed for the property they were purchasing, and possibly to get rid of the ten per cent. given in respect of compulsory purchase. This was done by adopting part of the procedure, but not the whole of the procedure, of the Housing Acts&#x2014;by applying part of the procedure of the Housing Acts to the Lands Clauses Acts, a purpose for which the Housing Acts, I submit, were never intended. If public authorities desire to deal with insanitary property they have the machinery of the Housing Acts at their command and have plenty of powers for dealing with such property.<lb/>
But what I wish particularly to urge upon your Lordships&#x2014;and I find from the Minutes that have been kept in my Office that this is a point that weighed considerably with my predecessor, the late Lord Onslow&#x2014;is that under the Housing Acts certain forms of procedure are prescribed which act fairly to the owner, who, after all, is entitled to justice even though he is a slum owner. They act fairly to him, and one of the fairest of those provisions is not embodied in the noble Earl's Amendment. When an authority like the London County Council desire to deal with what they consider an insanitary dwelling-house or area&#x2014;"nuisance" is the term used, and a
<col>506</col>
house that is a nuisance is defined, among other things, as premises in such a state as to be a nuisance or injurious to health&#x2014;they have to serve a notice on the owner, and the owner has this enormous advantage conferred upon him, that he is allowed to abate the nuisance himself. The Third Schedule of the Housing Act of 1890 provides that the authority shall, previous to taking proceedings, serve a notice on the owner calling upon him to abate the nuisance, and he has the chance of abating it and so nullifying any further proceedings against him. The proposed new clause which the noble Earl has moved to insert gives the owner, as I read it, no chance of abating the nuisance, because notice is served upon him when they are giving the notice of their intention to treat. I quite agree that the noble Earl has altered this clause so as to give the owner a hearing as to whether his property is a nuisance or not, but I cannot see under this clause that the noble Earl gives him power to abate the nuisance. The pistol is held at his head from the first. The property is to be taken away from him, and if it is in such a condition as to be a nuisance all the disadvantages of this clause are held over his head at once.<lb/>
Your Lordships will, of course, realise that this is not merely a London question. If this clause is assented to to-day your Lordships will be laying down a precedent which will be adopted at once all over the Kingdom by local authorities in their anxiety to purchase property as cheaply as they can. And what will be the result? If adopted all over the country, instead of local authorities proceeding as fast as they can, as their duty is, with procedure for better housing under the Housing Acts, it will pay them better to sit still with folded hands, leaving the properties insanitary and profiting by their having done nothing if they think that they may require those properties in the more or less near future for a specific purpose. There are plenty of precedents for refusing a power such as this, and I think it would be most unfortunate if it were to be laid down as part of our general legislation that neglect of duties under the Housing Acts was to result to the advantage of local authorities in cases such as these. Therefore, my Lords, my advice, as at present advised, is that your Lordships should not agree to the insertion of this proposed new clause.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0258"/>
<col>507</col>
I would point out to your Lordships&#x2014;a fact which I have no doubt will weigh with you much more than any advice I can give&#x2014;that this clause was almost consistently asked for from the late Lord Onslow and equally consistently refused by him after the County Council's representatives had been fully heard. The decision has been consistently against them for the reasons that I have pointed out. The noble Earl quoted Mr. McKenna's undertaking. As I read it, that undertaking is the best possible argument against the insertion of this clause. His undertaking was that public Departments were always ready to agree to the insertion of those clauses which are regarded in the practice of Parliament as model clauses; but model clauses merely represent the established practice of Parliament, and the established practice of Parliament since this matter has been gone into much more carefully than it had hitherto been has been to refuse the insert on of this clause, and for that reason my advice to your Lordships to-day is not to agree to the noble Earl's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01378"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think anybody can have listened to the Lord Chairman without seeing that he desires to deal with this subject in the most fair and considerate manner. On the other hand, I confess that listening to his speech I could almost have imagined myself back to the time when the whole of the social legislation of the last thirty years was unpassed. I remember in the early days of the 1880 Parliament when a Housing Committee sat for two years under the Presidency of Sir Richard Cross on purpose to relieve the then Metropolitan Board of the difficulties which had arisen, to which effect was given in 1885, and nobody will say that the terms then agreed to by Parliament were in any way unfair or have worked unfairly to the owners of insanitary areas. What my noble friend opposite practically says is this. You are at liberty to go forward with a scheme for an insanitary area under certain conditions, but it would be fatal if a public authority had the advantage of using those same conditions to amend sanitary areas at a moment when it is forced to acquire property for some other public purpose. I really think, with great respect to the Lord. Chairman, that that contention is out of date.<lb/>
I cannot put before your Lordships sufficiently strongly the situation in which you place a great public authority like the
<col>508</col>
London County Council by adopting the contention, having surrounded the proceedings with all the safeguards which are necessary to see that the owner of an insanitary area gets the fullest compensation for the real value of that which he has to give up, that that advantage must not be reaped for the public unless you go into the arena solely for the purpose of securing that slum area at an enormous expense. This is indeed an urgent matter at this moment. I was sitting in the London County Council only a few moments ago. There is before that Council at the present moment, at the instance of the Board of Education, a proposal to which after a long bargain the County Council is now disposed to agree&#x2014;that the whole of the classes should be reduced as rapidly as may be from their present size to forty-eight for small children and forty for larger children, and in order to do that the London County Council has to spend a sum amounting to &#x00A3;600,000 a year for all time in addition to the education charges of London, and a very large amount of that goes on the purchase of sites in order to provide these additional buildings. We argue that when you have a public authority, by agreement with the Government, undertaking so great a work, they should not be bound to co into the market and pay sums which we know the owners of these areas are not entitled to in order to keep up the distinction laid down by my noble friend. A public authority when it is working for sanitary purposes has an advantage which is denied to it if it is working for educational purposes.<lb/>
I cannot help feeling that all that my noble friend said as regards the careful examination of this subject makes it necessary that some tribunal which is not the same tribunal should try these subjects and hear evidence and decide whether you are to ask the greatest municipality in the world to put their ratepayers to so great a charge. My noble friend Lord Stanhope, in his admirable resum&#x00E9; of the position in which we are placed, did not give actual figures, but I have some figures before me with regard to a site at St. Pancras, where property of an unsatisfactory character has been purchased estimated to cost fifty per cent. more than a good property site of equal area. It is unreasonable that the County Council should have to clear away good houses when it has close by a space, where a lung is much needed for the poorer children in that neighbourhood and an
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0259"/>
<col>509</col>
opportunity of clearing away an insanitary area. I know that in these matters we are in the other House in the hands of the Government, but I would earnestly ask the noble Earl the First Commissioner of Works, who will reply, to give the facts a fresh consideration and compare the procedure in these cases with that adopted by Parliament with regard to public purchases made on behalf of the War Office. Years ago those purchases used to be under the Lands Clauses Acts. Parliament at length intervened and took steps to enable the War Office, for purposes of defence, to obtain property on more favourable terms. I cannot help thinking, having regard to the large extent to which the existing unrest in the large cities of this country is the result of bad and crowded dwellings, that when this House has the opportunity of putting in force, as I think, an absolutely just procedure, one which has been in other respects found to work without any injustice to the owner, it would be well if we were to adopt this procedure in this case&#x2014;one of the largest this]louse has ever had to consider&#x2014;rather than entrench ourselves behind the antiquated precepts of the past</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01379"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure your Lordships will realise that we are discussing two different points to-day. First of all there is the general question whether the principle of this Amendment is a good one and whether it is such an Amendment as should be inserted in Bills of this kind. We have also been discussing the smaller point&#x2014;namely, whether this particular Amendment should be inserted in this particular Bill. I will deal with those two points as wholly separate points. With regard to the actual merits of this Amendment His Majesty's Government are not without sympathy with the noble Earl who has moved it, but the noble Earl. I think, might be warned that attacks such as those which he made upon His Majesty's Government are not likely to secure for him any overwhelming measure of support in his endeavours. Apart from the partisan attack which he made, His Majesty's Government think that this is a matter which might very fairly be considered, and I suggest to your Lordships whether it might not become a matter for consideration, either by a Joint Committee of both Houses, or by a Select Committee of this House, or in such way as the noble
<col>510</col>
Earl may suggest, so that in future the matter of the general principle might, having been once discussed, be either admitted or refused in connection with these Bills. Then let me turn to the smaller question as to whether we ought to insert this Amendment in this particular Bill. On that I hope that your Lordships will follow the advice of the Lord Chairman. That is generally the course which this House takes in matters of this kind, and I venture to hope your Lordships will take it to-day. I do not base my opposition on any question of the merits of the Amendment, but on a matter of order. Your Lordships will see at once that it would be a very unusual step if in a Provisional Order Bill we were to insert a very far-reaching Amendment admitting a principle which has always been refused hitherto in Bills of this kind. That is the ground of my objection to-day to the insertion in this Bill of the noble Earl's Amendment. The last words of the noble Viscount opposite confirmed my objection, for he said this was one of the largest matters which the House has had to consider.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01380"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I meant on this particular question of housing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01381"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I agree. But is if wise to insert in a Provisional Order Bill an Amendment dealing with this question? We ought to settle the general principle in the way I have suggested, and then say whether or not this clause should be inserted in all Provisional Order Bills. We could not allow a county council to take advantage of the procedure in this House in order to create a precedent by those means. We think, as I have said, that this matter should be dealt with generally and as a matter of principle, and if the noble Earl will suggest to us any way in which he thinks it most desirable that the matter should be considered His Majesty's Government will be glad to take his suggestion into consideration and do their best to meet him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01382"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think those who listened to the opening statement of my noble friend behind me (Earl Stanhope) must have been impressed by the strength of the case which he laid before the House. I am bound, indeed, to say that when he sat down I found it difficult to conjecture what answer was going to be made to him. The
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0260"/>
<col>511</col>
outline of the case is a simple one. The County Council are obliged to provide a large increase of school accommodation. They find it necessary to give fewer places in each school room, and they have, therefore, no choice but to provide additional schools. Then the question arises where are they to put these schools. Is it better that they should take for the purpose sites which are occupied by suitable and sanitary buildings, or is it, on the contrary, better in the interest of the locality that they should go to sites which are occupied by squalid and low-class buildings, and achieve the double purpose of providing the schools which they want and also getting rid of what we describe as slum areas? The advantages of placing the school in the slum area seem to me obvious. And then my noble friend adds to his argument this, that under the procedure under which he proposes the owners of these slum areas should be compensated, not on an artificially enhanced rent which they obtain by crowding a great number of people on a narrow site, but on the true value of the property if reasonably used; and he points out that this is the principle upon which compensation is paid under the Housing of the Working Classes Act. Up to that point the case does seem to me to be a very strong one indeed.<lb/>
What is the argument in reply? My noble friend at the Table (the Lord Chairman) whose authority on these matters we always recognise, tells us that my noble friend who has charge of the Amendment applies only a portion of the procedure laid down by the Housing of the Working Classes Act and not that procedure in its complete form; and I think he also argues that if these slum areas are to be taken in hand at all it is proper that they should be taken in hand under the Housing Acts and not incidentally under a Bill of this kind. I will not say that those arguments are devoid of force, but I am bound to say that when you come to an operation of this magnitude&#x2014;for the building operation contemplated by this Bill is a very large operation&#x2014;it is a little technical to suggest that what would otherwise on the merits seem a most admirable proposal should be ruled out of order because it is an operation which ought to be conducted under a different Bill.<lb/>
Then I noticed that the noble Earl at the Table told us that under the Housing of the Working Classes Act the owner of the slum property is given an opportunity of,
<col>512</col>
so to speak, setting his house in order and putting the property into a proper and sanitary condition. But am I quite wrong in believing that under the Amendment of my noble friend such an opportunity would not be altogether denied to the proprietor? I see that in cases falling under my noble friend's Amendment when the arbitrator determines that there is a case for compensation he is obliged, in assessing that compensation, to receive evidence to show that the houses or premises are unfit and not reasonably capable of being made fit for human habitation. Therefore I infer that my noble friend's proposal would only come into operation in cases which were so bad that there was no prospect whatever of the premises being rendered sanitary and fit to be occupied.<lb/>
The real argument upon which we are asked not to insert this Amendment is that it is unusual and inconvenient to incorporate a principle of this importance in a Provisional Order Bill, and I dare say there is something in that. On a point of that kind I am ready to defer to the opinion of my noble friend at the Table. But what impressed me more than that was the attitude of the noble Earl opposite who spoke for the Government. I was glad to note from his remarks that he does not by any means meet the Amendment with what we sometimes call a blank <i>non possumus.</i> What I gathered from him was that he which my noble friend rested his case. I gathered from him that he is prepared to entertain a suggestion, or perhaps to make a suggestion himself, with the object of obtaining some kind of inquiry into this matter. If that is really what His Majesty's Government have to suggest, and if the noble Earl will, perhaps, communicate to the House in a moment what kind of inquiry he has in his mind, I should advise my noble friend who moved the Amendment to be content with having brought the question before the House and having obtained from His Majesty's Government something like an assurance that the point which he has raised&#x2014;the importance of winch we must all of us recognise&#x2014;is going to be seriously examined and dealt with at a future time. If the noble Earl will tell us whether we may infer from what he said that some investigation of this sort would be approved by His Majesty's Government, I should certainly not advise my noble friend to divide the House.</membercontribution></p>

I am moving this Amendment on behalf of the Port of London Authority, but as no doubt there are many other public bodies similarly affected the Amendment has been so framed as to include them. The Port of London Authority and their predecessors have from time to time purchased property with the object of developing that property
<col>516</col>
at some future time in connection with their docks, and there is on the property of the Port of London Authority a site which has been let, from philanthropic motives and at a purely nominal rent, for a place of worship, in the expectation that it will revert to the authority when it is required, or, rather, with the certain assurance that it would so revert for the purpose of developing the property. Under the provisions of this Bill those to whom this site is let can acquire it from us on the favourable terms embodied in the Bill; whereas the Port Authority, when the time came for developing that property, would have to re-acquire the site under the ordinary provisions of the Lands Clauses Act. I am sure your Lordships will appreciate that this would constitute a serious grievance for the Port Authority and for any other body similarly situated, and I hope the noble Earl in charge of the Bill may see his way to accept the Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01411"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> moved to insert the following new clause&#x2014;
<quote>". For the purposes of the assessment of Reversion Duty in respect of any premises the reversionary interests in which are acquired under this Act, the value of any buildings erected or improvements made by the trustees shall be excluded."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01412">The noble Lord said: I bring forward this Amendment in order that your Lordships may consider the effect which Clause 2 (<i>c</i>) of the Bill has upon the incidence of the Reversion Duty. The enfranchisement of these places of worship which is contemplated under the Bill&#x2014;that is, the enlargement of their leasehold interest into a freehold interest&#x2014;is an occasion on which Reversion Duty will be collected. Reversion Duty is at the rate of ten per cent. upon the value of the benefit which accrues to the lessor at the determination of the lease and is paid by the lessor. The value of the benefit is calculated under the Finance Act in this way. It is the difference between the total value of the premises at the determination of the lease and the value of the land at the commencement of the lease calculated upon the basis of the rent reserved&#x2014;upon the difference between those two sums Reversion Duty is paid; but the "total value," in the meaning of the Finance Act, includes the value of the buildings and other improvements. Clause 2 (<i>c</i>) of this Bill prevents the lessor receiving the value of the buildings and improvements in this case; yet though he does not receive them he would be compelled under the Finance Act to pay the Reversion Duty upon them. Therefore under the Finance Act Parliament compels the lessor to pay a duty upon a certain benefit which a subsequent Bill&#x2014;this Bill&#x2014;prevents him receiving.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01413">To make this clear I have had some premises valued showing the actual effect of this measure in this particular instance. It is the case of a Congregational chapel and schools let in the year 1890 on a sixty-years lease at an annual rental of &#x00A3;5. On enfranchisement the valuation will be as follows&#x2014;total value: site, &#x00A3;300; buildings, &#x00A3;2,200; total &#x00A3;2,500. From this sum, for the purpose: of Reversion Duty, has to be deducted the value at the commencement of the lease, calculated on the basis of the rent reserved
<col>518</col>
(&#x00A3;5), which would be &#x00A3;150. Therefore the amount on which Reversion Duty would be payable would be &#x00A3;2,350, although the actual value of the benefit, now that the lessor will not be allowed to receive the buildings, is only the value of the site&#x2014;namely, &#x00A3;300. Deducting from that the original value, which was &#x00A3;150, the value of the benefit is only &#x00A3;150, and the Reversion Duty at ten per cent. would be &#x00A3;15. So that while the Reversion Duty on the actual value is only &#x00A3;15 the lessor would, in fact, have to pay &#x00A3;235 out of the &#x00A3;300 he would receive. The noble Earl has been good enough to communicate with me on this matter and has referred me to Section 37 of the Finance Act, which he tells me will meet the point. This is a section which exempts the governing body of any charitable institution from the payment of Reversion Duty as long as the land is occupied for the purpose of their trust. Without attempting to argue the point as to whether the trustees of a place of worship under this Bill would be considered governors of a charitable institution, I do not believe that the section meets my point; because surely that section means that it is the governing body themselves who are exempt from the payment of Reversion Duty while in the case under consideration it is not the trustees or the governing body but the lessor, a private individual, who has his land compulsorily enfranchised under this Bill.</p>

The Board of Inland Revenue are certain that Section 37 of the Finance Act does exclude the lessor from payment of Reversion Duty in this particular case. The noble Lord and his advisers do not agree with my advisers and myself, and I am afraid we cannot settle a point of that kind across the floor of the House. It is obvious, if we inserted in one particular Bill a clause excluding one

small class, that that would of itself create a presumption that everything else was outside and would not come within the exemption of Section 37. I am somewhat at a loss to know what suggestion to make to the noble Lord. That is the difficulty which we see&#x2014;that if his Amendment is inserted it will create a presumption that other leases held under charitable trusts are not exempt. That, I am quite sure, is not within the intention of the noble Lord. I wish we could devise a system by which the Board of Inland Revenue could give some assurance to the noble Lord that the object which he has in mind would really be assured. How that can be done I am at a loss to suggest. But I venture to hope the noble Lord will allow me to communicate with him on this point, in order that, if necessary, we may deal with it on the Report stage. Meanwhile I can give him the assurance that we will not hurry the Report stage. There will therefore be plenty of time to deal with the point thoroughly before the next stage of the Bill is taken.</membercontribution></p>

On the other hand, I am sure the noble Earl would not wish to exclude their use for purposes of meetings of friendly societies or in connection with, say, the Insurance Act. The noble Earl would, I am sure, not regard such uses as improper uses. Perhaps the best way to simplify my proposed new clause would be to omit from each subsection the words "other than that of a place of worship or purposes connected therewith" and insert before the word "purpose" the adjective "political." If the noble Earl will allow me I will move the Amendment in that form, and there will be plenty of time to consider it if he thinks it does not meet the case.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01428"><member>THE EARL or CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The proposed insertion of the word "political" between "any" and "purpose" does come to me rather as a novelty, but at the same time I am sorry to say that it does not seem quite to commend itself to me. The noble Earl, as I understand, now proposes that premises which have been enfranchised should be allowed to be used for any purpose except a political purpose. What if they are used for dancing?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01429"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I would be glad to insert words definitely excluding dancing or anything of that sort.</membercontribution></p>

To
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0265"/>
<col>521</col>
allow these enfranchised premises to be used for any purpose except political is a considerable enlargement of the Bill. I think that the new clause as it stands on the Paper and not as the noble Earl has moved it meets my view quite sufficiently. At all events under that new clause if the premises are used for purposes which are not religious, then the Judge can order that the premises be sold. In that way you do not prevent the use in the first instance, but you provide a cure for the misuse afterwards, and to that extent I am quite prepared to accept the Amendment as it stands on the Paper, but not with the word "political."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01431"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I admit that a dance or cinematograph exhibition would be an improper use to which to put such buildings. But take, for instance, the present great crusade against consumption. Surely it would be a great pity not to allow these buildings to be used for meetings held in connection with that crusade. We might say "if it was let for hire," or something of that kind.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01434"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I think that is hardly right. The second subsection in the proposed new clause proposes that "for the purpose of this section premises shall not be deemed to be habitually used for any purpose other than that of a place of worship or purposes connected therewith by reason only of their being used for such other purpose not more than twice in any year." I suggest to the noble Earl that he should insert in this subsection the word "any" so that it would read "any such other purposes." As the words stand, the building might be used twice for one purpose, twice for another purpose, and so on. The noble Earl said just now that I would surely not object to the building being used for a meeting in connection with national insurance. I really do not know. That might be a very good purpose, but it is not a religious purpose. As I said just now, I very much object to the scope of the Bill being enlarged. It is a very drastic Bill as it is, and I strongly object to any provision likely to enlarge its scope.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01435"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: This Bill is being passed for a particular purpose&#x2014;namely, to enable particular denominations to acquire their places of worship. Why cannot we leave it there? The noble Earl in charge of the Bill wishes that the persons who acquire these buildings should be able to use them for other purposes. I suggest that it would be more consistent and give greater satisfaction to noble Lords on this side of the House if he would leave the Bill in its original form.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01436"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Upon one point I feel very little doubt. If an Amendment dealing with the subject is to be inserted at this stage, I would prefer the formula which appears on the Order Paper to the altered version which the noble Earl in charge of the Bill has suggested. What we are talking about is the case of a chapel which has been enfranchised as a chapel, and the object of any clause of this kind is to provide that if, after enfranchisement, the premises are used for some purpose which by no stretch of imagination can be connected with religious worship, then the premises should be ordered to be sold. If that be the object of the noble Earl's Amendment, I venture to think that the original text on the Order Paper carries it out much better than the amended text.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01437"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I would point out that this Bill has been passed on two or three occasions by your Lordships' House. The original purpose was to allow chapels to be used for the same purposes for which they could be used under the trusts, the idea being that a benevolent landlord had let the land, very often at a peppercorn rent, for the benefit of the Nonconformists of that area, and had allowed the premises to be used for other purposes than religious services. In previous years the Bill had been allowed to go through without any of the drastic curtailment now suggested. I admit that it is always unfair to propose an Amendment to this House without due notice, and as this is somewhat complicated, although it sounds more complicated than it is, I will withdraw the clause in the form in which I have moved it and will propose it as it stands on the Paper.</membercontribution></p>

We on this side are quite content, where it was originally granted for a minister's house and is really part of the same building and held under the same trust as the place of worship, that in respect of the minister's house there should be the same power of enfranchisement. But there is considerable difficulty in this matter, because you may have a place used as a minister's house situated in quite a different part of the town, which was never intended originally for a minister's house, and which was so let on a sub-lease without the knowledge of the original lessor. I claim that it is a considerable hardship that a house which the landlord had let for a private residence and which his immediate tenant had sublet as a minister's house should be compulsorily enfranchised because it happens to be occupied by a minister.

We regret to find that the space by the side of Great George-street will not be sufficient for the requirements of our public offices, especially for the requirements of the Board of Trade. The matter has been carefully considered, and the consequence is that we have thought it necessary to promote this Bill, which will allow the Government to provide a site in Whitehall Gardens for new buildings which would house the Board of Trade and other Departments. Nobody who has had connection with the Board of Trade can fail to know how inconvenient it is that their various departments are scattered about the West-end. This Bill has already been before the House of Commons, where it was investigated by a Committee. Certain alterations were made, and it will go through the same process in this House if any petitions are lodged against it by individuals who feel themselves aggrieved. There will be ample opportunity, therefore, for anybody who desires to do so to be heard. In addition to Whitehall Gardens we propose a small extension of the Patent Office, and also in Clifford's Inn we are anxious to secure that there should be a sufficient open space at the south side of the Record Office. But the first matter is the really important part of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01503"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member> rose to call attention to the present position of the Insurance Act and to the fact that no arrangement has been arrived at by His Majesty's Government to ensure the co-operation of the medical profession in the administration of the Insurance Act, and to move to resolve&#x2014;
<quote>"That in the opinion of this House, until such co-operation is ensured, the Government will fail efficiently to provide medical benefits in accordance with the law."</quote></p>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0270"/>
<col>531</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01504">The noble Lord said: My Lords, since my Motion was put down a characteristic speech has been made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who appears to think that anybody who has taken the trouble to look into the Act and suggest amendments to it is guilty of wilful ignorance. I should like, therefore, to allude to one or two of his remarks and show that it is not those who criticise the Act who are guilty of wilful ignorance but some of those who ought to know a great deal better. Your Lordships will remember that on June 12 I moved a Resolution to postpone the operation of the Act. I asked for more time for proper societies to be formed which would be suitable especially for rural labourers domestic servants and seamen. I asked for more time for the Act to be thoroughly understood, and, if possible, amended so as to make it workable. I also asked for more time for the Government to come to an arrangement with the medical profession in accordance with the Resolution passed by the House of Commons on May 1. On a later occasion I called attention to the mendacious and misleading leaflet and its objects, and the privileged position in which certain friendly societies were placed owing to the leaflet and to the pressure and intimidation brought to bear on workers to become members of those societies. As regards the formation of suitable societies, a great many have been formed suitable to the different classes I have mentioned. I should like to specially mention one&#x2014;the Domestic Servants' Insurance Society. There have also been formed within the last fortnight several rural labourers' societies, a National Seamen's Society, and others, but they will require time to enrol members and give them their insurance cards.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01505">When I called attention to the mendacious leaflet I stated what would be the effect of it and of the Post Office notice, but the matter was treated very lightly by the spokesman for the Government., my noble friend Lord Liverpool, on the ground that it was only a matter of the difference between "must" and "should." But what does Mr. Lloyd George tell us himself? Speaking at a packed meeting held on "Joy Day" under peaceful picketing conditions and with no dissent allowed, he told us that over 9,000,000 members were now enrolled. What does that mean, my Lords? It means that nearly 10,000,000 out of the 12,000,000 possible contributors have been already "raked in" under this
<col>532</col>
scandalous leaflet by the approved friendly societies, and that they have doubled their membership since May 31. I think that entirely proves that our opposition to the leaflet and the intimidating notice in the Post Office was perfectly justified. I do not know whether the amended leaflet has ever been sent out, but I do know that the leaflet to which we objected is still in existence, and that the notice is still up in the Post Office. I think it is impossible, after what we were told by Mr. Lloyd George on Saturday, that there can be any doubt as to what was the object of the leaflet or that it has met with the success with which it was intended to meet.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01506">Is the Act any better understood now than it was ten weeks ago? I do not think it is. The various pamphlets and leaflets which have been issued have made confusion worse confounded, and for my part I am coining very rapidly to the conclusion that it is much easier to understand the Act than to understand the pamphlets and leaflets, and for the future I shall let the pamphlets and leaflets go by the board and shall endeavour to understand and act up to the Act itself. Mr. Lloyd George complains of our "wilful stupidity," and then he tells us that it is our own fault, and that if we had spent a halfpenny or a penny on a certain pamphlet it would have made everything clear to us. If there is this very intelligible and clear pamphlet, why has it not been distributed throughout the length and breadth of the land by the Insurance Commissioners instead of these trashy pamphlets and mendacious and misleading leaflets? I can tell Mr. Lloyd George the reason, if he likes. The pamphlet to which he alludes was not framed to deal with the colossal difficulties of which the Lord Chancellor spoke in the course of our recent discussion. It was framed in order to popularise the Act, and to popularise, if possible, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. All the difficulties of the Act were left out of account, and that was the reason why, in going by his own pamphlet, he got into so many mistakes last Saturday. I do not advise anybody to read that pamphlet. There are others which are much better if we are to go to privately circulated pamphlets.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01507">This Insurance Act when first introduced was brought in for the "promotion of thrift throughout the nation." That was said to be its great principle. But thrift is gradually beginning to be abandoned.
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0271"/>
<col>533</col>
The other day the Secretary of the Treasury recommended that to avoid the unpleasantness of being taxgatherers in their own homes employers should pay both their own and their employees' taxes. Since then we have been told that there is another very much simpler plan&#x2014;namely, to pay your share of the tax and give a shilling a week more to each of your labourers out of which they are to pay the 4<i>d.</i> I do not see that that gets out of the difficulty of becoming the taxgatherer; and I do not see how it promotes thrift, because the labourer instead of paying 4<i>d.,</i> would get 8<i>d.</i> profit&#x2014;that is to say, would be something like 35<i>s.</i> to the good by the end of the year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01508">The Chancellor of the Exchequer accused us of wilful ignorance. I think he said there was more wilful ignorance about the penalties under the Act than about anything else. He said that all he cared about was to ensure the payment by the employers, and that if the employer did not pay he would be brought to book; but as for trying to penalise the labourer&#x2014;that was the last thing in the world he would have thought of. In pamphlet marked "A" for employers, which came out early in May under the authority of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of the Treasury, and their allies at Buckingham Gate, there appears this extraordinary paragraph&#x2014;
<quote>"A worker who, without reasonable cause, fails to deliver a contribution card when the employer requires it for the purpose of paying contributions or for production to an inspector, is liable, on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding &#x00A3;10."</quote>
That does not apply to the employer but entirely to the worker, so that I do not see how he is going to get out of it. And at the bottom of the first page of the notorious leaflet, by means of which the 5,000,000 contributors were "raked in" to the friendly societies, is this announcement in large letters&#x2014;
<quote>"PENALTIES.&#x2014;The penalties for each offence against the Act or the Regulations made under the Act is a tine not exceeding &#x00A3;10."</quote>
So much for Mr. Lloyd George's inaccuracies on this point. It shows that other people are ignorant who ought not to be ignorant. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had a great chance last Saturday if he had been a statesman. He could have explained a great many of the colossal difficulties and made it a great deal easier to understand the Act, and he could have suggested amendments which would have made the Act really workable and of benefit to the poor. But he cares only to have his own
<col>534</col>
way. He prefers claptrap, inaccuracies and abuse. He wants to bring the Act into operation for the personal gratification of himself, and cares nothing whatever how far the Act will be beneficial to those on whose behalf it is supposed to be framed. We who criticise the Act do desire to get the greatest benefit for the people now that it is the law of the land. That is the real difference between us and the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#x2014;not wilful ignorance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01509">I notice in the newspapers this morning that a Question was asked in the House of Commons on a subject to which I called attention on June 12 and to which I did not get an answer&#x2014;namely, whether or not the contributions under the Act are taxes. The hon. Member for Salisbury asked whether the contributions of insured persons are to be construed as past of a contract or as taxes. The Secretary of the Treasury replied&#x2014;and I am bound to say I cannot understand the answer&#x2014;
<quote>"Contributions are payable by virtue, not of a contract, but of a statutory obligation, and inasmuch as the payments inure to the benefit of the person paying them and do not go into the Exchequer they are not analogous to taxes."</quote>
I hope this legal definition will be explained by the Lord Chancellor. To me it is worse than Greek. The payments do not inure to the benefit of the employer, out of whose pocket the greater part of them come. Last week there was circulated in the Press the opinion on this point of a very learned King's Counsel, Mr. Shearman, who is reported to have given an opinion in the following words&#x2014;
<quote>"The contributions made payable by Section 4 of the National Insurance Act, 191 L, are taxes&#x2014;</quote>
that is exactly what the Secretary of the Treasury says they are not&#x2014;
<quote>"A tax is part of the revenue granted to the Crown by authority of Parliament, and the payment of a tax is not a question of contract between the Crown and a subject."</quote>
Of course not. But is this contribution a tax On June 12 I raised this very question, and said that the Act is practically a legislative contract between Parliament and the contributors under the Act. The noble and learned Viscount took no objection to that description, nor did the noble Marquess the Leader of the House. I should like to ask the Lord Chancellor whether he agrees with Mr. Shearman or not. If he does, then all the statements of Radical speakers that it is not a new tax are wrong.</p>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0272"/>
<col>535</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01510">Now I come to the Resolution standing in my name on the Paper. It is in practically the same words as the House of Commons Resolution of May 1, which was accepted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and unanimously carried. What has been done in the ten weeks interval to carry it out? If that Resolution was considered necessary ten weeks ago it is more than ever necessary now that July 15 has passed. We have a right to some information from Ministers and should not be left to contradictory statements in the Press. At present we know very little. The position seems to be that the Chancellor of the Exchequer stands firm by the proposals in the Act, and the doctors firmly refuse to accept them. But the House of Commons have unanimously declared that the Act will fail to confer medical benefit until the co-operation of the doctors is assured. That co-operation is not assured; yet July 15 has come and gone. If you study Mr. Lloyd George's apologia which appeared in the Press about ten days ago and also the information which we get from the <i>British Medical Journal</i> it is fair to assume that the Insurance Commissioners apparently admit that the terms of the Act are not fair and reasonable. Well, if they are not fair and reasonable they naturally condemn them. They further admit, we are told, that the remuneration under the Act should be greater than that received under existing conditions from the friendly societies. But it seems that they are as far off a settlement as ever. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has made no suggestion whatever during the negotiations, or so-called negotiations, which have taken place. He only maintains his opposition to what is known as the 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> proposal of the doctors and to the &#x00A3;2 limit, and he wants the doctors to leave open the whole question of extras&#x2014;namely, night visits, mileage and medicine.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01511">I wish to say a word as regards the dispensing of medicine. I believe that if the doctors could be allowed to dispense-their medicine they would probably moderate the terms they now ask, and it would be a very great advantage to the poor. It is monstrous to compel poor people in country districts, after they have sent perhaps three or four miles for a doctor late at night when a member of the family is taken ill, to then send perhaps six or seven miles to the nearest town to get the medicine made up. The practice in Lincolnshire is for the messenger to remain
<col>536</col>
at the doctor's house until the doctor has returned from visiting the patient and then the messenger takes back the medicine. If the poor are to have to pay first of all some one to go and fetch the doctor in one direction, and then get somebody else to go seven or eight miles in the opposite direction to get the medicine, the medicine will be very costly before it arrives. Moreover, I think it would tend much to bring the doctors and the Chancellor of the Exchequer together if he would give up the idea that the doctors are not to dispense the medicine. For my part I think it is a very good plan that they should do so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01512">Then there is another proposal&#x2014;that, if all fails, the sum of 6<i>s.</i> is to be given back to the contributor and he is to find his own doctor. We are told that it is not 6<i>s.</i> to one person but 6<i>s.</i> all round to all the contributors; but when the 6<i>s.</i> is handed back the whole question of general insurance is given up. It is supposed that 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> is to be for the doctor and 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for the medicine. Supposing a poor man is taken ill with influenza. Why, the first bottle of influenza mixture would cost a great deal more than 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> But we are really in the dark in respect of everything except what we can glean from the newspapers. That is not a satisfactory position. It appears to me that Mr. Lloyd George ignores all the colossal difficulties, and, as I have shown, repudiates his own pamphlets and leaflets. Whilst the whole Act is in chaos there will be the maximum of cost in its administration with the minimum of benefit to the contributors; and the chief principles of the Act&#x2014;namely, thrift, general insurance and medical attendance&#x2014;are now abandoned. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01513"><i>Moved</i> to resolve, That in the opinion of this House, until the co-operation of the medical profession in the administration of the National Insurance Act is ensured, His Majesty's Government will fail efficiently to provide medical benefits in accordance with the law.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Heneage.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01514"><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as regards the noble Lord's Motion, I am not going to oppose it any more than a similar Motion was opposed in the House of Commons. It is recognised by all that the co-operation of the doctors in the working of the Act is of vital importance, and everything that can be done is being done to secure
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0273"/>
<col>537</col>
that co-operation. It does not mean everything, however, if the doctors do not come in. On this question it is well known that there is strong feeling on both sides. The British Medical Association are going to meet this week and next, and it would be undesirable to make any statement in regard to conditions or as to negotiations beyond that which is already known. Sir William Plender's Report will be considered at the forthcoming meeting of the Association, and I would therefore urge the noble Lord not to press for additional information on the question of the cooperation of the doctors as long as negotiations with the medical profession are proceeding in a friendly spirit. As to the question of which the noble Lord gave me private notice&#x2014;namely, whether or not the contributions under the Act are taxes I am afraid I can give him no further answer than that contained in the reply given in the other House by the Secretary of the Treasury and read by the noble Lord in the course of his speech to-day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01515"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must confess to some little surprise at the answer which has just been given. I entirely agree that the co-operation of the medical profession is vital to the successful working of the Act. But how was it that that co-operation was not obtained from the first? What encouragement was given to the medical profession by the Chancellor of the Exchequer? During the last few weeks it has been stated repeatedly in the House of Commons that a settlement with the medical profession had nearly been reached. I wish to know what foundation there was for that assertion. So far as can be gathered from the newspapers the medical profession have never budged an inch from the position which they at first took up. As the British Medical Association are about to meet and to fully discuss these matters the noble Lord who has just replied for the Government felt that it would be indiscreet and unwise to make any further statement at present. I wish the noble Earl had acted as ear-flapper to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on Saturday last, when Mr. Lloyd George made most positive statements both as to what had happened and as to what he was determined not to do. He made statements of a nature from which Lord Liverpool wisely recoiled. As a matter of fact, there is no doubt whatever that so far as the medical profession is concerned matters are at a deadlock.<lb/>
<col>538</col>
Then take the question of sanatoria benefit. I do not know whether any of your Lordships have seen Memorandum No. 112, which has been issued by the Insurance Commissioners, and is the joint production of the Commissioners and the Local Government Board. From beginning to end this Memorandum is a complete confession that the administration of sanatoria benefit, whether you regard it as a. permanent institution or from the point of view of how to set the Act in operation, has entirely broken down. In this Memorandum it is pointed out that&#x2014;
<quote>"A complete scheme for dealing with tuberculosis in any area will fall naturally into two parts, called for convenience the 'dispensary unit' and the sanatorium unit' respectively."</quote>
With regard to the dispensary unit, they say&#x2014;
<quote>"The term dispensary' is used in this connection in a special sense as a local centre of expert diagnosis and treatment. As is pointed out in the Report of the Departmental Committee, the essential element is not the building but the expert medical officer to be designated the `tuberculosis officer '&#x2014;</quote>
No tuberculosis officer, so far as I know, has been appointed&#x2014;
<quote>"He should be a person of such experience, attainments, and professional status as are likely to command the confidence of the medical practitioners of the district, on whose effective co-operation the success of the whole scheme must largely depend."</quote>
In the present temper of the medical profession is it likely that you will find these tuberculosis officers, and is it likely that the medical profession will give them their assistance? At all events, that is more or less beside the question, because they have not been appointed.<lb/>
The next point is the "sanatorium unit," and there the Commissioners admit at once that these public sanatoria do not exist and cannot for a considerable time. This is what they says&#x2014;
<quote>"For the reasons already slated it is evident that in most districts the system of dispensaries, sanatoria, will not lie available for some time after time commencement of the Act."</quote>
No, they are not available and cannot be available, because the Provisional Committees which are now in existence have no power to commit a district to the adoption of any particular plan. Having said that the dispensaries and sanatoria cannot be found, they proceed to what is really the most imporant part of the matter&#x2014;namely, how they propose to deal with it now. I
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0274"/>
<col>539</col>
invite your Lordships' attention to this extract&#x2014;
<quote>"In making the necessary arrangements for administration at the commencement of the Act the Insurance Committee should, at an early date, place themselves in communication with the county or county borough council with a view to the medical officer of health attending a meeting of the Committee, as provided in Section 60 (2) of the Act, and advising them on the necessary arrangements."</quote>
Therefore they begin by falling back on the county or county borough council and using their medical officers. It is on these medical officers apparently that they have to rely. The medical officer is to advise them on the method by which persons applying, for sanatorium benefit should be medically examined, and, secondly, as to the institution and means of treatment available for patients. I should have thought that was the business of the Insurance Commissioners themselves. The Memorandum proceeds&#x2014;
<quote>"When a provisional scheme of arrangements has been arrived at the Insurance Committee should submit their proposals to the Commissioners for approval."</quote>
So that in every single county before you can proceed to deal with any of these cases of tuberculosis you have to obtain the approval of the Commissioners themselves. The Memorandum goes on&#x2014;
<quote>"As regards the first of the above matters, viz., the method of medical examination and report, the Commissioners have consulted the Local Government Board, and are of opinion, the Local Government Board concurring, that the following procedure will enable the Committee to deal with the administration of the benefit, so far as it can be dealt with at the outset, in those districts where a tuberculosis officer has not been appointed"&#x2014;</quote>
that is, everywhere&#x2014;
<quote>"and the agencies available are very limited. It is suggested, briefly, that in these areas the medical officer of health of the county or county borough might properly, if on the Committee's application the Council agree to such arrangement, be appointed to act temporarily as the expert adviser of the Committee in dealing with individual applications for sanatorium benefit."</quote>
The Committee are therefore absolutely dependent on the medical officer of the county or county borough. The Memorandum proceeds&#x2014;
<quote>"Where such an arrangement is made, an insured person who believes himself to be suffering from tuberculosis and wishes to obtain sanatorium benefit would apply to the Clerk (or Acting Clerk) of the Insurance Committee."</quote>
I wonder who that is going to be. Is he to be the clerk to the county council?
<col>540</col>
They have already taken the medical officer. Whoever the clerk is, he will furnish the person with&#x2014;
<quote>"a blank form of medical report, which the patient will 1.e advised to take to his ordinary medical attendant or any other medical practitioner he may prefer."</quote>
Then the Memorandum states that&#x2014;
<quote>"A fee should be paid by the Insurance Committee for the examination and report, and the Commissioners are advised that a fee of 5<i>s.</i> will be regarded as suitable for this purpose."</quote>
That may or may not be agreed to by the medical officer in question. But when he has made his report&#x2014;
<quote>"On his advice the Committee will select the cases that stand most in need of sanatorium benefit and decide what hind of treatment should be provided in each case."</quote>
That is substantially the whole provision by which it is proposed to work this sanatorium benefit at the commencement of the Act. In other words, there is no central administration at all. I can assure your Lordships that this Memorandum from beginning to end is nothing but a confession of failure. No doubt the Commissioners have been overworked. We were told that sanatorium benefit must be started at once. Well, you cannot start it at once. Is not this another proof of the haste and undue precipitation with which this Act, I will not say has been brought into operation, but has been nominally started? As to what may be the ultimate result of the conference between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the medical profession of course we know nothing. At the same time, I think that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would do well, when he professes to be negotiating with the medical profession, not to deliver such a speech as he did on Saturday last.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01516"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad to think that our action to-night is likely to be more harmonious than the speeches to which we have listened, because although noble Lords opposite and ourselves hold different views on the subject under discussion we are going to agree unanimously to pass the Resolution before the House. I think that relieves me of the necessity of entering into anything controversial on the matter. Nothing could be more unfortunate than to attempt to discuss, on the one side or the other, matters which ate still the subject of negotiation between the two parties, and if I refrain from answering
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0275"/>
<col>541</col>
the attacks made upon my right hon. friend I hope the House will not imagine that it is because I have not an answer to give. I know that noble Lords opposite are just as anxious as we are that arrangements should be come to with the medical profession. Therefore I will, with your Lordships' permission, say very little on that particular point. The noble Earl who has just sat down complained that the benefit of sanatorium treatment would not be immediately available to those who needed it. I am sure it will be a satisfaction to those who are responsible for the Act to know that the noble Earl is so very anxious that the benefits should become available at once and that his complaint is that they are not available yet. I confess I am not wholly able to agree with what seemed to me to be at any rate the result of his criticisms with regard to the medical officers and the fact that their advice will be sought by these Committees. These medical officers clearly have special knowledge of the circumstances of the county or county borough in which they themselves live, and they will be able to give to the Committees advice which at the beginning will be particularly valuable to them, and more valuable than the advice would be of an officer specially appointed and not acquainted with the district. Because this matter is not treated wholly from the central authority in London, that is not an admission of failure. From the beginning it was never contemplated that the Act should be centrally administered from London, but that its administration should, as far as possible, be decentralised in the various districts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01517"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I stated that this Memorandum is a confession that there are no means of bringing the Act into force, either as a permanent institution or at its first commencement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01518"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: Among the various points which the noble Earl brought forward to show that the Act had not been brought successfully into operation he instanced the fact that it was not going to he administered centrally, and I was pointing out to him that it was never intended that the Act should be administered from a central authority in London. Lord Heneage complained very much of the attitude which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had taken up on the question of
<col>542</col>
allowing doctors to dispense. In reply to that I would point out that there is power under the Act for the Commissioners to permit the Insurance Committees in exceptional cases to arrange with medical practitioners for the supply of medicines and drugs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01519"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: What I object to is that this is only to be in exceptional cases. I maintain that in country districts generally it is absolutely essential that doctors should be empowered to dispense.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01520"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Earl is going to take his stand, has he has done, on the delicacy of the negotiations, which a discussion in this House might prejudice, he ought to be in a position to assure us that the language which was used by his colleague, which has accentuated these differences, will not be continued. The failure to come to an agreement is not due to criticisms from us but to the extraordinary and unprecedented language used by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. At the Opera House he referred to the action of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons and Physicians&#x2014;bodies of scientific men who represent a profession which, with the exception of the clerical profession, has done more unpaid work and displayed more generosity towards the poorer classes in this country than any, other&#x2014;as an example of "rude ineptitude which is utterly without parallel, fortunately, in the history of the country," and "behaviour so extraordinary on the part of great societies as to absolutely unfit them for the position they assume." I protest against our being asked to abstain from criticism which might embarrass the Government in carrying out a great national measure while the author of the measure is himself to be allowed complete latitude to attack everybody and to foul his own water.<lb/>
I am most anxious to see this Act put into operation as rapidly as possible, and I have not the slightest sympathy with those employers who have said that they will not work the Act and will rebel against the law. I, and I believe I can speak for every one on this side of the House, desire to conform to the law, and to show those whom we employ how they can get the best advantage out of the Act. But in the speech to which Lord Heneage referred the Chancellor of the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0276"/>
<col>543</col>
Exchequer made an attack on the whole body of employers, who, he told the employees, were endeavouring to do them out of the benefits of the Act. That is a most gross insinuation. I will tell the noble Earl the position in which I find myself at this moment. A labourer of mine comes to me and says he has paid under the Act and is entitled to sanatorium benefit for tuberculosis. I ask the noble Earl, How, when the Advisory Committee is not constituted, when the doctor has not been appointed, when the machinery is not in existence&#x2014;how is that man to have the benefits of the contract which Parliament has made for him and the payments for which have been enforced from him?<lb/>
One other point. I do not think that the Government have realised that the mere fact of giving a man a money payment instead of the medical benefits which were promised is not in any respect an equivalent. The medical benefit at present may work out, under some scheme, at 6<i>s.</i> a year. If you pay that 6<i>s.</i> to a man who is ill, it will be eaten up in the first few hours of his illness. But that is not all. The medical benefits are calculated on preserving a man in medical attendance for the rest of his life. If you pay it in money to the individual you can only pay it up to the age of seventy, and a man who conies in now at the age of sixty-seven or sixty-eight, unless some arrangement is made with the doctors, will terminate his medical benefit at seventy and will remain without it during the years he most requires it. I hope that if my noble friend rests satisfied by the acceptance of this Motion it will not be held that this brief discussion exhausts the points we have to make. I personally would wish that everything should now be done to smooth the path of the measure. I cannot help registering my conviction, having had myself in the past some official relations with the heads of these great Colleges, that there is no body of men more willing to meet the public interest in the most generous manner and with the most complete self-sacrifice, and I venture to say there is no man in your Lordships' House who does not feel that such language as Mr. Lloyd George has used about the doctors, coming from a man who is both a politician and a statesman, is neither politic nor statesmanlike.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE ARMY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01522"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member> rose to call attention to&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01523">1. The statement of the Under-Secretary of State for War on 6th March, 1911 [OFFICIAL REPORT]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01524">That the number of Regular Infantry officers required for the six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force is 2,461, exclusive of Staff, and that the number serving by the Army List of January, 1911, not seconded was 1,998, and that the number of officers required for the four battalions remaining at home after the departure of the Expeditionary Force is 112.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01525">2. To the fact that the above figures show a total deficiency of 575, exclusive of Staff, or for any allowance for temporary unfitness for active service.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01526">3. To the statement of the Secretary of State for War on the 6th March, 1912 [OFFICIAL REPORT, page 316]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01527">The figures given by the noble Duke are substantially accurate. They are a little old, but the figures to-day, as he stated, are not materially different from those at the date he takes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01528">4. To the statement of the Secretary of State on 15th May, 1912 [OFFICIAL REPORT]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01529">My answer is that the actual shortage in the Infantry battalions of the Expeditionary Force on 1st March last, after deducting the officers required for Staff and extra regimental appointments, was 666.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01530">5. To ask the Government if it is not a fact that by the War Office Manual War Establishments, 1911&#x2013;1912, published by authority, the following officers must be withdrawn from regimental duty thereby creating vacancies in then companies as under:
<ol>
<li>(A) One subaltern per battalion to act as transport officer and one to act as signalling officer. (<i>See</i> War Establishments, 1911&#x2013;1912.)</li>
<li>(B) If it is not a fact that these officers are shown in the War Office Manual Peace Establishments, Part I, for 1911&#x2013;1912, as belonging to a company, but by War Establishments they are
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0277"/>
<col>545</col>
taken from their company and attached to headquarters of their units on mobilisation, thus creating 156 vacancies among company officers in the 78 battalions of the Expeditionary Force.</li>
<li>(C) If it is not a fact that by the Army List of June, 1912, no A.D.C.'s are appointed to Brigades, whereas by War Establishments, 1911&#x2013;1912, each Brigade becomes entitled to one A.D.C., making a total of 18 A.D.C.'s for the 18 Brigades.</li>
<li>(D) If it is not a fact that by Peace Establishments, 1911&#x2013;1912, there is no establishment laid down for signalling officers for Brigades and Divisions, whereas by War Establishments, 1910&#x2013;1911, each Division is shown with one divisional signalling officer, and each Brigade with one Brigade signalling officer, that is six for Divisions and 18 for Brigades, making a total of 24 signalling officers.</li>
<li>(E) if it is not a fact that by comparing the War Office Manuals of War Establishments and of Peace Establishments and the Army List, 198 Infantry officers additional to the shortage of 600 must be required for Staff and extra-regimental duties on the mobilisation of the infantry of the six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force, making a total shortage, including Stall, of 798 instead of 666, as by statement of the Secretary of State for War on 15th May, 1912.</li></ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01531">6. To ask if it is not necessary, in addition to the 198 officers required by War Establishments for Staff duties, to make further deductions:
<ol>
<li>(A) For temporary unfitness for active service, which at the lowest possible rate of 2 per cent. on the 2,665 officers required according to War Establishments for the Expeditionary Force would amount to 52.</li>
<li>(B) For the contingent of Infantry officers needed to complete the 182 required from all branches of the Service for aviation work (by Memorandum on Naval and Military Aviation [Cd. 6067]) to the extent of at least 50.</li></ol></p>
<col>546</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01532">7. To ask if, in the event of the above deductions being necessary, the total deficiency in Infantry officers on mobilisation, including Staff, extra-regimental appointments, wastage and aviation, would amount to 900.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01533">(B) If it is not a fact that by War Establishments, 1911&#x2013;1912, one officer per battalion must be left at the base over-seas, and thus 78 additional officers must be embarked with the Infantry of the Expeditionary Force for this duty, making a total shortage to be made good previous to the embarkation of the Expeditionary Force of 978 Infantry officers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01534">8. To call attention to the statement of the Secretary of State for War in the House of Lords, 13th May, 1912 [OFFICIAL REPORT]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01535">In completing the requirements of the Expeditionary Force as regards officers it has been found necessary to draw upon four sources: (1) non-commissioned ranks; (2) Special Reserve units; (3) Supplementary Reserve; (4) General Reserve.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01536">9. To ask if it is not a fact that&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(A) By Army Order, 23rd December, 1907, the number of Special Reserve subalterns in the 74 Third Battalions to be transferred to the Line battalions on mobilisation is four per battalion, making a total of 296.</li>
<li>(B) By statement of the Under-Secretary of State for War on 13th March, 1912, there are available in the Regular Reserve of Officers 129 captains and 38 subalterns, who are resident in the United Kingdom, who do not belong to any other branch of our Military Forces, and who have not left the Regular Army more than three years.</li>
<li>(C) By the June Army List there are available on the Supplementary List of the Special Reserve in the Infantry of the Line 56 officers, making a total of 519 officers from the Special Reserve, the Supplementary Reserve, and the Regular Reserve, to meet a deficit of 900, leaving a shortage of 381.</li></ol></p>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0278"/>
<col>547</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01537">10. To ask if it is the intention on mobilisation to promote 381 N.C.O.'s to commissioned rank to meet the deficiency in company officers in the battalions of the Expeditionary Force, in addition to three N.C.O.'s per battalion in all Special Reserve battalions, as by statement of the Secretary of State for War on 13th May, 1912, making a total of 684 Infantry N.C.O.'s to be promoted to commissioned rank on the mobilisation of the Infantry of the Regular Army previous to the embarkation of the Expeditionary Force.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01538">The noble Duke said: My Lords, in reference to the Questions standing in my name on the Paper, I called the attention of the noble Viscount the then Secretary of State for War before Whitsuntide to the deficiency of Infantry officers on the mobilisation of the Expeditionary Force, and suggested that, including Staff, in round numbers the deficiency would amount to 900. The Secretary of State for War, in his reply, stated&#x2014;it is in the fourth paragraph of my Notice&#x2014;that&#x2014;
<quote>"The actual shortage in the Infantry battalions of the Expeditionary Force on larch I last, after deducting the officers required for Staff and extra-Regimental appointments, was 666."</quote>
That is a very different figure from the one of 900 which I had given and was prepared to make good at that moment had not the Secretary of State for War informed me in the course of his reply that he could not deal with any figures unless they were on the Paper of the House. It was obviously useless for me to quote figures when the Secretary of State for War had just informed me that he could not deal with them. I had to wait until I could get the figures on the Paper of the House. Meantime, before there was any opportunity of so doing, the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War had been translated into the noble and learned Lord upon the Woolsack.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01539">The noble Viscount the late Secretary of State for War had on more than one occasion during the course of discussions in your Lordships' House most kindly invited me to call at the War Office when my mind would be set at rest by War Office experts, who would supply me with information&#x2014;in the words of the Secretary of State&#x2014;"of a more full description than it is possible to give across the Table of the House." I feel I should be lacking in
<col>548</col>
courtesy to the noble and learned Viscount upon the Woolsack if I did not explain why I have refrained from availing myself of his kind invitation to walk into the War Office parlour. My reason is that I wish to remain absolutely without knowledge of the secrets of mobilisation. I wish to speak as a member of the House whose only knowledge of mobilisation is derived from War Office manuals and answers given by responsible Ministers in Parliament; in short, from sources of information open to every Continental War Office, and to which it cannot therefore be contrary to the public interest to draw attention. At the same time, although I do not seek to know anything confidential about mobilization matters, I do want to know why the Army List and the Manual of War Establishments give a different set of figures from those recently used by the late Secretary of State for War in your Lordships' House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01540">As to the third paragraph of my Notice, there the late Secretary of State accepts the number of 600, which I have given, as the deficiency of Infantry officers without Staff, but with the qualification of "substantially accurate." Of course, the number of Infantry officers in the Army may vary from month to month, but the variation is very slight. I find by the Report on the British Army, comparing the number of Infantry officers on October 1, 1910, and on October 1, 1911, that there was a variation of two in the course of twelve months. That proves beyond all question that the figure of 600 is not subject to any appreciable difference, but is an absolutely reliable figure upon which to calculate at the present moment. In my fourth paragraph I quote the answer of the Secretary of State, saying that the shortage on mobilisation, including Staff, amounts to 666. That is an addition of 66 officers for Staff and extra-regimental duties, There are War Office Manuals called Peace and War Establishments. They are published by authority, hence the War Office is responsible for their accuracy. They are books showing the number of officers required by a unit in time of peace, and the number required by the same unit&#x2014;in this case an Infantry battalion&#x2014;in time of war. They show the difference between the peace and war establishments. In these War Office Manuals it is printed in black and white&#x2014;and I give the whole detail in my Notice&#x2014;that 198 additional officers will be required on mobilisation for Staff
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0279"/>
<col>549</col>
and extra-regimental duties, and not 66 as by the statement of the late Secretary of State for War. In the sixth paragraph of my Notice I call attention to the fact that, on the basis of two per cent. for temporary unfitness for active service, 52 officers must be deducted, and another 50 for aviation work. These deductions, together with the 198 required by the War Office Manual, give the total shortage of Infantry officers on mobilisation, including Staff, as 900.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01541">When explaining the Army Estimates on March 16, 1911, the Secretary of State for War said&#x2014;
<quote>"There is no difficulty at all in mobilising as far as officers of the Expeditionary Force are concerned."</quote>
Well, if there is no difficulty at all in providing officers, why did not the late Secretary of State explain to us in a few simple sentences, and in a way which we could all understand, where these First Line officers are to come from? The late Secretary of State for War has never done so. Instead, on May 13 last, he took the course of reading to us a long and intricate War Office Memorandum destructive of all he had told us ten weeks before on the very same point&#x2014;the shortage of Infantry officers&#x2014;and added that&#x2014;
<quote>"The Memorandum goes to the utmost limit of the information which M. the public interest we are prepared to give."</quote>
In the public interest we were to rest content with a final utterance contradicting all the information we had been previously given. It is interesting to contrast what the Secretary of State told us in March with what he read to us in May. On March 6 the Secretary of State said&#x2014;
<quote>"What you would do would be to draw upon the Regular officers belonging to the other establishments at home. There are 780 of them with the Special Reserve Battalions. You would make your Expeditionary Force as perfect in officers as possible."</quote>
And on May 13 he said&#x2014;
<quote>"All the Regular officers belonging to the Special Reserve establishments in peace would remain with them on mobilisation"</quote>
&#x2014;a flat contradiction to the statement made in March, and a loss to the Line battalions of 780 officers, and officers, let me explain, actually belonging to but withdrawn from the battalions of the Expeditionary Force. Again, on March 6 the late Secretary of State told us that allowance had been made in the establishment of all Fourth Battalions of the Special
<col>550</col>
Reserve to admit of four subalterns per battalion passing to the Line on mobilisation. But on May 13 he explained that&#x2014;
<quote>"In the course of the later development of the mobilisation scheme this has ceased to be so, and those 4th Battalions do not now have to part with any subalterns on mobilisation"</quote>
&#x2014;another flat contradiction to his statement in March, and a loss of 108 subalterns to the infantry of the Expeditionary Force. These are very quick changes, and reveal the surprising fact that up to Easter in this year no plan had been matured for the mobilisation of the Infantry officers of the Expeditionary Force, and if this was the condition of affairs in the case of the Infantry it may have been the same in other arms of the Service. On March 6 the late Secretary of State told us that&#x2014;
<quote>"There were available in the Regular Reserve at present 791 Infantry officers, after allowing 40 per cent. for officers who for various reasons may not be forthcoming."</quote>
A week later, on March 13, the Under-Secretary of State for War stated that there were 129 Infantry captains and 38 Infantry subalterns resident hi the United Kingdom, who do not belong to any other branch of our military forces, and who have not left the Army for more than three years. These 167 represent the number fit to embark with the Expeditionary Force, which implies fitness for the ordeal of going into action within a fortnight of being called back to the Colours. But 167 is a different figure from 791, less 40 per cent. for wastage, given by the late Secretary of State for War.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01542">To sum up the late Secretary of State's March plan. There were available, he said, 780 Regular officers attached to the Special Reserve battalions, <i>plus</i> 108 subalterns from the Fourth Battalions of the Special Reserve, <i>plus</i> 790 Infantry officers from the Regular Reserve. That is a total of 1,678, all of whom, with the exception of 100, were Regular officers available to meet the deficiencies in the Infantry of the Expeditionary Force. The late Secretary of State claimed in March that by means of these 1,678 officers he had wiped out the deficit to which I had then called attention, and had absolutely disposed of the fallacy of the shortage of officers on mobilisation. But a little later, when he was asked to discuss the condition of the Special Reserve he seems to have recognised the fact, if he deprived the Third Battalions of the Special Reserve of the whole teaching Staff
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0280"/>
<col>551</col>
of Regular officers and took away most of the subalterns of the Fourth Battalions at the very moment of sending them on service abroad, that the Special Reserve Infantry both for home and foreign service would collapse on mobilisation. You cannot have a military force without officers. In former days the Militia used to be bled white for the advantage of the Line. Now the Line is embarked for service abroad, bled white for the sake of the Special Reserve at home. The Special Reserve is the special creation of the late Secretary of State for War, and must be kept going on mobilisation, even at the risk of the Regular Army abroad.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01543">The late Secretary of State for War meant in March to make the Expeditionary Force "as perfect in officers as possible by drawing upon the Regular officers belonging to other establishments at home." In May we see the March plan completely changed. Nine hundred Regular officers belonging to the battalions of the Expeditionary Force, an average of 12 per battalion, are withdrawn from their battalions and left at home for the sake of the Special Reserve and the Territorial Army. It is certain that if ever the Expeditionary Force is sent on to the Continent we shall not be superior in quantity. It follows that the only chance of success resides in being superior in quality. If we arrange to be inferior both in quantity and quality, it is obvious that we have organised defeat, and that is what, for my own part, I think the May plan of the late Secretary of State for War has organised. Now it is certain that if we are defeated in the first decisive action on the Continent we cannot retrieve that initial disaster by a combination of the Territorial Army, the Territorial Force Reserve, the Special Reserve, the General Reserve, the Supplementary Reserve, the Regular Reserve, the Technical Reserve, the National Reserve, the Veteran Reserve, the Officers Training Corps of 20,000 serving members (all school boys), Category B men who are Special Reservists supernumerary to the Territorial Force, Category C men who are men specially enlisted at the moment of mobilisation, Rifle Clubs, Warrior Clubs, and patriotic persons who may be counted upon to come forward in time of emergency. We shall never forget with what consummate skill the late Secretary of State for War used to man&#x0153;uvre these vast legions to the amazement and bewilderment of his hearers. The late
<col>552</col>
Secretary of State for War will be remembered as the great inventor of new and incomprehensible military forces, and one of his most original creations is an Infantry Reserve destined, not to strengthen, but to weaken battalions of the fighting line by depriving them of 900 of their officers on the eve of one of the decisive battles of the world. It is impossible to make good to the Line the loss of quality which the withdrawal of 900 Regular officers entails.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01544">The attempt to make good the loss of quantity by the May plan is as follows. The late Secretary of State for War told us&#x2014;it is the eighth paragraph in my Notice&#x2014;that to complete the requirements of the Expeditionary Force as regards officers it had been found necessary to draw upon four sources&#x2014;(1) non-commissioned ranks; (2) Special Reserve units; (3) Supplementary Reserve; (4) General Reserve; and he added&#x2014;
<quote>"Investigation has shown that it is possible for these four sources to meet all the initial requirements, both Staff and regimental, of the Expeditionary Force of six Divisions on mobilisation."</quote>
The investigation alluded to is simplicity itself, and there can be nothing confidential or mysterious about it. The Army List gives the number of officers available, and War Establishments give us the number required on mobilisation. The rest is a simple subtraction sum. I will take the four headings given by the late Secretary of State, leaving the non-commissioned ranks till last, and beginning with the units in the Third Battalions of the Special Reserve. By the Army Order of December 23, 1907, one subaltern from each battalion must be left at the dep&#x00F4;t, and four go to the Line battalion on mobilisation. The result of this order on the Third Battalions of the Special Reserve is that there would be 25 battalions with no Special Reserve subalterns at all, and 29 more with three subalterns and less apiece. Yet in May the late Secretary of State for War told us that&#x2014;
<quote>"The authorities do not propose necessarily to take four officers from each Special Reserve battalion. If a particular Special Reserve battalion is considerably below its establishment of subalterns its strength may be left undisturbed."</quote>
Thus, by the statement of the late Secretary of State for War, 54 battalions out of the 74 would be exempted from the operation of the Army Order on account of deficiency in subalterns. This is impossible. I assume that the Army Order and not the idea of the late Secretary of State is carried
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0281"/>
<col>553</col>
out, and that four subalterns per battalion&#x2014;that is, 296&#x2014;are transferred from the Third Battalions of the Special Reserve to the Line.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01545">The next source of supply is the Supplementary Reserve. I know the late Secretary of State expects great things of the Supplementary Reserve. All that is necessary is to defer mobilisation for some ten years, then there is no telling to what number the Supplementary Reserve of Infantry officers may not have attained. But we must take facts as we find them, and by the June Army List the Supplementary Reserve for the Line at present numbers 56. I do not wish to disparage the subaltern officers of the Special Reserve and of the Supplementary Reserve, but you do not disparage a man by saying that he does not know that which he has never learnt. We must remember that the officers in the Special Reserve and Supplementary Reserve have never had any training winch would fit them for the First Line duties which they will be required to perform on active service when for the first time they join the Line battalions. It is hard measure upon them and harder upon the battalions. The next source of supply is the General Reserve. Now the only contributions which the General Reserve can make to the officers of the Expeditionary Force is the 167, as explained by the statement of the Under-Secretary of State for War in the ninth paragraph of my Notice.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01546">To sum up these three sources of supply, from Third Battalions Special Reserve four per battalion we get 296, from Supplementary Reserve we get 56, from the General Reserve we get 167, a total of 519, to meet a deficit of 900, leaving a shortage of 381. This deficit of 381 presented no difficulties to the late Secretary of State for War, because he was prepared to overcome it by unlimited promotion from the ranks. He recommended that course on the ground that Wellington mobilised with non-commissioned officers. I can find no record of any such action having been taken by the Duke of Wellington previous to the embarkation of his forces for the Peninsular Campaign. I pointed this out to the late Secretary of State for War in May, and he assured us that he would make inquiries among those learned in these things, and if he could get any light on the subject he would communicate with me. I have not heard since on this point from the noble and
<col>554</col>
learned Viscount on the Woolsack. The noble and learned Viscount must allow that the presumption is strongly against any wholesale promotions having been made from. the non-commissioned ranks by the Duke of Wellington, and that at a moment when he was not Commander-in-Chief. In 1809&#x2014;that is the time to which the noble and learned Viscount must allude&#x2014;purchase prevailed in the Army, and the value of an Ensign's Commission was from&#x00A3;1,500 to&#x00A3;2,000. If the Duke of Wellington had ever granted commissions to non-commissioned officers with a liberal hand previous to the embarkation of the Army for service it would have been an infringement of the prerogative of the Commander-in-Chief, which must have attracted considerable attention. I hope that the noble and learned Viscount will either establish his precedent or admit that there is no precedent at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01547">The late Secretary of State for War told us that he was not only going to promote non-commissioned officers for his Line battalions but also for all Special Reserve battalions, three per battalion. That means 303 for the Special Reserve and 381 for the Line &#x2014;a total of 684. We have been told by the present Secretary of State for War that lists of non-commissioned officers qualified for promotion are all ready at the War Office. It seems then that when the order to mobilise is flashed from Whitehall, at once upwards of 700 non-commissioned officers are to be promoted to commissioned rank. I wonder what the Government think will be the effect of that order, or whether they have ever thought about it at all. No doubt the commissioned rank will be strengthened, but it is equally certain that it will be done at the expense of the non-commissioned rank. Can the noble Lord opposite assure us that the total efficiency of the Infantry battalions will be increased and not diminished by such a weakening of the non-commissioned rank? It is an easy matter to sew two stripes on to the sleeves of 700 private soldiers and call them corporals. It is still easier to add a third stripe to the sleeves of 700 corporals and call them lance-sergeants. It is when you come to promoting sergeant-majors by the score and colour-sergeants by the hundred at the moment of mobilisation that you must play havoc with the interior economy and discipline of battalions, and that on the eve of a great campaign. The late Secretary of State told us&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0282"/>
<col>555</col>
<quote>"We have always been able to maintain great elasticity in the supply of non-commissioned officers, and the Reserve is sufficiently large to enable us to make up the slight depletion which the promotion of these non-commissioned officers would occasion."</quote>
It is interesting to know that the promotion of upwards of 700 non-commisisoned officers was considered by the late Secretary of State for War to be a slight depletion of the non-commissioned rank.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01548">I submit that I have shown that by Peace Establishments and War Establishments, and by the Army List, and by making the lowest possible allowance which common sense tells us must be made for temporary unfitness and for officers withdrawn for aviation work, there will be a shortage of 900 Infantry officers on mobilisation. There is one more addition to make. I note that by War Establishments one officer per battalion is required for the base overseas. On May 13 the late Secretary of State for War alluded to the time "when the Expeditionary Force would leave these shores complete in every particular as regards officers." Consequently 78 more officers must be embarked for this duty, giving a total shortage of 978 Infantry officers required for the embarkation of the Expeditionary Force. It is certain that the only plan which the late Secretary of State had for making good this shortage was an unlimited promotion from the ranks, oblivious of the fatal effect of such a measure on that vital third estate, the noncommissioned rank. It is true that the late Secretary of State for War believed on May 13 that the total shortage would be 666 and not 978. I beg to call the attention of the Government to the discrepancy between the figures used by the late Secretary of State for War in this House and the figures published by the War Office. It is certain that no profitable discussion on Army matters can be carried on in your Lordships' House or elsewhere so long as a Secretary of State for War uses one set of figures and the War Office another. I beg to inquire of the Government whether we may now calculate upon the figures as supplied by the War Office as regards shortage of Infantry officers and not on those used by the late Secretary of State for War, and to ask the Questions standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01549"><i>Moved,</i> That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty for Papers relating to the Expeditionary Force.&#x2014;(<i>The Duke of Bedford</i>).</p>
<col>556</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01550"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: My. Lords, the Questions which stand in the noble Duke's name do not open any very new ground, as they deal with the two principal and main points which he mentioned&#x2014;namely, the amount of deficiency which has to be made up on mobilisation owing to the difference between peace establishment and war establishment, and the methods which are to be employed in order to make up that deficiency. Taking first of all Paragraph 4 on the Paper, the statement of the late Secretary of State for War is perfectly correct&#x2014;that on March 1 last the actual shortage in the Infantry battalions of the Expeditionary Force, after deducting the officers required for Staff and extra-regimental appointments, was 666; and I think I shall be able to show that the majority of the numbers which the noble Duke has in his calculations added to the 666 had been already included in that number. Returning to Paragraph 1 of the noble Duke's Notice, the figures there quoted by the noble Duke were given in answer to specific Questions which he asked, and the deficiency of 575 at which he arrives through them is accurate; but since the date upon which they were given one subaltern has been added to the establishment of each Regular Line battalion at home&#x2014;that is 74 in all&#x2014;which therefore reduces the figure of 575. In addition, the figure of 1,998 which is quoted in Paragraph 1 did not include a considerable number of supernumerary officers who were awaiting vacancies in their regiments, into which they can be absorbed after vacating extra-regimental appointments for which they have been seconded. Therefore these two sources must be deducted from the 575. The total deficiency, including Staff and extra-regimental appointments, was, on March 1, 666.<lb/>
In Question 5 (A) the noble Duke is perfectly correct in his statement as to the one subaltern per battalion who is to act as transport officer and the one who is to act as signalling officer. It is not considered that this arrangement will materially affect the efficiency of the Expeditionary Force on mobilisation, but at the same time it is recognised that the practice is not a desirable one and the matter is receiving attention. Passing now to Paragraph 5 (C), these officers are allowed for in the 666; with regard to 5 (D) the matter has somewhat changed owing to the formation of a separate signal service, of which the organisation has been
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0283"/>
<col>557</col>
published in the Army Order of May 2. In this new service the place of the officers to whom the noble Duke refers in Paragraph 5 (D) will be taken by officers in the new organisation, who will therefore not be borne on the peace or the war strength of any battalion. Then I come to Paragraph 5 (E). Here, again, these officers are included in the 666. May I read the context which immediately preceded the remark quoted in Paragraph 4 of the noble Duke's Notice? The late Secretary of State said&#x2014;
<quote>"The noble Duke spoke first of the deficiency of 600 Regular Infantry officers, excluding Staff, on the mobilisation of the Regular Infantry of the six Divisions of the Expeditionary Force. He asked what would be the deficiency, including Stall. My answer to that is that the actual shortage in the Infantry battalions of the Expeditionary Force on March 1 last, after deducting the officers required for Staff and extra-regimental appointments, was 666."</quote>
The answer is, as I have said, that Lord Haldane was right, and that the 666 does include Staff and extra-regimental appointments.<lb/>
Then with regard to Paragraph 6 (A), it is not considered necessary to make deductions on this account. The officers who would be unfit for active service would not be many in number, and of that number a large proportion, though not fit for active service, would probably be sufficiently fit to undertake the duties now performed by Regular officers with Special Reserve battalions, who in their turn would replace the officers withdrawn from Regular units of the Expeditionary Force owing to sickness. With regard to Paragraph 6 (B), this was dealt with by Lord Haldane in the debate of May 15, when he said&#x2014;
<quote>"We shall have to recruit more officers to meet the demands which aviation is making, and we are proceeding to do so."</quote>
The actual amount of the shortage is, of course, very difficult to estimate, because the Royal Flying Corps is not homogeneously composed of Regular officers, and those Regular officers who had to be seconded for flying duties in war would not necessarily belong to the Expeditionary Force. The Flying Corps, of course, contains Territorial Force officers, Special Reserve officers, and others, and there is also the fact that a certain number of civilians are to be enlisted direct as officers in the Royal Flying Corps. The question,
<col>558</col>
therefore, of the actual amount of shortage in this connection is somewhat in the air. But at present officers who are with the Flying Corps in peace are being seconded in their units. With regard to Paragraph 7, owing to the fact that a great number of the additions which the noble Duke has made have already been included in the 666 the figure 900 is obviously wrong; and with regard to Paragraph 7 (B), these officers have also been allowed for in the 666.<lb/>
Now I come to what is really the second portion of the noble Duke's Questions. Leaving for the moment No. 8, I will take No. 9 (A), (B), and (C). The noble Duke is correct in these three statements (A), (B), and (C), except, of course, with regard again to the figure of 900 in (C). With regard to Paragraph 10, the number of 381, which is obtained by deducting (A), (B) and (C) from 900, is not correct because the figure of 900 is not correct. It is intended on mobilisation to promote a certain number of non-commissioned officers in the Expeditionary Force and also to promote a certain number of non-commissioned officers in the Special Reserve. Though it is not, perhaps, a very important point, the number of three in the Special Reserve which the noble Duke takes was really a hypothetical number in the late Secretary of State's speech, for if the noble Duke will refer to what Lord Haldane said on May 13 he will see the words, "<i>If</i> we grant commissions to three non-commissioned officers." The fact remains that a certain number of noncommissioned officers will have to be promoted in both the Expeditionary Force and the Special Reserve. As regards the Expeditionary Force, the number who will be promoted will be distinctly limited&#x2014;limited, that is to say, in each battalion; and in no case will such a number be taken from any one battalion as would impair that battalion's efficiency with regard to non-commissioned officers on mobilisation. I may further state that although, of course, it is quite impossible to say which noncommissioned officers would be promoted on mobilisation, at the same time the commanding officer knows which noncommissioned officers he has recommended for promotion, and therefore it is open to him to take such steps as he may think fit, in order to place other non-commissioned officers in a position to fill the vacancies which will be caused by promotions on mobilisation.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0284"/>
<col>559</col>
The deficiency arises on mobilisation when peace establishment is suddenly changed to war establishment, and when the Staff and other extra-regimental appointments are increased. This is common to all armies and I am authorised to say that this deficiency can be met successfully so as to ensure the Expeditionary Force being fully complete with officers. But, of course, once this is done we are faced with a difficulty with regard to the Special Reserve&#x2014;that is to say, there is a shortage of officers in the Special Reserve. There is no desire to disguise this fact. On the contrary, the fact has been so well recognised that machinery has been actually set up which it is hoped will gradually remedy this deficiency, but the machinery is as yet only in its infancy, and one must, therefore, be rather chary of judging of its results as yet. I allude, of course, to the Officers Training Corps, which was instituted in 1908. Endeavours are being made to induce members of the Officers Training Corps to take commissions in the General Reserve, and already some fifty gentlemen have agreed to do this, and this number will increase each year as more become available; and also an endeavour is being made to form a list of non-commissioned officers who during their service have been recommended for commissions and whose period of service elapsed without any emergency having taken place. These will form a valuable addition on mobilisation. At the same time there is no use disguising the fact that this shortage occurs in the Special Reserve, and the Secretary of State has asked me to-day to express the gratification with which he heard the statement of Mr. Wyndham in another place last night, in which he said&#x2014;
<quote>"I beg the Government to address itself, and I promise it the support of the Opposition if it does address itself, to making up the deficiency in the Special Reserve."</quote>
And, of course, any such expression of opinion in your Lordships' House would also be welcomed. But before leaving this question of the Special Reserve, may I quote a few figures to show what are really the potentialities of the Officers Training Corps? The strength of the Corps is approximately 25,000; 5,019 certificates A and 710 certificates B have been earned; 380 cadets have taken commissions in the Special Reserve of Officers, and 716 have become officers in the Territorial Force.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01551"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: How many in the Special Reserve apart from the Special Reserve of Officers I am drawing a distinction between the officers belonging to Special Reserve battalions and officers of the Special Reserve who are attached to no unit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01552"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: I have not the actual figure with me, but I will let the noble Marquess have it later. It is anticipated that these numbers will be considerably increased when the Officers Training Corps has been in existence long enough for cadets to have fully benefited by it&#x2014;that is to say, in two or three years' time. There are 18,000 ex-cadets who have not taken commissions, many of whom would no doubt come forward if necessary. A certain number of them would be fit for immediate service in the Territorial Force or Special Reserve, and steps are being taken to impress upon parents and guardians the importance of cadets taking commissions in peace time and thus being able to take the place of officers in war. In a word, the whole position is this. The deficiency in officers which arises owing to the difference between peace establishment and war establishment can be made up so as to complete the Expeditionary Force on mobilisation, but the making up of this deficiency will deplete the Special Reserve and there will be a great shortage of officers. In order to meet this new deficiency the machinery of the Officers Training Corps and of the other sources which I mentioned has been set up, and it is not possible at present to judge of the real outcome of this machinery. We must wait until it has really had time to be more fully developed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01553"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount the late Secretary of State for War accepted as substantially accurate the number of 600 as the shortage without Staff. Then he gave 666 as the shortage with Staff. That is an addition of 66. In every battalion one officer is withdrawn to act as a transport officer and one as a signalling officer&#x2014;namely, two per battalion. That makes 156 to go out, without Brigade and Divisional Staff. It is excessively difficult to reconcile the figures of the late Secretary of State for War with those supplied in War Office Returns. Am I to understand that it is proposed to send out officers belonging to the Officers Training Corps with the Expeditionary Force?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01556"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: They would supply the shortage in the Special Reserve, not in the Expeditionary Force.

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01557"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: It is evident that the source by which the deficiency will be filled is an unlimited promotion of non-commissioned officers.</membercontribution></p>

Neither of these things is true. The Officers Training Corps is not a new force; it is only an old force with a new name. The noble Lord knows perfectly well that school cadet corps have existed for thirty or forty years, and that the Officers Training Corps is nothing more than the old school cadet corps, in which most of us have served and in which I have no doubt the noble Lord himself served years ago. There is no more reason why the members of this school cadet corps should join the Special Reserve or the Territorial Force than there was when he and I served in our school cadet corps under a different name. I do not think it is fair towards the public of this country, who have not the opportunity of knowing the facts, to pretend that the Officers Training Corps is a source from which we can draw 25,000 officers in the moment of emergency.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01559"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think some contradiction should be given to the statement just made by Lord Ampthill.

It is all very well for the noble Lord to say that they are the old cadet corps, but we know they are not. They are very much superior; they are older men, and they have carried their military education very much further. As to the number of non-commissioned officers to be promoted on mobilisation, the figures given by the Government are&#x2014;296 from the Special Reserve, 50 from the Supplementary Reserve, and 107 from the General Reserve&#x2014;519 in all. The noble Duke says that in addition we should require 381 non-commissioned officers, but it appears from the figures that we require only an additional 81 and not 381. That is a very important correction. It is clear that though the noble Duke's figures are industriously prepared he has made mistakes by including Staff officers twice over.</membercontribution></p>

I do not myself think that any County Association will deliberately act contrary to the Act. As far as I personally am concerned, I can endorse what has been said by other noble Lords, that I shall do all I can to see that those whom I employ get the full benefits of the Act. But there is considerable doubt as to the position of County Associations. As far as I remember, the penal clauses of the Act were passed without any discussion at all, and we have had from the Chancellor of the Exchequer certain threats of putting
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0286"/>

the penal clauses into force if anybody acts contrary to the Act. The position with regard to County Associations is this, that they have not really mastered what is incumbent upon them under the Act; and what I have been asked to find out from the Government is, in the event of action being taken by County Associations contrary to the Act or in the event of no action being taken, against whom will proceedings be instituted and in what way will the Act be enforced? I own that I have some personal interest in the matter as I am both President and Chairman of a County Association, and I am not quite sure that I shall not be the one against whom action might be taken.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01568"><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: I think I can answer the Question to the noble Earl's satisfaction. If the members of the Territorial Force are insured their contributions will continue to be payable during the period of training, the men's share being deducted from their pay and the Crown paying the employer's share. As regards persons employed by County Associations as clerks, caretakers, and such like, the Associations are responsible in the same manner as are ordinary employers. If County Associations find any difficulty in carrying out their duties under the Act, the Insurance Commissioners will assist them. That is to say, the Commissioners do not wish to fine County Associations or their chairmen for any small inaccuracies through misapprehension, but will assist the Associations to rectify matters. On the other hand, if an Association wilfully refuses to pay what is required by the Act it will, like any other corporate body, be liable to prosecution.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Earl said: This Question also deals with public bodies, but I hope I shall not be understood to have desired to draw any comparison between lunatic asylums and the Departments of the Government. I merely instance lunatic asylums as employing a good many people, and it does seem to me that it would help public bodies of that character very materially if the Government, who, of course, have to deal with their own employees in much the same way, would draw up a set of simple rules which would assist them in making their regulations.</p>

<title>BRITISH INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01575"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member> rose to ask the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies what is the present position in regard to the question of the treatment of British Indians in South Africa, and whether it is intended to present any further Papers to Parliament in the near future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01576">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am not going to take up your Lordships' time with a speech, but I must say a few words of explanation with regard to the Question which stands in my name. I am obliged to put this Question because there was no opportunity in another place for those interested in this supremely important question of the treatment of British Indians in South Africa to elicit information from the Secretary of State. Your Lordships will remember that the Secretary of State took the members of the House of Commons for a tour round the Crown Colonies, which was so interesting and protracted that there was not opportunity to go further. Those of us who have for some years past been interested in this question are feeling very grave anxiety at the present time. Our anxiety is due to two causes&#x2014;in the first place, that the settlement which was promised so long ago, promised so definitely and so hopefully by the late Secretary of State for the Colonies, has again been postponed; and, in the second place, that the management of that settlement is now in other hands. General Smuts, who was Minister for the Interior, was personally pledged to carry out a settlement which, as we believe, had been agreed upon as satisfactory, not only by the Indian community in South Africa, but also by His Majesty's Government and by the Government of India. But now, unfortunately, the Bill has been postponed, and the office of Minister of the Interior is in other hands&#x2014;in the hands, I believe, of Mr. Fischer, who unfortunately we know to be, I will only put it this way, less amicably disposed towards the British Indian community than was General Smuts. We should like to know most particularly whether the fact that there is a new Minister of the Interior will make any difference as regards the settlement, and also, of course, why exactly it has been found necessary to postpone this settlement.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01577">Your Lordships will remember that more than a year ago we were assured most
<col>566</col>
confidently and hopefully by the noble Marquess the Leader of the House, who was then Secretary of State, that the settlement was close at hand, that he was really confident it would be brought about. Perhaps I may remind your Lordships what that settlement was. The essence of the settlement was the repeal of the Transvaal Act No. 2 of 1907, which was so hurtful to the feelings of our Indian fellow citizens in South Africa. That Act, which served no useful purpose and only acted as a humiliation and a soreness to the Indians in South Africa, was to be repealed, while the rights of minors were to be safeguarded and the principle of the restriction of Asiatic immigration&#x2014;to which the Indians themselves assented and which they recognised as inevitable and reasonable even&#x2014;was to be that there should be no racial bar on the Statutes of the Colony. That was the one thing they had been contending for&#x2014;that Indians should not be excluded on account of their colour. "If you must exclude us," they said, "let it be by administrative differentiation. Do it because it is a matter of economic convenience, but do not do it on the ostensible ground that you think we belong to an inferior race." We had hoped that the settlement might have been brought about long ago. It has been twice postponed. Therefore the first thing I want to know is what are the exact causes of the postponement, and then I should like to know whether His Majesty's Government are satisfied that the Bill which has recently been before the Union Parliament does actually fulfil those conditions of settlement to which I have referred. I know that there are competent lawyers in South Africa who say that it does not fulfil those simple and plain conditions, but that the racial bar is maintained in another form. What is the opinion of His Majesty's Government on that point? And supposing they are not satisfied, what steps have they taken, are they taking, or are they going to take to set that right?</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01578">Then it is also alleged&#x2014;I speak subject-to correction, but it is one of the points on which I am asking the noble Lord for information&#x2014;that this Bill does deprive-Indians in the Coast Provinces of rights which they have hitherto held undisputed. Is that the case or not? His Majesty's Government, in the Despatch of October, 1910, I think it was, said that no settlement of the Transvaal Indian trouble would be acceptable if it diminished the rights of
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0288"/>
<col>567</col>
Indians in other provinces. All along it was the profession of the South African Government, long before the Union, that they did not wish to diminish the rights of Indians who were already lawfully resident in that country. Lord Selborne, when he was High Commissioner, made that the keynote of his statements on the subject. He said he did not wish in any way to treat Indians who were lawfully resident in the country one whit less well than they had been treated before. The only thing he stuck out for was that no more were to be admitted, with the reasonable exception, which has been agreed to now by all parties, that the few educated men who are required for the natural life of the community, as ministers of religion, as doctors, and as lawyers, should be admitted. The number of six per annum was given as a probably reasonable limit, to the requirements of the community. I hope it is not the case that after competent examination it has been found that this new Bill does actually diminish the existing rights of Indians in the country, because if that were so it would be a very grave and unpardonable breach of faith. I trust, therefore, that we shall hear that His Majesty's Government have examined very carefully into that point and have been in friendly communications with the Union Government about it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01579">But there is one more word which I must say in order to explain the object of my Question, and that is, that the spirit of this settlement, which we were told was so near at hand, seems to have been violated during this period of delay. It was because we were allowed to expect that there would be an immediate settlement that the Indian community themselves agreed to drop their passive resistance movement. It was because we were told that a settlement was at hand that friends of the Indian community in this country stayed their hand and have since shown considerable reticence and self-restraint. We have waited most patiently, we have not bothered the Government with Questions and Motions in Parliament, we have treated them with very considerable trust and confidence and have waited patiently for a long time before asking them again what they were doing in regard to this question. I say that advantage has been taken of this delay to violate the spirit of the settlement. The spirit of the settlement was to treat
<col>568</col>
Indians who were lawfully resident in the country as well as possible. I must show what I mean by quoting some instances. In the first place, the Transvaal Supreme Court have taken a very serious course in deciding against the introduction of plural wives married according to the law of Islam, and there has been a notorious case in which it has been decided that the second wife of a Mahomedan cannot be admitted into the Transvaal. It is going further than that. It seems to me to be part of a very deliberate movement, for there is now an attempt to secure a decision against the admission of Mahomedan wives at all into the country on the ground that polygamous marriages are not recognised by the Transvaal law. From there it would only be a step to declare that the offspring of these marriages are. illegitimate. I need not enlarge upon that point. I need only appeal to your Lordships' imagination. Your Lordships have only to think for a moment what the consequences would he in India, in Egypt, in every part of the Empire where there are thousands of His Majesty's loyal Mahomedan subjects, if an affront, an insult, of this kind were levelled at the Mahomedan religion. Surely the whole spirit of rule under the British flag wherever it was flown has been religious toleration. There seems to me absolutely no ground for departure from that principle, and surely whatever the risk may be it is the duty of His Majesty's Government to uphold that principle wherever there are British citizens under the British flag. That is a very serious matter. Apart from everything else, a necessary question, if the movement is allowed to continue, is the breaking up of homes, the wives not being allowed to come in or being turned out of the country, the separation of families, the ruin of business, the expulsion of men whose right to be in the country has never been questioned, and consequences which I leave to the imagination of any one of your Lordships who will take the trouble to give the matter a thought. I want to know what His Majesty's Government have done in regard to this decision of the Supreme Court of the Transvaal. Have they pointed out how fatal would be the consequences of carrying this movement any further? Have they protested? What has been the nature of their protest, and what answer have they received?</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01580">There is another matter, and that is the growing tendency on the part of the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0289"/>
<col>569</col>
immigration officers to exercise arbitrary power. On one case I had occasion to correspond with the Colonial Office, but I got very little satisfaction. That case showed this, that even if an Indian can prove his right to be in the country to the satisfaction of the Supreme Court, it is within the power of the immigration officer to keep him out. That was proved by the decision in that particular case. It is said&#x2014;I want to know whether it is the case or not&#x2014;that the present Bill increases the arbitrary powers of the immigration officers. General Smuts, in introducing the Bill, did make some sort of apology for what he regarded as the occasional excesses on the part of the immigration officers. On a par with this action of the immigration officers is the exclusion of children of lawful residents in the country by the Portuguese officials at Mozambique at the instance of the Immigration Department of the Union. What has been the consequence of this? It is a very serious consequence, and I cannot understand for the life of me why more notice has not been taken of it. The result is that the Germans are imitating our example. In German East Africa they are proposing anti-Indian legislation on the ground that we are pursuing the same course. What will be our position as a nation before the people of India if we are obliged to confess that we cannot protest against this exclusion by a foreign country because it is merely what we are doing ourselves? There are other matters which are serious enough, though they are smaller. For instance, the growing tendency to exercise the trade licensing laws in Natal with the apparent object of making it impossible for Indians to have a right to be in Natal, whose right has never been questioned, with the object of compelling them to leave the country. The same is being done, during this period of delay of which I have spoken, with the Townships Act in the Transvaal and the Gold Law. The tendency of the regulations, which seem to be unlawful regulations, under that Act is to force Indians into locations. I should have thought that His Majesty's Government, of all people, would instantly object to and resent any attempt to force Indians into locations. That was the test of Chinese slavery. The one test was that Chinese labourers were obliged to live in locations. What, then, is the Government's answer to and their justification of this deliberate tendency to force Indians into locations?</p>
<col>570</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01581">I could give scores of instances of the I way in which advantage has been taken of this Bill to oppress&#x2014;there is no other word&#x2014;the lawful Indian residents in the Transvaal. What I want to know is whether. His Majesty's Government have been taking note of these oppressive acts, whether they have done anything to protect His Majesty's subjects, our Indian fellow subjects, who are in South Africa and have every right to be there, whose right has never been questioned. I emphasise that because it is not a case of immigrants who have forced their way in without permission. I do hope the noble Lord who is going to answer me will not give that answer which I have often heard before, and which I dare say the occupants of the Front Bench opposite think good enough for me. It is not good enough for those on whose behalf I speak. It is not good enough for anybody who regards this question from the point of view of common sense and the interests of the Empire as apart from the ordinary devices of political Parties in Parliament. That answer is that you cannot interfere with a self-governing Colony. That seems to be satisfying to many people, but it is a rotten answer, a stupid answer. In the first place, there is no question of interference. Let me remind you of the Malecka case. If you can interfere with the Government of a foreign country, over which you cannot possibly exercise any compulsion, in order to secure the reversal of the acts of a Court of Justice on behalf of one single person who was only half a British citizen if she was a British citizen at all, then surely you have a right to do something, to say something, to make a bargain, to come to an understanding, about thousands of persons who are wholly British citizens, and to make that understanding with people who are your own national kinsmen, who are under the British flag, who are under the authority of our Sovereign, and with whom&#x2014;and that is the point&#x2014;we have absolutely vital interests in common. If you cannot come to an agreement with our kinsmen in our Dominions oversea about matters which concern the whole welfare of the Empire, then I say that the Empire itself cannot have any existence in fact.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01582">I wish to Heaven that I had the power or the knowledge which would enable me to create public opinion and propitiate those wizards of the Press who, for good or for evil, influence our destinies in the same
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0290"/>
<col>571</col>
way as opinion was created and the Press were propitiated in regard to the Malecka case. Ten thousand times more justification has there been during the last five years in the case of our Indian fellow-subjects in the Transvaal; and if the pressure which I refer to in the Malecka case was potent to move the Government in this country to action, to oblige them to interfere with a foreign country over whom we have no power of control, how much more, had I known the trick, would it have been possible to move them into action in regard to our Indian fellow-subjects in the Transvaal? I hope I have made it clear to the noble Lord what are the exact points on which I wish to have an answer.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01583"><sup>*</sup><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (LORD EMMOTT)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am quite sure that those of your Lordships who have taken an interest in South Africa can feel no surprise that the noble Lord opposite has put this Question to me before the House adjourns, as I hope it will do, early in August. Whatever might be said in another place it would be quite natural that a Question should also be put here, particularly by the noble Lord who has for so long taken an interest in this subject. The noble Lord has covered an enormous amount of ground, and if I were to go through the whole of it in detail I am afraid that our sitting would be very prolonged. I will, however, answer a great many of the points he has raised, but I am sure in the circumstances he will allow me to do so as briefly as possible.<lb/>
The noble Lord referred at the end of his speech to the stereotyped answer, of which he says he has become rather tired, that we cannot interfere with a self-governing Colony, and he raised the Malecka case as an instance of our interfering, as he called it, with a powerful foreign Government. I really do not see the analogy between that case and many of these individual cases with which we have to deal. The noble Lord says that this answer that we cannot interfere with a self-governing Colony is a "rotten and stupid" answer, and that we have a right to interfere as regards thousands of cases as we had a right to interfere in the case of Miss Malecka. I carefully stated, on the last occasion on which we were discussing this question, what the policy of His Majesty's Government is. I stated that we always considered every case that
<col>572</col>
came before us, and that where we thought we had a right to intervene and that intervention would be useful we exercised our right, but I added that we were not going to be urged into a policy of constant nagging which would defeat its own end and only cause irritation without giving us any right really to remedy matters ourselves. If the noble Lord desires that all these individual cases&#x2014;and in some of them I do think there has been reason for complaint&#x2014;in regard to which the complaint arises are to be made the subject of representations, then I say, if that is to be the policy, we must wait until the noble Lord's friends come into power, and let him press his policy on them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01584"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: Nothing was further from my thoughts than to suggest that we should interfere in every case. I thought my language was perfectly clear. It was simply to the effect that we should make representations on the general tendency of the treatment of the whole Indian community.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01585"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EMMOTT</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord knows enough of official life to be aware that we cannot collect a number of cases and deal with them under general terms. We must deal with each case on its merits. We do deal with every complaint that is made to us, and wherever we think that intervention would be useful and that we have a right to intervene we exercise that right. The principal question of interest during recent months in South Africa has been the question of the Immigration Bill. In December last, on a day which I remember very well because it was the first day on which I had the honour of addressing your Lordships' House, I stated that correspondence in regard to the Immigration Bill was proceeding, and although the time had not yet come we would consider whether Papers could be laid in regard to it at some future date. The noble Lord is well aware that the Union Government introduced an Immigration Bill again this year. That Bill closely resembled the Bill of last year. It would have removed the differential bar about which he spoke, and which is the principal cause of complaint on the part of British Indians. Unfortunately the Government has not been able to carry that Bill during the session which has just closed. The noble Lord asked me why they had not passed it. I am afraid that is a rather difficult question for me to answer.
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0291"/>
<col>573</col>
We are not without instances in this country of a rather overcrowded program me which prevents the Government from carrying all the Bills that it foreshadows in the King's Speech. There has been a great mass of legislation before the South African Parliament, and no doubt one of the reasons must be the great pressure on their time during the very prolonged session that has recently come to a close. The noble Lord asked me also about another matter connected with the change of posts in the Union Government. I really cannot answer that question. It is not my place to express an opinion as to whether one man is more favourable to the views of the noble Lord and another less favourable. It would be highly improper, I think, for me to do so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01586"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: That is not the point. Has the Colonial Office had any information to the effect that Mr. Fischer is pledged in the same way personally as was General Smuts?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01587"><member>LORD EMMOTT</member><membercontribution>: No information occurs to me that has reached the Colonial Office as regards any pledge given on this particular question by Mr. Fischer as opposed to General Smuts. They have both been members of the same Government for some time, and I presume their policy in this matter is the same. I can assure the noble Lord that we have positive proof that Ministers were most anxious to secure the passage of this Bill. I need not say how keenly His Majesty's Government regret the failure to carry this Bill this year. We have made known our regret to the Governor-General, and Union Ministers have, in reply, promised to introduce a Bill to deal with the question at the earliest possible date next session. In these circumstances I think it would be useful if I promise to lay Papers dealing with this question of the Immigration Bill and bringing up to date the correspondence of which your Lordships have already had an earlier edition in Command Paper No. 5579.<lb/>
It remains for me to deal with one or two of the particular questions of complaint which were raised by the noble Lord opposite. He asked me about the terms of the Immigration Bill of this session which has failed to pass. All I can say is that we considered the terms of that measure generally satisfactory. He made some reference to one or two matters which I rather failed to grasp. I suspect that one of them had reference to the question of the
<col>574</col>
Orange River State. If that was not the object of the noble Lord's question I do not quite know what he meant. At any rate, there is no legislation proposed in the Immigration Bill which would be worse for British Indians in the Orange River State than the law at present in force there.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01588"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: What about other provinces?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01589"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EMMOTT</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Lord will state a little more specifically what information he wants I will endeavour to reply. The noble Lord complained of what he calls the conditions of the bargain which led up to the stoppage of passive resistance being violated in spirit, and he cited a number of matters on which he thinks there is cause for complaint. He cited the decision of the Supreme Court on the question of a second wife coming into the country. That is not a question of administration at all, but a question of legal decision. I am sure, the noble Lord will agree with me that many of the legal decisions given by the Supreme and other Courts in South Africa have been very much in favour of British Indians, and I do not think the decision of the Supreme Court in this particular case ought to be made the ground of a general charge of a departure from the spirit of the compromise entered into at the time when passive resistance was stopped. I may say that in this matter of polygamous marriages there is no change whatever in South Africa. South African law has never recognised any other system than monogamy, and therefore, although the amount of religious toleration there may differ somewhat in quality or quantity from what we have here, there is nothing new at all in the law with regard to monogamy and polygamy. Therefore, my Lords, I think you will understand that His Majesty's Government do not consider that there is any ground for protest in regard to this particular decision of what the law is at the present time in South Africa.<lb/>
With regard to the Nathalia case, to which he referred and on which he made representations to the Colonial Office, the noble Lord rightly and naturally attaches great importance to the question of an appeal on domicile. That is a matter that we have been trying to obtain for a long time whenever any opportunity has offered. All I can say is that an amendment was promised to the Immigration Bill by
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0292"/>
<col>575</col>
Ministers which would have given an appeal on questions of domicile, and that amendment would really have been of very great value, and one which His Majesty's Government would have welcomed. With regard to the other points, the noble Lord mentioned the question of detention in Mozambique, a matter which he raised last February. It is the fact that from the day when the noble Lord raised that question to the present moment we have received no protest in regard to the matter, and I presume and hope from that fact that matters are now proceeding satisfactorily in regard to this particular question in the Mozambique province. On that point, therefore, I have no information, and I am inclined to hope, from the fact that we have no information, that the complaint of administration which was made by the noble Lord is at any rate no longer justified.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01590"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: I did not bring forward those various points as complaints. I simply gave them as instances in the past of the way in which the spirit of the settlement had been violated. I quoted them merely as instances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01591"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EMMOTT</member><membercontribution>: If so, I hope I may suggest to the noble Lord that the absence of complaint in regard to these or similar matters shows that the spirit of the law is not being departed from in regard to them at the present time, unless incidents are going on of which we know nothing. The noble Lord mentioned the trade licensing laws in Natal. That is a matter about which His Majesty's Government corresponded with South Africa, and the result of that correspondence was that a law was passed giving existing holders of licences an appeal to the Court in regard to any question of deprivation of licences. I need not repeat that we regret very much that the Immigration Bill has not been passed into law. I will lay Papers with regard to the matter, and those Papers will, I think, include a promise that a Bill on this question will be introduced as early as possible in the next session of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>

<title>A SECRETARY FOR INDIAN STUDENTS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01592"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member> rose to ask the Secretary of State for India whether it is a fact that a new post has been created at the India Office in connection with the supervision of Indian students in this country, to which a former Member of Parliament has been appointed, and if so, what are the
<col>576</col>
duties attached to the post and the conditions of the appointment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01593">The noble Lord said: The noble Marquess the Leader of the House asked me to postpone this Question, not on the ground that he would not be in the House this evening, but on other grounds. I have often postponed Questions and Motions out of deference to the noble Marquess, but I really did not think it was necessary to do so to-day because it is merely a question as to fact. I ask whether this new post has been created or not. If it has not been created the answer is No; if it has been created the answer is Yes. Surely it does not want some weeks of delay to give me that answer, and surely if the post has been created some decision has been come to as to the object of the post, and there can be no difficulty in telling me why the post has been created. I have something to do semi-officially with this question of Indian students, and I have no official information about this post, and I have been asked by those with whom I have to work what it is? It is to obtain this information that I ask this Question.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01594"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad to be able to give the noble Lord the information for which he asks. As stated in the Question, it is the fact that the Secretary of State in Council has created a new appointment on the establishment of the India Office with the designation of Secretary for Indian Students. It is intended that the appointment should be permanent and pensionable, and the salary attached to it is&#x00A3;1,000 a year. Mr. C. E. Mallet has been selected to be the first holder of the post. The Secretary for Indian Students will be responsible for official correspondence with Advisory Committees in India, and with Universities and professional authorities in the United Kingdom. Generally, he will undertake such work for the benefit of Indian Students in this country as the Secretary of State may determine. The London Agency at 21, Cromwell-road, will remain under the direct charge of Mr. T. W. Arnold, who will henceforth be styled the Educational Adviser to Indian Students in London.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01595"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Has Mr. Mallet any personal acquaintance with India, or had any service there? We know that a number of gentlemen return from India in the prime of life whose services have been

of great value to the India Office. One would like to be assured that this gentleman has some knowledge of India. Otherwise one would be afraid that a more competent man for this particular work in connection with students might have been found.</membercontribution></p>

Provided that in the application of those provisions the period of forty-two years shall be substitutes for the period of twenty-one years therein mentioned.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01645">This Bill provides, among other things, for the making of tramways inside and outside the city of Glasgow, and General Order No. 130, under the Procedure Act, repeats the Standing Orders of both Houses of Parliament. The effect of that is that if any local authority makes a. tramway outside its own particular area the Commissioners have to put in powers to the outside authority through whose area the tramway goes to purchase the tramway within a certain period. The Commissioners have
<col>582</col>
inserted Clause 7 to carry out this particular Order, but it has been represented to the Commissioners that, under previous legislation on the same lines, the Glasgow Corporation in the years 1901, 1904 and 1905 had this provision omitted. Therefore the Commissioners have recommended to the Secretary for Scotland that, having regard to these precedents, to the relative unimportance of the intended outside lines, and to the advantages of uniformity, these tramways should be exempt from the operation of Section 43 of the Tramways Act, 1870, and they recommend that the clause in question be deleted. The Secretary for Scotland approves the recommendation, and I therefore move to leave out the clause.</p>

I remember that some years ago when I was sitting on either a Scottish Commission or a Committee the Glasgow Corporation made a similar proposal. They were proposing to construct tramways in the district of another authority, and they proposed that the other authority should be deprived of the power which all local authorities possess of purchasing the tramway after a certain time. Glasgow thus stretches out its feelers into the surrounding district and obtains a foundation for a claim at some future period to annex that district. On that occasion we came to the conclusion that there was no reason for interfering with the existing law. I do not know anything of the circumstances of the case now before the House, but I should very much like to hear what the Lord Chairman has to say.

<title>THE TAXATION OF LAND VALUES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01660"><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government for information with regard to the unofficial Committee which has been formed for the purpose of investigating the question of land reform; and farther to inquire into the special qualifications of the members of the Committee for the purposes of this inquiry.</p>
<col>584</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01661">The noble Lord said: My Lords, in anything I have to say to-night I will spare you any comments of my own on the past or present taxation or rating of land. As Mr. Gladstone wrote to Lord Tennyson&#x2014;
<quote>"Taxation and all that belongs to it forms rather a painful chapter in human affairs."</quote>
Neither do I mean to say anything as to what we hear a good deal about just now&#x2014;the Single Tax on land. I see that Mr. Hemmerde, fresh from all sorts of electioneering exploits, now says that he does not want to embark on anything so complex as this owing to the present conditions of the country, and that all that he himself is in favour of is a good fat tax on land values. As against this, though, I see that the Master of Elibank, the Official Whip, disclaims altogether a speech which his brother made last week in which he said that he thought the Single Tax was a phantastic notion. The Master of Elibank says it is all very well for his brother to say that, but he is speaking entirely for himself and in no sense for His Majesty's Government. I have not the slightest objection to serious-minded persons who hold views of their own getting together and deliberating and favouring His Majesty's Government for the moment with their views on any particular subject or upon any particular institution. After all, this is a free country. But I hope to show your Lordships that this so-called unofficial Committee is very different from anything of that sort.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01662">This so-called unofficial Committee appears to be animated and inspired by Mr. Lloyd George; according to <i>The Times</i> it received a most cordial welcome from the Prime Minister in another place; and it has quite lately been reinforced by Mr. Wedgwood Benn, one of the Party Whips, becoming a member of the Committee. I confess, my Lords, I think the sudden appearance in our common affairs of this unofficial Committee is quite as mysterious and almost as disquieting as that of the Trojan horse. These, perhaps, owing to recent events, are no longer the walls of Troy, but still I think this House would like to hear a little more about what it all means from His Majesty's Government. I confess that all I can learn about it is a little disquieting, though I do not consider myself at all of an apprehensive disposition. In fact, I labour too much under a tendency to think that nothing tremendous is going to
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0297"/>
<col>585</col>
happen the day after to-morrow. Still I notice that these Single Taxers have formed themselves into a league, and they met together in Essex Street, Strand, the other day, the occasion being a convivial dinner at which speeches were made and toasts honoured. The Lord Advocate, warming to his work&#x2014;I think he was speaking to a resolution of applause on all they had done about land&#x2014;declared that land was a quite different commodity from any other property and therefore it should receive quite different treatment. It is a self-evident proposition that land is not like whisky, and that it is not like coal. One great difference was pointed out by Mr. Lowe, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, who said&#x2014;
<quote>"Capital is a coy nymph; and, remember, she has wings."</quote>
Land, we know, is leaden footed and cannot get away. That I admit is a. great difference. The Government have the land of this country, as the French say, <i>sous la main</i>, and if the State chooses to treat land in a particular manner the land cannot get away.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01663">I feel that I need not make any apology to your Lordships for bringing this matter before the House. I say that for three main reasons. In the first place, we have lately had the Parliament Act passed, and under that Act this House was specially invited to become, as it were, the family solicitors of the country. We have been specially invited, I think, under the Parliament Act to inspect and scrutinise most jealously the prospectus and the contracts of any new issue. The second reason why I think it is proper that this discussion should come on in this House is that this House, in spite of the democratic tailor and hosier and hatter, to some extent at all events, however inadequately, represents the "shackles of feudalism" which was a picturesque phrase in Mr. Lloyd George's speech at Woodford, and which the Prime Minister on July 9 said he thought rather well of, and though it might be a little over picturesque he said he accepted it as a sound definition. The third reason is that this new land policy, if Mr. Lloyd George is to be believed, appears to be the new Liberalism. It is the new electioneering ticket, at all events. Mr. Lloyd George the other day wrote to Mr. Outhwaite stating how pleased he was with that gentleman because he was making land taxation a living issue in the politics of the day.</p>
<col>586</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01664">Mr. Lloyd George is not only an attractive but an exceedingly powerful Minister. I myself have a great weakness for Mr. Lloyd George. His imagination captivates me, and his eloquence enchants me. I think sometimes what I will call the class case may be a little overstated, but taking Mr. Lloyd George all round I believe that his devotion to what he thinks the cause of the less fortunate people in this troublesome world is quite as sincere as his disapproval of your Lordships' House and his mistrust of what we know, to use an old-fashioned term, as the landed gentry. And while I am on this I should like to express the hope that Mr. Lloyd George will patch up his peace with the doctors or that the doctors will patch up their peace with him, because I personally think that noble Lords opposite are all wrong about the insurance Act and that Mr. Lloyd George some day will get the credit for a very beneficent measure. Now with all these amiable feelings to Mr. Lloyd George 1 stand here to-night as one desirous of saving him in some way from himself. No one knows what Mr. Lloyd George's policy is. I do not think lie does himself, and I am certain the Prime Minister does not. From all I can learn the Chancellor and his friends, and perhaps what the papers call the Ship of State, are in some respects drifting in this matter of land taxation on to the shoals of an economic fallacy. Given, if you like, that it is desirable to get land out of few hands into many hands. I am not personally averse to that particular proposition. But are not Mr. Lloyd George and his reformers in some danger of arresting the processes of supply and demand and sale and purchase by special <i>ad hoc</i> taxation to force existing owners out? May not any such taxation prevent altogether the objects which Mr. Lloyd George and a great many members of the Liberal Party have in view? Although you may get the present owners out of the land, you will have great difficulty in getting other people in.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01665">I will read to your Lordships a few lines from a letter which I hold in my hand from an economist of repute, and not only is he a political economist but a man of the world. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"There is no reason to tax land more than Consols. A man must be encouraged to invest in both. Already the land bears the whole burden of the rates, which is not the case abroad. The peculiarity Of a Land Tax is that it falls on the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0298"/>
<col>587</col>
then owners, because the purchasers will, of course, deduct from the purchase price the various burdens and buy on the net income. The policy of the Government is to promote free trade in laud, but why make land a luxury of millionaires? Small holders are generally approved. Small holders can only succeed if the ownership of land does not expose the holder to uncertainty in the protection he has a right to expect front the Government. If more and better houses are wanted by labourers, by all means let this be done as in Ireland, but heavy taxation will, of course, discourage capital outlay. You want to attract capital to land."</quote>
As to the second part of my Question, in which I ask His Majesty's Government what the special qualifications are of the gentlemen who have been appointed on this unofficial Committee, who have been reinforced by one of the Liberal Whips, and who, as I say, start their labours with considerable applause from His Majesty's Government, I find myself in a considerable difficulty. We know&#x2014;it was stated the other day in an answer given in the House of Commons&#x2014;that this unofficial Committee is to be equipped by private munificence, and we are also told that no Unionist is to be invited to serve upon it; but I cannot get at the names of the members of the Committee although I have tried. <i>Sub rosa</i> I have learned that the Chairman is a relative of a gentleman possessed of very large landed property; but as far as I can make out from what has appeared in the newspapers the other members who have been indicated as having been appointed to the Committee are all fond of golf, but their practical experience in land seems to stop short at golf links and greens. Mr. Hetnmerde is a prominent member of this Committee; he is a splendid oar and a persevering playwright; but to the best of my information nobody seems to know whether any of these gentlemen have had practical experience of land. So that their labours are to be entirely based on a reference, which they will receive, no doubt, from a distinguished person, and upon their own views as to the position in which the matter ought to be placed in this country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01666">As a matter of courtesy to the House I endeavoured, when I put this Notice on the Paper, to find out the names of the unofficial Committee, and I wrote to Mr. Wedgwood Benn on the subject. This gentleman is in a very peculiar position. Just for the love of the thing, apparently, he has joined this Committee, but he has not taken the trouble to find out who are going to serve
<col>588</col>
with him. Replying to me from No. 12, Downing-street, Mr. Wedgwood Benn wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"I am sorry to say I cannot give you the information for which you ask, as I am merely an ordinary member of the Committee recently joined and do not know the full names."</quote>
He is going into this biggish job, but he does not know the people with whom he is going to work. Mr. Wedgwood Benn added that Mr. Roden Buxton, the secretary, would be able to give me the information. I thereupon wrote to Mr. Roden Buxton, and this morning I received from him a very polite light communication. He presents his compliments, and so on, but&#x2014;
<quote>"regrets to say that he does not feel authorised to forward the names of the members of the Committee on his own responsibility, but he will With pleasure lay Lord Ribblesdale's letter before the Chairman of the Committee and will communicate further with him."</quote>
I am afraid the further communication, from the look of things, will come a little too late for this evening's debate, and I can only apologise to the House for my failure to get the names of the members and their special qualification which we should all have much enjoyed investigating.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01667">The question is, Is this unofficial Committee to be taken seriously? It is very difficult to say. I am inclined to think not. I do not care very much about taking things seriously until they are round about one's ears. But still it seems to me that the proceedings of the unofficial Committee and its formation and so on are worthy of some consideration here and perhaps even of our vigilance, and it is for that reason that I have put down the Question to which I now invite an answer from His Majesty's Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01668"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I certainly do not at all complain of my noble friend for having raised this question, which he has adorned with the eloquence which always charms us whenever we have the felicity of hearing him speak in this House. I have no doubt that in his studies of the subject my noble friend has looked at the reports of the various references which have been made to it in another place. A series of Questions on different days were put to my right hon. friend the Prime Minister and I think to sonic other members of the Government, and I am sure that my noble friend will not be surprised if I am not
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0299"/>
<col>589</col>
able to add anything of a material kind to the replies which my hon. and right hon. friends gave in another place. What has happened is this. The inception has taken place of this unofficial Committee, as I think my noble friend described it&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01669"><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member><membercontribution>: It was so described in the House of Commons. It is not an invented term.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01670"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: It is a quite correct term, if I may say so, and a proper description of the body. That is to say, certain gentlemen undertook to collect within the next few months information upon matters of fact relating to various rural matters&#x2014;I do not think that I can describe it more accurately than thus, although I do not know that their activities in the matter of inquiry will be exclusively confined to rural questions&#x2014;upon certain matters of fact affecting land; and when this information has been obtained it will be available for His Majesty's Government. The bringing together of unofficial bodies of this kind is not without precedent, and I do not think that it can be seriously held, if it is properly understood, that it is open to objection. There is no question of any expenditure of public money. There is no question of framing any policy. The whole business, therefore, becomes one of the collection of information which His Majesty's Government may find it convenient at some future time to put to a purpose. The endeavour will be to collect that information as impartially as possible. My noble friend stated that he had not succeeded in obtaining a complete list of the members of this Committee although he had made some inquiries, but he had seen a number of names mentioned in the newspapers. The only name which, so far as I know, has been publicly stated is that of the Chairman, a gentleman well known to many members of your Lordships' House, Mr. Arthur Acland, who has held high office and is generally respected as one of the leading public men of the day. The reason which I imagine prevented the secretary of the Committee from sending a formal list to my noble friend on his inquiry was simply this, that the body being a privately formed one it was not desired to give it the authoritative stamp which would be given by such a reply or by cross-examination of Ministers as to a particular reason why some gentleman or other had joined it. That is the same reason why I do
<col>590</col>
not propose to give a list of the names of such members of it as I have heard of, because, in the first place, I have no reason to suppose that it would be a complete list, and primarily I have no desire, as a member of the Government, to take the responsibility of apparently having assisted to nominate this purely private body for the collection of information.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01671"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: Is there on the list the name of any single gentleman thoroughly acquainted with agriculture</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01672"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I should think that some of these gentlemen are. But the noble Marquess will remember that this is not primarily an agricultural inquiry in the strict sense. If we desired to undertake a formal agricultural inquiry such as might be conducted by a Royal Commission, I have no doubt that the composition of such a Royal Commission would have been quite different from that of this small body which is going to collect, as I say, simple information on matters of fact. I venture to think that the value of the information which these gentlemen will obtain will greatly depend upon the fact, which I am informed is to be the case, that quite separate local inquiries are to be made by them&#x2014;inquiries into the entirely different conditions which, as your Lordships are well aware, prevail in different parts of England, in different parts of Scotland, and in Wales. There can be no question, as it seems to me, of laying down any principle which is applicable either to the tenure or the cultivation of land either for England only or for Scotland or for Wales, the conditions being so intensely and fundamentally different in different parts of the United Kingdom&#x2014;I ought to say Great Britain, because this inquiry, as I understand, in no way extends to Ireland.<lb/>
The kind of inquiries&#x2014;and in this I am speaking not from any knowledge which I possess but from what seems to me to be probable&#x2014;the kind of inquiries which I suppose these gentlemen will conduct are something of this sort. You hear statements made that in some parts of England the country is being practically depopulated of its rural population; that practically all the younger generation, as soon as they grow up and have a chance of leaving the countryside, make their way to a town. Well, that is a subject into which surely
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0300"/>
<col>591</col>
inquiry is worth making, even inquiry of a completely unofficial kind. Then we are told by some that that migration is in many parts of England due to a shortage of houses in which the rural labourer can live. That is one of the points, as I take it, on which the conditions are vastly different in different parts of the country. That, again, is a type of question into which useful inquiry may be made&#x2014;inquiry of the kind for which everybody has been very grateful when it was made by Mr. Charles Booth in the case of London, or by Mr. Rowntree in the case of York&#x2014;Inquiry as to the conditions in which the poor live, and, so far as is possible, an investigation of their causes and suggestions for possible remedies. Then we are faced in many parts of England by the slow but in many cases steady decay of small country towns. That is one of the subjects on which I venture to think investigations might be held of real value from a number of points of view.<lb/>
So far as regards what is called the English land system, relating to purely agricultural land, I do not know how far these gentlemen will be able to make inquiries of a general or of a particular character. But there is one point in relation to that which I confess seems to me well worthy of inquiry. It is this. We are most of us in this House well acquainted with the English land system, with its merits as it is worked on a large scale in many parts of the country and also with its possible defects, and a question which seems to me worth inquiring into is this. Here is this English land system, an artificial one from many points of view, dependent on the contribution of by far the larger part of the fixed capital of the industry by the landowner. That is the main feature which distinguishes the English land system from that of almost any other country. It seems to me a subject worth inquiring how far the peculiar balance of that system, which demands for its success a state of equilibrium, is upset by the extent to which land is changing hands, by the rush to sell agricultural land which has been so marked in different parts of England. I am not going to discuss with your Lordships the causes which may have actuated individuals in putting their land on the market. I am speaking, of course, of agricultural land and not of building land. There have been a variety of reasons, which it is worth while in pursuing this particular subject to discuss. In some
<col>592</col>
cases I dare say the reason has been an apprehension, which I cannot believe to be well founded, of damaging legislation as applied to agricultural land, because noble Lords must in fairness admit that so far as agricultural land is concerned, except as it has taken its share like all other property in paying Super-Tax or being subject to the higher scale of Death Duties, it has been spared any special attention on the part of the revenue authorities. Nevertheless vague apprehensions may have caused some to sell. What has caused others to sell, I have no doubt, is the higher general scale of living which causes people to demand high interest for their money instead of low, and, as we know, there is no form of investment which returns so low a rate of interest to the owner as English agricultural land. But without attempting to go further into the investigation of those causes, it appears to me that the change is so marked and so remarkable a one that it is worth serious inquiry how far the conditions of our and the Scottish land system can be said to be altered by the change of ownership, it being remembered that so much in our land system has depended on the personal relations between the landowner and the tenants of the farms&#x2014;personal relations which are naturally altered by a sale.<lb/>
I have no wish to speak with gloom and foreboding as to the prospect of considerable change in the ownership of agricultural land in this country. I have no doubt that, particularly in the case of outlying estates in which owners are not able to take close personal interest, the landlord is very often wise to part with some portion of his agricultural property; but the fact, I think, cannot be blinked that the effect on our land system may possibly be one of considerable moment. A great many of your Lordships remember how unexpected and far-reaching upon the Irish land system was the effect of the passing of a measure which at the time was considered to be of the highest utility and likely to repair to a great extent the unfortunate condition into which so much of Irish land had fallen&#x2014;I mean the passing of the Encumbered Estates Act in 1849. The consequences of the passing of that Act were of the most far-reaching character, and its passage had an easily traced effect upon the subsequent land legislation which followed in the course of the next twenty and thirty years.<lb/>

<col>593</col>
The only quarrel I have with my noble friend is when he spoke of a new policy. There is no such thing as a new policy. The only policy which can in any case be an effective policy is that of those who at the time are entrusted by His Majesty with the government of the country, and to speak of any new land policy of His Majesty's Government is, I beg to assure your Lordships, a most complete misnomer and can only be accounted for by something approaching to an hallucination. I cannot help thinking that a good many people have been now, as they often are, misled by what they have read on this subject in the newspapers. We hear a great deal of talk about the sensation-mongering of the daily Press, but I think it cannot be wondered at that sensationalism should exist when public credulity always seems willing to keep pace with it, or even, if possible, go ahead of it. ft is not, I am sure, necessary to address a warning to your Lordships on that count, but a warning may very properly be addressed to a great number of persons who attach to newspaper paragraphs and newspaper articles an importance which does not strictly belong to them, greatly indebted though we all are to the Press for the information which it gives us and for the manner in which it gives it.<lb/>
I remember hearing many years ago a story of an observation made by a very wise and witty gentleman of the United States, Mr. Evarts. Mr. Evarts had an English friend who possessed a herd of Jersey cows, and this friend complained to him that although his herd was most carefully got together&#x2014;no expense had been spared upon it, and it was supposed to be the best that could possibly be obtained&#x2014;yet he had never succeeded in obtaining the output of milk which he saw recorded as being not uncommon in the United States. Mr. Evarts said&#x2014;
<quote>"I cannot understand why you should be disturbed in mind at finding that cows give rather less milk in England than they do in American newspapers."</quote>
And I should be disposed, therefore, to point out to some timid people that there is a most substantial and essential difference between a Land Tax or a demand made by a responsible authority and a tax described on a platform or advocated in the columns of a daily newspaper. As I say, I am sure this warning is in no sense needed in the case of your Lordships, who are experienced in affairs, but it is, I am sure, needed in the minds of a great number of persons. I
<col>594</col>
would therefore tell my noble friend, who was disposed, as he said, not to take this inquiry very seriously, that he really must take it as seriously as he thinks the facts of the case demand, and he must form his own judgment as to the gravity of the matters into which these gentlemen are going to inquire. If he thinks there is no case for any such inquiry, he may be quite sure that a number of others will think the same and no results of a kind which he would consider alarming are likely to follow front it. If, on the other hand, he thinks that there are abuses existing&#x2014;whether it be on the question of housing, whether it be on the question of rural employment, whether it be on the question in which the noble and learned Earl opposite (Lord Halsbury) has been so conspicuous, that of the transfer of land&#x2014;on any of these matters if he thinks a case exists demanding inquiry I do not think he would be disposed to complain of this inquiry which is going to be conducted. I hope that what I have said may have succeeded in reassuring noble Lords if there are any here, who have been disposed to attach too much credence to the rather portentous stories which they have heard and read, and that they also will be disposed to agree that an inquiry of this kind may have and ought to have some really serviceable results, of which a Government in some future day may be able to make practical use.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01673"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MIARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the interesting and ingenious speech which the noble Marquess has just delivered was not, I think, entirely successful in throwing light upon the very obscure and somewhat suspect transaction to which the noble Lord on the Back Bench opposite has drawn the attention of the House. The noble Marquess referred us to the answers that had been given by Ministers in the House of Commons. I made it my business to study those answers, but it was precisely because they seemed to me and to others so unsatisfactory and so vague that I was glad to observe that the noble Lord who made this Motion came here to-night to cross-examine noble Lords on the Front Bench. The noble Marquess appropriated the definition given by the Prime Minister when he said that this inquiry was an unofficial and informal one, and added as a gloss of his own that it was not one which, in his opinion, ought to be taken too seriously. I am not quite sure that we entirely agree with him on that point.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0302"/>
<col>595</col>
Pray do not let it be imagined that we on this side of the House have the slightest objection to any purely informal and unofficial investigation which may be instituted by groups of members of either House of Parliament. Such inquiries may sometimes serve a very useful purpose. But our point here is that this inquiry is not one which can with any propriety be described as merely unofficial and informal. It is an investigation which is apparently to be dry-nursed by His Majesty's Government from start to finish. To begin with, the Prime Minister bestowed his solemn approval upon the appointment of the Committee. Then we find that the members who are to serve upon it are "approached," not by the rank and file of the House, but by the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself. Then we find a gentleman well known to many of us, a Privy Councillor, an ex-Minister, appointed, I presume by the Prime Minister, to preside over the deliberations of the Committee. And finally, to make the story complete, there is added to it Mr. Wedgwood Benn, one of the Government Whips, who appears to think that by simply describing himself as a private Member he can cut all the links and associations which connect him with the Whips' room. The noble Marquess may perhaps ask me whether I am able to draw a sharp line between inquiries which are official and inquiries which are unofficial. There may be some difficulty in that. But of this I am quite persuaded, that this particular inquiry is not one which without great abuse of language can be described as an unofficial inquiry.<lb/>
Then let us consider a little the composition of this Committee. There has been a singular amount of coyness in divulging the membership of the Committee. In one of the conversations in the House of Commons information on the point was refused by the Prime Minister on the ground that the matter was unofficial; but we know one or two things about the composition of the Committee. There are no Unionists upon it, at any rate. They have not been invited in any way to associate themselves with this important investigation. Then my noble friend Lord Londonderry asked whether the Committee included any gentlemen practically conversant with agriculture. The noble Marquess opposite was not quite sure about that. And then he made this most singular announcement. He said that the inquiry was not really an
<col>596</col>
agricultural one but dealt with other matters. He told us that there were to be separate local inquiries as to local conditions, and then he described the kind of information which was to be sought for by these roving bodies. Does the noble Marquess suppose that inquiries as to the local conditions in regard to such questions as what is usually spoken of as the rural exodus, in regard to housing, and so forth, can take place without reference to the practical conditions of the agricultural problem? The two things are indissolubly mixed together and it is idle to attempt to separate them.<lb/>
Those who have spoken here and elsewhere for His Majesty's Government are at pains to explain that this Committee is not a Committee of Single Taxers. Well, perhaps not. My own belief is that you will find it extremely difficult to discover any one with any knowledge either of agriculture or of finance who will go the length of identifying himself with the Single Tax in the full sense of the term. The consequences which would result from the adoption of Mr. Henry George's full-blown doctrines are so obvious and so absurd, even to the meanest understanding, that although there may be fanatics who may hold these views I cannot believe that any responsible Government will be found to advocate them; indeed, I well remember the predecessor of the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack&#x2014;I think we were at the time discussing the Scottish Land Values Bill&#x2014;repudiating with all the earnestness possible, and with evident sincerity, the idea that His Majesty's Government could for an instant entertain what he described as the policy of Henry George. He added that those were doctrines with which His Majesty's Government had no sympathy whatever, and I feel sure that that is the case, at any rate so far as the noble Marquess opposite is concerned, at the present moment. But, my Lords, oar point is that the whole of these Members of Parliament who have been honoured with a place upon this Committee are gentlemen who are identified with a policy involving the transfer, I will not say of the whole of our taxation but of a great part of our taxation, from other sources to the land. About that there is no doubt whatever. We should very much like to know something of the procedure which is to be followed by the Committee during those peregrinations which the noble Marquess mentioned.
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0303"/>
<col>597</col>
Are they going to call witnesses? Will they have power to call witnesses? If they do not call witnesses and witnesses representing, not their own views, but the views of those who differ from them, what will be the value of this inquiry with its vast scope and the multitude of subjects which it is to include?<lb/>
And that leads me to remind the House of another little point which we gather from an answer given in the House of Commons by the Prime Minister. He was asked whether the Report of this Committee would be laid on the Table. What was his answer? He said he did not know. Is it not extraordinary that an investigation of this comprehensiveness and this importance should be contemplated and that we are not even to know whether the results of the inquiry are to be kept secret or whether they are to be made public? There is another matter of which I should like to remind the House. The subject into which this unofficial Committee is to inquire is a subject which has already been inquired into by more than one Committee or Commission. There was, for example, the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes; and there was the Commission presided over by my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh, which heard a great quantity of evidence and submitted very weighty recommendations upon all those subjects of which the noble Marquess spoke a moment ago. Now are you going to take this irregularly-composed Committee, this Committee of partisans&#x2014;for that is the only way to describe it&#x2014;and set them to give you a Report which shall overshadow and supersede such documents as the Reports of the two weighty Royal Commissions to which I referred a moment ago? The thing seems too monstrous to contemplate.<lb/>
Let me say for myself, and I have no doubt I speak for others too, we should welcome an inquiry into this question of the taxation of land, but if there is to be an inquiry let it be an inquiry conducted in the full light of day and by a properly constituted body. The noble Marquess told us that this Committee was to deal with what I think he described as the balance of our agricultural system, with such questions as the movement of the population from the country towards the towns, and with the housing problem. Why, surely, my Lords, if you are to have an inquiry into
<col>598</col>
such matters as these you want a weighty and authoritative body properly constituted and really able to sift the evidence with a thorough and practical knowledge of the matter. There are two ways in which Committees and Commissions are constituted. You sometimes appoint to them representatives of extreme views on both sides, you give them a fairly impartial chairman, and you trust that out of the conflict of opinion some reasonable compromise may be reached. That is one way. The other way, of course, is to appoint to your inquiring body no one but men of a judicial mind, chosen because they are unbiased and impartial. But in this case you have taken neither of these methods. You have made up your Committee of inquiry entirely of men whom I described a moment ago, I think not improperly, as partisans. Can you expect that front such an inquiry any real good will result?<lb/>
The real defence for the action of His Majesty's Ministers in this matter is one which I think the noble Marquess cannot venture to give. I will suggest it to the House. They have a very motley and a somewhat unruly body of followers, and amongst the most persistent of them are these gentlemen who are addicted to various versions of the Single Tax policy. My explanation of the appointment of this Committee is that His Majesty's Government have found it an extremely convenient way of keeping these gentlemen quiet for a little time. They have given them this bone to fight over, and for the moment no doubt they will be relieved of the necessity of themselves dealing with the matter. I am very glad that the noble Lord on the Back Bench has called the attention of the House to this matter, because it is in my view not, as the noble Marquess supposed, a matter of no importance, but a matter raising very serious questions of principle and one to which the House ought certainly to give its attention.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01677"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: Are the Government going to support the proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer contained in his letter to Mr. Outhwaite at Hanley? It is difficult to see how the matter can be unofficial when this subject was dealt with so fully by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The noble Marquess opposite says he is tillable to give us the names of the members of this Committee. At any rate, we know there is not to be a single Unionist upon it. From rumours we have heard we learn that the Committee is to consist of gentlemen who are interested in every kind of industry except agriculture. The only member who is acquainted at all with agriculture has property in Austria but has no interest whatever in agricultural land in England. This is to be a packed Committee, packed for one purpose only and packed by men who are supporters of the Party opposite, who hope that by raising this question of land values they will get at what they want to secure&#x2014;namely,&#x2014; the Single Tax. The Single Tax has been brought forward at recent by-elections by men who are considered prominent members of the Party opposite. Is this Committee appointed in view of the question of the Single Tax being in future made the policy of the Party at present in office I believe it is, and that is the opinion of the members who are upon it My belief is that this question of the Single Tax is started with a view to making it an election cry in the country. The Government know full well that if they went to the constituencies to-morrow on Home Rule or Disestablishment or against a reform in our fiscal system they would have no chance of being returned. They are therefore anxious to get up a new cry. But the moderate members of the Party opposite do not approve of these violent measures, and therefore the Government have allowed this Committee to be appointed to keep quiet certain sections of their supporters. This, however, is not a policy which moderate men in the Government should allow. I cannot believe, for instance, that speeches like that delivered at Limehouse by the Chancellor of the Exchequer are approved by the noble Marquess the Leader of the House; and I say that it is the duty of the noble Marquess and his colleagues who hold moderate views to dissociate themselves
<col>600</col>
from the violent outbursts to which I have referred and not allow these speeches to go to the country as representing the views of the Cabinet. But the truth is that the country is slowly waking up to the fact that there is no moderate party in the present Cabinet. Thinking men view with scorn the action of the so-called moderate men in the Government in allowing these violent speeches to go unrepudiated. In a paper entitled "Land Values," by Mr. Outhwaite, the recently-returned Member for Hanley, occurs a paragraph stating that the rank and file of the Liberal Party are tired of having to wait for Cabinet pronouncements to know the faith they are to hold; that Liberalism stands for economic freedom; and that when the straight road to emancipation has to be taken an irresistible army will rally, and happily there will be no mistaking those who now retard advance. I cannot imagine that such language will be appreciated by noble Lords opposite. In conclusion, I must again express my surprise that no one has risen from the Government Front Bench to reply to the speech of the noble Marquess beside me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01678"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether Lord Ribblesdale has derived much satisfaction from the answer he has received. If he has, I think he enjoys the position of being quite unique in the House. Who appointed this Committee? That is what we want to know. The noble Marquess says it is unofficial, but a Committee does not come into existence without having some origin. The noble Marquess told us we must not believe what we see in the newspapers. How far does he carry that? Does he carry it as far as the reports of speeches are concerned, because if the reports are not undeserving of belief we know that this Committee was the direct result of Mr. Lloyd George's speech at Woodford. These were his words on that occasion&#x2014;
<quote>"We have got to free the laud, to free the land that is at this very hour shackled with the chairs of feudalism. We have got to free the people front the anxieties, the worries, the terrors that their children may be crying for bread in this land of plenty. We have got to free the land. It is a disgrace to the richest land under the sun that people should want. This Act [the Insurance Act] is a beginning, and with God's help it is but a beginning."</quote>
It is an extraordinary thing that within a day or two after that Mr. Lloyd George gave
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0305"/>
<col>601</col>
a breakfast, at which a certain number of persons appeared who I believe are the members of this Committee. If I could only get the noble Marquess opposite into a private room I am sure he could give a great deal more information as to the members of this Committee than he was good enough to give to the House. It struck me that he must know a good deal more with regard to the composition of this Committee, more especially after the two letters which Lord Ribblesdale read, one front a Liberal Whip and the other from a gentleman very nearly in the same capacity. In reality the Government know a great deal more about this question than they will divulge to the House. There can, I think, be no doubt of that.<lb/>
I believe the guess of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition as to the origin of this Committee to be absolutely accurate, and I will tell you why. Mr. Hemmerde&#x2014;I do not think any one will dispute that he is one of the members of this Committee&#x2014;went to Mr. Lloyd George's breakfast, and he had just previously been returned for a Division of Norfolk. He is a Single Taxer, though I. must say he has lowered his topsails since he went to Crewe. At Hanley he supported the Single Tax, but now he says that he is in favour of it in theory, but that in an old country like this you cannot have it. I think it is largely to keep this gentleman and others quiet that this Committee has been appointed. At the meeting of the English League for the Taxation of Land Values this month Mr. Hemmerde said&#x2014;
<quote>"I believe that the Government is in earnest. The time has come for very plain speaking to some members of the Party whose voices carry no weight in the country, but who think it their privilege to dictate to the Party how far it is to go. There is no hope for Liberalism in this country unless it moves fast. Look at the Dock Strike, the Coal Strike, the Railway Strike. It is no good talking about a minimum wage to remedy these things. This fight is the biggest fight there has been in English politics for centuries."</quote>
I admit that language of that sort, if repeated, will be inconvenient for the Government, and it is certain that His Majesty's Government have looked upon the formation of this Committee, if not with absolute approval&#x2014;although the Chancellor of the Exchequer was the originator of it&#x2014;at all events in the hope that it will keep some of their extreme friends quiet.<lb/>
<col>602</col>
The noble Marquess opposite said there was precedent for this. Is there a precedent for a speech delivered by the Chancellor of the Exchequer followed by the appointment of a Committee which is said to have been self-appointed? I do not know whether the noble Marquess will admit that this Committee was appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. If it was not, is there a precedent for a self-appointed Committee suddenly rising into existence who are to collect information not exclusively about the condition of the rural part of the kingdom? I think the noble Marquess knows a great deal more about what they propose to de than he has up to the present time told us. Then he said there was no such thing possible as a new policy, because the policy is the policy of the Government. Therefore if you follow his argument out it comes to this, that as soon as a Government is in power nothing that they propose is a new policy. And he tells us, last of all, that we are not to believe anything we see in the newspapers. Although we may not believe all we see in the newspapers, at any rate we have had a good deal more indication in the newspapers as to the truth of this matter than we have up to the present time succeeded in extracting from His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01679"><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with your indulgence I wish to say one word to put myself clear with the noble Marquess, Lord Crewe. He was very kind in the way he treated the few observations I made, but when he said that I was not inclined to take it very seriously I should like to say this, My point is that I do take it very seriously that the Government should identify themselves with this Committee in the way they have done and refuse us all information; but what I do not take very seriously is the Committee itself. Really if I did take this Committee of partisans &#x2014;and I do not think the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition went too far when he used that word&#x2014;as serious people, I should have to take seriously an unofficial committee of thieves and ticket-of-leave men who declared their willingness to instruct the Government upon the reconstitution of the Metropolitan Police, or an unofficial body of professed secularists who undertook to remodel the Establishment and to tell us what we ought to do with the Right Rev.

<title>MOTOR TRAFFIC IN LONDON.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01680"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF RUTLAND</member> rose to call attention to the returns recently given in the Press of the motor traffic in London, and the casualties resulting therefrom; and to ask His Majesty's Government whether it is their intention to soon introduce legislation dealing with the whole subject of mechanically-propelled vehicles throughout the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01681">The noble Duke said: My Lords, it is some years since I ventured to address your Lordships on this subject, and I have laid to my soul the flattering unction that at any rate one of the suggestions which I ventured to make on that occasion was acted upon not very long afterwards by the London police&#x2014;I refer to the putting on of a certain number of skilled inspectors and constables to take action with respect to the more noisy and unwieldy motor-buses then punning. Last year 410 people were killed by vehicles in the streets of London. That is a very heavy death roll to contemplate. Of this number 122 were killed by horse-drawn vehicles and the remainder by mechanically-propelled traffic. During the same period motor omnibuses were responsible for 1,900 accidents which did not end fatally, and motor-cars for over 5,000 accidents. That is a very serious matter, but I am far from blaming the motor industry generally. You have to consider the number of motor vehicles which are on the streets now compared with a few years ago. Nine years ago there were only thirteen motor omnibuses on the streets of London; now there are more than 2,000, and additional motor-omnibuses are being put on at the rate of thirty a week. Nine years ago there was only one motor-cab on the London streets; to-day there are over 7,000. Those figures prove that this question of mechanically-propelled vehicles requires very grave consideration on the part of His Majesty's Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01682">We were told in the early days of motor traffic that we would soon get accustomed to it, and that one great advantage of it would be that there would be far more room in the streets. A taxi-cab being much shorter than a horse-drawn cab, it was contended that proportionately there would be more room and traffic would become less congested. I do not think any one acquainted with London traffic will say that this has been realised. On the contrary, the congestion is very great
<col>604</col>
indeed in the main streets of London, in which the traffic is mostly mechanically propelled. I at once say that I do not hold the drivers of these vehicles so much to blame as some of the newspapers make out. The strain of driving a heavy motor-omnibus weighing two tons through crowded traffic when the roads are slippery is very great both physically and mentally, and a driver is pretty well worn out at the end of his day's work. In my opinion many of the men who drive motor-omnibuses and taxi-cabs in London deserve very great credit for the manner in which they work their way through crowded traffic, and I always wonder that more accidents do not occur. While on this point I must say that the manner in which the traffic is handled by the London police seems to me perfectly marvellous. I have a high respect for the pluck and presence of mind of the street duty policeman. With regard to the accidents that take place, I think that pedestrians contribute largely to their own misfortunes in many cases. It is a common occurrence in crowded streets to see people ignoring the many refuges which would enable them to cross with safety and strolling casually across unconcerned as to their own safety. I think that in some thoroughfares there are too many of these refuges. That may sound an absurd statement, but there is no denying the fact that the placing of refuges in crowded thoroughfares at distances of only 100 or 150 yards apart does cause congestion of traffic and lead to accidents.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01683">There is another matter. Nowadays when rebuilding work is going on, hoardings are carried out so far and up so high that it is impossible, when this rebuilding is taking place at street corners, for drivers to see other vehicles coming round the corner, and if a large piece of glass were inserted in the triangle in such cases it would be of great advantage in preventing accidents. Then, again, there is no question that the twenty-mile speed limit is too high for London. I think fifteen miles or even twelve should be the limit inside London. I have often seen at midnight or at one o'clock in the morning vehicles racing down Piccadilly at well over thirty miles an hour to the imminent danger of the public. I hope that before long legislation on the whole subject of mechanically-propelled vehicles will be taken into consideration by His Majesty's Government, and that as a result we shall have a consolidated law

<col>605</col>
placed on the Statute-book which will do away with many of the gross anomalies and absurdities which now occur. Take the Great North Road. That is a clear road, and in parts it is quite safe to go at any reasonable speed you like. What can be more ridiculous, on a straight, open, clear road where there is not the slightest danger to any one, than being arrested for exceeding the twenty-mile limit? You may have been travelling some distance at a speed exceeding twenty miles an hour with no danger to the public and not the slightest vestige of inconvenience to anybody; but the moment you go over a certain line on the road you are arrested, although, as I say, you are travelling then at exactly the same speed as you were on the other side of the line. Could a greater absurdity exist in the law than that? That is a matter which I hope before long will be adjusted. In open country where you have a clear run and no cross roads I cannot for the life of me see why you should not be allowed to drive at a higher rate than twenty miles an hour, so long as there is no danger to the public. At the same time it ought to be severely punishable for a motorist to drive through any village at a higher speed than ten miles an hour, and it ought not to be left, entirely in the hands of the local authorities to say to which places the ten-mile speed limit should apply.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01684">Although, on the whole, motorists are much more considerate than they were a few years ago, I admit that the road hog still exists. I should like to abolish him altogether, and I think this could be accomplished by compelling him to go through villages much more carefully and by imposing heavier penalties for dangerous driving. You all know the story of the foreign chauffeur who indignantly declared at the police court when charged with furious driving, "I always make it my hobby not to kill anybody." I think motorists generally make it their hobby now not to kill any one, but still there is a great deal that can be done by legislation in the way I have indicated to stop the practices of the road hog. It is curious that while fowls, ducks, geese, and even dogs now-a-days do not take the liberties with motorcars that they used to, yet children seem to be as reckless as ever they were, and it is a great problem what to do with children who will insist upon playing in the middle of the road although they have excellent playgrounds elsewhere. In conclusion, I venture
<col>606</col>
to hope that His Majesty's Government will in a future session introduce useful legislation on these matters and at the same time consolidate the law so that we may have a satisfactory, intelligible, and workable Motor Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01685"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Duke has given us formidable figures as to the number of accidents in the metropolis last year. I saw in one issue of <i>The Times</i> last week a report of five fatal accidents in London. I am afraid that in this matter people are losing all sense of proportion. If five people are killed in a railway accident we have columns written about it as well as leading articles in the newspapers, but here were five people killed in one day in the streets of London and the matter was dismissed with half-a-dozen lines. I endorse all that the noble Duke has said as to the need for further legislation. At Constitution Hill there is a notice to pedestrians to beware of riders. I do not think that that strip for riders is very much frequented; but when you emerge on to Hyde Park Corner you are at one of the most congested and dangerous points in London. The noble Duke seemed to imply that it was in the more congested thoroughfares that the larger number of accidents occurred. I believe it is in the open thoroughfares where danger most lies. The noble Duke, who is in the full vigour of manhood, may be able to get across safely. But take Grosvenorsquare. Before leaving the pavement you may look carefully to see that there is no motor-car coming along, but if a car is travelling at thirty miles an hour it is on top of you long be-fore you can get across to the other side. I certainly support the representation that a speed limit of fifteen miles an hour should be fixed inside London. No doubt children are guilty of carelessness, but they have not many recreation grounds in London and it is only natural that they should play in the streets. It is hard upon those who pay the rates and presumably have a perfect right to cross public streets that they can only do so at great risk to their lives. I hope something will be done by His Majesty's Government to mitigate this great source of danger to the inhabitants of London.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01686"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ALLENDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with a great deal of what the noble Duke has said I am, and I am sure the majority of your Lordships are, in hearty agreement. The figures as to accidents are no doubt very
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0308"/>
<col>607</col>
large, but it must be remembered that the total number includes every kind of accident., even the slightest personal injury, and that the figures given are in respect of an area of 700 square miles and a population exceeding 7,000,000. We must all regret that 410 lives were lost through traffic accidents in London last year, but the number does not appear to be so very large when the vast population and the considerable area are taken into consideration.<lb/>
The mileage of cabs and other public vehicles has increased greatly since the introduction of motor traffic. In 1902, for instance, there were 11,382 cab licences; they were practically all horse cabs. I do not know what the average run per day for a horse cab is, but if you take the average at forty miles that would represent a daily cab mileage then of 455,280 miles. In 1911 there were 10,973 licences&#x2014;3,347 horse cabs and 7,626 motor vehicles. If we again take forty miles as the average of a horse cab and eighty as that of a motor, the total average mileage per day is now 743,960 miles; and I think it may be assumed that the mileage of privately-owned vehicles has increased in the same ratio. Coupled with this there has been an enormous increase in the mileage covered by pedestrians. I agree that pedestrians are sometimes to blame for contributing to accidents, but it is not much use telling a pedestrian when he has been run over and hurt that he was to blame.<lb/>
The noble Duke said that when motor traction was first introduced we were told that there would be more room in the streets but that that had not turned out to be the case. In that. I quite agree with the noble Duke. The congestion of traffic in London has increased enormously, and far greater difficulty is experienced by the police in dealing with traffic. But though there has been this increase the streets generally and the pavements have not been widened but remain the same width for an increasing population. It is the old question of trying to put a quart into a pint pot. With much that the noble Duke said as to speed on country roads I dare say a good many of us agree, but I doubt whether you would have public opinion behind you in any proposed legislation to increase the speed limit to twenty-five or thirty miles. Rightly or wrongly, the general public think that there is some sort of security in having a
<col>608</col>
speed limit. His Majesty's Government and the Departments concerned are watching the evolution of motor traffic, but I cannot say what may be proposed eventually as regards this question of speed, though I doubt very much whether public opinion would sanction the increasing of the speed limit. I fully endorse what the noble Duke said in praise of the London police and the manner in which they handle the traffic. The noble Duke also expressed the opinion that in many places there were too many refuges. That, however, is not the view of the Chief Commissioner of Police; and the police are pressing the local authorities wherever they can to increase the number of refuges in certain places.<lb/>
The speed of vehicles in London is controlled under Section 1 of the Motor Act, 1903, which makes it an offence to drive negligently or in a manner dangerous to the public, or under Section 9 of the Act on the ground that the speed limit is being exceeded. In towns what is commonly known as the "police trap," but more euphemistically called the "control," hardly applies. It is most difficult to employ the control in town traffic. Then it has been suggested in this discussion that a specially-low speed limit should be imposed at danger points in towns. I agree with the noble Duke that the speed at such points and through villages and urban districts should not exceed ten miles an hour; in fact, in many cases ten miles an hour is too fast. In town traffic, however, it is by no means certain&#x2014;in fact the contrary is, I think, held to be the case&#x2014;that a very low speed limit would conduce to increased safety. A comparison of the figures of the City of London with those of the rest of the metropolitan police district supplies a striking corroboration of this. In the City of London the traffic is more congested, and moves at a much slower rate than in any other part of the metropolis; moreover, the traffic in the City is more controlled &#x2014;I mean by there being more police in proportion to the population&#x2014;than elsewhere. But, notwithstanding this, in the one square mile which forms the City of London and which constitutes one seven-hundredth part of the metropolitan police area the number of accidents is one-tenth of the total. These figures go to show that accidents are due to the density of the traffic rather than to excessive speed. Low limits are also to be deprecated from the point of view of facilities for traffic.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0309"/>
<col>609</col>
The Government Departments concerned and the police have the whole subject under careful consideration, and if it is found possible to take any steps for the greater control of traffic and the greater protection of pedestrians at certain points this will be done. The Departments always welcome suggestions as to measures which might be taken for dealing with this problem, and I will certainly lay before the Departments concerned the suggestions which the noble Duke has made to-day. There is no doubt that the advent of mechanically-propelled traffic has changed very much the conditions of our life, and although in many ways there may be advantages there are also considerable disadvantages. I can only say
<col>610</col>
that at present the Government do not contemplate legislation on the subject. The evolution of motor traffic is, as I have said, being watched by the Chief Commissioner of Police in London, by the Departments concerned, and also by the local authorities in the country, and no doubt some further legislation will have to be brought in before long to consolidate the legislation on the subject and minimise as far as.possible the danger which has grown up with this traffic.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01767" align="center"><i>Restriction on the Use of the Term "Creamery" in relation to Irish Butter.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01768"><b>1</b>&#x2014;(1) From and after the first day of January nineteen hundred and thirteen the term "creamery" if applied to Irish butter shall be taken to be a trade description signifying that the butter has been manufactured in a creamery registered under this Act awl has not subsequently been blended or re-worked, and if applied to any Irish butter which&#x2014;

Provided that in Great Britain the term "creamery" if applied to Irish butter shall not by reason of the foregoing provision be taken to be a false trade description, unless there is also applied to the butter a description stating or indicating directly or indirectly that the butter was made or manufactured in Ireland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01769">(2) For the purposes of this section the term "creamery" shall be deemed to be applied if applied within the meaning of the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887, and the expression "Irish Butter" shall be deemed to include in Ireland any butter sold or offered, exposed or consigned for sale otherwise than as British, colonial or foreign butter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01770"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD PLUNKET</member><membercontribution>: I move to omit the proviso at the end of subsection (1). Some of your Lordships will recall that on the Second Reading of this Bill, speaking on behalf of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, which is representative of over half the creameries in Ireland, I stated that we approved the Bill as a whole but that we would have serious Amendments to move when it reached the Committee stage, and that we thought the Bill should not leave your Lordships' House without those Amendments being agreed to. Since then an important concession has been made by the Irish Department. The Agricultural Organisation Society has con-
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0314"/>
<col>619</col>
stantly urged the formation by the Irish Department of Agriculture of an advisory committee on dairying, adequately representative of the butter industry in Ireland, to which all matters affecting this industry should be referred for consideration and recommendation. The Vice-President of the Irish Department of Agriculture has now agreed to give effect to that proposal and to constitute such a committee in time to deal with this Bill before it reaches the Committee stage in another place. I shall not enlarge upon the enormous general advantage to the industry of such a committee, but will only say that we are prepared, in consequence of this promise, to join with the Government in asking your Lordships to accept this Bill with the Amendments to be proposed to-day, with the one exception of the proviso at the end of subsection (1) of Clause 1, which, at the urgent request of every creamery we have heard from, we ask your Lordships to delete.<lb/>
This proviso was not in the original draft of the Bill. It is not a proposal of the Irish Department of Agriculture, but was inserted, we understand, at the request of the Board of Trade and the English Board of Agriculture. The clause as it stood and as we desire it to remain contains the essence of the Bill&#x2014;that in future the term "creamery" when used in connection with Irish butter would be an absolute guarantee that such butter had been prepared under very stringent and exacting Government conditions. But this proviso so weakens this clear and simple definition that much of the value of the Bill, under which creameries are called upon to make very great sacrifices, disappears, for it would practically encourage a form of fraud on English consumers easy to carry out but very difficult to expose and punish. For it actually proposes that in Great Britain the term "creamery" applied to Irish butter need not necessarily signify the butter is really creamery butter unless described directly or indirectly as having been made in Ireland. You therefore confer upon the Irish butter industry a benefit with one hand and take it away with the other. You give a clear definition of what creamery butter really should mean (to the enormous advantage of the producer and consumer), and then you confuse and weaken that definition; and in this connection it must be remembered that the detection and successful prosecution of frauds upon the public in the sale of butter
<col>620</col>
is hard enough to carry out already. We understand that the reason advanced by the Board of Trade and the English Board of Agriculture for inserting this proviso is that they fear that without it there might be established a sort of trade mark for Ireland in the term "creamery." It is quite true that the custom of the trade in the United Kingdom, as evidenced by their principal organ, the <i>Grocer</i>, is to regard the term "creamery" as practically a special designation for Irish creamery butter. Everyone knows that butter from Denmark, Sweden, etc., is made in creameries, but it is unusual for it to be so described. But we do not and could not object to their using the definition, nor do we think the clause without the proviso could be twisted to prevent them. What we say is that this clause with the proviso is obscure and unnecessary, and that it is calculated to expose Irish creameries to the danger of competition in the British market with firms who will purchase other than creamery butter and sell it as So-and-so's Creamery Butter, gaining the higher price which this new Parliamentary definition of creamery will give them and escaping scot free in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred.<lb/>
If the Board of Trade still remain uneasy, they should suggest some alternative proviso which the advisory committee on dairying, to which I referred at the beginning of my remarks, could consider. There are a number of minor points in this Bill which might have been discussed in your Lordships' House to-day, but we feel that with the assistance we have already been given by the Government and with this advisory committee to which I have referred, the Bill when it reaches this House again will be practically perfect. But if this particular proviso in subsection (1) of Clause 1 remains in we cannot possibly accept the Bill, and we trust that the Government will withdraw the proviso.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01772"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: The proviso which is the subject of this discussion was not inserted in the first instance at the desire of the Irish Department of Agriculture, but it has been regarded as
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0315"/>
<col>621</col>
important by the Board of Trade and by the Board of Agriculture in England and we look upon it as an integral part of the Bill; and if your Lordships see fit to follow the noble Lord's suggestion and delete the proviso now, the Government will feel bound to reinsert it in another place. I think the fairness of the proviso and its necessity will strike any impartial observer. The fact is that without it a. British merchant selling creamery butter in this country which happened to come from Ireland&#x2014;it might conic from Ireland without his knowledge&#x2014;would be liable to the penalties which the Bill establishes. What we say is that if he sells it as "Irish creamery butter" and it is not manufactured in a registered creamery, then it should come within the penalties of the Statute. I think it is desirable in the interests of salesmen that this proviso should remain in the Bill. What we have to consider from an Irish point of view is whether it does, in effect, destroy the value and utility of the Bill, as the noble Lord seemed to think. I cannot conceive its doing so unless you suppose that a certain creamery in Ireland, wishing to escape the provisions as to inspection, maintenance of plant, and so forth, were to determine to sacrifice the whole of their Irish trade in butter and merely make butter for the English market. It is quite true that if the person running that creamery did not apply and did not get registered he could sell creamery butter in the English market as creamery butter, but in order to do that he would have to sacrifice the whole of his Irish business, because in Ireland at any rate you cannot sell any butter as creamery butter unless it is made at a registered creamery. I do not see that the effect of the Bill is at all weakened by this proviso. The noble Lord seemed to think that it would encourage a form of fraud. I would remind him that one of the advantages of this Bill is that it does give a statutory definition to creamery butter, and that it was the want of such a definition which prevented prosecutions in the past. There will be no difficulty under this Bill in obtaining convictions where other butter is palmed off on the public as Irish creamery butter. We have made concessions in regard to this Bill on almost every point except this one. The Bill is practically an agreed Bill with the exception of this single remaining point. As I have stated, the moment you look at this proviso you must see its fairness; and
<col>622</col>
seeing that it really cannot injure the Bill and cannot detract from its utility and its stringency I hope the noble Lord will not persist in his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01773"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: I do not think the noble Lord who has just sat down has succeeded in getting rid of the difficulty that is in the minds of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society with regard to this proviso. It is perfectly obvious that under this proviso any British trading firm could buy butter in Ireland and sell it as Mr. So-and-so's creamery butter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01774"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: Not if there is any indication that it comes from Ireland. If the name of a well-known butter manufacturer in Ireland were used, that would be an indirect statement that it was Irish creamery butter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01775"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: It is obvious that the butter could be sold as creamery butter and the public would be led to think it was Irish creamery butter whereas it had not been made in a registered creamery in Ireland. Therefore the advantage given by the Bill is taken away by this proviso. The noble Lord said the British tradesman might be under this disadvantage, that he might be selling what lie thought was English butter but it might turn out to be Irish butter and he would then come under the penalties of the Bill; but I think the noble Lord, inasmuch as this advisory committee is to be appointed to which a matter of this sort could easily be referred, might agree to this proviso being deleted at the present stage until the advisory committee have had an opportunity of discussing it. Perhaps we should then be able to find a way out of this <i>impasse</i> which would protect British salesmen in the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01776"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I do not understand that this is to be an advisory committee on the Bill. It is an advisory committee on the Irish dairy industry as a whole. I repeat that I do not believe that this proviso does any real injury to the Irish butter trade. If you look at the <i>Grocer</i>&#x2014;which is <i>The Times</i> of the trade&#x2014;you will find that Irish creamery butter is always described as "Irish creamery butter." I have never seen it described as creamery butter only. All that needs to be done is to describe it as Irish creamery butter, and then it is clear that anybody who sells as Irish creamery butter butter not made in a registered Irish creamery does come under the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01777"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The House is placed in some difficulty with regard to this Amendmen, for I do not think that until we came here this evening most of us realised the great importance which is attached to it. I have great sympathy with the view of the case so effectually put before the House by the noble Lord who moved the Amendment. This is a very drastic and stringent Bill, and imposes on Irish creameries a considerable number of severe restrictions. In return for that they get a kind of trade mark which gives their goods no small advantage in the market. They point out&#x2014;I think with some force&#x2014;that if this proviso remains in the Bill the door will be opened for fraud, and that they will be deprived of the protection afforded to them by what I called a moment ago the trade mark which this Bill provides them with. As I understand the proviso, it will be open to a dealer to sell as creamery butter butter which was made in Ireland, though not, perhaps, at a creamery, unless there is something on the package to suggest distinctly that the butter is Irish creamery butter. That does seem to me to open the door for a considerable amount of abuse. But I should be very sorry to suggest to your Lordships that you should take to-night a decided view for or against this Amendment. What I should like to suggest, particularly as the Bill appears to be, except for this one point of difference, an agreed Bill, is that this one point might be held over for another stage, and that we might in the meantime endeavour to ascertain a little more clearly than we can at present the precise position of the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01778"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD PLUNKET</member><membercontribution>: This is a very complex matter and one which it is rather difficult to decide. We have not the least objection to the Board of Trade safeguarding what they consider to be the interests of English traders, but as this proviso stands there really is no protection against some firm with an Irish name buying up what is not creamery butter in Ireland and calling it "Murphy's creamery butter."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01779"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: That is not so. He would come within the Merchandise Marks Act. No butter but creamery butter can be sold in England as creamery butter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01780"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD PLUNKET</member><membercontribution>: That point is difficult to prove. I am quite prepared to accept the noble Marquess's suggestion that
<col>624</col>
this matter should be postponed to a later stage of the Bill, so that it may be further considered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01781"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: I quite agree that it would be rather an extreme course to do anything to endanger the Bill as a whole on this comparatively small point, and, speaking generally, the postponement of its consideration till another stage would seem to be a natural and obvious course. I am not quite certain, however, what would be meant at this particular time of the year by postponing the consideration of this point to another stage. Do noble Lords opposite think that it would be possible to settle this point before we adjourn at the end of this month, or does the postponement mean that it would have to be postponed until we meet again in the course of the autumn?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01782"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD PLUNKET</member><membercontribution>: I should be able to ascertain within a few days whether it would be possible to come to an agreement on the point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01783"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: If that is so I hope the noble Lord will take the steps he has indicated in order to find out whether it is possible to meet the objections which my noble friend has taken on behalf of a considerable body of English public opinion. If I might say a word on the merits, it seems to me rather as though the Irish creamery industry were asking for a little too much, in the sense that they are practically asking that the term "creamery butter" should mean Irish creamery butter. I should have thought that, from the point of view of the deception of the public, there would be greater risk if butter was described as Irish butter, possibly with an Irish name attached to it, in which case the public might be led to assume that it was creamery butter when it was not. But, as my noble friend has pointed out, to describe as creamery butter that which was not made in a creamery either in Ireland or elsewhere would, I understand, be an offence against the law. Therefore I should have hoped that Irish creameries were sufficiently protected by the insertion of this proviso.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01882">Amendments <i>reported</i> (according to Order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01883">Clause 1:</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01884" align="center"><i>Underground Premises.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01885"><b>1.</b>&#x2014;(1) On and after the first day of January one thousand nine hundred and fourteen, or such later date, not being later than the first clay of January one thousand nine hundred and fifteen, as the Secretary of State may by Order appoint, no underground room in a factory, workshop, or workplace shall be used for the purpose of any of the
<col>632</col>
processes or occupations specified in the Schedule to this Act unless duly certified by the district council to he suitable for the process or occupation named in the certificate, and unless the regulations made under this Act or the conditions contained in the certificate are complied with.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01886">(2) For the purposes of this Act an underground room shall mean any room any part of which is so situate that half or more than half the whole height thereof measured from the floor to the ceiling is below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street, or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the room.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01887"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think it will be necessary to detain your Lordships very long over these Amendments, because they were the subject of discussion when the Bill was last before the House in Committee; but I have not yet succeeded wholly in convincing His Majesty's Government and my noble friend opposite of the importance of striking out the proviso in Clause 2. That is the clause which provides that an underground room is not to be permitted unless it is suitable, and the question now to be discussed is what constitutes suitability. As the Bill is drawn, suitability is defined to be, in the first place, whether it complies with certain regulations made by the Home Office. That is a very proper provision. This is a restrictive Statute intended to say that henceforth certain premises which have been used for certain purposes are no longer to be so used, and that certain other premises which are hereafter to be constructed must be constructed so as to conform with the regulations as to suitability. It is therefore evident that such a provision should be the subject of regulations by the Home Office. But the Government inserted in a previous stage a proviso to Clause 2 to the effect that, supposing the Home Office have not had time to make the regulations or supposing they resolve that they will not make regulations, then all the precautions which follow on the making of the regulations are thrown to the winds anti the owners of these premises are to be subject to the discretion of no more important an authority than a district council with an appeal to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction. If regulations are made under the Bill by the Home Office, then Sections 80, 81 and 84 of the Factory Act apply, and the regulations have to be regularly published, opportunity has to be given for objection, and objections have to be carefully considered, and if the objections are persisted in and are not frivolous they have to be inquired into at a public
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0321"/>
<col>633</col>
inquiry. And, lastly, when made the regulations have to be laid on the Table of both Houses of Parliament, and if either House objects the regulations fall to the ground. But if the Home Office does not make the regulations here provided for and the local authority is allowed to do it instead, there are no precautions. There is no provision insisting that objections should be considered; there is no public inquiry; there is no laying of the regulations on the Table of Parliament. Simply because an inferior authority makes the regulations there are to be no precautions. You cannot expect the public to accept a provision that is, on the face of it, so unreasonable. Though I am here to ask your Lordships to make an alteration in the law in the direction of a more drastic provision, yet I am not prepared to go so far as that. The first four Amendments standing in my name deal with this point. At the moment, however, I move the first Amendment to delete the words "or the conditions contained in the certificate" at the end of subsection (1) of Clause 1.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01889"><member>THE PAYMASTER - GENERAL (LORD STRACHIE)</member><membercontribution>: I undertook on the previous occasion when this Bill was before the House to go fully into the question whether it was desirable to make any alteration on the lines suggested by the noble Marquess. I should like to remind the House, first of all, of the position as the Bill now stands. The local authority in certifying underground workplaces must be guided by the Home Office regulations if there are any such regulations. If the Home Office are to make regulations dealing with the various trades and processes in the Schedule, having regard also to the fact that it is intended that the Schedule should be added to very largely in the future, the result would be that these regulations would be very complicated indeed; they would require a great deal of research and consideration before they came into effect, and would consequently take considerable time to draw up. It is therefore provided in the Bill as it stands that, in default of any such regulations being made by the Home Office, then at their own discretion the local authority
<col>634</col>
is to exercise the powers which the noble Marquess seems to be so very much afraid of, though, as he pointed out, a Court of Summary Jurisdiction will have power to revise the district council regulations or forbid their being carried out. As regards orders made by district councils an inquiry is not so important, because they only deal with a small area and with matters within the knowledge of the members of the district council themselves and also in the knowledge of the constituents, who can, if necessary, correct any unfairness at the next district council election. As the Bill now stands, it is practically the same as when introduced by Lord Willoughby de Broke. The Home Office Amendments were merely of a drafting character and were necessary to put the Bill into shape. What the noble Marquess now proposes is that the local authority should only certify workplaces if regulations have been Made by the Home Office. The result of that would be that the Home Office would have to make regulations for all the trades included in the Schedule.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01890"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: The Bill would not operate until the regulations had been made. That is the effect of my Amendments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01891"><member>LORD STRACHIE</member><membercontribution>: Then the existing state of things would remain until the Home Office were able to make regulations. Clause 8 specifies that regulations are to be made as to the structure of underground rooms, the provision and use, as regards such rooms, of means of securing the maintenance of reasonable temperature, proper lighting and ventilation, freedom from damp, dust, effluvia and exhalations, and the carrying off of dust and fumes, and otherwise for securing the health of persons employed in underground rooms in the processes and occupations to which the Bill applies. The feeling of the Home Secretary is that he cannot agree to the responsibility being placed on the Home Office of making these regulations. While it might be very easy for a local authority acquainted with the local conditions to make regulations, I think the House will see that it would be very difficult indeed for a central authority like the Home Office to make them, as great research would be necessary to prevent injustice being done. We have a precedent for the course we suggest. At the present moment under the Factory and
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0322"/>
<col>635</col>
Workshop Act, 1901, the existing provisions as regards underground bakehouses are left entirely to the discretion of the local authority. If that is so in such an important matter as underground bakehouses, which not only affect the health of the workers in those bakehouses but the public who purchase the bread, why should it not be equally right for a local authority to deal with the matters covered in this Bill? They are the best judges in the matter of underground premises; and, on the whole, the Secretary of State thinks it will be best if the Bill follows the bakehouse section of the Factory and Workshop Act and leaves the matter in the hands of the local authorities. In any case the Secretary of State cannot give an assurance that the Home Office will make the regulations suggested in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01892"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I understand the noble Lord to suggest that in the view of the Department the best thing would be that the whole matter should remain in the hands of the local authorities. [Lord STRACHIE nodded assent.] If that is so, then are we not entitled to ask what is the object of the clause requiring the making of these regulations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01893"><member>LORD STRACHIE</member><membercontribution>: There may, of course, be cases where it might be desirable for the Home Office to make regulations. That is the advantage of having elasticity in the Bill. Clause 8 as it now stands and as it was introduced states that the Secretary of State "may" by Order make regulations. The Department desire to be left free to make regulations where necessary, though not necessarily in all cases. In most cases it will probably be to the advantage of every one that the matter should be left to the local authorities.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-01920"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I move to insert a new clause after Clause 7. This is in its nature a default clause, but it also arises out of a remark which the noble Lord opposite made on the last stage. He said that in respect of some of these trades and occupations the Home Office had no power at present of interference or of sending inspectors. It seemed good, therefore, to give them specific power under the Bill. The drafting of this clause is taken out of the Factory Acts and it applies the provisions of the Factory Acts to these underground workplaces. Under these words there would be, if the district council did not enforce the regulations made by the Home Office, complete power on the part of the Home Office to send in an inspector and put the law in force. As the Bill depends upon regulations the authority which makes the regulations should have the right to see
<col>638</col>
that they are carried out. We have no desire to make habitual interference by the Home Office necessary. We throw the duty on the district council in the first instance to see that the regulations are carried out, but if credible persons represent to the Home Office that the regulations are not being carried out, then my Amendment gives power to the Home Office to interfere. That is the sum total of the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE NAVAL POSITION IN THE<lb/> MEDITERRANEAN.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01951"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member> rose to call attention to the declarations of His Majesty's Government on the subject of the naval position in the Mediterranean; and to move for Papers. The noble Earl said: My Lords, we had a discussion in this House about a fortnight ago on the position in the Mediterranean, and that discussion was preliminary to the further discussion which it was understood would take place when the First Lord of the Admiralty had made his statement in the House of Commons. Yesterday that statement was made, and I think none of your Lordships who has read that statement but will agree with me that it was a very remarkable statement. I think I might summarise it thus. Mr. Churchill came to grips in his speech with the naval policy of certain foreign countries; but he did not come to grips with the naval policy of this country. He indicated in general and eloquent terms the kind of policy which he thought was essential for the safety of our Empire, but he did not&#x2014;and that was the most significant part of his speech&#x2014;he did not tell us in what manner His Majesty's Government propose to give effect to those principles.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01952">I make no apology for quoting to your Lordships some of the statements made in the House of Commons last night, particularly those in which the position of navies in Europe to-day was summarised, because I do not think a statement of equal gravity has been made in either House of Parliament in recent years. Mr. Churchill said in respect of Germany&#x2014;I quote from <i>The Times</i> report&#x2014;
<quote>"A Third Battle Squadron of eight battleships will be created and maintained in full commission as a part of the Active Battle Fleet, Whereas, according to the unamended law, the Active Battle Fleet consisted of 17 battleships, four battle or large armoured cruisers, and 12 small cruisers, in the near future that Active Fleet will consist of 25 battleships, eight battle or large armoured cruisers, and 18 small cruisers, and whereas at present, owing to the system of recruitment which prevails in Germany, the German Fleet is less fully mobile during the winter than during the summer months, it will, through the operation of this law, not only be increased in strength, but rendered much mere readily available. Ninety-nine torpedo-boat destroyers, or torpedo-boats as they are called in Germany, instead of lid, will be maintained in full commission out of the total of 144. Three-quarters of a million has already been taken under the general Estimate for the year for the building of submarines. The Navy Law adds a quarter of a million to this, and that is a provision which, so
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0326"/>
<col>643</col>
far as we can judge from a study of the finance, would appear to be repeated in subsequent years. Seventy-two new submarines will be built within the currency of the law, and of these it is apparently proposed to maintain fifty-four with full permanent crews. Taking a general view of the effect of the law, nearly four-fifths of the entire German Navy will be maintained in full permanent commission&#x2014;that is to say, instantly and constantly ready for war. Such a proportion is remarkable, and, so far as I am aware, finds no example in the previous practice of any modern Naval Power."</quote>
Truly a startling and remarkable statement: The First Lord then went on to explain that there was provision in the German Bill for increasing the personnel by 5,700 men a year, and that the German Naval Estimates had risen in a very short period from &#x00A3;11,000,000 to &#x00A3;23,000,000. These again, were his words&#x2014;
<quote>"We are shortly to be confronted with twenty-five German battleships in full commission in the Actual Battle Fleet, the whole of which will often be concentrated within a few hours of our shores."</quote>
Turning from northern waters to the Mediterranean, Mr. Churchill said&#x2014;
<quote>"The naval position in the Mediterranean is about to undergo a series of very important changes. At present neither Austria nor Italy have any Dreadnought vessels actually commissioned. Within a few weeks and possibly sooner the first Italian Dreadnought will be ready, and thereafter both Powers at short intervals will be reinforced by powerful modern units until towards the end of 1915 Austria may be able to dispose of four and Italy of five, perhaps six, Dreadnought vessels."</quote>
And in respect to the Mediterranean Mr. Churchill said further&#x2014;and I draw your Lordships' attention particularly to these words&#x2014;
<quote>"I am bound to add, however, that the information which has reached the Admiralty seems to indicate that one of the Mediterranean Powers t have mentioned is contemplating another considerable naval programme. We do not need in these neuters to act on surmise or by anticipation. It will be sufficient for me to say that if this information should prove to he correct, it would constitute a new fact requiring prompt attention and not included in any of the forecasts I have given of future naval construction."</quote>
Let me summarise this. I am sure your Lordships would agree that all Parties must look the facts in the face, without menace to any foreign country but without endeavouring to minimise the gravity of the situation to our own fellow-countrymen. This means that almost immediately Germany will have in the North Sea a more powerful Fleet than was the whole British Navy twelve years ago when I had the honour of first going to the Board of Admiralty, and that that Fleet will be
<col>644</col>
practically in a position for immediate war&#x2014;such as no other Fleet has yet been. Mr. Churchill laid great stress, and quite rightly, on that fact, because it is the key to the whole situation, and it makes the formality of a declaration of war a mere politeness, because with the Fleet in that condition a blow could be delivered simultaneously with the notice. Therefore I think Mr. Churchill did great service when he laid special stress on these peculiar conditions in the North Sea.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01953">Then, my Lords, look at the position in the Mediterranean. In the Mediterranean there will be in the immediate future a fleet of battleships belonging to the allies of Germany more powerful than either the British Fleet in the Mediterranean or the British Fleet in the Channel and North Sea was at the epoch to which I have alluded&#x2014;twelve years ago when I first went to the Admiralty. The First Lord was careful to warn us that he has reason to suppose that the progress of the power of the navies of these countries is not going to stop short there in the Mediterranean. He clearly warns us of a distinct further increase on the part of one of these Powers. The picture is alarming in the sense that it does and must entail on the people of this country an ever increasing sacrifice for the simple and mere purpose of maintaining the integrity of our shores and the peace of the world. Therefore I think I was justified when I said that the First Lord of the Admiralty came to full grips with the situation as it affects those foreign Powers. He concealed nothing from the country. He laid stress on the really salient points, and without drawing his picture in alarmist or sensational colours he drew it with strict and literal accuracy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01954">When I turn to the declaration of policy with which Mr. Churchill followed this explanation the character of his remarks changes. Again I must trouble your Lordships with some quotations. The first is of a general character, and I cannot too whole heartily subscribe to every word of it. Mr. Churchill said&#x2014;
<quote>"We ought to learn from our German neighbours, whose policy marches unswervingly towards its goal across the lifetime of a whole generation. The two general principles that I would deduce from these observations, and which will guide my remarks this afternoon, are, first, that we must have an ample margin of strength instantly ready; and, secondly, that there must he a steady and systematic development of our naval forces untiringly pursued over a number of years."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0327"/>
<col>645</col>
And the Prime Minister endorsed the spirit of that utterance. For Mr. Asquith said&#x2014;
<quote>"The House may feel assured that when we produce our Estimates next year, with the added knowledge and fresh light acquired in the interval, and with the prospective requirements of the situation, we shall not fall short of anything our advisers think necessary to fully and adequately safeguard British interests in the Mediterranean and elsewhere."</quote>
Those are two purely general though most commendable utterances. It is when we come to the embodiment of the principles contained in those utterances in a specific policy that disappointment and anxiety supervene. The only allusions to a definite statement of the measures considered necessary by His Majesty's Government are to be found in the quotations I am now going to give your Lordships. Mr. Churchill states that it will be necessary to add four battleships to the building programme in the next five years. He states that by a re-shuffling of the Fleet and the withdrawal of battleships from the Mediterranean he has raised the number of fully-commissioned battleships available in home waters from sixteen to twenty-four. He tells us that at the end of 1914&#x2014;and I want to draw your Lordships' particular attention to these figures&#x2014;we shall have a minimum of thirty-three and a maximum of forty-one fully manned and in full commission, against which the corresponding German figure is twenty-nine. Now thirty-three to twenty-nine does not sound a very satisfactory proportion. I certainly do not think it satisfactory, and the First Lord obviously did not expect the House of Commons to think it satisfactory either. But his re-adjustment of the Fleet will bring us at the end of 1914 to that position.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01955">Now I turn to the proposals about the men. In asking for 5,000 men this year Mr. Churchill says&#x2014;and I should very much like the noble Marquess the Leader of the House to give me some explanation of this extraordinary statement&#x2014;that "we started with 2,000 men short." Why? How came it that the Board of Admiralty allowed the numbers voted by the House of Commons last year to fall 2,000 short? Especially as the First Lord repeated what everyone who has had the honour of being at the Board of Admiralty knows&#x2014;that there is no difficulty in getting men and boys for the Navy. Either this statement in the report of the Fir, t Lord's speech is a misprint, which I hope it is, or an explanation
<col>646</col>
of what is to me perfectly unintelligible is required. The First Lord warns us that for several years to come a large annual addition of men will be necessary. Before I pass from the matter of <i>personnel</i> I should like to say that I noticed with great pleasure the First Lord's statement that he was going to inquire how far and in what way it was necessary or advisable to improve the pay of the lower-deck ratings. I am quite sure such an inquiry has not been undertaken one moment too soon, and although any inquiry of that, nature of course entails a serious obligation on the taxpayers of the country owing to the number of men involved, still, considering the rise in the general cost of living, the increase in rates of wages, and the great increase in the intelligence of the men of the Fleet and the highly skilled work they have to do and their splendid physique, I am quite sure the time has come for the inquiry promised by the First Lord.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01956">Then Mr. Churchill went on to tell us what is the re-adjustment proposed in the Mediterranean. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"We have therefore determined to withdraw the six older battleships from Malta and to replace them with four battle cruisers of the Invincible type. These vessels will go out in the winter, and in the interval there will be a powerful battle squadrons available which will lie able to cruise in the Mediterranean, tilling in the gap before these vessels can he fitted for service there. We intend further to strengthen the quality of the armoured cruiser squadron based on Malta."</quote>
And, finally&#x2014;
<quote>"It will also be necessary for us to add to the submarine and destroyer flotillas at Malta and to establish a new torpedo station at Alexandria."</quote>
Mr. Balfour also made a remarkable speech in the debate in the other House yesterday from which I will only trouble your Lordships with two quotations which bear on the point of the First Lord's speech we are now considering&#x2014;
<quote>MR. BALFOUR: I think I gathered from something that fell from him in his speech that the right hon. gentleman quite admits that he cannot look beyond the next two or two and a half years, and that there may be developments which will require a great change even in the Mediterranean arrangements.</quote>
<quote>MR. CHURCHILL: About three years from now.</quote>
<quote>MR. BALFOUR: And I gather also that the right hon. gentleman thinks he is safe in not making up his mind as to what new construction he will make until next year. Is not lie running it rather fine?</quote>
I hope the noble Marquess who leads this House will reassure us on that latter point.
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0328"/>
<col>647</col>
I hope to show presently that in my opinion we are running it rather fine. Then Mr. Balfour added&#x2014;
<quote>"The speech just delivered must cause grave thought and anxiety in the country.&#x2026; The First Lord told us of our dangers, and yet I think he will admit he has told us very little of how he intends to meet those dangers."</quote>
It is on that aspect of the case that I should like to say a word or two in your Lordships' House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01957">In the first place, let us deal with the Mediterranean. I frankly confess that I belong to the school which attaches great importance to the Mediterranean. I have no intellectual agreement with those who think that the Mediterranean can be safely abandoned by us either in peace or in war, and I believe it to be a perfect heresy to suppose that our position in the Mediterranean could be in any sense whatever secured in war simply by adding to the garrison in Egypt and establishing a large flotilla of torpedo boat destroyers and submarines at Gibraltar. The only result of that policy would be that the more troops there were stationed in Egypt the more prisoners there would be for an enemy to take, and the fate of those troops would be the same as that of the French troops after the Battle of the Nile. I admit that in war the Suez Canal may be blocked. That is a contingency which has always been foreseen. I deny that it could be blocked for the whole of a war, and I deny that the whole importance of the Mediterranean is derived from the Suez Canal. Putting aside the naval question altogether, it seems to me to be politically necessary that this country should maintain the position in the Mediterranean in peace which she has held during the last 200 years. Therefore I am not prepared to scrutinise too closely what does appear to me to be a change of opinion on the part of His Majesty's Government. I certainly did understand some weeks ago that the policy then announced was a policy of virtual abandonment of the Mediterranean. The noble Marquess opposite will doubtless dispute that that would have been the effect of the policy. I will not argue that with him, because it must remain a matter of opinion; but I submit that the whole of the people of the Mediterranean would have taken my view of it and not his. Therefore I welcome with thankfulness the second thoughts which have led to a powerful cruiser squadron being based on Malta.</p>
<col>648</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01958">I accept that, however, only as a makeshift. Battle cruisers are better than cruisers, but they are not battleships. The only possible permanent basis for our naval strength and political prestige in the Mediterranean must be a squadron of battleships. Indeed, if I wanted to be critical I might point out that battle cruisers, valuable as they are, were never designed, so far as I know, to act in isolated detachments. They have their exact place in naval tactics but always as part of a Fleet containing battleships. Therefore I fasten on to the admissions in the First Lord's speech which point to the fact that this arrangement is only temporary. After all, the responsibility for the distribution of such ships as this country possesses at the moment must rest on the Board of Admiralty, and if the Board of Admiralty say that, with the ships we have and given the impossibility of abandoning the Mediterranean, the best advice they can offer is to send there for the next two years this composite squadron of armoured cruisers and cruiser battleships then I say the responsibility rests upon the Admiralty. But this admittedly temporary arrangement must not be allowed to obscure the fact that these ships are to be taken away from the Atlantic to be put into the Mediterranean. That proves conclusively the assertion which I ventured to make in this House a fortnight ago, that we are demonstrably a whole squadron of modern battleships short. If we had eight more modern battleships there would be no need to think of a temporary policy in the Mediterranean. Assuming for the moment that the country, on the advice of the Board of Admiralty, accepts this makeshift provision in the Mediterranean, how can we regard without alarm the margin which will exist a short time hence in the North Sea&#x2014;a margin stated by Mr. Churchill to be four ships. Thirty-three to twenty-nine is a wholly insufficient proportion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01959">Apart from the difficulty in the Mediterranean, it is quite clear that we still have arrears of both ships and men to make up in the Atlantic and the North Sea. I wish to lay very great stress on the fact that ships are nothing if you have not really trained and competent seamen, stokers, and marines to put into them. If I knew that the Government were really going to stick to this programme of adding 5,000 men or thereabouts to the Navy for the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0329"/>
<col>649</col>
next five or six years, that would go far to reassure me; but I confess that the uncertainty and want of definite promises in the statement of the First Lord has failed to remove the anxiety which I feel. What really is the origin of all our difficulty? It is that the advice which the First Lord of the Admiralty gives us now has not been followed. These words used by Mr. Churchill ought to be written up in letters of gold in this House, in the House of Commons, and in every constituency throughout the country&#x2014;
<quote>"We ought to learn from our German neighbours, whose policy marches unswervingly towards its goal across the lifetime of a whole generation. The two general principles that I would deduce from these observations, and which will guide my remarks this afternoon, are, first, that we must have an ample margin of strength instantly ready; and, secondly, that there must be a steady and systematic development of our naval forces untiringly pursued over a amber of years."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01960">Why do we find ourselves in this position at all? It arises from the dropping of the Cawdor programme five years ago. I do not think there ever was a more unfortunate and deplorable blunder made by any Government in their responsibility for national defence than the dropping of the Cawdor programme five years ago. The whole political position of this country in Europe and the peace of the world would rest upon a surer and sounder foundation to-day had that policy never been interrupted. Definite promises have now been given by the First Lord and by the Prime Minister. I admit that those promises are distinct, and we shall not forget them. Let me again remind you what the Prime Minister said&#x2014;
<quote>"The House may feel assured that when we produce our Estimates next year, with the added knowledge and fresh light acquired in the interval, and with the prospective requirements of the situation, we shall not fall short of anything our advisers think necessary to fully and adequately safeguard British interests in the Mediterranean and elsewhere."</quote>
Why, then, do we feel anxiety? Why are we not wholly reassured? It is because we remember what happened to the Cawdor programme, and because we are told in the Government Press day by day, and told by the familiars of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that there is division in the Cabinet in regard to this matter. If we knew that the Cabinet were united then we should know that the nation was united, and we should have no fear that this policy would not be carried out. But it is not unreasonable that we should be alarmed when
<col>650</col>
we read what is written by the friends of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#x2014;the gentlemen who take their early cup of coffee, their midday meal, and their afternoon tea with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and cull from his lips when be puts on his pyjamas in the evening the last instructions for the morning issue. These gentlemen tell us every day that there is no union in the Cabinet, and that the party which is opposed to a steady, systematic, unswerving naval policy is in the ascendency. Therefore is it unnatural that we should feel anxious Mr. Asquith tells us that the Government will "not fall short of anything our advisers think necessary." A very great responsibility rests on all the members of the Board of Admiralty. I have never been able to understand, and I do not now understand, how the Board of Admiralty could have agreed to the dropping of the Cawdor programme. Of course, the position of Sea Lords is in our Constitution a very delicate one. They would make themselves ridiculous and the system impossible if they always insisted upon their own particular opinion in minor matters. The only possible spokesman for the Board of Admiralty is the First Lord. But they have a definite position, and the country does regard their counter signature as assuring it that in the opinion of the Board of Admiralty as a whole, and not merely of the First Lord and of His Majesty's Government, the naval provision year by year is sufficient for the safety of the country and of the Empire. For that reason I lay stress upon the Prime Minister's words&#x2014;that the Government will not fall short of anything their advisers think necessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01961">I cannot help agreeing with Mr. Balfour that the Government are running their policy fine. You have left yourselves little time owing to the dropping of the Cawdor programme. On you rests, I think, the most tremendous responsibility that can possibly rest upon a Government, and that is to see that run do not run the time too fine. If next year and in the years ensuing you act up to the spirit of the utterances of the Prime Minister and the First Lord of the Admiralty you will be doing your duty; if you fail, you will incur the greatest responsibility that could fall upon any Government and with consequences which are absolutely incalculable. As Mr. Balfour pointed out&#x2014;and the Prime Minister endorsed his words&#x2014;the British Navy is not
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0330"/>
<col>651</col>
only the only guarantee for the integrity of these shores and the existence of the Empire, but it is the foundation stone on which the peace of the world is built. There is no other so great a security for the peace of the world as the adequate strength of the British Navy. Mr. Balfour analysed, with his own peculiar subtlety and skill, the effect of alliances and <i>ententes</i> in Europe, and his conclusion was that on the whole they made war less probable. He summarised his view thus&#x2014;
<quote>"The result will be that any single Power indulging in reckless and offensive acts of aggression will find itself isolated from its friends, but in conflict with au overwhelming enemy, in conflict, I mean, with the other organisations which, by hypothesis, are the subject of this gratuitous attack."</quote>
But does that quite exhaust the matter? I agree that no Power would like to be so obviously and hopelessly in the wrong as to make it difficult for its allies and friends to help it. But is there not another side of the case? May not allies and friends say to themselves, "We cannot afford to let this Fiver be crushed," no matter whether it was right or wrong in making war? Is not the balance, in fact, so fine that the disappearance of one Power from the equation would upset all calculations so that nations and Governments will be afraid ever to face that contingency? Therefore I fear that the headstrong wilfulness, and unjustifiable conduct of one Power might not necessarily work out its own remedy so exactly as Mr. Balfour hopes that it may. I have already said that we have to wait until next year for the final announcement of the whole details of the Government policy, but I do not think I should be doing my duty if I did not state now quite clearly that, in my opinion, in addition to the ships of which notice has been given by Mr. Churchill and in addition to the continuous increase of men and stores, we require and should have at the earliest possible moment a complete new squadron of battleships at least eight in number. That is what I reckon to be our chief deficiency at this moment, and I had hoped that the Government would have had recourse at the earliest moment to some such measure as Lord George Hamilton resorted to in 1889, providing for the addition to the Fleet of a definite battle unit in the shape of a squadron by means of borrowed money repayable in a short period. That is what I believe to be required at this moment. I say again that the men are even more important, than the ships, and I hope that no influences that
<col>652</col>
may be brought to bear on the Government will induce them to swerve from the steady systematic increase of the <i>personnel</i> of the Navy, which is essential to make any ships, old or new, of value.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01962">Before sitting down I must allude to what Mr. Churchill and Mr. Asquith said about the Dominions. These were Mr. Churchill's words&#x2014;
<quote>"Apart altogether from the material aid, the moral effect of the arrival upon blue water of these new nations of the British Empire cannot be measured. The unity of the British Empire carries with it the safety of its component parts, and the safety of the British Empire probably carries with it the peace of the world. If we are told that the beginnings of co-operation in defence must carry with them the beginnings of association in policy, then I say that both in measures of defence and in the direction of policy the co-operation of the Dominions with the United kingdom will be of inestimable benefit to the strength of the Empire and to the general cause of peace."</quote>
And the Prime Minister said&#x2014;
<quote>"But, without committing ourselves in any degree to particular forms in the matter, we share with our great Dominions the feeling which has become more and more conscious and articulate as years have gone on throughout the Empire, that we have a common heritage and interest, and that in the enjoyment of that heritage, and in the discharge of the duties which those interests involve, we ought more and more to be conscious partners with one another."</quote>
I have no hesitation in saying that the utterance of those words by leaders of the Party opposite in the House of Commons is a landmark in the history of the world. They mark an evolution in the history of this country and of the whole Empire. We do not for a moment grudge that it has fallen to the lot of our political opponents to be in office when the time came to say those words, because they are sentiments which we on this side share and endorse to the full, and there is nothing at which we would more rejoice than that the whole question of Imperial unity should be removed from Party politics, as we hope the question of the Navy may be. In the womb of the evolution foreshadowed by these words lies, I believe, not only the possibility of the liberty and existence uninterfered with by the foreigner of this country and the other nations of the Empire, but also the only hope for the permanent peace of the world. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01963"><i>Moved</i>, That there be laid before the House Papers relating to the naval position in the Mediterranean.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Selborne.</i>)</p>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0331"/>
<col>653</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01964"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD INCHCAPE</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps the noble Marquess the Leader of the House, before he replies, will allow me to say a few words on this subject which is closely allied with the Eastern trade of this country with which I may claim to have had some acquaintance for a good many years. Although it has been made perfectly clear from the statements in another place last night by the Prime Minister and the First Lord of the Admiralty that there is no intention to abandon the Mediterranean, still although I am not pessimistic I cannot say that feel altogether satisfied. Unless we continue to hold undisputed supremacy in that part of the world our trade position will be seriously endangered, and our ability to hold Egypt, our Eastern possessions, our Far Eastern possessions, and our Southern possessions will undoubtedly be jeopardised, and our ability to protect our Eastern trade, our trade with the Black Sea, and our trade with the Mediterranean itself will be seriously endangered.<lb/>
The First Lord of the Admiralty said last night in the House of Commons that to maintain a naval force in the Mediterranean superior to the combined Fleets of Austria and Italy would impose extravagant burdens on our people, and he demurred to the suggestion. He further said that the force he proposed to keep there would, in conjunction with the Navy of France, make our combined forces superior to all possible combinations. He foreshadowed, however, that within the next few years our squadron in the Mediterranean would require very considerable reinforcement. If I read his speech correctly, we are now relying, and must continue to rely for some time to come, on the help which we receive from the Navy of France. I confess I do not like it. Of the 4,969 vessels that passed through the Suez Canal last year, with a total tonnage of 18,000,000, no fewer than 3,089 were British, with a tonnage of 12,000,000. It is difficult to say how many British vessels enter and leave the Mediterranean every year by the Straits of Gibraltar, but on July 18 of this year&#x2014;that is, five days ago&#x2014;there were 404 British vessels, with a net tonnage of 841,000, in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, none of which would be secure if we lost command of the Mediterranean. Then the Suez Canal itself, half of which is owned by the British Government and brings into the Treasury &#x00A3;1,200,000 per annum, would, as the noble Earl has said, be liable to be blocked and held up.<lb/>
<col>654</col>
Figures in Blue-books are useful, but they are unconvincing. Probably a conviction of this kind led the First Lord of the Admiralty to invite the members of both Houses of Parliament the other day to Spithead to visit no Fleet in being. Many noble Lords now in the House have been to the East. I would ask them to recall the satisfaction and the pardonable pride which they felt on approaching Port Said, on passing through the Suez Canal, on making Aden, Bombay Harbour, Colombo, Penang, Singapore, Hong Kong, even Shanghai and the Yangtse River, when, as the shipping in those places appeared above the horizon and the bunting could be distinguished, practically the only flag to be seen was the Red Ensign. No more penny-wise and pound-foolish policy could be conceived for this country than to abandon our undisputed control in the Middle Sea. No matter what expenditure is involved, no matter what sacrifices we have to endure in maintaining our individual supremacy, that expenditure and those sacrifices must be courageously faced. If our supremacy goes even temporarily, apart from the loss of our prestige which is bound to follow, and apart from the decadence of our shipping which must ensue, a great portion of the trade of these islands will be absolutely ruined and we shall sink to the category of a second-class Power. The expenditure should be regarded as another national insurance premium against unemployment and all classes should be made to contribute. While we desire to live on terms of peace and friendliness with all nations, we want no entanglements. We do not want isolation, but we desire to preserve our individual freedom; we believe that any understanding by which another nation would come under an obligation to us would be as bad for that nation as it would be for us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01965"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the debate so far this evening has extended over a somewhat wider range than did that which was a preliminary to it the other day, and I confess that I had supposed that on this occasion the noble Earl opposite would have confined himself to an examination of the specific proposals in relation to the Mediterranean with which his Motion alone deals&#x2014;that he would not have embarked upon a full examination of the entire naval situation as described by the First Lord of the Admiralty in another place yesterday, but would have deferred to some other day the wider consideration which is necessarily
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0332"/>
<col>655</col>
involved in dealing with the whole subject. I hope, therefore, that the noble Earl will pardon me if I am not able to deal fully with some of the questions which he has raised, because I did not anticipate that such questions as, for instance, the necessary margin of strength in the North Sea would have formed part of our discussion this evening.<lb/>
I do not dispute for a moment, and nobody who read the First Lord's speech delivered in another place yesterday would dispute, that in one sense the position is one of no little gravity. That was evident from the tone of all the speeches which were delivered in the House of Commons yesterday. But while admitting that the position is one of gravity, it is important, I venture to think, to face it in as cool a manner as possible. I do not for a moment say that the noble Earl did anything else, but some of those in the country who discuss this question approach it in anything but a cool way. I am certain that we have to guard against the alarmist feelings of extreme partisans at either end of the scale&#x2014;either those wh4 are apparently alarmed at any ship being built, or the opposite kind of alarmists who desire a programme of almost unlimited building. The conclusions of both of those extreme partisans have, in my opinion, to be most carefully guarded against. I took occasion yesterday to utter a warning against undue credulity in regard to newspaper paragraphs, and I may venture to assure the noble Earl, in spite of all the paragraphs he has read, that the gravity of the situation is not increased or its complications added to by any difference of opinion in His Majesty's Government on this matter. It is, of course, perfectly true that as trustees of public money we do not take any pleasure in spending it either on shipbuilding or upon anything else of the sort. We do not belong to that school which appears to regard it apparently as a positively satisfactory position to be obliged either to borrow large sums of money which posterity will have to pay, or to add to the burdens of the country if we pay our way as we go. I can say quite positively that His Majesty's Government do not regard such a prospect as that with anything like satisfaction, although I hope equally there is not a single member of His Majesty's Government who is not prepared to face what can be regarded as necessary expenditure.<lb/>
As regards one point mentioned by the noble Earl outside the Mediterranean ques-
<col>656</col>
tion pure and simple, I will say one word. I allude to the quotation which he read from Mr. Churchill's speech in relation to the question of manning, in which, if I remember right, the word "shortage" was used. Mr. Churchill spoke of the Admiralty as having been 2,000 men short. I take it that the use of that expression arose in this way. The Manning Vote was, if I remember right, for 136,000 odd men, thus giving an increase of 3,000 men which had been arranged for last year. That figure was subject, and was bound to remain subject, to what might be the added manning strength of the German Navy under their new law, and when the German addition was made&#x2014;as to whether it was going to be made it was, of course, impossible for our Admiralty to express a definite opinion, still less to act upon that opinion&#x2014;when the German addition was made it was found necessary to increase our strength by a further 2,000, making 5,000 additional men in all. Mr. Churchill is proceeding, as I understand, to get those men. He was, therefore, in that sense 2,000 short, but he had only arranged for an addition of 3,000, and it was not until the German programme was announced that it was known that it had to be met by the additional 2,000 men. There was no question of shortage, as the noble Earl seemed to think, owing to any default on the part of the Admiralty. It was merely a colloquial way in which my right hon. friend put the fact that he had to wait to know whether the increase would have to be 3,000 or 5,000.<lb/>
I come to the particular question of the Mediterranean. The House may remember that when it was discussed on the last occasion I mentioned the various schools of opinion and of policy on which action might be founded, and I ventured to point out that logically taken each of them could be shown to end in a <i>reductio ad absurdum.</i> That is to say, whether you were going to engage in a universal naval competition with the world, or whether you were going to pin yourselves down by formal alliances, or whether you were simply going to hope for the best and trust that in any critical moment something favourable would turn up&#x2014;that whichever of those courses you choose to adopt you would lay yourselves open to very simple and easy criticism. The course which we have taken and the actual proposals which we are making for the Fleet in the Mediterranean are, I think, as little open to criticism of the kind I then
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0333"/>
<col>657</col>
indicated as any which could be made. I need not describe those proposals at length. Noble Lords know quite well what battle cruisers are. They are enormously powerful vessels varying in size and ranging from 17,000 up to 30,000 tons in some of the newest, type. They carry, as a rule, eight of the biggest and most powerful guns, and they also have a most powerful secondary armament of quick-firing guns. Their speed is greater than that of any battleship; if I remember right, it can be stated as a minimum of twenty-five knots, and in some of the larger and later ships it reaches to a considerably higher figure than that. Four of those ships, as was pointed out by Mr. Churchill, are to form the backbone of our present Mediterranean squadron, and in addition to them there will be a squadron, a very powerful squadron, of armoured cruisers, not, of course, of the tremendous type of those that are now called battle cruisers, but some of the most powerful armoured cruisers afloat. In addition to this exceedingly powerful squadron there is to be a defensive force of torpedo boats at Alexandria, and also a flotilla of destroyers and submarines based on Malta. It may be taken, I suppose, as practically agreed by the noble Earl that so far as regards the immediate future that is a force competent to represent our interests in the Mediterranean, and it is not until we come to the year 1915 and the following years that the question arises as to the value which a force of that particular character will have to represent us there.<lb/>
I may say at once that my noble friend who spoke last did not lay, in my judgment, at all too much stress upon the paramount importance of the Mediterranean as one of our great highways of commerce. The mass that pours through that neck of the bottle is, as we know, enormously large. I suppose I am accurate in saying that the great volume of the Antipodean trade generally comes either by one Cape or the other in the mass&#x2014;either by Cape Horn or by the Cape of Good Hope; but as regards the Far Eastern and Indian trade, to say nothing of our trade with the Mediterranean countries themselves, the volume and value are enormously large, and it includes, it is important to remember, not merely trade in conveniences or luxuries, but a distinct and substantial part of our grain trade, on which, of course, we depend for our existence. It includes also a substantial portion of our cotton trade. Neither need I repeat
<col>658</col>
what I said on the last occasion on the importance of maintaining a position in the Mediterranean such as will make it clear both to those who are our friends and to those who may from time to time regard us with suspicion that we are not descending from our position in the world and not placing complete reliance upon the possible friendly offices of other Powers when the time of danger comes. In view of the growth of the navies of other Powers such as we shall presumably find in existence after 1915, there remains no doubt room for a difference of opinion as to what will be necessary to protect our trade and to maintain our position. The noble Earl has stated with great candour that he would at once add a squadron of eight ships of the Dreadnought, type by means of a loan, and I do not think it is an unfair conclusion to draw that he would regard that, not as an isolated act, but as representing the measure of the preponderance which we ought to maintain, and that consequent he would be prepared for more loans and more Dreadnoughts when in his opinion further occasion arose.<lb/>
To leave for one moment the question of the Mediterranean, we are entitled, I think, to ask, although we shall certainly not get a reply, where and at what point is this demand for absolute preponderance to stop. It is quite conceivable that the time might come when eight Dreadnoughts in the Mediterranean&#x2014;altogether apart from the North Sea Fleet, or our Fleet in Home waters, which is, perhaps, a better way to describe it, which it appears to be argued must be regarded as a quite separate line of defence&#x2014;may give us no great preponderance over a potential combination against us there. Again, in the year 1915 there will be, if I remember right, seven Dreadnoughts belonging to various South American States. Are we to be told that it is necessary for us if we are not to abrogate our position in the world to maintain a maritime preponderance on the South American coast? It would not be difficult, if you desired to draw a picture, to put a case together in which those South American Dreadnoughts or some of them might inflict serious damage upon British possessions in some part of the world. If you are prepared, as some people seem to be prepared, to consider every country as our potential enemy and scarcely one as our probable friend, I confess it seems to me impossible to argue on that basis. That is why I welcome the illuminating observations made in another
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0334"/>
<col>659</col>
place yesterday by Mr. Balfour, to which reference has been made by the noble Earl opposite, on what I will venture to call the human probabilities as distinct from the paper probabilities of the case&#x2014;human probabilities which a number of people sternly refuse to take into consideration at all.<lb/>
As I say, the general effect of some of the criticisms has been to regard all countries as probable foes and scarcely any as possible friends. Dealing with figures in that way you can produce the most blood-curdling combinations which can possibly be conceived. For instance, in the most lighthearted way a combination of Austria-Hungary and Italy against us in the Mediterranean is talked of as though it were not merely possible but ought to be regarded as a contingency against which full provision must be made. As it happens, there are no two countries in Europe for whom we have entertained in the past, and I venture to say still entertain, greater feelings of sympathy than for Austria-Hungary and Italy, and yet in order to make out a particular case it is necessary to assume, not only that they are united against us, but that at the same time we are either at war or also in danger of war with Germany, and that the remaining great Mediterranean Power, France, is either totally unconcerned or intentionally hostile. I repeat once more that dealing with the figures in that way it is possible to prove almost anything that is alarming. But Mr. Balfour in his speech yesterday, which I gather did not entirely satisfy the noble Earl opposite, pointed out that the worst conceivable combination against us was one which, working on the ordinary lines with which practical men contemplate the chances of life, ought not to be seriously taken into account.<lb/>
But even if you allow to a greater extent than I should be disposed to allow that certain combinations are possible, it is surely reasonable to examine with care the probable individual strength of the various parties of whom each combination is composed. It is not unreasonable or too happy-go-lucky to point out that the programmes&#x2014;particularly the programmes of Powers who have not had long shipbuilding traditions&#x2014;are not likely to be precisely realised in point of time, and it is not unfair, therefore, in devising our preparations beforehand to take into view those considerations, though, of course, too
<col>660</col>
great stress ought not to be laid upon them. For that reason I am not prepared to admit the force of the criticism made by Mr. Balfour and repeated by the noble Earl, that in not immediately coming forward with a large new programme we are running things too fine. The noble Earl thinks that we have run it far too fine already, because during the last six or seven years he thinks we ought to have begun building on the Cawdor programme scale, although I suppose he would have desired to add to that scale during the last two or three years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01966"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: If you had stuck to the Cawdor programme, you would not have had to build so many ships afterwards.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01967"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: That is one of those things which I think the noble Earl will admit must remain a matter of opinion, because it involves the consideration not only of what we did but of what various other countries in Europe have or have not done or might have done. But there is an objection surely, and it is not only a financial objection, in being overstrong at a particular time. The financial difficulty is, of course, considerable&#x2014;at least it is one which cannot be altogether put aside. You are spending money <i>ex hypothesi</i> before it is absolutely necessary to spend it. But, my Lords, there are other objections. If you hurry on your programme to the utmost extent you lose the benefit of the continued improvements possible in design and almost certain in construction and in armaments which are from time to time made in ships even nominally those of the same type. You have only to compare the original Dreadnought, which is now talked of almost with sympathy as quite an old-fashioned ship, with the very latest battleship, and you cannot fail to be impressed by the distinct advantage belonging to delay in completing. There is another consideration. If you come forward with a great splash of a programme you help to bring about the evil which you desire to avoid, because the people to whom you announce that you are building against them are positively spurred on to the acceleration and possibly to the enlargement of their programme, and to that extent, therefore, you tend to defeat your own object.<lb/>
It is true that next year, in view of the maritime strength of the world three, four,
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0335"/>
<col>661</col>
or five years hence, it will be necessary to look the situation once more in the face. Whether it will be the plea of the Admiralty that it will be impossible for us to be fairly represented in the Mediterranean without our possessing there a large fleet of battleships&#x2014;upon that I will not profess to give any opinion, because I have no idea. The particular functions, strategic and technical, which can be fulfilled by a powerful cruiser squadron are, of course, different from those which a Fleet of the line of battle fills, but it may be argued that as a permanent provision some such form, possibly extended, of holding the Mediterranean by cruisers might sufficiently uphold our dignity and preserve our interests there. Upon that I will not attempt to express any opinion, but I cannot, for the reasons I have given, admit We truth of the charge that my right hon. friend and the Admiralty and consequently also His Majesty's Government are running it too fine in this matter, because I cannot conceive a condition of affairs in which the margin of time is not sufficient for our purpose. The noble Earl will forgive me if do not at this moment enter into the question of the inadequacy of the margin in the North Sea. That is a matter which I can assure him has received the closest and most anxious consideration, but I do not think ally useful purpose would be served by my attempting now to discuss the various considerations involved and the various opinions entertained by the most experienced and practical men on the value of particular forms of armaments and particular methods either of offence or defence. I would ask the noble Earl and the House to believe that, even if we cannot follow the noble Earl in his shipbuilding programme or in seine of the views which he has expressed as to the necessities of the case, we are quite as fully alive as he can be to the necessity of maintaining impregnable the defence of this country, sharing the belief that such a defence is the surest guarantee for the peace of the world.<lb/>
I will only say before I sit down that I share with the noble Earl and welcome the sentiments which he expressed with regard to the co-operation of the great Dominions of the Crown in this matter of the naval strength of the Empire. Their co-operation is welcomed in the heartiest way by men of all Parties and views without a shadow of distinction, and those of us who of late years have been directly concerned in these questions, as I was at the Colonial
<col>662</col>
Office and on the Committee of Defence, recognise that in the Dominions themselves there is only one desire&#x2014;to take their proper part in maintaining the strength and the dignity of the Empire. As we know, they are not altogether agreed on the best methods by which that object may be achieved, but although there may be differences of opinion on particular points the same spirit of loyalty to the Empire and of a desire to play their part is shown throughout. I also agree with the noble Earl that such co-operation as the Dominions freely offer us must mean and ought to mean some further share, however it may be obtained, in the representation of their separate interests in the councils of the Empire. Noble Lords opposite are well aware of the peculiar difficulties, resting largely on the physical facts of distance, which surround that question, but I certainly shall never believe that those difficulties are altogether insuperable, and it is, I think, an appropriate task for the best minds of the Empire, either overseas or here, to put forward their best powers in the consideration of how that object can most fittingly be achieved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01968"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess's remarks were couched throughout in a reassuring tone, and what fell from him made it perfectly clear that His Majesty's Government are as much seized as anybody on this side of the House with the gravity of the situation. I do not think, however, that the noble Marquess would claim that his speech was couched in tones of confidence; in fact, at times wondered whether the noble Marquess possessed the confidence which he found it necessary to assume. In his opening sentences the noble Marquess rather took exception to my noble friend Lord Selborne having travelled beyond his Notice by dealing with our whole naval position, but I think any one who read the First Lord's speech last night would feel that the justification for my noble friend's action lay there. The First Lord was at pains with very great precision to lay down the difficulties in which we stand with regard to our position in the North Sea, and he introduced the Mediterranean as a sort of background to that picture.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01969"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I was far from complaining of the action of the noble Earl. What I said was that it had occurred to me that the noble Earl might wish to deal
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0336"/>
<col>663</col>
with that branch of the subject on another day. The speech of the First Lord was directed to the defence of a Supplementary Estimate largely dealing with the North Sea.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01970"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My point was not so much that as to endeavour to persuade the noble Marquess to consider one or two aspects of the situation in the Mediterranean even under the temporary arrangements which have now been made there. The instance of South America which the noble Marquess gave when he said that it was impossible for us to be in a position of superiority in all places at the same time is inapplicable to the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean is vital; the South American station is not. I would put another point. The noble Marquess expended a considerable amount of tactical rhetoric on the undesirability of our regarding every Power in the Mediterranean as a potential foe. We all feel the same. But, after all, it is necessary to face the facts. The noble Marquess knows the position of the Triple Alliance and that the desires of a particular Power at a particular moment may cause a coalition to be brought into action, of which the other members have a very remote interest in the quarrel. Again I would put this point to the noble Marquess. If the Government are sending four battle cruisers to the Mediterranean it is because they believe that in some circumstances they may be necessary, and if the Government bases the Fleet upon Malta it is because they think it the best strategic position. It is necessary for the land defences in the Mediterranean to be such that they will leave whatever ships are there free for the work which they may be required to perform. The First Lord last night spoke of these battle cruisers as being the ships of all others most suitable to preserve our trade route and to protect our trade in the Mediterranean in case of trouble. If they are to protect our trade, they must be free for that work. They cannot at the same time protect our trade and act as a defence to Malta.<lb/>
When I was at the War Office I was under continual pressure to increase the garrisons in the Mediterranean. I visited Malta and Gibraltar in the year 1903 in order to see on the spot what both the Generals then commanding asked me to see with regard to their distribution of troops&#x2014;not because
<col>664</col>
my opinion was of any special value, but because what one has seen for oneself enables one the better to appreciate the expert opinions given one. The strongest pressure was brought to bear on the War Office to add four battalions to the garrison at Malta. It was just at that time that the Defence Committee was brought into being by Mr. Balfour at the instance of Lord Selborne and myself for the consideration of this very class of questions, and for the first time, I believe, all the problems of military and naval defence were considered together as part of a whole under the influence of that Committee. The very clear position was taken up by the Defence Committee at that time that we could abstain from adding to the garrisons of Malta and Gibraltar&#x2014;but on one condition, that a certain naval force was kept in the Mediterranean which enabled the Navy, when performing its own duties, still to leave at Malta a sufficient force to constitute a serious difficulty to an enemy attempting to make a landing. In the debate in the House of Commons last night Lord Charles Beresford, who held the command in the Mediterranean three years after the date to which I have been referring, made this most important statement&#x2014;
<quote>"Another point he would like to put to the right hon. gentleman was, Did he intend to increase the garrisons at naval stations? When he (Lord Charles) was in the Mediterranean he and the then Commander-in-Chief at Malta expressed the hope that they would not be reduced, and all they got from the Admiralty was that they were going to be reduced for economy, but the naval support would be good enough. Now the naval support has been taken away."</quote>
Is not that really a serious state of affairs? You have decreased by five battalions the garrison which I was asked to increase by four battalions, and you have removed the naval support which justified the Defence Committee in 1904 in refusing the additional garrison. I would ask the Lord Chancellor to tell us distinctly whether any military authority advised the Government that without adequate naval support the troops now at Malta and Gibraltar can hold those places? I believe that these garrisons can only be maintained at their present strength on the assumption that a very large measure of naval support can he given to them. In case of war you are in this very serious position, that you have not got the troops to stop the most moderate landing, and if the Fleet there in its reduced condition is to do its duty it cannot possibly afford to Malta or to Gibraltar the necessary support. We were
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0337"/>
<col>665</col>
told last night that &#x00A3;12,000,000 had been added annually to the cost of the Navy. The cost of maintaining these garrisons at strength would only have been about &#x00A3;100,000 annually. At all events, I urge most sincerely that those two questions should be considered together. A great and pressing need has arisen largely owing to the fact that the Government have abandoned the Cawdor programme and at the same time reduced the Alediterritnean garrisons by five battalions&#x2014;two things taken together which have made for danger where safety is imperative. I hope that before this debate closes we may hear from the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack whether there is some military authority for the present position. Certainly I hope that in the conditions, which have changed since the reductions were decided upon, the Government will not be above coming to Parliament if they cannot do it executively and restoring these garrisons to proper strength.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01971"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to make a few observations on the speech which has just fallen from the noble Viscount. I agree with him that these are matters which deserve our best consideration, and on that happily both Parties in the State are at one. The noble Viscount has spoken of two matters&#x2014;the abandonment of what is known as the Cawdor programme, and the reduction of the garrisons in the Mediterranean&#x2014; as being at t lie root of the evil, or as being part of the cause of the trouble at the present moment, and it is about these two matters that I wish to say something. Since the Cawdor programme was laid clown the whole face of Europe has changed altogether so far as fleets are concerned. If we had maintained the Cawdor programme we should be very far behind to-day. We are much further on than we should have been with the Cawdor programme. It is not the Cawdor programme, or any change of policy on our part, but it is the enormous and new development of naval power on the part of foreign countries which has made the difference, and it is a very serious difference.<lb/>
Then I come to the question of the reduction of the garrisons in the Mediterranean, and about that I entirely agree with the noble Viscount. The question of those garrisons cannot be dissociated from the question of our sea power in the Mediterranean. I go further. In the
<col>666</col>
absence of sufficient sea power the garrisons are ludicrously inadequate. It is not a question of four battalions; it is more nearly a question of forty battalions if we were to aim at providing such a force as could hold each without adequate sea power. Sea power and the state of the garrisons are matters which are so completely interlaced in the Mediterranean that it would be strategical madness to consider one apart from the other. Reinforcements may have to be transported. With adequate sea power no attack can be sustained. You may have to keep off an attack for a limited period, but if you have sufficient sea power you can go to the relief of and rescue a garrison and make further attack impossible. It is upon that basis that the plans which have been worked out are founded.<lb/>
To begin with, four battle cruisers are very different from the "Duncan" and. "Swiftsure" types which are there at present and are to-day inadequate. A much faster and more powerful type of ship is necessary, and for that purpose four battle cruisers and four other cruisers will be sufficient, and added to those there will be a very powerful flotilla of submarines and destroyers which will protect Malta, and another which will be off Alexandria. I am far from wishing to give your Lordships the impression that I look upon the vessels we are just putting into the Mediterranean and these flotillas as sufficient for the develop3nents which may and probably will take place in the future. My point is that they are a very much stronger armament than we possess in the Mediterranean at the present time, and they will see us through until the period arrives for which we shall have to watch. Two Great Powers in the Mediterranean belonging to the Triple Alliance are increasing their Fleets and have Dreadnought programmes which are in course of maturing. I am far from saying that the mere fact that those two Great Powers belong to the Triple Alliance means that we should look upon them as likely to enter into any form of aggressive attack. On the contrary, with one we are on terms almost of intimacy, and with the other we have friendly relations. I have no means of knowing that the Triple Alliance is founded on an aggressive basis, nor am I prepared to accept that without proof. As regards the other Power, the Fleet of which is and is likely to remain as large as
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0338"/>
<col>667</col>
the Fleets of the two others combined, we are on the most friendly relations, although we have not entered into any alliance. In that state of things, what is it that we have to deal with? So far as the command of the sea in the ordinary case is concerned, we have a very powerful Fleet outside. There will be based on Gibraltar a Fleet which by degrees will be increased to eight modern Dreadnoughts. The whole resources of the Navy, so far as the necessary task of guarding the North Sea will permit, are available to reinforce. The Fleet is ubiquitous, and, therefore, though I am far from saying that the situation is not one which we must watch from year to year, and as it grows adapt ourselves to it, for the situation as it exists at the present moment we have taken steps which I think will protect those garrisons by adequate sea power and lay the foundation for what we may do in the future.<lb/>
I am far from wishing to speak in a tone of easy-going optimism in this matter. On the contrary, I think the country is
<col>668</col>
face to face with one of the most trying naval situations that have existed for a very long time. The Government have made up their minds that the position of this country depends on sea power. We have told the only Power which is our rival&#x2014;we have told them in the most friendly fashion&#x2014;that that is our view, and whatever efforts they may put forth they must reckon on our making efforts still greater than any they may make. We have said that we do that, not with any intention of aggression, but because sea power is our life, and in sea power we intend to remain superior. That is the view of the Government; that is the principle to which we have pledged ourselves, and according to which we shall approach all questions of naval strategy which concern our life as a nation.</membercontribution></p>

It is in the burgh of Renfrew and turns into a <i>culde sac</i> off a tramway in a street belonging, to the burgh of Renfrew, but a street in which the exact position of affairs is what the position would be in respect of this seventy yards of tramway if the clause which Lord Willingdon has moved to leave out is omitted. The ordinary purchase clause does not apply in the case of the main line of tramway, and it is desired by the promoters that the purchase clause should not apply to this arm, which is merely a siding and would be quite useless for tramway purposes to ally one not owning the main tramway.

<title>PERSIA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-01999"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member> rose to call the attention of His Majesty's Government to the position of affairs in Persia with particular reference to the Anglo-Russian Convention.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02000">The noble Lord said: My Lords, on several occasions I have troubled your Lordships with remarks on the trend of events in Persia, and the present situation in that country justifies the fears to which I have from time to time given expression. The Anglo-Russian Convention was adopted as a kind of healing plaster for the political sore in Persia but I fear that at the present time the wound is gaping far beyond the edges of the plaster that was then applied. The Anglo-Russian Convention was adopted in 1907 on the basis&#x2014;and it is important to remember this&#x2014;as stated in the Preamble of the Convention, that the Governments of Great Britain and Russia engaged to respect the integrity and independence of Persia.
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0341"/>
<col>673</col>
That was fortified by the Memorandum presented by our Ambassador to the Persian Government in September, 1907, in which the Anglo-Russian Convention was referred to as being "based on a guarantee of Persia's independence and integrity." The Persian Revolution in the following year was, no doubt, the outcome chiefly of abhorrence of the cruel oppression exercised by the then ruler of that country, the ex-Shah Mohamed Ali; but there is reason to believe that the Persians were getting very much alarmed at the growing interference with their affairs by their two great neighbours, and particularly in respect of the Articles of the Anglo-Russian Convention which they regarded as infringing their political independence.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02001">We are always confronted with the retort&#x2014;it is made frequently in the House of Commons and in that portion of the Press which supports the foreign policy of His Majesty's Government&#x2014;What would have happened had the Convention not been framed? That is a hypothesis with which it is impossible to deal. First of all, it is quite possible, for the reason I have given, that the Revolution would never have taken place; secondly, one does not know what value Russia and Great Britain placed upon their respective interests or how far they were willing to press diplomatically in defence of their respective interests. I am quite willing to admit that the Convention has secured harmony between Great Britain and Russia at present&#x2014;I hope for ever&#x2014;but I maintain that that harmony would have been perfectly consistent with also securing the independence and integrity of Persia. There was nothing incompatible in that. But the present harmony has, I think, been established by the sacrifice of the real basis contained in the Preamble of the Convention, and at the present time the situation in Persia is pretty much the same, in my opinion, as if no Convention existed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02002">Look at the present situation. At the present time from Tabriz in the West to Meshed in the East, through that long stretch of Northern Persia, it may be said that Russian control is practically absolute. Coming further south to the capital, Teheran, I do not know of any other authority exercised there at the present time than that of Russia. I do not say it is supreme, but I do not know of any other
<col>674</col>
authority or control there. I do not believe that any important act is undertaken by the Persian Government at the present time without the sanction or approval of the Russian Government. The glove may be Persian, but the hand inside the glove is Russian. How far further south that control may be exercised I do not profess to say. One hears wonderful stories of Russian influence spreading right away throughout Southern Persia. Personally I do not believe in all these stories or in the machinations and intrigues that are imputed to Russia, but these stories are the necessary consequence where you have power exercised without responsibility. There is no responsible power at the present time in Persia. What is the result in Southern Persia? You have there a state of complete anarchy. The Central Government is powerless to exercise any authority throughout that vast area. The main trunk route from Teheran to Isfahan all last year and sometime previously was constantly being looted. The mail horses were stolen, and there was practically an interruption of all trade; and the only solution found for that state of things was for the Government to appoint the chief brigand to be in command of a large district, and since that time he has been occupied in despoiling the district of which he is in charge.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02003">As regards our own position. A few months ago from the Baluchistan frontier in the East all along the south coast to Persia, right away up the Persian Gulf, and up the west Persian frontier till one arrives at Russian territory there was not a single commercial route open except that which is known as the Lynch road&#x2014;a rough mule track over a succession of high mountain chains. That road was open two months ago but in May it was closed owing to the coming down of a wild tribe, and I believe that route is closed at the present time. Therefore you may say that right away from Baluchistan up to the Russian frontier there is no trade route available at the present time. In consequence of this our own prestige in Persia has suffered considerably. The people know that as a nation we do not desire to annex a single acre of their territory. They have always regarded us as their friends, but they consider that we have been timid and pusillanimous in not upholding their individual rights. The goodwill they have hitherto entertained for us has suffered
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0342"/>
<col>675</col>
somewhat by the action last year of His Majesty's Government in sending a detachment of troops up to Shiraz and Isfahan. That detachment was either too small or too big. It was too small to do anything with regard to maintaining order in the country, but it was sufficiently large to create feelings of animosity.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02004">I have recently been in Persia, and throughout my journey I found one feeling of depression and despondency among the Persians with whom I came in contact, whether individually or collectively, owing to the passing away, as they consider, of their freedom. I know nothing more depressing than a journey in Persia at the present time. That is the result of the Convention, or rather of the working of the Convention by His Majesty's Government. In my view the Revolution gave a splendid opportunity, it was a real godsend, for putting life and spirit into the declaration that it was intended to maintain the independence and integrity of Persia. Recently Sir Edward Grey in another place stated that a very large section of Russian opinion is discontented at the working of the Convention. They regard the Convention as a self-denying ordinance and a one-sided affair, and believe that Russia has given up a great deal and obtained very little in return. I am aware that those views are held by a large body of Russian opinion. At the same time, I believe there is a section of the Russian people who are opposed to any territorial extension of their responsibility. Those two rival parties have their representatives in Persia itself, and instances have occurred time after time in which it has been found that the responsible Minister, the authority representing Russian interests in Persia, has adopted one policy and his lieutenants have acted almost diametrically opposite. The Minister may be loyally endeavouring to carry out the terms of the Convention, but his subordinates have been advancing Russian interests to the detriment of those of Persia.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02005">I admit that this makes the work of our diplomatists much more difficult, but I do not think it absolves His Majesty's Government from putting more strength and vigour into their negotiations with Russia for the carrying out in a proper spirit of the terms of the Convention. Only last week in this House we had practically an admission from the noble Viscount, Lord Morley,
<col>676</col>
that the principle of the Trans-Persian railway was accepted by His Majesty's Government under coercion. They did not adopt it in the interests of India, but because something dreadful might have happened had they refused the proposal as put before them. It is clear from the Blue-book on Persian Affairs recently published that that is not the only occasion on which we have been very submissive in our dealings with Russia. Your Lordships may remember that, after Mohamed. Ali had been dismissed from his Throne and had taken refuge in Europe, he returned through Russian territory and had a series of fights with his countrymen in order to regain his Throne if possible. As is shown in the Blue-book, time after time it has been represented what harm has been done to Persian interests and to British and Indian interests by the ex-Shah's return, and how the great tribe, the Bakhtiari, had to take the best men from their country and go and fight the ex-Shah, with the result that the money supplied to Persia for the purpose of her regeneration, instead of being spent on improving the administration in Southern Persia, had to be spent in meeting the ex-Shah. Finally he was defeated and had to leave Persia.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02006">May I allude to one curious misconception which I think Sir Edward Grey is under? He said that it was only owing to Russian influence that the ex-Shah was got rid of and had to leave Persia. That is a travesty of what took place. Had it not been for Russian support the ex-Shah would not have been living at this time, or he would have been a wandering pauper in some other part of the world. It was recognised that, having returned to Persia, he was not justified in claiming any longer his pension, but on the representation of Russia his pension was allowed to be awarded to him again. Sir Edward Grey, in a telegraphic Despatch of January 17, said&#x2014;
<quote>"A rendition of the renewal of the pension must Is' that Great Britain and Russia will lend Persian Government their support against Mohamed Ali if lie returns to Persia without the consent of the two Powers."</quote>
After a long series of Despatches I gather that the ex-Shah finally left Persia about two months after that date, with the only stipulation that he should not return to Persia or should forfeit his pension if he returned to Persia "without the consent of the Russian Government." The consent of the British Government was waived, as
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0343"/>
<col>677</col>
also was any idea that we should give support to the Persian. Government should Mohamed Ali return again to Persia. That is an instance of how the position that was taken up with great fairness at so late a date as January 17 has been whittled away.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02007">In this connection I should like to obtain a definite answer on the point whether His Majesty's Government still adhere to what was said in this House by Lord Morley in December last. The noble Viscount then said&#x2014;
<quote>"Whatever intrigues may have gone on between the ex-Shalt and the subordinate agents of the Russian Government, they do not affect the desire, the intention, of the Russian Government not to support the ex-Shah if he should attempt to return to his Throne, and we for our part have informed the Russian Government that it would be impossible for us under any circumstances whatever to recognise the ex-Shah."</quote>
It is highly desirable to obtain some definite answer on this point, because the greatest fear is felt in Persia at the present time that the ex-Shah may return, that if he did there would possibly be a series of terrible reprisals, and also that he would be a mere puppet in the hands of the Russian Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02008">There is one other instance of where His Majesty's Government have very readily acquiesced in Russian action, and that is with regard to the garrison that is kept at Kazvin. On December 27 our Ambassador at St. Petersburg said that M. Sazonoff was quite prepared to withdraw the troops from Kazvin as soon as the conditions of the Ultimatum that was then being presented to the Persian Government were complied with. There was a subsequent Despatch which admitted that these conditions had been fully complied with; but the garrison at Kazvin was not withdrawn. His Majesty's Government from time to time made representations about its continued stay there, particularly at the time when the ex-Shah left Persia, but the garrison of at least 1,000 men was still at Kazvin in May, and there is no reason to believe that it is not there at the present moment. I quote these instances as showing that His Majesty's Government have been more than complaisant, that they have been only too ready to sacrifice the independence of Persian interests. The whole of the Bluebook shows what a farce it is to talk of there being any freedom of action on the part of the Persian Government. One of
<col>678</col>
the conditions of the loan of &#x00A3;200,000 to Persia was that Persia should recognise fully the Anglo-Russian Convention. Hitherto they have always been opposed to any such recognition, because they deemed the Convention to be an infringement of their sovereign powers. However much they resisted it, they finally had to give their agreement to the Convention, and in doing so I think they sealed the fact that they were no longer an independent Power.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02009">Perhaps I am rather flogging a dead horse in dwelling upon the independence of Persia, because in the House of Commons in December last we had an admission by Sir Edward Grey which seemed to me to give the whole case away. At that time he said, in reference to the Anglo-Russian Agreement&#x2014;
<quote>"It was never intended by the Agreement to destroy or diminish Russian influence in any part of Asia where it had already been obtained. The object of the Agreement was not to thrust Russia hack, and, or course, not to deprive ourselves of any influence we had at the time in Asia. Russian influence when the Anglo-Russian Agreement was made was already predominant in the North of Persia."</quote>
A perfect state of stagnation does not exist, and it was not likely, if Russian influence was not to decline, that matters would remain exactly as they were at the time of the signing of the Convention. There was bound to be an advance towards an extension of the interests of Russia and possibly of ourselves. Therefore if it was the intention of His Majesty's Government at that time that there was to be no decline of the interests or of the influence of the two Powers in Persia, it was perfectly inconsistent to make any reference in the Convention to "the independence and integrity" of Persia. On February 8 Sir Edward Grey said, in a Despatch, that the Persian Government was deserving now of the support of His Majesty's Government because they had got rid of those members who were unfavourable to the continuance of Russian influence in Northern Persia. That is really the whole case against the Mejliss. What these people were fighting for was simply the ordinary independence of their country and for freedom of action. But this was held to be a reproach, and not until the Mejliss was, by a coup <i>&#x010F;&#x00E9;tat</i>, dissolved and some members of the Government who were supposed to hold strongly Nationalist views were dismissed did His
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0344"/>
<col>679</col>
Majesty's Government think fit to give any support to the Persian Government. "Patriotism" seems to be only a virtue in the case of a great and powerful and Christian nation; where in a country like Turkey or Persia efforts are made by the people to defend their rights and freedom patriotism is held to be rather an absurdity and almost a wickedness. Personally I regard with admiration those who have done their best to hold on to their country and to make it an independent country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02010">It is customary for upholders of the policy of His Majesty's Government to say that Persians are quite incapable of ruling their own country. I emphatically express my dissent from that point of view. I have come in contact in Persia with men who are quite capable, in my opinion, of ruling their country. You have Mr. Shuster's opinion on that point. There are men in Persia quite fit to occupy important posts and to maintain order and secure the proper working of responsible government. Also I have come in contact with people who have been for a long time resident in Persia, who know Persia and its inhabitants better than do our own Government officials, and who say that there are men there who are absolutely qualified in this direction. Yet the taunt is constantly flung in their face that they are incapable of managing their own affairs. If that doctrine was sound it is the more ridiculous to male out that you are working the Convention with the idea of setting up a free and independent country. For myself, I believe that the Anglo-Russian Convention was brought into being in order to save His Majesty's Government from having a policy about Persia at all. Secondly, it fulfilled the object of acting as a screen to the British public regarding the true position of affairs in Persia. Whenever an incident occurs in that country of a deplorable nature a curtain bearing the inscription "The Convention; all is well" is at once let down, and the gaze of the public is hidden from the drama which is being enacted on the Persian stage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02011">The question may be put to me, "What do you propose should be done in Persia? Can it be saved now?" I believe that, even at the eleventh hour, something practical could be done to save Persia and to maintain its integrity. First of all, you have a very peaceable and tractable people easily governed. The bulk of the people are renowned for their peaceful
<col>680</col>
proclivities. There are one or two aggressive tribes, but they are not of the character of those tribes on the North-West frontier of India with which we have had to deal, and I believe that in a short space of time they could be brought into submission. The great bulk of the people of Persia are quite easy to rule. Then, again, you have a body of men who could be easily trained and disciplined to act as <i>gendarmerie.</i> While I was in Persia I came in contact with some of the remnants of Mr. Shuster's <i>gendarmerie</i>, and I found them an excellent, willing and scrupulously honest body of men. The energetic and zealous Swedish officers who are training the <i>gendarmerie</i> there could not speak too highly of the aptitude of their Persian recruits to learn their drill and make themselves a model <i>gendarmerie.</i> Those two factors might help towards securing Persian independence.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02012">But there must be two big changes. First of all, you must get rid of the present financial system, which commands no confidence at all, either amongst Persians or amongst British residents in the country; and, secondly, there must be a complete change of attitude on the part of the two Governments towards the working of the Convention. They would have to put life and spirit into the words "independence and integrity." They must honestly desire to infuse a national spirit into the people, and the Government must not be liable to be suppressed whenever at any particular time they are able to execute some reform. That has been what has taken place in the past, and the object of my remarks to-night is to let the public in this country know that all is not well in Persia, and that at the present time there are complications which may develop very seriously, and perhaps disastrously, because the independence of the ancient kingdom of Persia now hangs by the very finest of threads and its integrity is rifted through and through.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02013"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE ion INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry that my noble friend, Lord Morley, who usually undertakes the reply to Foreign Office questions on behalf of the Government, could not be in his place to-day, as he is receiving an honour which he highly prizes at the hands of his fellow-townsmen in Lancashire. But, as it happens, in relation to this particular question it is also my business to keep
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0345"/>
<col>681</col>
myself abreast of all the information as it comes to His Majesty's Government, and therefore I will do my best to reply to the various points which have been raised by the noble Lord. We recognise, of course, his right to raise this subject from his personal knowledge of the country increased by a recent visit, and we welcome any pieces of information which he is able to give us either of events that are actually happening in the country or of what he has observed of the disposition of its people. I understand that in spite of the criticisms which the noble Lord has levelled at some of the results which he understands to have proceeded from the Russian understanding, he would in no way desire to impair our good relations with Russia&#x2014;[LORD LAMINOTON: Hear, heard.]&#x2014;either in Persia or in any other part of the world, only be believes that those good relations might be fully maintained with a definite change of action on the part of both Governments. [LORD LAMINGTON: Hear, hear.] It is, of course, quite true that the existence of an understanding between the two Powers, particularly in relation to questions so thorny as those which arise in Persia, does not and cannot necessarily involve a perpetual identity of view, and it is clear from Papers already laid on the subject that there have been occasions in which either Russia has remonstrated with us or we with Russia in respect of some action of the respective countries.<lb/>
But I am particularly glad that the noble Lord has in one respect recognised the difficulties of the situation&#x2014;a respect in which they are often, as I think, not realised by those who speak in public or who write on this subject. It is sometimes the custom to talk of Russia and the action of Russia as though all the inhabitants of Russia thought precisely alike on these questions, and that there was only one set of views and opinions which had to be taken into consideration. It is a common form of error to suppose, because a country is not governed by an Executive responsible to a Parliament, that therefore there is no such thing as public opinion in such a country. Nothing can be more misleading. Whatever the form of government may be, however despotic it may be in name or in appearance, the rulers of a country have to pay and do pay a close regard to public opinion; and, as the noble Lord has fully recognised, there are in relation to this question of Persia quite different schools of
<col>682</col>
thought among Russian statesmen and Russian administrators. There is, no doubt, a strong forward school in that country who would be disposed, if they spoke their minds frankly, to criticise the understanding because it prevents the complete Russification of at any rate the northern half of Persia. On the other hand, there is a strong body&#x2014;and in essence the strongest body, because these are the views held by the Russian Government&#x2014;who have no desire for an indefinite enlargement of their responsibilities in the direction of Persia. They do not desire to lose any influence which they possess as the most powerful neighbours of a weak country and as the principal traders with that country; but they do not desire to undertake any more direct control or to proceed in the direction of occupation still less of annexation. We are able to say with confidence that during the whole of these difficult proceedings the loyalty of the Russian Government and the loyalty of the Russian Minister at Teheran, M. Poklewsky, who is so well known to many of us in this House, to the Convention and all that it involves has been altogether complete. At the same time I quite agree that it is impossible to believe that the action of all the agents of Russia throughout Persia has been, so far as one is able to judge, in conformity with the wishes of St. Petersburg, or that it has been inspired by a desire to maintain that independence and integrity of Persia which the noble Lord has rightly quoted as forming an essential point in the understanding between the two countries.<lb/>
The noble Lord spoke of the northern part of the Russian sphere of influence as being "absolutely controlled by Russia," and he spoke of a part of their sphere rather further south, including the capital, Teheran, as being, not absolutely under Russian control, yet in a condition in which Russian control was the only control, and he added, I think, that the Persian Government could not move hand or foot without the leave of Russia. I think that is a statement which is liable to be misunderstood, because as a matter of fact the Russian Minister and our successive Ministers there have worked together, as I said just now, with absolute loyalty. It is, of course, the case that to both the Persian Government has made frequent appeals for advice and assistance, but it would not be accurate to state that any difference has been made at Teheran as between the responsible agents of the two
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0346"/>
<col>683</col>
Governments there. The noble Lord, while criticising the Convention, did not suggest&#x2014;and he was himself aware of the omission&#x2014;did not suggest any other method apart from the Convention by which the integrity of Persia can be altogether secured. He said&#x2014;I believe with perfect truth&#x2014;that the existence of the Convention was not incompatible with that integrity. But he did not say what I myself believe to be the fact, that the existence of the Convention avoided either the definite partition of Persia or at any rate an occupation of a large part of Persia by Russia, with a possible abstention from any similar steps on our part in the south, but with some strengthening, which would clearly have been necessary in such a case, of our position on the actual seaboard of the Persian Gulf. That is what I cannot help believing would have been the outcome if there had been no <i>Entente</i> between us and Russia.<lb/>
But the effect, according to the noble Lord, either of too much interference or too little has been equally disastrous. He points to Northern Persia as being now in Russian occupation, though I venture to think that he has very greatly overstated his case; and he points to Southern Persia as being in a condition, not of British occupation, as we all know it is not, but of complete and hopeless anarchy without a trade road upon which it is possible for any caravan to make a journey. That, surely, places us in a somewhat melancholy dilemma. Because it seems only reasonable to assume that if Russia had for the time being, or permanently, cleared altogether out of Northern Persia a somewhat similar state of anarchy would have reigned there, or that the only method by which any species of order could be secured in Southern Persia would have been by a definite occupation by our troops. I should be very sorry to believe that such a dilemma is the one that we have to face, although I certainly should not pretend to speak in anything like sanguine terms of the situation as it exists at this moment or of the immediate future.<lb/>
The fact is, my Lords, I can think of no comparison so accurate with the present condition of Persia as that of the state in which the noble Lord's native land was in the second half of the sixteenth century, during the troublous reign of Mary Queen of Scots and during the infancy of her son. It would be possible to make a number of close parallels between the condition of
<col>684</col>
things that obtained in Scotland at that time and that of which one reads in Persia now. We are confronted with this perpetual difficulty, the question of money, which appears to move in an eternal and vicious circle in this way. Unless a considerable amount of money is advanced to Persia there is no chance of restoring order, but unless order is restored you have no security for the interest on the loan. It is possible, therefore, to go arguing backwards and forwards on those two facts, each of them indisputable in itself, with the natural result that money appears to become more and more difficult to lend. But it is only just to say that the Russian Government have fully recognised the paramount necessity of a loan, and, if possible, a large loan. It may be necessary in the interval to go on dribbling out smaller sums of money for the meeting of immediate necessities, the pay of the various forces involved, and so on, but both countries will do their best by a close examination of the real financial resources of the country to see how the difficulty of obtaining a reasonable security for the interest of a large advance can be met. Although, of course, their financial advisers are bound to look at the matter from a purely financial point of view, I am convinced that the Governments will be disposed not to take too hard or strict a view in considering the possibility of an advance.<lb/>
The noble Lord, in speaking of Southern Persia, mentioned what happened in the autumn of last year, when we sent a larger Consular escort to Shiraz, and the attack on Mr. Smart, our Consul, took place on the road from Bushire. The noble Lord criticised the form of that Consular escort, which he said was either too large or too small. It was not large enough for an army, and it was too large to be regarded as a Consular guard. The noble Lord has been in those parts and I have not, and therefore I should be slow to contradict him; but I confess it is not easy to see, the condition and position of Shiraz and of our Consul there being what it is, why an Indian Cavalry regiment should be regarded as something so formidable or imposing that it could not be looked upon as a Consular guard. It might have been simpler, if the noble Lord likes it it might have been wiser, to send a battalion or half a battalion of Infantry instead. The reason for sending Cavalry was that at the time the life and property of British subjects in Shiraz were considered to be in imminent danger.</membercontribution></p>

<col>685</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02014"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The danger was over when they were sent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02015"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The danger may have been over, but the fear of danger certainly was not over. Far from it; and we did not treat it as a matter of special importance whether Cavalry or Infantry were sent for that particular purpose. It was most clearly and expressly laid down that the Cavalry were sent as a Consular guard and not as an escort for caravans. Their position has remained that of a Consular guard, and it will so remain until they return to India. I can say without hesitation that I shall be very glad when that large Consular guard can be removed. I should be very glad myself if it could be removed to-morrow. We shall certainly return it to India&#x2014;though it will have to be replaced by some other force&#x2014;as soon as conditions permit. As the noble Lord knows, there have been various complications respecting the demand for compensation in respect of the attack on Mr. Smart. In the absence of any powerful Central Government at Teheran, it is no easy matter to secure that the individuals upon whom we believe the responsibility for that attack properly lies should be made amenable, and the question of the reduction or withdrawal of this particular force has been complicated by that fact. But I can assure the noble Lord that as soon as this Cavalry regiment can be returned to India the better we shall be pleased.<lb/>
I was glad, however, to hear the noble Lord speak with appreciation of the efforts to create a <i>gendarmerie</i> under Swedish officers. I believe that the formation of such a force offers the best prospect which can be put before us of restoring the safety of the southern roads. I think I am right in saying that the proposition is that a force of 1,500 men should be devoted to this purpose, and it is gratifying to have the testimony of the noble Lord that not only are the Swedish officers keen and apt for their work, which confirms the information that we had received, but that also they in their turn are well satisfied with the material which they have to turn into these road guards. But, as the noble Lord very well knows, the formation of a <i>gendarmerie</i> of this kind produces troubles and difficulties of its own. The various tribes on the roads are accustomed to supply what are termed road guards," who are paid for their services by a form of blackmail upon passing
<col>686</col>
caravans, and the institution of a Government <i>gendarmerie</i> naturally interferes with this particular source of profit. It will therefore be necessary, as I am sure the noble Lord will agree, to proceed carefully in securing the adhesion of the various tribal leaders to the plan if it is to work at all successfully and without friction.<lb/>
I think that the noble Lord was a little sanguine, even possibly a little biased, in laying stress, as he did, upon the peaceful proclivities of the people, and in expressing the belief that if they were only left alone they would settle down, as I understood him to believe, to order and to good government. I do not dispute for a moment that the Persian character may deserve everything that has been said of it. But I cannot help recalling that during all the most troublous years of Irish government noble Lords opposite and their friends heard with deep impatience what used to be said by those who desired to speak up for the popular movements in Ireland and the freedom of Ireland from crime. Noble Lords used to point out that that might be all very well; that there might be fewer burglaries and fewer crimes of ordinary violence, but that upon the whole, owing to agrarian agitation and crime, life could not be regarded as safe over large districts. Therefore while, as I say, not disputing anything that the noble Lord may say of the merits of the character of the Persian people, who are a profoundly interesting people from their history, yet at the same time it is, perhaps, a little sanguine to believe that a mere policy of non-interference would lead to the establishment of a state of order and facility of trade.<lb/>
In one sense I am entirely in agreement with the noble Lord so far as our sphere of influence is concerned. I should do my very utmost to the last possible moment to avoid anything which could be described as military occupation of any part of the country or an attempt to restore general order by British arms. I say this because no man can possibly foresee the end of the road along which you have to travel if you adopt that policy. You have to deal with a proud people, as I have just stated, proud from their past history; you have to deal with a people who hold the most exclusive religious faith in the world; and you have to deal with a people in whom an anti-foreign sentiment is very easily aroused. The noble Lord has himself said that the mere fact of
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0348"/>
<col>687</col>
our sending a somewhat larger Consular guard to Shiraz than we have been in the habit of sending there created the wildest suspicions of our intentions in the minds of some of the inhabitants: Therefore I would do practically anything to avoid anything that could be described as a military occupation, not merely on account of Persia, although I think it would be a distinct wrong to her; but it is also on account of the interests of India and of the interests of this country and of the Empire at large that it would be, in my opinion, an act of supreme folly to enlarge our responsibilities in that direction. Therefore interference of that kind is interference which I venture to think ought only to be taken in the very last resort, and in order to avoid something which is obviously and definitely worse.<lb/>
As I said, I cannot pretend to regard the future very hopefully. I do not think it is necessary to adopt the depressed and gloomy tone used by the noble Lord in regard to the aims and intentions of Russia. I cannot think that he is fair to the Russian Government. The vicious circle of which I spoke in relation to the supply of money and the restoration of order sets before us a problem which must be regarded as one of supreme difficulty, and until that is removed and until also, I am bound to add, the Central Government at Teheran is able to take a distinct and definite part in governing the whole country, or at any rate doing what it can to administer the whole country&#x2014;until an advance is made in those directions I agree it is not possible to speak with very much confidence of the immediate future. There are some signs, however, of an improving state of things. I think the noble Lord mentioned the Lynch road as the last which had been kept open but was now closed. What happened was that the Bakhtiari Khans, who look after the protection of that road, had not been able for various reasons to afford the engineer who looks after the road and his staff proper protection. Our Minister at Teheran went on at every opportunity pointing out the necessity of resuming this Protection; and our last news in the early part of this month is that one of the principal and most energetic of the Khans, furnished, I am glad to say, with sufficient funds for the purpose&#x2014;because that is an item which always in such cases ought to be mentioned&#x2014;was to start, and as far as I know has started, for the highlands there
<col>688</col>
for the purpose of restoring order and guaranteeing the security of the road. That, of course, is done through the Central Government at Teheran, and there is every reason to hope that the results will be successful and that that particular trade route will shortly be open and secure once more. I think I have covered the various points raised by the noble Lord, but if there is any other question with which I have not dealt I have no doubt he will remind me, and I shall be happy to answer if I can.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02016"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who sits behind me, Lord Lamington, has, not for the first time this afternoon, rendered a substantial service to Persia and to British interests by bringing the unfortunate condition of that country before your Lordships' House. To-day he has spoken with the added authority of a recent visit to the country, which has enabled him to see things with his own eyes and accordingly to speak to your Lordships as an eye-witness of recent events. The noble Lord drew for the information of your Lordships a picture of the present condition of affairs in Persia which I can only describe as profoundly disquieting and even pathetic. The noble Marquess who has just sat down seemed to dispute the general accuracy of that picture, and more than once described it as over-coloured and overstated, but I do not think there was anything in his speech that led us to doubt the substantial accuracy of what the noble Lord said on every point. Indeed, from such information as I possess I should be inclined in some respects to speak in even more gloomy terms about the present condition of Persia and about its future prospects than the noble Lord did himself.<lb/>
The noble Lord alluded to the last occasion&#x2014;it was in December of last year&#x2014;when the subject of Persia came before your Lordships' House, and I remember very well that at that time, a time of great crisis in Persian affairs when the Persian Government was reeling under the blows of two successive Ultimatums from Russia, the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, reassured us by reading out to the I louse what he described as an important assurance from the Russian Government. It was to this effect&#x2014;
<quote>"The Russian Government assures us that it has no aims that would violate the independence and integrity of Persia. It assures ns categorically, and desires us to place on record that such
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0349"/>
<col>689</col>
military measures as it has taken in Persian territory are of a purely provisional nature, and it has no intention whatever of infringing the provisions of the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 as to Persia."</quote>
We were somewhat comforted by that assurance, and I remember thanking the noble Viscount for the definite advance that seemed to have been made by this announcement. We were told by Russia that her military occupation was to be of a purely provisional character. But now what is the impression left upon us by the picture drawn by the noble Lord? Only two days ago I read a reply given by the Foreign Secretary in the House of Commons to the effect that at the present moment there are 12,400 Russian troops in the North of Persia&#x2014;an occupation more extensive than has ever taken place before; an occupation so definite that it quite justifies the noble Lord in saying that practically the whole of Northern Persia has passed under the political control of Russia. Tabriz in the North-west has long been a town practically under Russian domination. The same is now true of Meshed in the North-east; and recently we heard that the Russians had even bombarded the holy shrine of Im&#x00E1;m Reza at Meshed. It was but yesterday I read that at Tabriz they had ordered the Persian Government to organise a further force of so-called Persian Cossacks, which means, of course, Persian troops under the charge of Russian officers and non-commissioned officers and practically obeying Russian commands. That, then, is the position along the whole of the North of Persia&#x2014;a position of absolute Russian supremacy, of Russian military occupation very little short of annexation.<lb/>
Then we come to the middle part of Persia, the part in which lies the capital. Here, again, I understood the noble Marquess to dispute the general accuracy of what my noble friend said. I believe my noble friend was entirely justified. In Teheran at the present moment the Government is impotent. The Regent who has been conducting affairs during the last two years has, I believe, left the country; the Treasury is empty, and the control of the finances, if the word is capable of being used in connection with the present situation in Persia, is in hands which are profoundly distrusted both by the British and by the Persians themselves, and which are believed to be inspired by great sympathy with the views of those extremists on the Russian side to whom the noble Marquess referred.<lb/>
<col>690</col>
I pass clown to the South, towards the sphere with which we are specially interested. The noble Marquess deprecated the use of the word "anarchy" as applied to the condition of the trade roads in the South of Persia. It is a curious thing that only this morning I saw a letter from a correspondent in Shiraz, written less than three months ago, in which he used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"The whole of Southern Persia is in a state of anarchy and is ruled by robber gangs."</quote>
That I believe to be a faithful description of the fact. Trade is practically nonexistent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02017"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl scarcely caught what I said. My intention was to point out that according to Lord Lamington the only alternative was either full military occupation or anarchy&#x2014;that there seemed to be no other course.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02018"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I do not for one moment think that that was the alternative of my noble friend. But I was alluding to thou passage in the noble Marquess's speech in which he disputed the accuracy of the use of the word "anarchy" as applied to the conditions in Southern Persia. I am afraid it is true. Such is the position in that part of the country with which we are chiefly concerned; and the position, unhappily, has been rendered not better but worse by the very measures taken by His Majesty's Government to alleviate that state of affairs&#x2014;I allude to the despatch of Indian Cavalry troops to Shiraz and Isfahan. You have 240 troops at Shiraz and 120 at Isfahan. Does not that quite justify my noble friend in what he said about this force being either too large or too small for its object?&#x2014;too small to control the roads, to protect travellers, to dominate the tribes; too large for the mere purpose of a Consular escort. I believe myself that the despatch of those troops was a great mistake. It has caused nothing but ill-feeling and heartburning in Persia. So much so that the one traveller&#x2014;it used to be the other way about&#x2014;who cannot not now march up with any security from the sea to the towns in the interior is an Englishman. Surely that is a most pitiable state of affairs. I hope that that mistake having been recognised His Majesty's Government will, as soon as they can do so with dignity and propriety, take these
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0350"/>
<col>691</col>
escorts away. I quite agree with what the noble Marquess said on the point of military occupation. There is not a sane man in this country who would welcome an occupation either on a large or a small scale by British forces of any part of Southern Persia. It is precisely because we think the attitude now adopted must inevitably lead sooner or later to some such occupation that we feel bound from time to time to call attention in this House to matters as they progress. Such, my Lords, is the state of affairs in the North, the centre, and the South of Persia.<lb/>
There is one other point of view that even we in your Lordships' House ought to consider, and that is the position and sufferings of the Persian people themselves. I believe the attitude of that unhappy people, torn by this disorder, is one of profound misery, so much so that they would welcome any strong hand that was stretched out over them, whether it were Russian, or British, or foreign of any description whatever. That, my Lords, is an element that may appeal to our pity, but it is also an element of danger; because, of course, the knowledge of such a condition of affairs can hardly fail to be an encouragement to the extreme persons on the Russian side who are anxious to push their Government into a further advance.<lb/>
Broadly speaking, although the noble Marquess deprecated the use of strong adjectives, he said little to dispute the picture which the noble Lord behind me drew and some of the details of which I have filled in. But in one portion of his speech the noble Marquess indulged in the now familiar retort, familiar because we have not only heard it in this House but the Foreign Secretary has repeated it almost <i>ad nauseam</i> in the House of Commons&#x2014;namely, that bad as this condition of affairs is it would have been much worse but for the Anglo-Russian Agreement. The way in which the noble Marquess put it this evening was this, that owing to the Convention we had escaped a definite occupation by Russia of the northern part of Persia. The facts that I gave just now, I think, show that the position of affairs is little short of a definite occupation of that part of the country by Russia.<lb/>
The general argument used by the noble Marquess and employed by the Foreign Secretary is one which it seems to me is quite inconsistent with the facts of the case; and for this reason more than for any other.
<col>692</col>
The Anglo-Russian Agreement was concluded in September, 1907&#x2014;that is to say, nearly five years ago. But what was the position of affairs in Persia before those days? For nearly a hundred years the position of Russia in the North has been one of military ascendancy in strength almost as great as that she now occupies. Yet during the whole of this time, although there was no Anglo-Russian Agreement, Persia retained her independence. None of these calamitous results ensued. But since the conclusion of that Agreement&#x2014;I do not say entirely in consequence of it&#x2014;the position of Persia has been steadily and daily getting worse. To what was it due that in the old days Persia succeeded in retaining her integrity and independence without the Anglo-Russian Agreement to sustain her? It was due to the consciousness that had any attempt been made by Russia or by any other Power to destroy that integrity or to interfere with that independence, such an act would have been met by the determined hostility of this country. That has been the traditional policy of British Governments for the best part of the last century. Why is the opposite result produced now? It is because our attitude in Persia, at the same time that we repeat our old assurances about independence and integrity, is no longer one of determined insistence upon the principles to which I refer, but is apt to be one of complacency, of acquiescence, of mild-mannered agreement in the various infringements that take place of Persian autonomy, which one may almost say is being whittled away before our very eyes.<lb/>
The noble Marquess seemed to think that perhaps the worst thing that could happen in the matter of Persia&#x2014;it would, indeed, be a bad one&#x2014;would be that we should be driven at any time to contemplate a military occupation of the southern part of the country. True. But let us try and look a little bit ahead. Let us try and see the direction in which things are tending. It seems to me that if the present state of affairs continues, if Russia is driven by the exigencies of the case to tighten her hold, first upon the North and then upon the centre of the country, she must gradually move down towards our sphere and must fill the vacuum which is created by the incompetence of the Persian Government. And in this way I do see&#x2014;it is a prophecy and warning which I utter with profound regret&#x2014;a drawing together of the Russian
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0351"/>

and the British spheres of interest and activity in Persia. I do see in the not distant future India, and the British Government on behalf of India, being driven to do something in defence of those interests in the South which it is absolutely necessary for the safety of our Indian Empire we should safeguard. I do see Persian independence gradually being crushed out of existence before our eyes. The noble Marquess concluded by saying he could not be very hopeful, and that there were not many bright spots on the horizon. I see no single bright spot on the horizon. I see dark clouds rolling up, pregnant with danger and with risk, not merely to Persia but to our future relations with Russia and to the interests of the Indian Empire itself. I am sorry to speak in what the noble Marquess, I am sure, would tell me is a very pessimistic and gloomy fashion. I would gladly say that I think things are going well. But when I am familiar with this state of things how can I allow my conscience to be lulled by the facile expressions that fall from Ministers, and to say that things are well when I know them to be bad and believe them to be getting worse?<lb/>
As regards what the noble Marquess said in direct reply to Lord Lamington, there was one point he did not allude to&#x2014;I think he forgot it. The noble Lord behind me sought from His Majesty's Government a repetition, which I am sure they would be prepared to give, of this very definite pledge about the ex-Shah. The ex-Shah was a curse to his country while he was in it, and he ought never to be allowed to return. A most definite pledge has been given in that respect, and my noble friend sought nothing more than to be told that that is a pledge to which His Majesty's Government will faithfully adhere.<lb/>
The noble Marquess made one point to which it is only fair that I should allude in passing. He said the Russian Government themselves, both at headquarters and through their representative at Teheran, have been quite loyal to the terms of the Agreement. I, of course, fully accept that assurance. Indeed, any one who knows the Russian Minister at Teheran at the present moment, Monsieur Poklevsky, would be confident that lie would conduct the relations between his Government and our own in a perfectly straightforward and honourable way. But the noble Marquess laid his finger on what is the weak spot in the situation. There are
<col>694</col>
always agents who interpret the policy of their Government in a more extreme sense and divert it to the gratification of their own political ambitions. That is the serious feature of the position. What is more serious still is that it is these extreme elements who get the better of the Minister. Therefore while you are getting the fullest assurances from your Russian allies, the Agreement between you and them is being almost neutralised by the illicit and extravagant action of their subordinates.<lb/>
The noble Marquess alluded to two other points. The first was the question of loans. I quite grant that the question of loans is one of great difficulty, because, as the noble Marquess very justly pointed out, you cannot give a loan without some security, and the Persian Government is hardly in a position to give any security at all. Yet at the same time I think a certain financial and political risk must be run in this respect. After all, His Majesty's Government equally with ourselves have one object in view&#x2014;namely, the recovery, if so it may be, of the independence and integrity of Persia. It cannot be done without money. I think, therefore, that at the present stage we ought not to be too exacting in our conditions. I believe His Majesty's Government along with the Russian Government have recently provided a loan to the Persian Government in the form of cash, and I think that within the limits of such caution as they find themselves able to observe something further must be done in this direction. The second point to which I wish to refer is that of the <i>gendarmerie.</i> Let us by all means give every encouragement we can to this experiment of a <i>gendarmerie</i> under Swedish officers. The noble Lord behind me paid a tribute, which I was glad to hear, to the spirit and patriotism of the men and also to the hold that had already been established over their confidence by their officers. These officers, unfortunately, have no executive authority. They are instructors and little more. Still there is in the creation of this <i>gendarmerie</i> the germ of a good idea, and I hope His Majesty's Government will lend every support to it in their power.<lb/>
My observations have, I am afraid, been of a somewhat depressing character, but we shall do no good by shutting our eyes to the fact that the position in Persia requires unremitting vigilance. His Majesty's Government can do much more, I believe,
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0352"/>
<col>695</col>
than they have done in the past on the lines indicated by my noble friend behind me. What, after all, did he ask for? That there should be introduced into our negotiations either with Russia or with Persia the spirit, not merely of loyalty to our own assurances, but even of standing up where the occasion arises to stand up against the action of those who are disloyal to them. I do honestly think that His Majesty's Government might show greater spirit in their dealings&#x2014;a little more courage, a little less acquiescence, a little more delicate regard for the interests of Persia itself. I am not one of those who wish to see the Anglo-Russian Agreement, profoundly as I dissent from some of the terms on which it was concluded, torn up. But if spirit is shown on the one side, let spirit also be shown on the other. Let the British Government show more emphatically than they have hitherto done that the one object they have in view and on which they mean to insist is the continued vindication of the independence and integrity of that unhappy country.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Lord, I think, was not quite accurate in saying that we had withdrawn the stipulation that in no case would the ex-Shah be allowed to return to Persia without our leave. I think, as a matter of fact, that the position was maintained that a return of the ex-Shah into Persia at all without our consent was altogether inadmissible, and to that the Russian Government agreed. On the general merits, I may say that all I know of the character and proceedings of the ex-Shah would lead me to suppose that there is little or no prospect of any such leave being given.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02058"><member>LORD PLUNKET</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have an Amendment to move at this stage. It is to omit the proviso in Clause 1. Your Lordships will remember that in Committee I withdrew this Amendment at the suggestion of the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, with the idea of endeavouring to find some way of getting rid of the difficulty with which we are confronted owing to the insertion in the Bill of this proviso, which is very much objected to by the Irish creameries. I am sorry to say that, though I have consulted with the noble Lord in charge of the Bill, we have not been able to find any way out of the difficulty, and therefore I am compelled to press this Amendment. I trust that in another place some alternative proviso may be agreed upon which will satisfy the Board of Trade and at the same time not render this Bill a contentious one.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02060"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this subject was fully discussed yesterday when the Committee stage of the Bill was taken, and I do not think it is necessary to repeat the arguments which were then stated. I must say I regret very much the action of the noble Lord in seeking to delete this proviso. The only desire we have in inserting it is to protect the British salesman who quite inadvertently sells as creamery butter Irish creamery butter not made in a registered creamery. I sincerely hope that language may be discovered later which will satisfy all parties. I do not propose to trouble your Lordships to divide upon this Amendment, but I must say that we reserve to ourselves the right to reinsert it in another place if, as perhaps may be the case, some compromise is not reached. My noble friend Lord Lucas is in his place, and I hope he will give your Lordships the benefit of the view entertained on this subject by the Board of Agriculture.</membercontribution></p>
<col>700</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02061"><sup>*</sup><member>THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is an Irish Bill and one which does not affect our Department, except that we have in this particular case to safeguard as far as we can the interests of English traders who are concerned. I can assure the noble Lord opposite that we will do everything we possibly can to assist the interests he has at heart. We fully realise what admirable institutions these creameries are, and we wish that we could have had the same success in this country in starting co-operative creameries. We do not wish to do anything to injure Irish creameries, but at the same time the matter has to be looked at from the point of view of the English trader. With the best will in the world towards Irish creameries it is a little difficult to give them a monopoly in the word "creamery." Ireland is by no means the only place which has creameries. We have creameries here; and a great deal of creamery butter comes into this country from abroad. Unless the trader can be perfectly certain of the country of origin, which is not always easy, it would be impossible for him, if this Amendment is agreed to, to call butter "creamery butter" at all; or, if he does, he runs the risk of its being discovered to have come from an Irish creamery and then he lays himself open to the penalties in the Bill. It is hard on the English trader that it should be necessary for him in all cases to trace the origin of the creamery butter he sells. Therefore, while we are prepared to go a good way to meet the objects of the promoters of this Bill, we think that what the noble Lord is asking for in his Amendment is pushing the thing a little too far. May I add this word of warning? As far as we know, the Bill is accepted by all parties in Ireland, but I do not think English traders have been consulted on the measure. It is difficult to prophesy, but there is a strong probability that if the noble Lord's Amendment is agreed to there will be mobilised against this Bill a very strong body of opinion on the part of the traders of this country which would seriously endanger the prospects of the Bill passing into law.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0012P0I0355"/>
<col>701</col>
delayed for a few days so as to give us ampler opportunity of going into the merits of the question. For some reason best known to the parties another decision has been arrived at, and the Bill comes on again this evening. We remain of opinion that my noble friend who moved this Amendment was able to show a strong case in favour of it. He was able to tell the House that agricultural opinion in Ireland, and not only agricultural opinion but official opinion in Ireland, is solid in favour of the omission of this proviso, which if it were allowed to remain in the Bill would, in the opinion of those concerned in the creamery industry, open a door to serious abuse. That is the <i>prima facie</i> view of the case and it appeals very strongly to me. The noble Lord opposite is able to suggest that there may be hard cases on the other side. That is possibly so. But in the meantime I am inclined to think that, having regard to the great weight of opinion behind my noble friend's Amendment, the better course will be to delete the proviso. That will not at all prevent the further consideration of the point, and we shall all, I have no doubt, be well pleased if some compromise which will meet the views of both parties is arrived at before the Bill becomes law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02063"><member>LORD PLUNKET</member><membercontribution>: I should like to say that the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society fully appreciates that the Board of Trade may have an excellent case, but this proviso has been drawn up in a way which cannot satisfy Irish creameries. The noble Lord opposite stated that the Bill was agreed to by practically all parties in Ireland. It is agreed to generally by all parties, but not with this proviso. There is not one single co-operative creamery that we have heard from&#x2014;and we have heard from a great many&#x2014;which is not opposed to this proviso. We are most ready to work with the Board of Trade in this matter if we can, and if the proviso is deleted now we hope that before the Bill comes up for Second Reading in another place we may be able to find some way out of the difficulty which will satisfy all parties.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE GOVERNMENT'S LAND POLICY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02066"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> rose to call attention to a statement attributed to Mr. Outhwaite, M.P., at Crewe on July 22 at a Liberal meeting, that Mr. Lloyd George, with the support of the Prime Minister, will embark this autumn on a great campaign which is to be continued right up to the next General Election, "to do something for the overthrow of the land monopoly"; and to ask whether there is any foundation for Mr. Outhwaite's statement; and, if so, whether it correctly represents the intentions of His Majesty's Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02067">The noble Earl said: Your Lordships probably noticed in <i>The Times</i> a report of the speech by Mr. Outhwaite at a Liberal meeting in Crewe, where a by-election is now pending, in which he made the statement contained in my Notice. That statement is a very open and clear statement. Mr. Outhwaite used the words "Mr. Lloyd George, with the support of the Prime Minister." That is equivalent to the Government, because these two Ministers cannot be regarded as independent members of the House of Commons. According to Mr. Outhwaite there is to be "a great campaign to do something for the overthrow of the land monopoly." When I read this I could not help contrasting it with the speech which we heard on Monday from the noble Marquess the Leader of the House, who I regret is not in his place to-day. On that occasion the noble Marquess was asked for some information with regard to the so-called unofficial Committee, and he said he could give none. He was asked for the names of the members of that Committee, and he said he could not give them. He then proceeded to belittle by all the language in his power the effect of that Committee and to explain to your Lordships that we must not take the matter seriously, that it was not a thing which proceeded from the Government but was entirely unofficial. In fact, the language in which he indulged would have done credit to the Delphic oracle from the point of view of mysteriousness and uncertainty. He only told us one thing&#x2014;namely, that he is not a Single Taxer.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02068">The noble Marquess then went on to very much depreciate the value of that statement by finding fault with Lord Ribblesdale for having spoken of a "new
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0356"/>
<col>703</col>
policy." He said there was no such thing as a new policy&#x2014;that the Government of the day was the Government of the day, and the policy of the Government was the policy of the Government; and to speak of such a thing as a new policy was, he said, an hallucination. I could not help thinking at the moment that, according to this argument, it is perfectly easy for any Government at any time to alter their policy completely and then to say "This is not a new policy because it is the policy of the Government." Contrasting that speech with the statement by Mr. Outhwaite I should like to ask your Lordships, To which of those statements does probability more attach? I think I shall be able to show your Lordships in a very few words that all the positive evidence that we have is in favour of Mr. Outhwaite's statement that this policy is the policy of the Government and that it is going to be pursued accordingly. In the first place, we know that Mr. Lloyd George has a positive policy with regard to land, and Mr. Lloyd George, as we also know, is a very powerful member of the Government. He has made a statement to this effect once or twice. In a letter which he wrote on the occasion of a recent by-election he said&#x2014;
<quote>"Our present land system may have served some useful purpose in the past, but it has long ceased to be anything but a burden and a blight."</quote>
Then, again, speaking at Woodford, he said that the land was in the "shackles of feudalism" and so on, and that it was their duty "to free the land." Therefore there is no doubt as to what Mr. Lloyd George's policy is with regard to the land.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02069">Now Mr. Lloyd George's policy, according to the Prime Minister, is shared by all his colleagues. On July 8 Mr. Asquith was asked whether the statements of Mr. Lloyd George at Woodford were approved of by the Government and his answer was&#x2014;
<quote>"The views expressed by my right hon. friend in his speech at Woodford as to the necessity for land reform are shared by his colleagues."</quote>
Therefore these are not merely the views of Mr. Lloyd George; they are the views of His Majesty's Government. Then in appointing this so-called unofficial Committee Mr. Lloyd George had Mr. Asquith's approval. In reply to a question Mr. Asquith said&#x2014;
<quote>"My right hon. friend has with my approval approached certain gentlemen &#x2026; with a view to securing their services on an unofficial Committee which has been formed for the purpose of investigating the question of land reform."</quote>
<col>704</col>
in the same afternoon he was asked whether there was any precedent for an individual Minister of the Crown appointing a Committee to deal with a subject like this, and Mr. Asquith replied&#x2014;
<quote>"I said the Committee was appointed with my sanction."</quote>
Therefore, my Lords, it is quite clear that this cannot properly be described as an unofficial Committee. I do not see how the word "official" can possibly be withheld from it seeing the auspices under which it was appointed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02070">Further than that, this very extreme theory of land taxation is being pressed by Liberal candidates at the various by-elections, more especially at the by-election which is now taking place for the Crewe Division. Mr. Murphy, the Liberal candidate there, has been gradually advancing in his views with regard to land. He was a little modest and rather coy at first; then he progressed until he reached a 2<i>d.</i> tax on the capital value of land; and yesterday he advanced still further. He did not enter into a figure, but he said this&#x2014;
<quote>"Take whatever figure you choose. A penny will bring in &#x00A3;25,000,000; 2<i>d.</i> will bring in &#x00A3;50,000,000. That would enable you to wipe off every single duty now on the necessities of life and relieve poor people of their burdens."</quote>
The Prime Minister, in writing his approval of Mr. Murphy's candidature, did not refer to this extreme doctrine as going beyond his own individual opinions. What he said was this&#x2014;
<quote>"I trust that the Progressive forces in Crewe will return you at the top of the poll to strengthen and encourage the Liberal Government in the arduous work which lies before them."</quote>
It is evident, therefore, that Mr. Asquith thoroughly endorses Mr. Murphy's candidature; and if the Prime Minister is not a Single Taxer himself he is not ashamed and not unwilling to take advantage of the votes which will be obtained by Mr. Murphy, who is in favour of extreme taxation. I think I have said enough to prove to your Lordships that all the positive evidence we have is in favour of supporting the statement made at Crewe by Mr. Outhwaite.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02071">I do not know who will reply to my Question on behalf of His Majesty's Government, but I wish&#x2014;I cannot say I hope&#x2014;I could be told that there is nothing in this statement by Mr. Outhwaite, that it does not in any sense represent the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0357"/>
<col>705</col>
intentions of His Majesty's Government, and that His Majesty's Government will take no part in such a programme. But if there is something in Mr. Outhwaite's statement&#x2014;and, as I have said, I am afraid it cannot be contradicted&#x2014;if there is anything in it and if His Majesty's Government have a policy on this matter, why do they not tell us what that policy is? It seems to me that it is the duty of the Leader of this House, or whoever represents him, to speak out on a matter of such vital importance. I can assure your Lordships that nothing can be of such disservice to the country and to the interests of the country as for the Government to indulge in hesitation and ambiguities and to attempt to conceal&#x2014;the concealment, of course, can only be for a very short time&#x2014;from the country what their real policy with regard to land is.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02072"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it seems to me that the noble Earl is alarming himself quite unnecessarily. In the statement of Mr. Outhwaite, which the noble Earl considers definite and important, I find anything but definiteness, and I cannot find much of importance in it. What in the world may the words "to do something to overthrow the land monopoly" mean or not mean? The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition has been recently associating himself with most laudable efforts to enlarge the ownership of land in this country. I suppose that may well be described as "doing something to overthrow the land monopoly," and that the Ashbourne Acts in Ireland and the Land Purchase Act of the late Government also may be brought within that description. I suppose the legislation with which this Government is associated for land purchase is something in the same direction. I hope that more efforts will be made to bring the land and the owners and occupiers of land into closer contact; and in that sense I hope that a vigorous campaign will be continued up to the next General Election to do something to overthrow the land monopoly. But as to whether it will be on the lines of the noble Marquess's policy or on other lines there is nothing in this quotation which throws any light. Mr. Outhwaite spoke for himself, and had no authority to speak for the Government. I know nothing of his statement except what appears in the noble Earl's Notice on the Paper, and no more, I believe, do my colleagues. What
<col>706</col>
the Government land programme will be is a question the Government will pronounce upon when they have had full opportunity to consider it. The noble Earl referred to the unofficial Committee. As my noble friend Lord Crewe said on Monday, the Committee is absolutely non-official&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

It is not likely to include the Single Tax or any of the alarming things of which the noble Earl has spoken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02075"><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, such light as the noble and learned Viscount has afforded us is darkness, and I think that what he has told us will only add to the confusion of the loss subtle intelligences of average men. The Lord Chancellor is perfectly entitled, as a debating point, to shift everything connected with this matter on to Mr. Outhwaite. Except just now, when the noble Earl reminded him of certain facts, he seemed completely to ignore the very open and definite statements which have been made by powerful members of the Government. He told us that Lord Crewe had explained exactly what the Committee was to do and the work on which it was going to engage. It involved what the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition described as "extended peregrinations all over England." Then Lord Lansdowne asked two important questions. He asked whether the Committee were going to take evidence and evidence on one side only, and whether in considering their Report the Reports of Royal Commissions on this subject in recent years were to be entirely set aside. But although we had from the Leader of the House on Monday last a long speech couched in that excellent tone of taste and courtesy and consideration for people who do not agree with him which always characterises Lord Crewe's speeches, I think the noble and
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0358"/>
<col>707</col>
learned Viscount on the Woolsack is stretching the English language to extreme limits when he tells the House that very much was explained to us. I did not grasp the true inwardness of Lord Crewe's observation the other night as to the hallucination under which we were supposed to be suffering in describing this as a new policy. I subscribe entirely to what Lord Camperdown said about the new policy. This is not an expression which we have coined. Day after day in the <i>Daily News</i> we see the headline, "The New Liberal Policy." That must mean something. At all events I have not heard anything from the Government which convinces me that it means nothing. Mr. Outhwaite is only one of many people who, following the lead of a powerful Minister, have taken this line and announced the crusade on the new policy. The mystery amuses me. These are days of tourneys, and if they like to masquerade throughout the country as un-named Ivanhoes we have no objection; but we know under whom they act. I should be the first to agree that we can go too far a field into conjecture as to what land reformers may have in their minds, or what they may be in a position, which is much more important, to force the Government to do. But I am bound to say that this extraordinary blend of Delphic utterances and categorical statements does drive us into conjectures of this kind. They may be conjectures; but these two things acting together naturally give rise to alarm and suspicion, which I do not think either the speech of the noble Marquess on Monday night or the few words from the noble and learned Viscount to-night are likely to allay, in the minds of people who have some little apprehension as to what this new policy may land us all into.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02076"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack has, if he will forgive me for saying so, shown himself a very ingenious but not a very convincing commentator upon a somewhat doubtful text. He fastened upon the use by Mr. Outhwaite of the words "land monopoly," and I think he suggested that I, too, desired the land monopoly to be broken down. I object very much to the use of the term "land monopoly," because I do not believe there is any such thing at the present time. The facts of which we are every day made aware by the public Press
<col>708</col>
show that land is not at this moment by any means held as a monopoly. I quite agree with the noble and learned Viscount in thinking that it is a great misfortune that the land of this country should be in the hands of a comparatively small number of people, and I am quite willing to co-operate with him in any movement directed to bring- about a dispersal of the land among a larger number of owners. But that was not by any means what was suggested by Mr. Outhwaite in his speech at Crewe. What Mr. Outhwaite stated, and stated, I venture to think, quite definitely, was that a great campaign&#x2014;which he described as the greatest contest between privilege and the people that had been known since the days of the Corn Laws&#x2014;was to be undertaken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer with the approval of the Prime Minister. That was a perfectly definite, and I must say a somewhat alarming, statement. I dislike it because it seems to me to be full of that class prejudice which is always imported, so it seems to me, when these questions are discussed in Radical circles. What my noble friend has asked is, I think, a perfectly legitimate question&#x2014;or I should say three perfectly legitimate questions. He asks whether this story of the great campaign is true or not. The noble and learned Viscount, apparently, is not aware whether it is true or whether it is not true. Then my noble friend asks whether this unofficial and informal Inquiry, which, remember, has been undertaken at the request of the Government and the results of which are to be made available for the information of the Government, for that has been distinctly stated&#x2014;whether this Inquiry has nothing to do with the great campaign which is to take place in the autumn. We can, I think, draw our own conclusion as to that. And, thirdly, my noble friend asks whether it is the case, as it evidently is the case, that the Inquiry and the campaign are very closely indeed connected. If they are, what becomes of the statement made by the noble Marquess who leads the House when he told us that there was no question of this Inquiry leading to a new policy and that those who had any such anticipation were labouring under an hallucination? Those are three simple and straightforward questions, and I venture to say they have not been answered this evening.</membercontribution></p>

<title>AGRICULTURAL HOLDINGS BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02102">Debate on the Motion, That the House do resolve itself into Committee <i>resumed</i> (according to Order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02103"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the House proceeds further with this Bill I desire to say a few words with regard to it. If the noble Lord in charge of the Bill (Lord Lucas) thinks that any useful purpose can be served by proceeding to discuss the Amendments which are on the Paper we are prepared to discuss them, but I wish to intimate to him as clearly as I can that those of us who sit upon this side of the House are not prepared to take the remaining stages of the Bill before the adjournment for the holidays, and I really want His Majesty's Government to Consider very carefully whether in those circumstances there is any advantage in dealing with the Committee stage to-night. This is a Bill which has been introduced by His Majesty's Government for the purpose of giving relief to a certain class of farmer&#x2014;the sitting tenant who finds himself disturbed in consequence of the sale of the estate; but it is a remarkable thing that since the measure first made its appearance not only has not one single word, so far as I am aware, of commendation proceeded from any of the bodies which represent the agricultural interest in this country, but from a great number of those bodies, including some of the most influential of them, there have proceeded resolutions and reports condemning the Bill in the strongest possible language, and so far as I am able to judge the disfavour with which the measure is regarded tends, if anything, to increase. I ask the noble Lord in charge of the Bill, who has been aware of all these expressions of disfavour, whether he is able to produce to-night any authentic evidence that any appreciable section of the agricultural interest really supports or cares about this Bill. I doubt it extremely.<lb/>
There is another matter which I ask the House to consider. There is evidence to show that the Government themselves have scarcely given to the details of this Bill the consideration which they deserve. There is a notable illustration of this in the fact that we were able to point out when the Bill was first produced that Clause 1 was altogether ineffectual for the purpose of giving protection to the sitting tenant in cases
<col>712</col>
where the owner of the estate might decide to postpone the sale. I am bound to say that the noble Lord saw the force of this argument, because he has now on the Paper an Amendment dealing with that point. It was a point dealt with in the first instance by my noble friend Lord St. Levan, and it was not until the 6th of this month&#x2014;the Bill, if I remember right, first saw the light in April&#x2014;it was not until the 6th of this month that the Government's Amendment made its appearance on the Paper. I cite that in order to show that in all probability His Majesty's Government themselves would gain a great deal by a little further time for the examination of these questions. I do not desire to obstruct this Bill. I have admitted throughout that there is a grievance which we should all like to redress, but I do doubt extremely whether the Bill as we now see it is the best means of dealing with that grievance. I want to put it quite good-humouredly to the noble Lord in charge of the Bill whether in these circumstances there is anything to be gained by proceeding with the discussion to-night. It is not really as if we were pressed for time. After the summer adjournment we shall come back here in October, and so far as I am aware we are not likely to be overwhelmed with work. Would it not be much better in those circumstances to let the question stand over, and in the meanwhile His Majesty's Government will have further opportunities of ascertaining for themselves how their proposals are really regarded by the farmers of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02104"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: Before the noble Lord in charge of the Bill replies, I should like to say one word in support of the suggestion made by the noble Marquess. I would go a step further, and repeat what I said on the last occasion, that it really would be in the interests of agriculture that this Bill should be withdrawn altogether; for although the Government have at last found it is necessary to put down some Amendments to the measure they have not in any sense mollified the opposition to their scheme on the part of farmers, who are as bitterly opposed to it as ever they have been. But I suppose, the Government having once refused to withdraw the scheme altogether, I can hardly hope that they will do so now. At the same time I support the suggestion of the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0361"/>
<col>713</col>
noble Marquess that, at all events, they should, having in view the fact that we cannot get through all the stages of this Bill before the adjournment, postpone it and take the further advice of agriculturists generally on the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02105"><sup>*</sup><member>THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was not aware until I arrived at the House this afternoon that this particular suggestion was going to be made, and I have rune down I am afraid inadequately supplied with the evidence for which the noble Marquess has asked. He asks what evidence we have that this Bill is receiving support from any large class of agriculturists. I have every reason to believe that it does receive a considerable amount of support, but not having brought with me chapter and verse I hesitate, as so much depends on accuracy, to state the sources, but I believe there is considerable support for this Bill in the country, though I do not think the support has been quite so outspoken as the opposition, but that is a common feature of every measure. At any rate we think we have sufficient evidence to satisfy ourselves and to back up our own strong opinion that this Bill is one which, if passed into law, will go a considerable distance in alleviating the particular evil which it is intended to meet.<lb/>
As to the noble Marquess's suggestion of postponing the Bill, may I put this point to him? We have put down a considerable number of Amendments to the Bill, certain of which we hope to see passed, and I have no doubt there will be other Amendments inserted in spite of what some of us would wish. Therefore the Bill would emerge from the Committee stage a very different Bill from what it is now, and if we are to obtain a further expression of opinion upon it would it not be better that the Bill should go through its Committee stage now in order that it may in its amended form be published, so that the various persons interested may see it in its amended form and express their opinion? If that were done we should, when we meet again in the autumn, be in a better position to judge on the question than if we were to adjourn the debate now and wait until the autumn before inserting the Amendments that are down on the Paper to-day.</membercontribution></p>
<col>714</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02106"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord deals with this matter with so much good humour that I feel some scruples about interfering in this debate on the other side. At the same time, I would point out to your Lordships that the noble Lord has himself given one very good reason for postponing the debate on this Bill. He is unable, for want of notice no doubt, to give us any information at all to-day as to the amount of support which this Bill has received from the agricultural interest in the country. He admits that it has received a good deal of opposition. No doubt if the Bill were postponed he might be able to give us some facts in support of his contention, but he has given us none to-day. But there is another reason. I am told on good authority that a very important agricultural body, the Central Chamber of Agriculture, at a recent meeting passed a resolution appointing a committee to examine and report upon this Bill. That committee cannot complete its labours until the autumn. By that time we shall have before us the matured views of the Central Chamber of Agriculture, certainly the most representative body which agriculturists possess, on the proposals of this Bill. If they are in accordance with the views of His Majesty's Government, that undoubtedly would be a strong argument in favour of the Bill. If, on the other hand, they are opposed to the Bill, surely that would be a very strong additional reason for not proceeding with it any further.<lb/>
I have during my political life given a great deal of attention in both Houses of Parliament to subjects of this kind. I suppose I have taken part in the discussion of more Agricultural Holdings Bills and Bills of that kind than any member of your Lordships' House, and I have always endeavoured to do the best I could for the farmers in dealing with this matter. But I must say that the more I look at the proposals of this Bill the more I am convinced that from every point of view&#x2014;from the point of view of the landlord, from the point of view of the farmer, from the point of view of agriculture generally, and from the point of view of facilitating the sale of estates and their division among smaller owners&#x2014;this Bill is a mistake. I believe that the amount of good it could do as regards the sitting tenant would be infinitesimal as compared with the amount
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0362"/>
<col>715</col>
of harm which it would do to all other interests. The length of occupation which it would give to a tenant whose tenancy, after all, would be doomed would be detrimental to agriculture, for a long notice of the kind when a man has to leave at the end of that notice really tempts him to work out his farm to the injury of everybody concerned.<lb/>
Then there is the doubt, which in my mind is a strong one, as to the circumstances in which the Bill should take effect. Nothing could be vaguer than the words of the Bill, that it is to take effect "where the landlord of a holding in connection with a sale or offering for sale of any part thereof gives notice." Where a man had taken some public steps towards the sale of the estate the Bill would apply. But suppose, on the other hand, that the owner of a holding, wishing not to bring himself under the provisions of the Bill, takes no public step whatever before giving notice to his tenants with regard to his intention to sell. The Bill would then open a question between landlord and tenant which would lead to litigation between the parties. If it did apply it would place a great impediment in the way of dividing estates into a large number of small lots to facilitate the purchase by occupying owners of a certain amount of land, which we all desire to see brought about, but which this Bill would simply prevent; because who would buy a field or a small farm with the knowledge that he could not occupy it for eighteen months or two years Unless the Central Chamber of Agriculture pronounce in favour of this Bill I should certainly join with any noble Lords who opposed it in its future stages. The Bill, in my opinion, will do infinitely more harm to other interests concerned than it will do good to the sitting tenant. In order to bring the matter to an issue I beg to move that the debate be now adjourned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02107">Moved, That the debate be further adjourned.&#x2014;(<i>Viscount St. Aldwyn.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02108"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LINCOLNSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on the Motion for the adjournment of this debate I should like to say a word. The attitude of noble Lords opposite is, I am bound to say, a great disappointment to those who firmly believe in this Bill. I venture to think that the speech of
<col>716</col>
the noble Viscount is really a reason why the Bill should be proceeded with at once. The noble Viscount said he considered that the Bill was entirely a mistake. Personally as a supporter of His Majesty's Government, I think that this is a very good Bill. If noble Lords opposite think it is wrong, why do they not have the courage of their opinions and throw it out or produce something better? I do think that the agricultural interests in this country will be disappointed to see this Bill put on one side as if it were of no importance whatever.<lb/>
After all, what great objections are there to this Bill? Some weeks ago Lord Clinton quite reasonably asked the House to postpone the Bill in order to consider the objections, and His Majesty's Government at once fell in with his wishes and the matter was postponed. What, after all, are the great objections to this Bill? As far as I can make out, they are only three&#x2014;really only two and a half, because the third objection is consequent on the second and is only alternative. As to the first objection I think that can be dismissed in a few words. The first objection, we are told, is the land agents' objection&#x2014;that the Bill would increase the premium on had farming. To quote their words&#x2014;
<quote>"If a tenant keeps his farm eighteen months after the sale it will be a great temptation to a bad tenant to farm to leave."</quote>
We all know that those will be exceptional cases; and, after all, the landlord is protected by Section 3 of the Land Tenure Act. It is the custom in some parts of England to give two years' notice to quit, and it answers very well indeed. The second objection to this Bill is met by an Amendment which Lord Lucas proposes to insert if he is permitted to do so. Lord Salisbury, speaking for the landlords of England, told us six weeks ago that, human nature being what it is, he thought it natural enough that a landlord would postpone the sale for another year. What does that mean? The grievance is admitted by the noble Marquess opposite and by everybody. The Bill is brought in by His Majesty's Government to remedy that grievance, and the noble Marquess, speaking for English landlords <i>en bloc,</i> declared that they would evade the law. In the language of noble Lords opposite, all that will happen will be that the agony of the unfortunate tenant will be prolonged, and
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0363"/>
<col>717</col>
the last stage of that man will be worse than the first.<lb/>
But that is not all. English landlordism being what it is, tenant farmers are convinced that landlords when property is put up for sale intend to show them no mercy, and that when estates are put up to auction landlords mean practically to evict&#x2014;perhaps that is too strong a word&#x2014;to expose the tenants to eviction at three months' notice, so that by offering vacant possession they call secure tip-top prices for their farms. I am not speaking of the landlords of England who are at the mercy of moneylenders and are really nothing but mere rent-chargers. I am speaking now of the landlords who have the power to deal with their estates. This objection is dealt with by the Amendment of my noble friend which is on the Paper to-day. Now we come to the opinions of the farmers of England. These were voiced by Lord Clinton in the last debate, when he told us that the only remedy which the farmers could see was State-aided purchase. What does State-aided purchase mean? It means my right hon. friend Mr. Jesse Collings's Bill pure and simple.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02109"><member>LORD CLINTON</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble Marquess is assuming too much. The right hon. gentleman's Bill is not the only Bill before the country at this moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02110"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LINCOLNSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: I thought the noble Lord was speaking for the farmers. Everybody knows that Mr. Jesse Collings's Bill has been received with great acclamation, and resolutions in favour of it have been passed by the Central Chamber of Agriculture, by the Scottish Chamber of Agriculture, and by the Farmers' Club. I do not know whether a resolution in its favour has been passed by the Farmers' Union, but resolutions in favour of it have been passed by 168 Chambers of Agriculture in the country. Now nobody knows better than we do that some of these Chambers are simply Conservative Associations. [Several noble LORDS: No, no.] I know that in my own county the Chamber of Agriculture is simply a Conservative organisation to assist the return of a Conservative Member. Still, of course, it is a great feather in Mr. Jesse Collings's cap that he has been supported by 168 Chambers of Agriculture all over the country; and I notice that in the <i>Nine</i>-

I was somewhat sceptical about that statement, but I read in <i>The Times</i> this morning, with regard to Lord Lansdowne's declaration last night, that Mr. Jesse Collings had informed one of the reporters of that paper that&#x2014;
<quote>"What we have been pressing for for a long time is now settled."</quote>
Well, what is that? It is legislation for English farmers on Irish lines. You cannot possibly get away from that. It is set forth by Mr. Jesse Collings's spokesman and friend, Mr. Green, the secretary of the Rural League, in the following cryptic but ungrammatical sentence&#x2014;
<quote>"Whatever is good enough for the Government of the day to do for Ireland, this country ought to have the same privileges."</quote>
I am well aware that Mr. Jesse Collings's Bill only proposes to ask for the trifling sum of &#x00A3;12,000,000 as an experiment&#x2014;&#x00A3;10,000,000, of course, to go to the big men and &#x00A3;2,000,000 to the smaller holders. Consider what that means. True it is only &#x00A3;12,000,000, but once you embark on this policy it will be impossible to refuse to the majority of sitting tenants the facilities which you afford to a favoured few. That is absolute gospel truth. Lord Lansdowne, I think, sees that. For in accepting Mr. Jesse Collings's proposals yesterday the noble Marquess said&#x2014;
<quote>"If they proceeded on the lines of Mr. Jesse Collings's Bill they would succeed so completely that they would be impelled to proceed further on the same lines."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02111"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I do not know what report the noble Marquess is quoting from, but he is quite in error in supposing that I accepted Mr. Jesse Collings's Bill or the Bill of any one else. Mr. Jesse Collings had inserted in his Bill what seemed to me to be a very useful clause, to the effect that in any proposal which he supported he desired that the financial basis should be such as to protect the public against loss. It was that, and that alone, to which I referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02112"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LINCOLNSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: Then how does that reconcile itself with the statement in <i>The Times</i> to-day that the noble Marquess and his colleagues are in

<col>719</col>
favour of Mr. Jesse Collings's Bill? The noble Marquess was yesterday on Mr. Jesse Collings's platform, with Mr. Jesse Collings in the chair, approving&#x2014;I think anybody would get that deduction from the noble Marquess's speech&#x2014;of his proposals and saying, in the words I have just quoted, that if they proceeded on the lines of Mr. Jesse Collings's Bill they would succeed so completely that they would be impelled to proceed further on the same lines. What does that mean? What is Mr. Jesse Collings's Bill if brought to its natural conclusion? If you proceed&#x2014;as is proposed in Mr. Collings's Bill&#x2014;on Irish lines it means &#x00A3;120,000,000 which will have to be paid to English landlords and something like a total loan of a billion for a land purchase scheme. That was Mr. Jesse Collings's proposal as brought before Lord Haversham's Committee, and when asked where on earth all this money was to come from Mr. Green, Mr. Jesse Collings's spokesman, said it would come from taxation. There was consternation at that proposal; and then he said, "I think we could get it from a Guaranteed Land Stock at 3 or 3&#x00BC; per cent." when everybody knows that you cannot get money under 4 per cent. I really think on this side of the House we have a right&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02114"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LINCOLNSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: The Motion before the House is for the further adjournment of the Bill. The noble Viscount opposite, in moving that Motion, was allowed to make a long statement about the iniquities and the wrongdoings of this Bill; yet I am called to order because I try in my own feeble way&#x2014;ridiculous way, no doubt&#x2014;to combat the most practised, the most finished, and the ablest debater on the Opposition side of the House. I only ask for fair play. I think I might be allowed to say in this House what I say outside, for I am never afraid to state in your Lordships' presence what I say on the public platform outside. All I have to add is that the proposal in Mr. Jesse Collings's Bill, which was, as far as I could understand, approved of yesterday by the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition, has to-day been repudiated by the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>
<col>720</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02115"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My speech was, as far as I know, faithfully reported in <i>The Times,</i> and if the noble Marquess will stick to what he finds in that report I shall not quarrel with him. But he has been putting a number of glosses on the text which have unfortunately altered the meaning.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02116"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LINCOLNSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: I quoted the noble Marquess's exact words. I should like to ask whether there is any noble Lord on the Front Bench opposite who will get up and say that he is in favour of Mr. Jesse Collings's proposals. All I can say is that on the side of noble Lords opposite there does not seem to be a great consensus of opinion, for a Unionist writer in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> calls Mr. Jesse Collings's proposal a "vast and ridiculous scheme" for peasant proprietorship and appeals to Mr. Bonar Law to "knock it on the head." I feel certain there will be great disappointment in the agricultural world at this perpetual postponement of Lord Lucas's Bill, which is intended solely to rectify a grievance admitted by every noble Lord on the other side of the House. I do not think the public generally will endorse the proposals of Mr. Jesse Collings, whether or not they are supported by noble Lords opposite, but that they would welcome the more practical and certainly the less revolutionary terms which the Government offer in this Bill, which I venture to hope will eventually become law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02117"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I intervene in this discussion with some diffidence, and I do so partly to apologise to the noble Marquess opposite if I unduly interrupted him. I desired to remind the House that the question before us at the moment is the narrow one of whether or not we shall adjourn this debate for a certain number of weeks; and for the life of me, even after the additional explanation given by the noble Marquess opposite, I am at a loss to see how the merits or demerits of Mr. Jesse Collings's proposals or the speech which the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition made yesterday have the remotest connection at all with the question of whether or not we should adjourn this particular debate. But I am not going to pursue that point. This is a tolerant Assembly on points of order, and there is no individual in the House to whom it delights in being more tolerant than the noble Marquess, Lord Lincolnshire.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0365"/>
<col>721</col>
I venture to make what I think is a practical suggestion. I share the objections to giving too long a notice when a tenancy is going to be determined. There are great and obvious dangers in that which any practical man knows and can take account of. We are at one on one important matter&#x2014;namely, that there is a certain grievance or liability to grievance which has to be remedied. The Government have made certain proposals in this Bill. Those proposals have been criticised. Whether they have been criticised from a purely Party point of view, as the noble Marquess seemed to suggest, or from an agricultural point of view does not touch the suggestion which I am going to make to the House. These proposals have been criticised, and apparently they have been criticised with such effect that the Government themselves have put down some Amendments to the Bill. Would it not be a practical suggestion that we should go into Committee to-day to this extent&#x2014;to let the Government put in what Amendments they choose so as to make their scheme a concrete one? We should then see their scheme as a whole without having to look to Amendments which they had placed on the Paper. However well-intentioned agricultural societies or even land agents' societies may be, it would be better for them to have the Government's amended proposals before them during the recess, and we could then see how far the Amendments had brought us together.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02118"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: As far as I am personally concerned, I have no objection to Lord Balfour's proposal. I think it would have this advantage, that the Central Chamber of Agriculture would have before them when they consider it the Bill as the Government desire it to be.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02119"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am under a certain disadvantage in dealing with this matter, because I have not been able to follow the earlier stages of this Bill in the sense of being present in the House while the discussions took place. I am, therefore, rather in the position of a questioner in this matter. Perhaps before I put the questions which I have in my mind I might say that it is true that my noble friend behind me, Lord Lincolnshire, did not in his speech confine himself exclusively to the question whether
<col>722</col>
this debate should or should not be adjourned, but that is no novel experience for us in this House, and I am quite sure that noble Lords opposite were prepared to receive with full good-humour the observations of my noble friend. I confess it did not appear to me, so far as the speech as a whole was concerned, that my noble friend's observations were in any way irrelevant, for this reason. It is assumed, at any rate for the purposes of argument, that there is a grievance or a difficulty in the case of certain sitting tenants when a property is sold over their heads, and the question is how that grievance or difficulty can be met.<lb/>
It is proposed in this measure to meet the difficulty in a particular way. As I understand it, the answer of those who dislike the provisions of the Bill is this. They say there is a more excellent way of meeting this difficulty, and that by their plan, if not in all cases at any rate in selected cases, the tenant may become the purchaser by an advance of public money. I have certainly no desire to discuss the merits of any proposal for the creation of tenant purchasers, still less the question whether it is possible, as I gather noble Lords opposite hope, or the noble Marquess Lord Lansdowne hopes, to limit such advances to certain selected cases. I think my noble friend Lord Lincolnshire's observations were perfectly relevant, because he was treating a certain proposition as a substitute for the clauses in this Bill and was assuming, as it seems to me he was entitled to assume, that one reason for the apparently indefinite postponement of the consideration of the particular proposals in this Bill was to be found in the fact that a definite scheme for the substitution of some form of tenant purchase might be forthcoming in their place. If that is so, I venture to say my noble friend's observations were perfectly relevant.<lb/>
But the questions I desire to ask noble Lords opposite are, What is the precise reason for desiring a further postponement of the consideration of these clauses? What is it expected will be gained in the public interest by a postponement of the discussion? I have no desire to go into the merits of the various proposals. The noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, has explained his objection to certain proposals which he considers may encourage bad
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0366"/>
<col>723</col>
farming rather than good and are consequently for nobody's advantage. But what I do not understand is why, if the noble Viscount finds a majority of your Lordships to agree with him, that agreement should not be demonstrated in the ordinary manner by the consideration of these proposals, and, if you will, their rejection by those who do not like them. I should have thought that the consideration of the clauses in the Bill, of my noble friend's Amendments, of some other Amendments which I understand he is prepared to accept and some other Amendments which he will not be prepared to accept but which will presumably be carried against him&#x2014;that a general discussion of that kind would assist those in the country who, as I understand, are still endeavouring to reach some definite conclusion on the subject. It would surely be a more helpful way of proceeding for Chambers of Agriculture or bodies of farmers, for whose opinions I understand noble Lords are waiting, to have the benefit of the discussion in this House and the matured opinions of this House after consideration in Committee rather than for us to wait upon their opinions before arriving at a conclusion. The difficulty, therefore, of adopting the course proposed by Lord Balfour and assented to by the noble Viscount is that there are, as I have said, some Amendments of noble Lords opposite which His Majesty's Government are able to accept, and I confess I do not see what would be lost by continuing the discussion as a whole and placing the Bill in a shape in which it commends itself to the majority of your Lordships' House. The question, therefore, which I have to ask the noble Marquess opposite is, What is the precise gain in the public interest of a further postponement rather than of an immediate consideration of the various clauses in the Bill?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02120"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: It is only by the courtesy of the House that I can speak again, and I do so in reply to the two very precise questions which the noble Marquess has addressed to me. I do not think he would have addressed them if he had been in the House when I made a few remarks earlier in the evening. The noble Marquess asks what is our reason for desiring the postponement of the Committee stage. My answer is that we desire a postponement because there is
<col>724</col>
in our possession an immense amount of evidence to show that the Government proposals are regarded with great and growing disfavour by the agricultural community. The noble Marquess also asked what we expect to gain by a postponement. We expect by a postponement to gain an opportunity of ascertaining for ourselves whether that disfavour is only superficial or whether it is a growing disfavour, and whether it represents a deep-seated conviction in the minds of the farmers of this country. This Bill is intended for the relief of a certain class of farmers, and it seems to me that the first thing that it is necessary for us to know is whether the farmers themselves regard the Bill with favour.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02121"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I confess that I feel very strongly about this measure. I disapprove of it entirely, and should be glad to see it rejected. I agree with the suggestion of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, that we should before proceeding with the Bill have before us the views of the various Chambers of Agriculture. I cannot see any object in going on with the Bill at this moment, and I hope that my noble friend Lord St. Aldwyn, who so clearly put the case before us and showed that the long notice in the Bill would be injurious to every class of agriculture, will persist in his Motion for the further adjournment of this debate. The noble Marquess, Lord Lincolnshire, said there was a good deal of support for this Bill. I venture to say I have never come across it, although I have mixed in agricultural circles all my life and am connected at this moment with an agricultural association which is certainly non-political. I submit that we ought to know when we meet again in October who the supporters of this measure are. As far as I can see, the Bill has received no support whatever from the agricultural community. In the county of Northampton an ardent supporter of the Government who represents the Northampton Chamber of Agriculture is as strongly opposed to this Bill as I am; and so far as our Chamber of Agriculture in the North of England is concerned we would welcome any measure which would be of advantage to agriculture, but we cannot support this Bill.<lb/>
I have one great objection to the Bill, and that is to the lengthening of the period
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0367"/>
<col>725</col>
of notice to quit. I believe that the present term of notice is of essential benefit to the outgoing tenant as well as to the incoming tenant. In many important agricultural districts a system of six months' notice to quit has worked most admirably, and the best relations have existed between the incoming and the outgoing tenant. I am told by a friend of mine, a leading agriculturist, that under a six months' notice to quit, with a Lady Day entry, it is the outgoing tenant who prepares the crops which the incoming tenant will reap, but so complete are the arrangements, under the custom referred to, for the payment of compensation to the outgoing tenant that he has every inducement to farm well up to the moment of quitting. In this way a high state of cultivation is secured on a change of tenancy to the advantage of all parties concerned. This is the custom which prevails under the six months' notice system in many parts of England, and to sweep that away in one fell swoop and substitute the provision in this Bill would, I think, be fatal to agriculture. I hope, therefore, that the debate will be adjourned until October, and that in the meantime we shall ascertain the views of the great agricultural bodies. We shall then be in a better position to deal with the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02122"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to state that I was present at the discussion of this Bill at the Farmers' Club and also at the discussion by the Central Chamber of Agriculture, and I know that the Farmers' Union are in agreement with those two bodies that this Bill is not worth having and not worth amending. None of these bodies will meet again until after the harvest. Therefore they would not be likely to consider any amended Bill which may be reprinted now, supposing we went into a discussion in the manner proposed by Lord Balfour of Burleigh. No doubt it would be a great advantage to have the Bill of the Government as they propose to amend it before us, but if we were to discuss these Amendments, as Lord Crewe suggested, now, I think the whole matter would be forgotten long before the meetings of these practical bodies in November. It would be far better that the discussion should take place here in October just before the meetings of these bodies than that the discussion should take place now and be entirely forgotten before they can meet. I have been connected with the Central
<col>726</col>
Association and the Farmers' Club for forty years, and I entirely disagree with Lord Lincolnshire that these bodies look upon questions from a political point of view. All these questions ale discussed fairly and practically, and I am sure it would be of great advantage that these bodies should have this matter sufficiently in their minds when they meet in November.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02123"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I believe I am in order in speaking to the noble Viscount's Motion for the adjournment of the debate. I do not think we have received an answer to the question which my noble friend the Leader of the House put to the noble Marquess opposite, which was this. As noble Lords opposite attach such importance to obtaining the views of the various Chambers of Agriculture and other bodies, what is the objection to letting them discuss the matter and obtaining their opinion upon the Bill in the form in which it would emerge from Committee? We want their opinion, not on the Bill in the shape in which it stands at this moment, but in the shape in which we hope to put it. I must say I think it is a little humiliating to the dignity of this House to be told that we are to defer our deliberations in order that we may obtain the opinions of a number of bodies, who, as Lord Heneage has told us, will probably not meet to discuss this matter until November. We are quite prepared to consider the opinions of agriculturists. But if we are going to attach so much importance to the opinion of these bodies, surely what we ought to have is the considered opinion which they will be able to give on the Bill in the shape in which it would emerge from the Committee stage. Lord Balfour suggested that we should go into Committee and that the Government Amendments should be inserted, but that the other Amendments should be left over. May I say that that is not a counsel of the greatest valour. It rather looks as if noble Lords opposite felt that they were burning their fingers by touching the Bill at all. There is a practical difficulty in adopting the course which Lord Balfour suggests. There are eight Amendments on the Paper standing in the names of noble Lords opposite, including one of the first importance which Lord St. Levan has put down and which we are prepared to accept. If the Committee stage were taken now and those Amendments became part of the Bill the Bill would be a very different one, and if it were reprinted in the shape in which
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0368"/>
<col>727</col>
it would stand on emerging from the Committee stage we should then be able to obtain a much fairer opinion from agricultural bodies. Therefore I very much hope that we shall take the Committee stage to-day, and we would fix the Report stage and the Third Reading for dates after the</membercontribution></p>

In his absence I have been asked to give the following answer to the noble Earl. Contributions are payable at the English rate while the servants are actually in England (<i>i.e.,</i> in normal cases 7<i>d.</i> a week for men and 6<i>d.</i> a week for women, of which 4<i>d.</i> and 3<i>d.</i> a week respectively may be deducted from wages), and at the Irish rate while the servants are actually in Ireland (<i>i.e.,</i> in normal cases 5&#x00BD;<i>d.</i> a week for men and 4&#x00BD;<i>d.</i> a week for women, of which 3<i>d.</i> and 2<i>d.</i> a week respectively may be deducted from wages). While the servants are in England they will, under the ordinary conditions, be entitled to all the ordinary benefits of the Act, including medical benefit or a money equivalent. While the servants are in Ireland they will be entitled to the ordinary benefits as in England, with the exception of medical benefit.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02130"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: I rise to ask His Majesty's Government whether those workers who have been induced by the National Insurance Committee's leaflets to join friendly societies which had been approved previous to July 15 and may now or in future desire to transfer their cards of membership to other more suitable societies will be able to do so, and under what conditions. The reason I ask this Question is that we have formed a large rural workers' association in Lincolnshire and have already got some 22,000 members. There are a large number of small societies who would like to join it and become affiliated, but a difficulty has arisen. Many of their members, frightened by the leaflet which was circulated a mouth ago, have already become members of the Prudential and other societies, and they do not know whether they would be allowed to transfer their cards to a society which would be of much greater benefit to them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02131"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WILLINGDON</member><membercontribution>: The advice given on the leaflets published by the National Health Insurance Commission is entirely justified. Until a person has been accepted as a member of an approved society he risks prejudicing his admission, either through breakdown of his health in the meantime or through the possibility of the conditions of admission being made more stringent. At present the bulk of approved societies are accepting members practically without any medical test. It is possible that conditions will be made more stringent after the class of deposit contributors has once been formed. Neglect to look for a society now may easily continue until the opportunity is lost unless specific warning is given of the need for early action. In addition, full advice as to his position and rights under the Act will most readily be obtained when the individual has behind him the assistance of an approved society of which he has become a member. If a person who has joined one society desires to transfer to another he must give due notice, to the first society of his intention to withdraw. Transfers are regulated by Section 31 of the National Insurance Act, under which consent to withdrawal cannot be unreasonably withheld by a society; and the Commissioners would be disposed to consider that a society would be acting unreasonably in refusing consent to withdraw in the case of persons who had joined a society hurriedly without much con-
<col>730</col>
sideration and who desired to withdraw for the purpose of joining a society appearing to them to be better suited to their circumstances and requirements. Persons who have become members of an approved society cannot transfer their membership to another society merely by handing their contribution cards upon expiry to the second society. Transfers must in all cases be effected in accordance with the provisions of the Act and of the Regulations, and the original card must be surrendered to the society which issued it. The necessary adjustments in respect to contributions already paid will, of course, be made when the transfer is carried out.</membercontribution></p>

It comes from the Inland Revenue, and as it only reached the promoters at 1.30 p.m. to-day it has been quite impossible for them to give proper notice if the Bill was to be read a third time to-clay. The proper course would be to postpone the Third Reading in order that the usual notice might be given. This, however, is an agreed Amendment between Somerset House and the promoters,

The result of delaying the Bill would be to cause the promoters to lose a valuable twenty-four hours in getting their Amendments through the other House, and I therefore suggest that your Lordships would do well not to insist on the strict rigidity of the rules of the House on this occasion but allow this Amendment to be inserted.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02173"><member>LORD SAYE AND SELE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it will be in your Lordships' recollection that about this time last year a Bill was brought up to this House and eventually became law for the consolidation and amendment of enactments relating to this subject. Scotland, however, was omitted from that Bill owing to the difference of procedure in vogue in that country. The Bill to which I am now asking your Lordships to give a Second Reading is almost a facsimile of the Act for England, and therefore I do not think it will be necessary to occupy much time in describing it. There are, however, one or two points in respect of which this Bill is different from the English Act. Clause 4 not only provides for compensation for damage done by cruelty to an animal, but also provides the machinery for collecting it, and there is further on in the clause a provision that a person shall not be ordered to pay arty sum as compensation under this clause unless he has had reasonable notice of the application to be made by the person aggrieved, including notice of the amount claimed. Clause embraces the whole of the knackers legislation for Scotland, and imposes a penalty of &#x00A3;5 for keeping or using any building or place as a knacker's yard without first taking out a licence for that purpose. Clause 7 gives a wider defence than in the English Act to any person putting down poisoned grain and flesh. In Clause 9 the words "or any snare" are added after "spring trap," and it becomes necessary under this clause for any one who sets a spring trap or any snare to inspect or cause some competent person to inspect the trap or snare at least once every day between sunrise and sunset. Clause 12 differs slightly from the English Act in that it gives further protection to the person against whom proceedings are taken for an act of cruelty, he not being the owner; and it provides that reasonable notice should be given to him. With those few exceptions this Bill is exactly similar to the English Act which your Lordships passed into law last year. It has come from another place without any opposition being taken to it, and I ask your Lordships to give it a Second Reading today.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SANITARY SERVICE OF INDIA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02186"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member> rose to ask the Secretary of State for India whether he can make any statement as to the reform in the Sanitary Service of India which has recently been under consideration; what will be the position of the head of the Sanitary Service under the new conditions; and when he will be in a position to lay Papers on the subject.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02187">The noble Viscount said: My Lords, in asking the Secretary of State for India the Question which stands in my name, I do not propose to occupy your Lordships' time for more than a minute or two. It would be impossible, of course, to speak on the subject of sanitation in India without speaking at considerable length. The subject is a very difficult one, and I am afraid I must confess that I think it is one in which there are considerable arrears of administration to be made up. There is one point on which I specially hope that the Secretary of State may be able to reassure us, and that is with regard to the position of the head of the Sanitary Department in India. As your Lordships are aware, for many years the head of the Army Medical Department was also head of the Sanitary Service in India. The duties now discharged by the head of the Army Medical Corps are of a very wide character, and the immense improvement in the health of the troops is largely due to the measures which have been taken by successive heads of the Army Medical Department; but it has long been realised that it is beyond the power of any human being to discharge all these duties with regard to nearly 200,000 troops and at the same time carry on the whole Sanitary Service throughout India. It is therefore to be hoped that the change which was made by which the head of the Sanitary Department obtained an autonomy of his own may be restored. In recent years the head of the Sanitary Service in India has been placed for administrative duties under the Education Department of all others, and I confess that I think the time has come when that arrangement, which is difficult to understand on the face of it, should be modified, and when a <i>status</i> should be given to the head of the Sanitary Department equivalent to the vast duties which he has to discharge. I do not move for Papers, but I hope that the noble Marquess may be able to tell us that we may hope to see Papers before long on the subject.</p>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0373"/>
<col>737</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02188"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I Will deal somewhat briefly on this occasion with the matter raised by the noble Viscount, but I shall be able, I hope, to satisfy him to some extent by saving that we hope soon to lay tolerably full Papers on this subject, and it is possible that when the noble Viscount has read them he may desire to go somewhat more fully into this interesting and important question of the Sanitary Service of India. Your Lordships will remember that one of the Directors or Inspectors-General whose office it was proposed at one time to abolish was the Inspector-General of Sanitation. The noble Earl who is not now in the House, Lord Curzon, included this officer in the remonstrance which he addressed to us last year in respect to the proposed abolition, and I was able&#x2014;I think it was at the beginning of November last year&#x2014;to reassure the noble Earl and those who agreed with him that we did not propose to carry out the complete amalgamation of sanitation with the Indian Medical Service. I accordingly addressed a Despatch to India not long before I left for that country last autumn, in which I stated that we had decided to retain an independent Sanitary Commissioner, but that his precise relations with the Director-General of the Indian Medical Service would have to be a matter for future consideration.<lb/>
It may be remembered that one of the particular objections taken to the system as it has existed for the last five or six years was that it was found that more and more divorce was beginning to exist between the research side and the clinical side of the Sanitary and Medical Service. Many of the younger medical officers who were employed for research purposes found that they were losing touch with an important part of their duties in having little or no opportunity of watching cases. We have now reached a conclusion which I hope the noble Viscount will consider to be a satisfactory one. The Sanitary Commissioner will be in future relieved from a great body of office work which fell upon him when he was the independent head of a separate Department, and will have, therefore, more time for touring and for inspection in different parts of India. The research and bacteriological side, which was formerly under the Sanitary
<col>738</col>
Commissioner, will now be placed under the direct authority of the Medical Director-General, but on all purely technical sanitary matters the Sanitary Commissioner will be not a subordinate but an independent officer. He will be able to correspond on such subjects directly either with the Provincial Governments or with the Government of India itself; but on matters of administration, questions of appointments and of <i>personnel,</i> he will be in the position, as it were, of chief of the staff to the Director-General of the Medical Service. We believe that this compromise between the complete abolition of the post of Sanitary Commissioner and its retention as a purely independent post is one which will be found best to suit the peculiarities of Indian conditions.<lb/>
It is not possible, in our opinion, altogether to divorce the Medical from the Sanitary Service in India, however possible or desirable it may be to do it elsewhere. The Local Governments have naturally to retain a considerable degree of independence in sanitary matters. In the first place, it is they who find practically all tine money. And then in India there is the fact, which is not found, at any rate to the same extent, elsewhere, that a close association exists between sanitation and politics. As noble Lords who know India well are aware, it is possible by unwise or excessive insistence upon sanitary improvements to run counter to deep-seated beliefs and prejudices of the population in many parts of the country, and on such subjects it may be presumed that the Local Government is the best guide that could be found. Consequently there will remain a great deal of local control, and for many purposes the Inspector-General will therefore not be an officer who gives orders so much as an inspecting and advising official, but his position, as will be clear from what I have already said, will be one of no little importance and dignity. On this subject I shall hope to be able to submit Papers before very long, and also I hope at the same time further Papers dealing with the important question of the local sanitary services.<lb/>
After a great deal of discussion between the Government of India and the Local Government; a scheme has been prepared which was submitted to us at the India Office this year and which has been
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0374"/>
<col>739</col>
approved. It embodies some of the recommendations of the Plague Committee of 1898, and it also deals with some of the recommendations which were made to the noble Viscount opposite when he was Secretary of State by the College of Physicians, if I remember rightly in the year 1905, when he received a deputation on the subject. The object is to strengthen, if possible, the local sanitary staffs. It is proposed to add, among superior officers, nine Deputy Commissioners of Sanitation, and for those posts Indians will be eligible as well as Europeans. It is proposed also to strengthen and enlarge the sanitary staffs of big towns. It is hoped that all the more considerable towns in India in clue course will have a Health Department presided over by a really capable officer, which will place them in these matters on something of the same level as the great urban communities in this country and in other countries in Europe. It will, I am sure, have occurred to the noble Viscount that these things will cost money and that provincial funds are not easily forthcoming even for such excellent objects as these. Therefore it has been arranged that the Government of India will come forward with money to a certain extent <i>pro rata</i> to that which is locally provided, and in that way, as I should hope, no little improvement will be possible.<lb/>
The Papers, I think, will also touch on the malarial conferences which have been held, one in Bombay and also others, for dealing with this terrible scourge which still devastates India to so great an extent, and, as I hope, for continuing to educate the people of India in the methods of combating the pests through which malaria is spread. As noble Lords are aware, there are many facts in Indian conditions which make the destruction of the malarial mosquito a greater difficulty in India than it has been found to be in some other parts of the world, such as, for instance, in the West Indies or in West Africa. On the other hand, there have been some notable successes in Bombay and other places, and it may be trusted in time that steps will be taken all over India to diminish to a great extent, although it may not be possible quite to eradicate, this painful and disabling disease of malaria.</membercontribution></p>

I am not sure that I quite apprehend the full meaning of the noble Viscount's second question. I understood him to be referring to the Royal Commission, the appointment of which has been approved by His Majesty's Government, in relation to the Indian public services. It was on that Commission, I think, that the noble Viscount asked whether a sanitary expert would be placed.</membercontribution></p>

<title>LOCAL AUTONOMY IN INDIA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02193"><member>LORD INCHCAPE</member> rose to ask the Secretary of State for India whether his attention has been called to the alleged differences in statements made by members of His Majesty's Government with regard to the Government of India's Despatch of August 25, 1911, on the subject of the changes announced at the Delhi Durbar.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02194">The noble Lord said: My Lords, it is within the knowledge of your Lordships that some difference of opinion appears to exist as to the views expressed by a member of the Government in another place and by the noble Marquess the Secretary of State for India in this House in regard to the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0375"/>
<col>741</col>
Despatch of the Government of India of August 25 last. The subject has been mentioned, I think, in your Lordships' House. It has also been frequently referred to in the Press not only in this country but in India, and I venture to submit that if the noble Marquess has no objection it might be convenient if he would give your Lordships a statement as to what the views of His Majesty's Government on that Despatch really are.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02195"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I fear that I may appear to be taking up too large a portion of this afternoon's sitting, but nobody, I am sure, will say that too large a portion is being given or could be given to Indian affairs. The particular Question put by my noble friend deals with a subject which has become, unexpectedly to many of us, of no little importance as a subject of discussion both here and very widely in India itself. The whole matter arises out of the third paragraph of the Despatch which the Government of India wrote to me in reference to the Delhi change&#x2014;the Despatch which, with my reply to it, was published as a White Paper on December 12 of last year. About that Despatch and subsequent allusions to it and comments upon the particular paragraph a series of Legends has grown up to which my noble friend has drawn attention in his Question.<lb/>
The legends have taken some such form as this. In the first place, the Government of India is supposed in that third paragraph of its Despatch to have pointed to what is known in India as <i>swaraj,</i> self-government or home rule for India, as the aim and object of the policy of which the change of capital formed a part. The matter was alluded to in this House on February 22, and the legend proceeded that I had endeavoured, apparently without much success, to put a gloss upon the Despatch and altogether to minimise its meaning. The third chapter of the legend was that a few days later the Under-Secretary in my Office, Mr. Montagu, had made a speech at Cambridge in which he threw over my interpretation of the Despatch and reiterated the reading of it which the public had already ascribed to the Government of India's words, and that in speaking again in the House of Commons on April 22 Mr. Montagu repeated the same performance. Then on June 24 Lord Curzon
<col>742</col>
alluded to the matter in this House, and my reply was stated, according to the legend, to have represented a second inadequate attempt to misinterpret the views of the Government of India. The whole of this legend is absolutely baseless. There has never been any difference in meaning or intention between the Government of India and myself, between Mr. Montagu and myself, or between Mr. Montagu and the Government of India. As regards Mr. Montagu, so little did I conceive on reading his excellent speech at Cambridge that he had said or desired to say anything different from what I had said here that. I never even called his attention to the particular passage in his speech, which, of course, I should have done if I had placed any such interpretation upon it.<lb/>
The Government of India are of opinion that this misinterpretation or, as it has undoubtedly been in some cases, misrepresentation of our meaning is due to their use of the word "autonomy" in their Despatch. The actual passage is this&#x2014;
<quote>"The only possible solution of the difficulty would appear to be gradually to give the Provinces a larger measure of self-government, until at last India would consist of a number of administrations, autonomous in all provincial affairs, with the Government of India above them all and possessing power to interfere in cases of misgovernment, but ordinarily restricting their functions to matters of Imperial concern."</quote>
The word "autonomous" possesses four syllables, and may therefore be regarded as comparatively unintelligible. I remember a story of the late Lord Sherbrooke, who at some period, either when he was residing at Oxford or later when he was in Parliament, came into collision with a corporation or other local authority, who addressed him a letter of severe remonstrance. Mr. Lowe, as he then was, as I have heard wrote them a long reply couched entirely in words of one syllable. It is fair, I think, to assume that his main and not uncharacteristic object was to exhibit by that means his opinion of the intellectual standard of his correspondents, but the result probably also was to make his meaning to them entirely clear. It may be that the rise of the word "autonomy" has caused some of this confusion.<lb/>
But the opinion of the Government of India, which I entirely share, is that British policy in India should have three
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0376"/>
<col>743</col>
objects in view. The first object, which we believe will be assisted by our recent policy as explained in this paragraph in the Despatch, is, where possible, to devolve upon local and provincial Governments as many of the functions of government as can safely be entrusted to them. The second object of British rule in India should be, and is, to employ as many Indians in the public service as can reasonably be employed there. The third object is to combine the pursuit of the two first with the maintenance and permanence of British rule in India, because we believe that the maintenance and perpetual continuance of British rule in India is the best way of securing the happiness of the Indian people. There is, of course, some difference of opinion between various persons as to the extent to which provincial devolution or autonomy is possible. Even in the ranks of the Civil Service in India you will find men who by a rough analogy from the United States would be called Republicans, and other men who would be called Democrats&#x2014;men, that is to say, who in the one instance believe in the predominance of the Central Government, and who in the other case believe in the importance of government by local divisions&#x2014;and there is room, of course, for doubt or difference of opinion as to what may be meant by the words "local autonomy." On the last occasion when we were mentioning this matter I pointed out that Lord Curzon had spoken of provincial autonomy in matters of finance. We may be quite sure that he did not mean, when holding out the prospect of provincial autonomy, that the Provinces ought to be allowed to raise as much revenue as they pleased in any way they pleased and to spend it as they pleased. What the then Viceroy obviously meant was that a larger share of public expenditure should be left to local collection and to local expenditure on a defined principle; and therefore when we talk in this connection again of provincial autonomy it is reasonable to suppose that certain limits, which need not be narrow or tightly drawn, are intended to exist as between the Provinces and the Central Government.<lb/>
Then there has been, I think, a second misunderstanding, this time founded on a monosyllable&#x2014;that is, in the use of the word "goal." This is confusing the lines on which the Government of India desires to work&#x2014;that is to say, the road along which
<col>744</col>
the Government of India desires to travel, with a supposed or intended termination of that road at which an entirely new form of Government would be found to exist&#x2014;for there is, I venture to lay down clearly, no final and permanent condition which the Government of India ought to have in view. It cannot have in view what some Indians describe as <i>swaraj,</i> and therefore although it desires to advance along the road of including in the government of India as many of the native inhabitants of India as is possible it does not speak, and I do not believe it will ever speak, of a final goal which it desires to reach. I do not know whether any of your Lordships have ever read the observations of a man who was probably the most thoughtful and the best informed of all the unofficial writers about India in the last half century&#x2014;I mean the late Mr. Meredith Townshend. He took a pessimistic view of this very question which we are discussing to-day. He founded himself on a belief that England was losing the power of governing other races. He believed that Englishmen were beginning to doubt whether they had a moral right to rule anybody, rather than thinking of ruling justly. He believed that in the ultimate future all the offices of India would be handed over to Indians, with the final result, in his words, that&#x2014;
<quote>"India will re-emerge as she was, shortly to be reduced to the condition in which we found her."</quote>
He believed that the distinct genius of the two Continents, Europe and Asia, forbade any real union between them, and he held that the uneffaceable difference in the <i>morale</i> of Asia from that of Europe made the genuine assimilation of Western ideas by Asia altogether impossible. We need not attempt to dive so deep into the future, and even if we do we need not adopt so pessimistic a form of prophecy as that in which Mr. Meredith Townshend indulged.<lb/>
It has to be borne in mind, as I mentioned the last time I touched on this subject, that the dream which some Indians love to hold&#x2014;and, for all I know, some Englishmen cherish it too&#x2014;is a dream of a form of complete self-government for India within the British Empire. I repeat categorically what I said last time, that there is nothing whatever in the teachings of history so far as I know them, or in the present conditions of the world so far as I
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0377"/>
<col>745</col>
understand them, which makes the realisation of such a dream even remotely probable. We have tried the experiment of a worldwide Empire of members of our own race. All the chapters in that experiment have not been felicitous. One broke down in 1776, when the American Colonies declared for independence. Since then we have learned some wisdom. We have succeeded in weaving into the Empire the French of Canada and the Dutch of South Africa. Now in an Empire which includes both those different European races we are trying to face and to solve the tremendous problems of general imperial defence and of giving to the component parts of the Empire some share in the shaping of Imperial policy. Can anybody conceive any similar solution of imperial problems for hundreds of millions of men of different races and all of absolutely different races from our own?<lb/>
Is it conceivable that at any time an Indian Empire could exist on the lines, say, of Australia or of New Zealand, with no British officials, no British troops, no tie of creed or of blood which takes the place of material bonds? I am far from saying that the idea of such an Indian Dominion, cherished by many high-minded men whom I respect, is an ignoble idea, or that those who hold it ought to be described as in any way disloyal. There are some such who believe that it is possible to secure in India the continual presence, the continual influence, and the continual service of men of British blood with no prospect of any violent rupture between the two races and the different countries. To me that is a world as remote as any Atlantis or Erewhon that ever was thought of by the ingenious brain of an imaginative writer. I believe that on the lines which I laid down as being those on which the Government of India ought to work and desires to work there is ample scope both for service and for distinction for men of Indian birth and of the different races. I see wide fields, fields which will grow wider still, for the full play and exercise of the remarkable and special qualities of Indian intellect. It is true I can imagine that there are gifted and most estimable men who may be loth to abandon the idea that either they or somebody like them in future years may be Prime Minister of an Indian Dominion or Commander-in-Chief of an Indian Army. But I venture to think that it is only those who think
<col>746</col>
less of service and more of distinction who would lose heart if they braced themselves altogether to set aside this vision and were willing to settle down to more co-operation and closer co-operation with this Western race, to which they can teach much and from which they can learn much&#x2014;cooperation for time moral and material bettering of the country to which they are so deeply attached and of which we are so proud to be the governors.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02196"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I doubt whether when we came down to the House this afternoon any of us anticipated that we should have had the pleasure of listening to so important a deliverance as that which has just been uttered by the noble Marquess. It was a deliverance which dealt at some length, not only with the principles upon which the Government of India should be administered, but the principles upon which the affairs of the whole British Empire might be conducted in the future. I hope the noble Marquess will not think me a little uncharitable if I suggest that his speech showed a slight undercurrent of uneasiness as to the effect produced upon the public mind both in India and in this country, in the first place by the memorable paragraph in the Government of India's Despatch which he quoted, and next by the interpretation placed upon it by the noble Marquess's Under-Secretary.<lb/>
Let me once again remind your Lordships of the terms in which the Despatch was couched. It was therein explained that the ultimate solution to which His Majesty's Government looked forward was to be one under which India would&#x2014;
<quote>"consist of a number of administrations, autonomous in all provincial affairs, with the Government of India above them all and possessing power to interfere in cases of misgovernment, but ordinarily restricting their functions to matters of Imperial concern."</quote>
I venture to suggest to your Lordships that that paragraph describes a condition of things wholly different from and inconsistent with the Government of India as we know it at present and as we are likely to know it for a long time to come. But the noble Marquess explained that the Despatch was merely intended to indicate what he called the "trend and tendency" of things in India. He evidently preferred that the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0378"/>
<col>747</col>
Despatch should be taken as pointing to a somewhat remote future. But that was not the language of Mr. Montagu. Mr. Montagu spoke of the "goal towards which His Majesty's Government proposed to travel," and then he used these remarkable words&#x2014;
<quote>"At last, and not too soon, a Viceroy has had the courage to state the trend of British policy in India and the lines on which we propose to advance."</quote>
It was clearly suggested by Mr. Montagu that this was a new departure, something which had not yet been dreamed of by any Government either in India or in this country. In another speech he said the Government were there&#x2014;
<quote>"to develop India on a plan which had been thought out by those who had been advising the Secretary of State."</quote>
Those are words which did not point merely to the trend of the policy observed towards India at the present time. They pointed to some new conception of Government which had been elaborated by the present Government of India and by His Majesty's present advisers. The noble Marquess will not have forgotten the manner in which these announcements were received in India. My noble friend Lord Curzon, when he last dealt with the subject in this House, quoted the comments of the Indian Press. The Indian Press unquestionably took this announcement as indicating a new departure, not a mere following of a gradual path of development, but something new which had not yet been dreamed of and which was being promulgated to the people of India in connection with His Majesty's visit to that country. The noble Marquess has endeavoured to reconcile all these inconsistent declarations, and he gave us at the beginning of his speech the broad outline of the policy which in his opinion should be followed in dealing with the affairs of India. I am bound to say that so far as I was able to follow the noble Marquess's statement I heard nothing in it which at all shocks my feelings or indicates that there is in contemplation any very abrupt departure from the policy to which we, have been used in the past.<lb/>
I gathered&#x2014;the noble Marquess will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;that these were the three cardinal points of the policy which he and his colleagues desire to advocate in dealing with the Indian Empire.
<col>748</col>
He suggests that we should devolve on the Local Governments as many functions as can be safely entrusted to them. I think that has been very much the policy of the Government of India in the past. The whole question, of course, is what functions can you safely devolve on the Local Governments, and as to that there may, of course, be differences of opinion. The noble Marquess's second point was that we should employ as many natives as could be reasonably employed in the public services. The noble Marquess knows what an immense number of natives are already employed, some of them in very responsible positions, in the public services in India, and what an infinitesimally small minority of public servants in India are of British origin. It has always been the desire of successive Governments to recognise merit amongst Indian servants of the Crown and to advance them so far as that could be safely done consistently with the public interest.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02197"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I have no reason to suppose that the noble Marquess does not realise that I meant that in my opinion both those processes might continue to increase to a considerable extent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02198"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Certainly, we all of us realise that there must be a gradual broadening of these concessions. The noble Marquess's third point was that we should see to the permanent maintenance of British rule in India. That, I take it, is a proposition which no one will controvert, and which no Government of India in the past has ever allowed to be called in question. All those seem to me, if I may say so, sound and salutary principles, and really everything must depend upon the tact and the patience, and, above all, the caution, with which these principles are applied. I do not think I am wrong in gathering that, so far in, the noble Marquess is concerned, those principles will be applied with proper caution. I am glad that he has made his statement to the House, because I think some statement was necessary in order to dissipate the apprehensions and misgivings which, beyond all question, were created both by the terms of the Despatch and by some of the official comments that were made upon it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02199"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are, I think, in the presence of a very great problem and very deep specula-
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0379"/>
<col>749</col>
tions as to the future, and I think it is necessary to be extremely cautious in entering into any part of the discussion which has been raised by the Question addressed to the noble Marquess by my noble friend below the Gangway (Lord Inchcape). I would fain leave it alone, but I confess I am under the impression that one word at least should be added&#x2014;a word of deprecation almost of the discussion itself. An attempt has been made to solve a great mystery. That mystery had better be left to solve itself, to work itself out in a fashion as to which I venture to think no member of your Lordships' House and no one outside, however deeply engaged in the affairs of Government, however profoundly attentive to the issues of the present time and the movement of events here and elsewhere, is competent to pronounce a final judgment.<lb/>
This discussion has been raised because of three apparently different expressions of opinion on the part of the Government in India and the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary at home. The noble Marquess the Secretary of State now tells us that the Government in India have never differed from himself, that he has never differed from the Under-Secretary, and that the Under-Secretary has never differed from the Government in India. Then he proceeded to describe what was the one thing on which they are agreed. I confess that the expressions of the three authorities do show such a dissimilarity that it, is very difficult to make out absolute agreement at the bottom; and the attempt to describe what is the nature of their agreement and what is the future on which the efforts of those who direct the government of India are bent does not impress upon me at all events a feeling that it can be accepted as final or exhaustive. It has been supposed apparently that the local autonomy which it was suggested in the famous Despatch might be given to Provincial Governments meant entire self-government by something like representative bodies brought into existence as representing the different inhabitants of the particular Province. The phrase does not necessarily mean that. It only necessarily means a restricted independence of the Provincial Government in ordinary matters of local concern.<lb/>
But the language of the Under-Secretary did describe a state of things in which a
<col>750</col>
greater measure of independence might be reached, and the Secretary of State proceeded here to deprecate the suggestion that there could ever be complete independence of British control in India. The noble Marquess affirmed, not only that that could not be foreseen or could not be aimed at, but that the perpetual maintenance of British control is the thing to which all must look forward. I do not see myself the end of that control; I do net see what would take its place; but I venture to deprecate the suggestion that it could not come to an end and that some other order might not arise. May we not be content with the further carrying on of the process of development of which Lord Lansdowne, has spoken, the further enlistment of natives in the government of the country, and the further advance of authority within India itself without speculating on the complete and entire withdrawal of British government, still less British influence, from India? "One step is enough for me" was the utterance of a great and wise man, and it seems to me that in this matter that utterance might be appropriated by tire Government. I do not think I ant violating any confidence when I recall that only the year before last a very distinguished Indian servant, one universally honoured but who has passed away, speaking on the subject of the future said to me&#x2014;
<quote>"It is not impossible that the twentieth century may see the complete withdrawal of Europe from Asia";</quote>
and in view of what has happened, in view of the extraordinary revivification of Japan and in view of what is going on in China and what may happen there, it is surely unwise to put the limit of impossibility on the development that may occur in India.<lb/>
It is very difficult to conceive added to the vision of the union of the self-governing Dominions and the home country the vision of a self-governed India participating in that Imperial union. But with respect to all this I am only impressing on your Lordships the suggestion that, however comfortable it may be to ourselves to attempt to dismiss these speculations, we cannot get rid of them. They will be worked out in some fashion probably independently; and it is enough for the moment, at least, if we persevere with what has been the wise policy for some time past
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0380"/>
<col>751</col>
&#x2014;a policy which received considerably freer development under Lord Morley as Secretary of State, and which apparently is entering upon a new stage and another length of road under the operation of the Despatch which accompanied the ceremonial at Delhi and the changes then brought about. I repeat that it is unwise to predict what may or may not be the final result. Let Indian dreamers dream, if they will, a dream which it appears to me can do us no harm. Let us persevere, as is our duty, in doing all we can for the better government of India and making British influence as authoritative, as influential, as it can possibly be through its own merits, and then we may leave the future, whether it be dim or distant or whether it be near, where it is&#x2014;on the knees of the gods, beyond our power to do anything more than slightly to influence its course.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02200"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: May I say one word in explanation, as I think it is possible that my noble friend behind me (Lord Courtney) may have misunderstood my object in saying what I did. It was no desire of mine and no part of my intention to indulge in positive prophecy about the ultimate future of India. It was, indeed, less my object to indicate what our policy is than what it is not. My noble friend may not be aware to what an extent it has been assumed that the present Administration in India is actively pursuing a policy which is intended to end in self-government; and though I quarrel with no man, Indian or other, for the dreams in which he may indulge, I strongly object if my friends and I are stated as sharing those dreams when we do not share them. It is, of course, quite true, as my noble friend has said, that the future remains on the knees of the gods, and it is unwise to attempt to look too far forward. The writer whom I have already quoted, Mr. Meredith Townshend, said somewhere that Asia, which survived the Greek and the Roman, would also survive the Teuton and the Slay. I have no desire, I can assure my noble friend, to engage in any kind of prophecy of the ultimate future; but I did think it desirable, in replying to my noble friend who raised this question, to state clearly what is not our view, in order that our aims and intentions in making, as I hope we shall continue to make, advances in the direction with which my noble friend has sympathised may not be misunderstood.</membercontribution></p>

The provisions which were inserted in the Bill in the House of Commons have, I think, in every way satisfied those who were anxious in regard to this matter. I may tell the noble Earl that we are not allowed under the Bill to go beyond a certain line which is even not so far forward as a continuation of the line of Whitehall Court. Therefore there will always be in front of the new buildings room for a garden quite as large as that which is now there, and to which the noble Earl referred in terms of appreciation with which I should like to associate myself.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02210"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: In answer to the noble Viscount I have to state that it is a fact that about 190 rifles were lent by the War Office to the Admiralty for use at Bisley, but these rifles were not of the recently-converted type but were the long charger loading type such as are at present in use by the Territorial Force. According to the information supplied by the Admiralty, no breeches of these rifles were "blown out"; but&#x2014;and this is probably the foundation for the noble Viscount's Question&#x2014;four bolt heads broke off on extraction after the rifles had been fired. The ammunition which was used was the ordinary Mark VI., which, of course, is the only ammunition that could be used in these
<col>754</col>
particular rifles owing to the sighting, and there is no reason to suppose that the breaking of the bolt heads was in any way connected with the ammunition which was used. The rifles will, I may say, be thoroughly examined before they are again issued for use.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02244" align="center"><i>Right of Trustees Holding Leasehold Interest in Place of Worship to Acquire Freehold.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02245"><b>1.</b>&#x2014;(1) Where premises held under a lease to which this Act applies are held upon trust to be used for the purposes of a place of worship, whether in conjunction with other purposes or not, and the premises are being used in accordance with the terms of the trust, the trustees, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary (not being an agreement against the enlargement of the leasehold interest into a freehold contained in a lease granted or made before the passing of this Act), shall have the right as incident to their leasehold interest to enlarge that interest into a fee simple, and for that purpose to acquire the freehold and all intermediate reversions:</p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02247">(2) The leases to which this Act applies are leases (including underleases and agreements for leases or underleases), whether granted or made before or after the passing of this Act, for lives or a life or for a term of years where the term as originally created was a term of not less than twenty-one years, whether determinable on a life or lives or not.</p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02248"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I propose, in paragraph (<i>b</i>) of Clause 1, to strike out the words "or where the trusts upon which the premises are held include the use of the premises (otherwise than by a lessee or assignee from the trustees) for the purposes of any trade or business or for any purposes of a political character." These words were not originally in the Bill but were inserted by the noble Earl, Lord Beauchamp, to meet a complaint made by my noble friend Lord Newton. Personally I did not quite agree to the words. But since then the noble Earl has proposed in Clause 4 to meet the grievance in a way which seems to me on the whole satisfactory. In those circumstances the words which I propose to strike out have nothing to do with the purpose of the Bill, and by remaining in the clause they seem to me rather to create confusion than otherwise. For that reason I propose to omit them.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02252"><member>LORD RITCHIE OF DUNDEE</member><membercontribution>: I move to insert the new paragraph standing in my name on the Paper. The noble Earl will recollect that when the Bill was in Committee I moved an Amendment, on behalf of the Port of London Authority, with the object of exempting that authority and other public bodies from the operation of the Bill, and though the noble Earl agreed that I had made out a good ease on behalf of the Port Authority he considered the scope of my Amendment too wide. I understand that as the paragraph is now worded the noble Earl's objection is removed. As I explained in Committee, the Port Authority have a site on their property which has been let by them at a purely nominal rent as a place of worship in the expectation that it would revert to them when it was required for the development of the property. It would be obviously unfair that those to whom the site is let should have the right of acquiring it on the favourable terms provided in this Bill, and that the Port of London

Authority should be left at some future date when it was necessary to develop the property to reacquire the land on the terms of the Lands Clauses Act. I therefore hope your Lordships will agree to the insertion of this Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02256">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02257"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I propose, after Clause 3, to insert the following new clause, "It is hereby declared that the acquisition of an estate in fee simple under this Act is not an occasion for the assessment or charge of Increment Value Duty and that Reversion Duty is not assessable or chargeable on any such acquisition." The latter part of this Amendment was proposed in other words in Committee by Lord Clinton, who is not able to be in his place to-day, and I have undertaken to put it forward on his behalf, with the addition that I have extended it to Increment Value Duty as well. The reason is very simple. It is quite possible, if the site of a chapel let on lease is enfranchised, that the lease may be said to be terminated, and then under the new terms the lessor would be liable for Reversion Duty. It has also occurred to me that, supposing it were taken to be a sale, in the same way be might be liable to Increment Duty under the sale clause. I know it has been said that under Section 37 of the Finance Act, 1910, Reversion Duty would not be chargeable because a body of trustees holding for religious purposes would be held to be a governing body constituted for charitable purposes while the land was occupied by such a body for the purposes of that body. It is a legal point and I am not going to undertake to say that it is not so, but it is not very clear, and for
<col>760</col>
the purpose of showing that Reversion Duty is not to apply in this case it would be as well to insert this declaratory Amendment. In any case Section 37 of the Finance Act of 1910 does not apply to Increment Duty. Therefore I think it would be advisable to insert the words which I propose in order to show that it was not intended that this Bill should operate with regard to these transactions. The noble Earl in charge of the Bill said the other day that the Government did not intend to claim Reversion Duty in these cases. I have no doubt that may be so. But the question is, What is done in these cases? Lately the Government have been making very extravagant claims for Reversion Duty and Increment Duty, and only on Saturday last they made a claim for Increment Duty, the result of which was that not only were they declared to be wrong, but they had to pay the costs. It seems to me very hard that an individual in the cases under this Bill should be called upon even to defend his rights in the matter and fight any attempt to impose a charge of this sort. If your Lordships consent to insert the clause which I now move, such an attempt would, of course, be absolutely impossible.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02261"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry I do not see my way to accept this Amendment. The proposed new clause divides itself into two parts&#x2014;one part deals with Increment Value Duty and the other with Reversion Duty. The question of Reversion Duty was referred to during the Committee stage by Lord Clinton. I told him then that we were quite convinced that under Section 37 of the Finance Act, 1910, the lessor was exempt from paying Reversion Duty under this Bill, and since that time I am glad to think that I have been able to persuade the noble Lord that that is so. Then comes the question of Increment Duty, which is on a very different footing. There I do not believe the land would be exempt, and His Majesty's Government do not quite see why it should be. It would be their intention that in such circumstances the land should pay.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02262"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: It would be the lessor who would pay, would it not?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02263"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: It would be the vendor, that is to say the owner, who would have to pay the Increment Duty. It is not the intention of His Majesty's Government that the vendor should not pay. If there is an increase in the value of the land then Increment Duty becomes payable. Why not? If the land has gone up so immensely in value, then, under the whole principles under which the new taxation upon land as introduced in the Budget was approved of in another place, it is only right and proper that Increment Duty should be paid. In any ease, I suggest to your Lordships that this Amendment is one of those which trench upon debatable ground in so far as the privilege of the other House is concerned, and for that reason also I hope your Lordships will not agree to this Amendment. It is clear that the vendor would have to pay and under the Finance Act he ought to pay.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02264"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: When the noble Earl says that the vendor ought to pay I do not follow him, because what advantage will the vendor have got? The site will have been enfranchised and the per3ons who will have benefited will be the trustees of the chapel. On the other hand the vendor, if Increment Duty is payable, will, as I understand, have to pay it. Why should he have to pay it? He gets nothing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02265"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am anxious that there should be no misunderstanding as to this somewhat technical point. May I put to the noble Earl how I understand it? Let us take the case of a chapel leased to trustees at the nominal rent, say, of a shilling a year. The site is enfranchised under this Bill. Thereupon, as I understand it, no question arises with regard to Reversion Duty. That I understand the noble Earl is quite satisfied upon, and he is able to give the House an explicit assurance on the point. Then we come to Increment Duty. Am I right in thinking that what would happen in that case would be that the owner who had leased the site, in the case supposed, for a shilling a year would find himself, after enfranchisement, able to turn it to the best advantage and to obtain an increase of income in respect of it? If that is so, I think there is something to be said for the view of the noble Earl in charge of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<col>762</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02266"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: Increment Duty only becomes payable upon the difference when the land is more valuable. What the vendor would have to pay upon, therefore, would be the increase in the amount of money he got. If the vendor does not get the money he cannot pay Increment Duty.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02269">Clause 4:</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02270" align="center"><i>Power to Require Trustees to Sell in Certain Cases.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02271"><b>4.</b>&#x2014;(1) If any person who appears to the Judge of the County Court to be interested proves to the satisfaction of the Judge that any premises the estate in fee simple in which has been acquired by the trustees under this Act, or any part thereof, are let or are habitually used for any purpose other than that of a place of worship or purposes connected therewith, the Judge shall, unless it appears to him that such use was due to inadvertence and will be discontinued, order that the premises, or such part thereof, be sold.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02272">(2) For the purposes of this section premises shall not be deemed to be habitually used for any purpose other than that of a place of worship or purposes connected therewith by reason only of their being used for such other purpose not more than twice in any year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02273"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I move to omit from subsection (1) the words "any purpose other than that of a place of worship or purposes connected therewith" and to insert "purposes of any trade or business or for any purposes of a political character." This Amendment will not come as any surprise to those of your Lordships who followed the discussion on this clause in Committee. I quite admit that the position is a difficult one. We none of us wish them chapels in future to be used for political purposes or for trade purposes. We are quite agreed upon that. In the clause as it stands at present your Lordships will see that the building is forbidden to be used for "any purpose other than that of a place of worship or purposes connected therewith." A number of other objects readily occur to one's mind for which it is very desirable that these chapels should be used if the trustees so desire. Take, for instance, the campaign against tuberculosis, an instance to which I referred on the last occasion. Take, again, meetings of friendly societies; it is desirable that friendly societies should not meet in public-houses. But the words of the Bill as they stand at present would prevent the use of these chapels either for
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0386"/>
<col>763</col>
friendly society purposes, or for such purposes as the campaign against tuberculosis. I might mention other purposes for which these buildings might be used such as parish council meetings, health and housing crusades, agricultural and horticultural lectures, and so on; but under the clause as it stands any purpose other than that of a place of worship or purposes connected therewith is forbidden. It is desirable that we should rid our minds of what, perhaps, is in the minds of some noble Lords. I refer to the fact that those who use these chapels for religious purposes on Sundays do not attach quite the same sacred character to them as we in the Church of England do to our churches. The idea of using our churches for other purposes than as places of worship is repugnant to us, but that is not so in the ease of the chapels which will be enfranchised under this Bill. In these circumstances I venture to hope that your Lordships will agree to this Amendment, which allows full latitude to the trustees and only prevents the buildings being used for purposes of trade and political meetings.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02275"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: In spite of what the noble Earl has said, I cannot help expressing the hope that this Amendment will not be accepted. After all, this Bill is brought in for a particular purpose&#x2014;namely, because it is supposed to be a good thing to enfranchise certain religious edifices&#x2014;and I cannot see why the scope of the Bill should be enlarged. The words in the Bill "place of worship or purposes connected therewith" ought to be wide enough for anybody. I take it that those words would cover, for instance, an institution like a gymnasium or anything of that sort. What the noble Earl is proposing, in effect, is that enfranchisement should be compulsory provided no trade whatever is carried on in the building and it is not used for political purposes. I submit that that is going beyond the spirit of the Bill, and that the words in the clause are amply sufficient to cover the purposes indicated. For that reason, if I succeed in finding a teller, I shall certainly vote against the noble Earl's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<col>764</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02276"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I must say, having spoken the other day with regard to this Amendment, that I think the words which the noble Earl inserted in Committee are amply sufficient and very good words indeed. He provides that the premises are to be sold at the discretion of a Judge if they are "let or habitually used for any purpose other than that of a place of worship or purposes connected therewith." That is the whole extent of the Bill as stated in Clause 1. It is quite true that by inserting the words which the noble Earl has moved to-day these premises may be used for tuberculosis meetings and so on, but they might also be used for the purposes of a club or anything of that kind. I greatly prefer the words at present in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02277"><member>THE EARL OF MEATH</member><membercontribution>: Would the words as they stand in the clause prevent Happy Evening Associations meeting in chapels, because we know that they have sometimes a tendency to be very political?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02278"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I expressed the other evening, and I still retain, a preference for the very much simpler formula which is now in the clause and which owes its existence to the Motion of the noble Earl in charge of the Bill. After all, this is a Bill intended to facilitate the enfranchisement of places of worship. That is admirably expressed in the clause as it now stands. I see the point which Lord Beauchamp has in his mind, but what I am afraid is that if we extend the scope of the clause in this manner we shall find that we are passing a measure, not for the purpose of enfranchising places of worship, but for the purpose of enabling people to enfranchise premises which are partly used as places of worship and partly for wholly different purposes. My noble friend cited one of them a moment ago. I venture to think that the safer course is to adhere to the clause as it is in the Bill at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02279"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I shall not, of course, put the House to the trouble of a Division, but I am afraid I must warn noble Lords opposite, on behalf of my friends in another place, that the Bill in its present shape is not likely to be acceptable to them, and that it is not unlikely that the Bill will be returned to this House with the wording changed.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02281"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Is the noble Earl satisfied that subsection (2) of Clause 4 is essential to the purpose of the Bill? The first subsection says that if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Judge that the premises are "let or habitually used for any purpose other than that of a place of worship or purposes connected therewith" there is power to require the trustees to sell. Cannot we safely leave it to the Judge to decide whether the premises are habitually so used or not? Subsection (2) attempts to define what is "habitual use." Personally I would very much prefer to trust to the common-sense of the Court than to any definition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02282"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: This is one of those legal matters on which I can only speak with difficulty. I am advised that the phrase "habitually used" is one which is difficult for Judges to interpret, and it was thought that it might be of some assistance to them if we defined what the phrase really means. I have no great feeling one way or the other, but acting under the advice which has been given to me I am inclined to ask that the subsection should be allowed to stand, at any rate for the present.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02293"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I should like to ask the noble Lord in charge of this Bill what the object is of the particular words in this clause which oblige the individual responsible for the setting of a trap to have it inspected "between sunrise and sunset." I am not an advocate for spring traps. I would like to see them abolished altogether if it were possible, but I know it is not possible. I cordially agree that they ought to be inspected regularly, and where they are used in any place with which I have to deal they are inspected regularly. But why is it to be done "between sunrise and sunset"? So far as Scotland is concerned, I believe that to be an idiotic provision. In Scotland the winter days are very short. The sun does not rise till eight o'clock in the morning, and it sets between three and four o'clock in the afternoon. The regular practice on well-ordered estates where traps are set for rabbits is to inspect them twice in the twenty-four hours&#x2014;between sunset and sunrise. The humane thing is to inspect traps at night and early in the morning before sunrise. But what you are going to do by this Bill is to oblige the unfortunate animal which is caught in the trap to stay there for a longer period alive than it would otherwise do. Of all the idiotic provisions I have ever seen, I think this is one of the worst.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02294"><member>LORD SAYE AND SELE</member><membercontribution>: In the English Act of last year the wording was that the traps should be inspected "at reasonable intervals of time and at least once every day between sunrise and sunset." The words "at reasonable intervals of time" were taken out of this Bill by the Committee for Scottish Bills in another place. So far as I know they gave no reason for striking those words out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02295"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble Lord ought to be able to give a reason. He is responsible for the Bill here.

I came to the House intending to give notice to move in Committee to omit the words "between sunrise and sunset," but I was unable to give notice because the Committee stage was down for to-day. If the noble Lord will now accept an Amendment to leave out these words I will move it. Certainly if the provision remains as it stands you will do serious injury to the ordinary practice. The traps for which
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0388"/>

my servants are responsible are inspected twice a day, but on both occasions, as I have said, between sunset and sunrise. If this Bill passes as it stands that practice will have to be stopped, because it will not be in accordance with the law. Yet I am doing at the present moment a much more humane thing in the interests of the unfortunate animals which are caught in these traps than would be the case if this Bill passed in its present form.

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02303"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> rose to ask whether Mr. Thomas Wilson, lately appointed a Sub-Commissioner by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland, was a Liberal election agent for Inverness-shire up to his previous appointment as factor and manager for the Congested Districts Board; and also, why he has been treated exceptionally in regard to salary, which commences at &#x00A3;700 per annum, the maximum salary of the scale.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02304">The noble Earl said: My Lords, a Return was recently laid on the Table which gives the appointments made by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland since they entered upon their office on April 1 last, and I wish to call your Lordships' attention to the appointment of Mr. Thomas Wilson as a Sub-Commissioner for Small Holdings. The salary of Sub-Commissioners is on a scale from &#x00A3;550 to &#x00A3;700 per annum, but Mr. Wilson is entered on the scale with the maximum salary of &#x00A3;700. I would remind your
<col>768</col>
Lordships that the duties which Sub-Commissioners have to discharge are very delicate duties indeed. The Sub-Commissioners have the right of putting forward schemes for taking land compulsorily, for proposing what land is to be taken, and so on, and to submit those schemes to the Commissioners. These Sub-Commissioners are appointed by the Board of Agriculture, and will, I presume, have to report to them and advise them on all dealings with land, and they will have to negotiate with owners and occupiers of land and have other delicate duties of that kind to perform.</p>

I believe I am right in saying that within a short period he was an active political agent in Inverness-shire. Indeed, at the last General Election, if my memory serves me rightly, he travelled about Scotland making speeches on the land question and on other questions of that kind. He is well known and has been so for years as a person who takes a very strong part on the Liberal, or I should say the Radical, side of the question. If your Lordships look at the last column of the Return you will see that Mr. Wilson is represented as having been formerly employed in an established capacity as factor and manager under the Congested Districts Board at a salary of &#x00A3;300 a year. That appointment must have been of very short duration. The dates are not given, but I know it must have been for a very short time. When the Congested Districts Board left office and the new Board of Agriculture came in their place Mr. Wilson was appointed as an established officer and entered upon the appointment at &#x00A3;700 a year, the maximum salary of the scale. Why he has thus been treated exceptionally I know not. If your Lordships will look at the Return you will see that the other Sub-Commissioner, a Mr. Angus Macintosh, is employed on the same scale of salary and he starts at &#x00A3;550. What is the reason for the difference made between these two men? Mr. Angus Macintosh was senior to Mr. Wilson in established employment under the Board. It seems to me that these are facts which require explanation, and therefore I beg to ask the Question standing in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02306"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WILLINGDON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know anything personally about
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0389"/>
<col>769</col>
the individual to whom the noble Earl makes reference, but I propose to answer the two specific points that he raises in his Question. The noble Earl asks, first of all, whether Mr. Thomas Wilson was a Liberal election agent for Inverness-shire up to his previous appointment as factor and manager for the Congested Districts Board. That is perfectly true. Up to his appointment in that capacity he was a Liberal agent and I am given to understand a very efficient and able Liberal agent, but I ant sure the noble Earl will not suggest that the fact of his having been a political agent, whether Liberal or Conservative, would militate against his being efficient in any other service if he was an able and industrious man.<lb/>
In the second part of his Question the noble Earl asks why Mr. Wilson has been treated exceptionally in regard to salary. The reason I am given to understand is this. It is obvious that when a Department is in its inception it is important to get the best men at the heads of the various parts of the Department. It was considered very desirable to get Mr. Thomas Wilson to be the head of this particular branch of his Department because he had an intimate knowledge of the particular locality for which he was appointed. He represented that he was already making an income of between &#x00A3;700 and &#x00A3;800 a year and that he could not give this up for a reduced salary, and it was considered so advisable to appoint him&#x2014;this is what I am given to understand&#x2014;and he was considered such an efficient man that he was appointed at the maximum salary. Added to this he is a man of fifty-six years of age, and, of course, that made a considerable difference as he would not have many years to run under the particular Department. Those, I am given to understand, are the reasons for the appointment of. Mr. Wilson. He is a most efficient and able man, and will, I think, perform his duties thoroughly satisfactorily.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02307"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I do not suppose it is fair for me to cross-examine the noble Lord about Mr. Wilson. It was after the time when I was responsible for matters at the Scottish Office that Mr. Wilson was appointed factor and manager for the Congested Districts Board; at that time he had not even been made Liberal agent for Inverness-shire. But my knowledge of Mr. Wilson's antecedents
<col>770</col>
goes back a number of years, and while he may have been efficient as factor and manager for the Congested Districts Board I should he rather surprised to find that he had in any way distinguished himself for judicial administration, which I understand is part of the work of a Sub-Commissioner. As factor and manager for the Congested Districts Board he was probably under the control of people who would bring to bear a judicial mind upon the transactions, but if the noble Lord cares to inquire as to what Mr. Wilson's antecedents were in earlier years he will hardly think that he is likely to be a very judicial person when questions arise between landlord and tenant.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02308"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I think we are excusable if we keep a somewhat vigilant eye upon appointments of this kind. The question is not really a small one. It is on record that the present Administration since they came into power had, up to July of last year, made no fewer than 4,200 appointments in the Public Service&#x2014;appointments necessitated by the legislation which has taken place since 1906. It follows that the average pace at which these appointments are made is something in the neighbourhood of 1,000 a year. Therefore the matter is, as I said just now, not one of small importance. It is also on record&#x2014;all these things are disclosed in a Parliamentary Return&#x2014;that two-thirds of these appointments have been filled without any examination.<lb/>
Two results must inevitably follow from this practice. I do not blame His Majesty's Government so much with regard to them, because I believe they are inevitable results. The first result is that you are bound to appoint a great number of persons of very mediocre attainments, and for this excellent reason&#x2014;first, that the number of first-rate men available is not sufficient, and, in the second place, that the emoluments which you offer are not sufficient to attract first-rate men to the Service. The second result which I believe to be inevitable is that in selecting these persons the Government of the day turn principally to their own friends. I do not make any charge that persons unfit are deliberately selected for these appointments, but it is obvious that the heads of Departments come more into contact with people of their own way of thinking, and therefore the tendency does arise to appoint partisans of your own, and, in making these selec-
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0390"/>
<col>771</col>
tions, to reward political services by means of these appointments. The way in which it is usually put is that the Government desire to put into these places persons who are sympathetic with the legislation to which effect has to be given.<lb/>
Now look at the case of this Mr. Wilson, What do we know about him? He has been a Radical political agent, and the noble Lord who replied for the Scottish Office told us that in that capacity he was efficient and able. I dare say he was and that not a word is to be said against his efficiency or his ability in that post; but, as Lord Balfour truly said a moment ago, you do not look to that kind of man, however efficient and able he is, for those judicial qualities which are indispensable in the case of an appointment of this kind. We all know that under the Act of fist year these Commissioners and Sub-Commissioners have to decide most difficult questions involving extensive private rights, and it is most important that their antecedents should be of a kind which would inspire the parties who are affected by their decisions with confidence in the judicial qualities of the officials themselves. I can scarcely believe that it was impossible to find for this appointment no one except a gentleman with such a tempestuous record as that which Mr. Wilson appears to enjoy. I am glad my noble friend has drawn attention to this matter, and I do earnestly trust that this short conversation may have the effect of inducing His Majesty's Government to press upon the Departments subordinate to them the necessity of exercising the greatest possible care in filling up these appointments, which, though perhaps in a somewhat minor degree, nevertheless involve very important <i>quasi</i>-judicial duties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02309"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I desire, with your Lordships' permission, to say one or two words with regard to the answer which was given to me by the noble Lord who represents the Scottish Office. That answer seemed to me to make it more clear than ever that Mr. Wilson ought not to have been appointed to the office of Sub-Commissioner. The noble Lord said that Mr. Wilson has an intimate knowledge of this district. Yes, so he has; and so have the district and the Scottish Office a very intimate knowledge of Mr. Wilson. Lord Balfour, even so far back as the time when he (Lord Balfour) was Secretary for Scotland, knows
<col>772</col>
Mr. Wilson, and knows that his qualities are not those of a Sub-Commissioner. The Act says that all these appointments are to be made with the approval of the Secretary for Scotland. I presume that approval was given in this instance. Yet if the Secretary for Scotland had only chosen to make inquiries in his own Department I am quite convinced that he would have been told that Mr. Wilson was not a fit person to place in this position. One reason given for starting Mr. Wilson at the maximum salary of &#x00A3;700 is that he is fifty-six years of age and is not likely to go on for very long or reach the maximum of his pension. Are these appointments to be filled up in order to enable people to reach the maximum of their pension, and is the salary to be allotted in regard to age rather than the efficiency of the person appointed? It seems to me that the fact that Mr. Wilson is not likely to go on long was an additional reason for not appointing him, and certainly not one for giving him a higher salary.<lb/>
Last year the then Secretary for Scotland, Lord Pentland, assured your Lordships over and over again in this House that one reason why we should have no hesitation in entrusting these great powers to the bodies created under the Scottish Small Holdings Act was that the appointments would be made with the greatest impartiality and the greatest care. This, however, is the first appointment the Board of Agriculture made on entering upon its duties&#x0021; Any one who knows much about Scotland and the history of Scotland during the last two or three years will have heard of Mr. Wilson by name, and I venture to say the Board has commenced its duties by making a very bad and unfit appointment. Do your Lordships imagine that owners and occupiers of land in Inverness-shire and all that part of the country, whose land, I suppose, Mr. Wilson will inspect and report upon to the Board, will have any confidence in the impartiality and in the judicial qualities of a man who up till lately was a political agent in the county? It stands to reason that this appointment was not a fit appointment; and I can only say that if the actions of the Board are looked upon in the immediate future with a considerable amount of suspicion, it will arise from their own fault and from their own fault alone.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02325"><member>LORD GREVILLE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I move an Amendment in subsection (1) of Clause 29, after the word "approve" ["Board of Trade may approve"], to insert "and for such periods and on such terms and conditions as may be expressed in such approval and the Board of Trade may revoke any such approval." The object of this Amendment is to strengthen the hands of the Board of Trade and give them power of control over the working of this clause. As your Lordships know, there has been a certain amount of opposition to the use of trailer cars in London. This is practically in the nature of an experiment. These powers are asked for by the London County Council owing to the enormous increase of tramway traffic in London during the last five years. The number of passengers carried has now reached a total of 533,000,000 per annum. A great many of the passengers using the tramcars make use of them at two periods of the day&#x2014;early in the morning and again in the evening&#x2014;thereby causing a great rush of traffic at these times. It is in order to meet this congestion that the London County Council now seek power under this clause to run trailer cars.<lb/>
This clause has been considered by two Parliamentary Committees. It was passed unanimously by the House of Commons Committee, and was also passed by the House of Lords Committee restricting it to certain districts and certain roads. The Board of Trade were absolutely satisfied that these trailer cars could be worked and would not be detrimental to the public. At the first inquiry before the House of Commons Committee the motor omnibus companies were represented, but before the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0392"/>
<col>775</col>
House of Lords Committee they were found to have no <i>locus standi.</i> It is not necessary for me to say much about their opposition, as they are competing authorities and purely commercial concerns. The advantage of trailer cars is that by using them you reduce the units of traffic. One of the greatest causes of congestion of traffic and danger to the public is the large number of units of traffic using the roads. By the use of a trailer the seating capacity is doubled, and at the same time there is only one unit of traffic. In the majority of cases of accidents it is generally the front of the vehicle that causes the accident. Therefore by having a trailer attached to the tramcar while doubling the seating capacity you do not increase the risk of accidents. Further, there is no danger of other traffic coming between the tramcar and the trailer, as the space between is amply protected. I would point out the difference between a tram with a trailer attached and two trams one following the other. In the latter case there is nothing to prevent faster traffic coming in between, which very often causes dangerous accidents.<lb/>
Trailer traffic is not a new institution. It is used in Paris, Berlin, Pittsburg, Hamburg, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Milan, Sydney, Melbourne, and in other parts of the world. The London County Council went to a great deal of trouble in collecting evidence as to the working of these trailers. All the evidence of experts was that the use of trailers relieved congestion because passengers were able to leave and enter quicker, inasmuch as with a trailer there are three exits and therefore less confusion; and as regards the block at places where traffic is held up, it stands to reason that a tramcar with a trailer attached takes very little longer to cross than a single tramcar. I would instance the case of the tunnel on the Thames Embankment. To enable tramcars to enter that tunnel the whole of the traffic going both ways has to be held up, whereas with a tramcar using a trailer you would get double the number of passengers through each time the traffic was held up. These trailers would be used during the busy parts of the day and discontinued during the slacker times. They could also be made use of in times of stress when there is a great rush. I instance the recent Coal Strike, when special powers were given to permit overcrowding in tramcars. Your Lordships will agree that that is not a thing to be encouraged. By
<col>776</col>
having trailers attached at such times to all cars you would do away with overcrowding.<lb/>
A great deal of apprehension has been expressed with regard to the danger to the public, but I think your Lordships will agree that there is less danger with one unit of traffic than with two. In the first six months of this year the figure of fatal accidents in London as regards motor 'buses was one per thirty-five; as regards tramcars, one per 221. Economy in working is another object which the London County Council has in making this experiment in regard to trailers. At the present moment some &#x00A3;12,000,000 of the London ratepayers' money has been sunk in tramways, so that the matter is one of great interest to the ratepayers. By the use of trailers there would be a saving in the wage bill, as a tramcar with a trailer would only require one driver. There would also be a saving in electrical equipment and also in depot accommodation, as trailers would not require such a costly depot as ordinary tramcars, and again their original cost is about one-half that of a fully equipped tramcar. The other objectors were the Police, but I think it was admitted before the Committee that the Police witness had never seen trailer cars working. Therefore his opinion as to their danger did not carry very great weight, whereas the Board of Trade have licensed trailers and are acquainted with their working in other cities of Great Britain. Fear of delay at the termini was another reason given for the Police objection. There are several methods of dealing with the cars at the different termini, and before any particular system was adopted we should have to obtain the sanction of the Board of Trade and the question of which system of control should be used at the different termini would be thoroughly gone into.<lb/>
I would like to point out to your Lordships that none of the twenty-nine highway authorities in London appeared before either Committee to raise any objection to the running of these trailers. Trailers are being used to a large extent both by motor and steam vehicles, and I have here a photograph of a trailer at present in use in London of very much larger dimensions than any trailer which we propose to use on the London tramways. Another point is that it is very much safer for trailers to be used on recognised roads and on fixed lines. By the Amendment which I have
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0393"/>
<col>777</col>
put on the Paper the Board of Trade are given ample power to control or revoke the running of these trailer cars. The London tramway authority have given a great deal of time and thought to solving the difficulty of dealing with the rashes of traffic to which I have referred, and after collecting evidence from all parts of the world they have come to the conclusion that the problem can best be met in this way. They are of opinion that trailers will accelerate traffic, relieve congestion, and be as safe to the public as any vehicle moving on the roads can be. The only alternative to using trailers would be to put on extra tramcars, and all the objections brought forward to trailer cars apply with much greater force to having a larger number of tramcars running, because the danger to the public with separate units is naturally increased. Therefore I ask your Lordships, in the interests of the public, to accept my Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02327"><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not desire to enter into the merits of this question for reasons which I shall state in a few sentences, but more especially as I fancy the merits will be probably gone into at greater length when we come to the Amendment standing in the name of Lord Montagu of Beaulieu and in the speech which I hope will follow his from the noble Marquess, Lord Bath, who was Chairman of the Committee which heard this case. What: I desire at once to point out to your Lordships is this, that this case has been fully heard&#x2014;with perhaps one' exception, to which my noble friend Lord Montagu will no doubt draw attention&#x2014;by two Committees, a Committee of the House of Commons and a Committee of your Lordships' House, and they decided to allow an experiment. I will not put it higher than that, because what they have allowed falls very far short of the clause as it originally stood when the Bill was first introduced. They decided that sonic experiment is necessary to deal with what the London County Council tell us is the very exceptional state of traffic at what are known technically as the rush hours in the morning and in the evening. These two Committees
<col>778</col>
accepted the view of the London County Council that something must he done; and I desire to support the Amendment of my noble friend Lord Greville for the reason that it carries out&#x2014;and I think the noble Marquess, Lord Bath, will agree with me&#x2014;more clearly than the clause does as it at present stands what the Committees desired should be carried out when they gave their decision. The clause as it stands on the Paper now does not carry out the decision to this extent, that. I do not think it makes it absolutely clear that the Board of Trade are to have power to watch this experiment and to stop it in particular cases where they think it amounts either to a failure or to an injury to either parties. I have been able to see the representatives of the London County Council since the Bill was referred to the Committee of your Lordships' House, and this Amendment is the result of negotiation and the genuine desire of the London County Council to carry out the decision of the Committee before whom they appeared Admitted that this is an experiment, I think your Lordships will be wise to allow it to be, carried out subject to the constant supervision of the Board of Trade, which supervision would be assured if the words of my noble friend are added to the clause. I need not remind your Lordships that the Board of Trade are responsible to Parliament, and that if they do&#x2014;and we have no reason to anticipate that they will&#x2014;neglect their duties under this clause they will be liable to the pressure which can be brought on a public Department by Parliament. But there is another safeguard. The London County Council are not a quiescent body from a Parliamentary point of view. They come before Parliament annually and generally have a Tramway Bill on the stocks, and if as a result of strongly formed public opinion it is found that this clause acts injuriously to the public as a whole or to large individual interests, nothing will be easier than for Parliament to repeal the clause. They will have almost annual opportunities of doing so. I think, therefore, your Lordships will be wise to allow this experiment. Consequently I desire to support the Amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Greville, and if your Lordships in your wisdom think fit to agree to that Amendment. I shall recommend the House to maintain the clause as it will then stand and allow the Bill to pass.</membercontribution></p>

<col>779</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02329"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to move the Amendment standing in my name, which is to leave out Clause 29. I listened with interest to the speech of Lord Greville, and I admit frankly that he spoke with moderation and put the County Council's case forward in an attractive manner. I am not able, however, to agree with all the figures he gave to the House or with the conclusions which he drew. The Amendment which Lord Greville moved and winch the House has just adopted is, I think, a step in the right direction, and even if your Lordships do not agree to delete the clause altogether I shall feel that my efforts have not been in vain, for if I had not brought the matter to the notice of the House it is probable that the clause would have slipped through without the further Amendment which has just been agreed to.<lb/>
My reason for calling your Lordships' attention to the matter at this late stage of the Bill I can explain in a few words. When the Bill was before the House of Commons Committee a good deal of evidence was heard on both sides. It happened that those who were moving on behalf of other users of the roads were not prepared, for reasons which I do not know, to offer their case to the House of Commons Committee, but they were prepared to offer a complete case to the Committee of this House. When they got here, however, it was found that, owing to a curiously strict reading of the Standing Orders, they were debarred from putting forward their laboriously gathered evidence and making, as they thought would be possible, a good case before the Committee. Further, they were consequently unable to cross-examine the witnesses put forward by the promoters. The result is that I find myself now, on the Third Reading of the Bill, obliged to call the attention of the House to this matter. There is a Motion on the Paper of your Lordships' House to-day to amend the Standing Orders of the House in such a way as would allow the Roads Improvement Association, which I represent to-day, to be heard in the future. That is a tacit admission that it would have been much better had they been able to be heard when the Committee of your 'Lordships' House were considering this Bill.<lb/>
I am the last person to oppose an extension of traffic facilities for London. I am no great anti-tramcar advocate. All forms of locomotion are necessary in London, and
<col>780</col>
I acknowledge that the London County Council have done excellent work for many years past in helping to convey the population to and from their work. But it must not be thought that the London County Council are the chief conveyers of the immense amount of passenger traffic in this metropolis. It may interest your Lordships to know that, though 533,000,000 passengers were conveyed last year on the London County Council tramways, 30,000,000 in excess of that number&#x2014;namely, 563,000,000&#x2014;were conveyed by motor' buses and other forms of public conveyance. Therefore the London County Council have no better claim as a traffic conveying authority to be heard than private individuals concerned in this matter. The difficulty, as Lord Greville said, arises owing to the heavy traffic in the mornings and in the evenings. Every one who has watched the traffic of London knows that during the greater part of the day the tramcars and omnibuses are nearly empty. Therefore this request on the part of the Council is merely to deal with the "peak load" during the hours from eight to ten o'clock in the morning and from five to seven o'clock in the evening. Had the Committee thought wise to restrict the use of trailers to these hour I should have been loth to oppose the clause. I think it would have been a perfectly reasonable request. But no such provision exists in the Bill, and as it stands at present trailers and coupled ears may be run at any time during, the twenty-four hours, and they will be run at times when I maintain there is ample accommodation under the existing system.<lb/>
The noble Lord also assumed, on behalf of the London County Council, that the tramway system was going to be a permanent one. I think he rather left out of consideration the fact that the number of passengers carried on the County Council tramways has already dropped. For the first six months of this year they dropped one per cent. as compared with the corresponding period of last year. And the &#x00A3;13,000,000 of the ratepayers' money sunk in these tramways only earned a net profit of &#x00A3;220,000 for the year. Motor 'bus competition is very severe and is increasing rapidly, and before long the County Council's trains will be a non-paying concern. Speaking as a London ratepayer I should, of course, greatly regret this; but the actual state of affairs does not encourage us very much to regard the County Council tram-
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0395"/>
<col>781</col>
ways as being of a very permanent nature so far as the future is concerned.<lb/>
Now I come to the evidence that was given before the Committee. I think it is a serious thing to override the opinion of the Police in this matter. Both the Assistant Commissioner and the Inspector of Public Service Vehicles are strongly of opinion that the use of trailers and coupled cars on the tramways will be prejudicial to the management of traffic in London and will also be dangerous. I maintain that these two gentlemen are great experts on the question. They have spent their lives in studying it, and it is a serious thing for us or for the Committee to say about their evidence that it is not worthy of much attention. When I was a member of the House of Commons I sat on a number of Highway and Traffic Committees, and on those occasions great attention was always paid to the Police point of view. Until we get a Traffic Authority for London, a consummation much to be desired, the Police are the only responsible body for the management of the traffic, and that being so I think it is very important to give their views fall weight. What do they say They state that, not only in the matter of terminal arrangements but in the matter of the actual length of the tramcar and trailer, they entertain very grave objection to this clause. The length of the coupled cars will be seventy feet. To give your Lordships an idea of what this means I took the trouble to measure the Chamber in which we are now sitting, and I find that two tramcar s would reach from the back of the Throne to the railings which separate members of the other House from your Lordships' august body. These cars would be rather wider than the Table at which the Clerks sit, and their total weight would be forty-four tons. These cars with trailers attached are really railway trains. I will deal later on with the weight question, which is a serious one in itself.<lb/>
It so happens that I have been away for the past eleven weeks in America and Canada, inspecting and reporting on the very sort of question presented by this Bill. I visited sixteen of the principal cities in the States and in Canada, and went very carefully into their systems of street railways. I found that the tendency everywhere was to limit the privileges of street railways, and to, if possible, introduce other forms of vehicles. I found that where trailers and coupled cars had been allowed to be run there was a tendency to
<col>782</col>
compel the street tramway companies to give up this practice on the ground of obstruction to traffic. The president of the largest tramway company in New York told me that the Police there would not think of allowing trailer cars to run, and New York is the only city where the traffic is at all comparable to that of London. Therefore when the noble Lord mentioned Pittsburg and other cities as allowing trailer cars to be used, I can only tell him that the present tendency is all against these huge trains being run on street railways.<lb/>
I have read through a good deal of the evidence that was given before the Committee of your Lordships' House on this Bill, and I find in it statements which, had they been subjected to cross-examination, could not possibly have stood. One witness was described as the "general manager of the tramways undertakings in Paris." There is absolutely no such concern. When I read those words I took the trouble to find out what were the tramway companies in Paris. There are in Paris three chief companies, with 124, 53, and 81 miles respectively of route, some running out through the fortifications, some into the country, and some almost entirely in the City of Paris itself. But there is no gentleman entitled to speak for the whole of the tramways of Paris. Nor can anybody who has been in Paris maintain that the traffic conditions there are in any way comparable to those of London. London is a proposition by itself. It has quite unique problems and a far greater density of traffic and far greater difficulties of management, and any parallel that can be drawn from another city, though helpful, is to my mind not at all complete. I notice that there are towns in Great Britain which used to have the power&#x2014;in fact, they possess it to-day&#x2014;to run trailers but have abandoned them. Take Leeds. Leeds has had the power for six years to run trailers, but the system was abandoned there for the reason that it did not pay. I venture to say we ought to have more experience before we authorise the running of these trailers in London. Moreover, if you are going to allow the London County Council to run trailers you must in justice allow other tramway companies in London to run them. How can you allow the London County Council to run trailers and couple their cars together and not allow the same privilege to other tramway companies which operate in the Metropolis?<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0396"/>
<col>783</col>
The decision of the Committee itself I think to a certain extent proves my case. The Committee have limited the London County Council to the territory South of the Thames. I congratulate the Committee on their wisdom. Yet on the South side of the Thames, at the ends of the bridges in particular, are some of the most congested spots in the whole of London, and these are exactly the spots at which these seventy-feet long trains&#x2014;and if there are two meeting their length will Le 140 feet&#x2014;will block every street which crosses the main road. Whether that is wise to allow your Lordships will decide, but I for one cannot help thinking that it is an experiment exceedingly hazardous and rash to allow. Then are you going to allow motor-'buses to have trailers? If the London County Council trams are to have trailers, why not the motor-'buses? Then are you going to allow trade vehicles to have trailers? If you once admit the trailer system it seems to me that you will have to extend it indefinitely. There is yet another point While motor-'buses are confined to a speed of twelve miles an hour these street trains will be allowed to go at sixteen miles an hour.<lb/>
Another grave question is that of Westminster Bridge. It may be news to your Lordships that the maximum weight of any vehicle allowed over Westminster Bridge, according to the by-laws of the London County Council themselves, is fifteen tons. It was never anticipated when Westminster Bridge was built, between 1857 and 1863, that concentrated and heavy loads would ever pass over it. Westminster Bridge is of peculiar construction. It is built of girders which are partly wrought iron and partly cast iron, the object being to give it a good appearance and to diminish the gradient at each end of the bridge. The County Council were at one time so concerned about the bridge that they fixed a limit of two and a-half tons per wheel, for vehicles crossing it, but last year the restrictions as to the load per wheel disappeared. The limit of fifteen tons for vehicles, however, remains. Now while fifteen tons is the maximum allowed by the London County Council's by-law for traffic over Westminster Bridge, the County Council's tramcars each weigh twenty-two tons, and under this clause if it is passed you may have two coupled tramcars going in the reverse direction&#x2014;that is eighty-eight tons of rolling weight on
<col>784</col>
the crowns of the arches of Westminster Bridge. I am assured by competent engineers that that weight is a dangerous one. If the London County Council are to be allowed to break their own by-law and to run weights over Westminster Bridge of eighty-eight tons I think it is a very serious abuse of the by-laws, and they will have to alter the by-laws or else stultify themselves in the eyes of the public. These and other points were not before the Committee of your Lordships' House which considered this Bill owing to the unfortunate position of the Standing Orders.<lb/>
I believe I have put an unanswerable case for the rejection of this clause; but in the event of the clause not being struck out I accept with thankfulness Lord Greville's Amendment to which your Lordships have to-day agreed, and which will at any rate reserve to the Board of Trade full power in the matter. Still I venture to think that the clause even as it stands now is very ambiguous and does not at all convey clearly that the Board of Trade are to have complete control in the matter. If the words "with the consent of the Board of Trade" were put in after the word "may" ["the Council may"] at the beginning of the clause, that I think would cover the point. But at present the clause reads that "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Act, Order, by-law, or regulation, the Council may provide, maintain, work, and use trailer carriages, and, with the consent of the Board of Trade, coupled carriages." I maintain that that wording is very ambiguous, and that both from an editorial point of view and from the point of view of making the clause perfectly clear the words "with the consent of the Board of Trade" ought to come after the word "may." Surely what is meant by the clause is that the consent of the Board of Trade must be obtained both in the case of trailers and coupled carriages. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<col>785</col>
considered. In regard to the question of <i>locus standi</i> we practically had no option. But I must say that if an association like the one mentioned by the noble Lord, admirable though it is, is to be admitted in opposition to measures of this kind I do not know where Committees will be able to draw the line with regard to <i>locus standi.</i> It is perfectly true that, in consequence of the decision with regard to the <i>locus standi</i> of the association which the noble Lord represents, the opposition to this clause and other clauses was limited, but we did have the advantage of all the Police evidence, and we also had the privilege of hearing a representative of the Board of Trade. The two Departments did not look on this question at all from the same point of view. Personally I must say I was not satisfied that there would be any increase of danger from the use of trailer ears. I think it must be obvious that if you couple two cars closely together there is one element of danger removed which would be present if you had those same cars travelling at a short interval one behind the other.<lb/>
No doubt in some ways there probably may be inconvenience in dealing with the traffic,; but we had also to consider the points which were put before the House earlier by my noble friend Lord Greville and which were placed before us with very great force by the London County Council. I refer to the heavy traffic at certain hours in the morning and in the evening and the necessity of properly and economically dealing with it. The Committee, after careful consideration, felt that this was to be an experiment. We also felt that it was one which ought to be tried and given a chance of proving its efficiency or the reverse. We were impressed with the evidence of opposition with regard to dead ends. There is no doubt that North of the Thames the tramways come down to a number of dead ends into crowded parts of London, and it was for that reason that we limited these trailers to the districts South of the Thames, giving access over Westminster and Blackfriars Bridges in order that they may get the circular routes. We allowed them also to go over other bridges, one going to Victoria and another one lower down in Chelsea. It was impressed upon us that these trailers are not meant to run all day. The object of the County Council is by means of the trailers to deal with the crowded traffic in the morning and in the evening, but in the middle of the
<col>786</col>
day the trailers will be placed in their dep&#x00F4;ts. Although the Roads Improvement Association had no <i>locus standi</i> before our Committee, no more had the omnibus companies owing to the omission of a clause from their petition. But it is important to remember that there was no opposition from any of the people who would be affected locally; and while it is perfectly true that the London County Council witnesses were not cross-examined from the point of view of opposition, I can assure the House that their evidence was most carefully scrutinised and questioned by all the members of the Committee, and I think we were able, if I may use the phrase, to put them through their facings almost as well as it might have been done professionally. There were two matters alluded to by Lord Montagu on which I would only say a word. The question of the weight on Westminster Bridge was not before us. I understand that that is a domestic matter which concerns the London County Council.</membercontribution></p>

In any case I presume that the by-laws made by this authority would require the-sanction of a Government Department. My noble friend stated that a French gentleman who was called as a witness described himself as the "general manager of the tramways undertakings in Paris." My recollection does not exactly bear that out. My recollection is that he was described as the assistant to the general manager, and that he was not the chief official himself.</membercontribution></p>

particular set of tramways in Paris. To return to the proposal contained in this clause. I repeat that it is admittedly an experiment. The House has to-day inserted a proviso which gives the Board of Trade ample power, not only to license but to revoke its licence, and I respectfully urge upon your Lordships that this is an experiment which in view of what is done in other towns in this country and also on the Continent should be permitted if a body like the London County Council make such a point of it. I would venture to make one suggestion. It is that possibly the objections which my noble friend Lord Montagu has raised would be to a large extent removed if the fifty-four yards' limit between tramcars following one another was strictly enforced by the Police. It appeared from the evidence given by the inspectors that that provision is not at present strictly enforced. I would urge that having given the powers they have to the Board of Trade the House may very well pass the clause as it now stands and allow what is an experiment but nothing more than an experiment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02336"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has moved the rejection of this clause has, if I may say so, raised a whole succession of bogies. He has virtually told your Lordships that Westminster Bridge may fall through, that we are all going to be run over, and that all sorts of horrors are likely to occur in consequence of this proposal. The London County Council is an elected body and I put it to the House, Is it likely, in view of that fact, which necessarily they have to bear in mind, that they are going to take enormous risks and do things that are unpopular and unnecessary? The Roads Improvement Association is apparently very much troubled over the question of trailers. I would remind Lord Montagu that trailers are allowed in the case of other vehicles in the streets of London. If he will come and stand in the road in which I live he will see a considerable number of motor lorries with carts attached behind, and the officials of the London County Council produced photographs showing some of these vehicles, which were seventy-four and more feet in length.</membercontribution></p>

<col>788</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02338"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: It may be limited to that extent, but the speed at which they travel over the roads in London is considerably more. It has been settled that this is an experiment. The London County Council are quite prepared to accept it as such. But how in the world are they going to put this experiment to proof unless they are allowed to exercise this clause? Lord Montagu said that the London County Council have not yet sufficient experience to undertake this work. How are they to get that experience if they are not allowed this power? The noble Lord stated that the problem in London was an entirely different one from that in any other city in the world. Therefore if we are going to get any valuable experience obviously these trailers have to be tried in London. As to the question of weight, under this clause the Board of Trade have power to refuse to sanction any type of trailer car that the London County Council may put forward. Therefore it is impossible to lay down hard and fast any pledge in this House as to what type of trailer will be employed or what the weight will be, but it is calculated that the weight will not be two-thirds that of an ordinary tramcar and probably it will be only about one-half. With regard to the question of Westminster Bridge, the noble Lord gave a description to the House of the extreme length of these trains&#x2014;as he called them, Well, if they should be of the length which he suggested the weight would necessarily be distributed over a considerable length of the bridge and that would largely affect the question of stability. The question for this Rouse to decide is an exceedingly simple one&#x2014;namely, whether there are to be more tramcars or whether trailers are to be allowed to be used. The noble Lord said that the traffic on the London County Council tramways had dropped. It has done nothing of the kind. The figures for 1909&#x2013;10 were 451,500,000 passengers in 1911&#x2013;12 the figures were 533,500,000. That shows an advance of very little short of 100,000,000 passengers.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02340"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: We have had considerable disturbances throughout London of various kinds during that time and naturally the traffic returns have been affected, but I should be very much surprised if it is found that the traffic has
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0399"/>
<col>789</col>
dropped over the whole of the twelve months. This clause has been considered by Committees in both Houses of Parliament, and there is power in it for a great Government Department to supervise the whole experiment and to veto it at any moment they choose. Therefore it does seem a little unreasonable to say that the public are not going to be sufficiently safeguarded. As I remarked before, the London County Council are an elected body and it is hardly likely that they would carry on an unpopular and unnecessary experiment and waste the ratepayers' money in running trailers which were not required, thus rousing up the opposition of the public, who will be able to decide whether they approve or not of the Council's policy in only a few months' time.<lb/>
I notice that Lord Montagu has a further Amendment on the Paper. It is, in the event of this Amendment not being carried, to insert a new clause providing that trailers should only be tried for a year from the passing of this Bill, and that then the London County Council should have to return to both Houses of Parliament for further powers. On that I should like to ask the noble Lord whether he imagines that trailer cars can be picked up in the streets. We have to make our trailer cars and, of course, we have not begun to make them yet for the simple reason that we have not acquired powers from Parliament to do so. When this Bill receives the Royal Assent the Highways Committee of the County Council will begin the work of making these trailer cars, but I doubt whether we shall have a single one running on the streets this year; and if we have to come back and ask for new powers next year the Highways Committee will not do anything so silly as to commence making trailers now. The London County Council have a sinking fund which enables the cost of a car to be paid off by the time it is worn out.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02343"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I had hoped that before the discussion reached this stage some representative of the Board of Trade would have risen from the Bench opposite to tell us how that Department regards the proposal before the House. I am not quite sure whether we enjoy the advantage of having a representative of the Board of Trade at all under the present arrangement. But what I wished to say was this. I think those of us who have listened to this debate must have remained under the impression that my noble friend Lord Montagu was fully justified in calling the attention of the House to this clause. It is a new provision and one of great importance. It is a provision which must inevitably have a considerable effect either advantageous or disadvantageous on the traffic of London. It is objected to&#x2014;that has not been contradicted&#x2014;by the Police authorities, and it is also objected to by a considerable number of persons interested in the use of the public thoroughfares, who unfortunately, for a technical reason, did not have an opportunity of expressing their views before the House of Lords Committee. And there is also this point about it, that, as was suggested by my noble friend, this concession, if made to the London County Council, must inevitably open a very wide door through which other companies interested in tramcar traffic will desire to pass. There are, however, considerations which I think are entitled to great weight till the other side. This concession is very urgently demanded by the London County Council, and they demand it upon the ground that unless it is made it will be impossible for them to deal with the tremendous congestion of traffic which we know takes place at certain points and at particular times of the day. That view prevailed with the Committee of the House of Commons and also with the Committee of your Lordships' House, and I own that I am greatly swayed by the advice of the Lord Chairman when he suggests to us that the finding of those two Committees ought not to be lightly set on one side by your Lordships' House. Then I am again reassured by another consideration. This clause certainly does not give the London County Council anything like a free hand in this matter. It positively bristles with provisions under which the authority of the Board of Trade may be invoked for a number of purposes&#x2014;for deciding the, route to be followed by these cars, for deciding what safety appliances
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0400"/>
<col>791</col>
should be used by them, and for deciding what their design shall be. And then this evening, on the Motion of my noble friend Lord Greville, we have added a still further safeguard under which the Board of Trade will be able to determine the period for which the concession shall be allowed, the terms and conditions under which it shall be allowed, and under which the Board of Trade will be in a position to withdraw its approval if it thinks that the concession is abused. I think that with those safeguards we may very fairly regard this concession as an experimental one, and as an experiment which ought in all the circumstances to be tried. Therefore I venture to suggest to my noble friend Lord Montagu, who, I think, may fairly urge that but for his intervention we might possibly not have had the Amendment which has now been inserted in the clause, that he should be content with that Amendment and should not put the House to the trouble of a Division.</membercontribution></p>

On this occasion I am glad to think that His Majesty's Government are able to reinforce the appeal which has just been made by the noble Marquess opposite. We feel that your Lordships may safely pass the clause now under consideration, especially in view of the Amendment which has been inserted to-day on the motion of Lord Greville. As your Lordships know, when there is any question of dispute in a matter of this kind negotiations of an informal character always take place, and the parties to those negotiations are generally good enough to take the Government Department into consultation. We have in this case in harmony together the London County Council, the Lord Chairman, two Committees (one of this House and the other of the House of Commons), the Board of Trade, the Home Office, and the Police, and all these are confident that the passing of the clause in the form in which it Dow is cannot possibly cause any danger to anybody.</membercontribution></p>

I can hardly agree with Lord Beauchamp in his statement that the Police now acquiesce in this clause. That was certainly not the information which I received as late as twenty-four hours ago.

The whole country has seen with deep interest and with profound regret the news of the sad event which has plunged into sorrow the friendly people of Japan. The historical imagination of everybody must be stirred by a break such as this in the succession to an ancient Dynasty which was already old when Rome was still the mistress of the Western world and of the fringe of the Eastern world; and our own sympathies, our political sympathies, are affected by the

<col>793</col>
disappearance of a Sovereign who has been for years the faithful friend and ally of this country. It is impossible that any contemporary can attempt to offer an adequate description of the marvellous changes which took place during the reign of the late Emperor. It must be left to the historian of the future to do justice to the wonderful blending in Japan of the old and the new, the retention of so many things of value accompanied by a series of progressive changes such as in other times and countries have not been brought about by the most rapid and the most violent revolution. We have to travel back in recollection to the reign of our own King Alfred to find anything like a comparable instance of the concentration and regeneration of a people in the lifetime of one ruler and under his auspices; and to find a comparison far nearer our own time we are reminded, in thinking of his late Majesty the Emperor, that another Sovereign, the German Emperor William I, was, like him, the centre of great events and of the making of a new nation, while being, like him, content to leave the meed of much popular recognition and applause to the statesmen and the warriors who helped in the accomplishment of those mighty changes. People in this country knew but little of the personality of the late Emperor, but we were told that in all the relations of life, as the father of his people, in the domestic surroundings of his home, as a sharer in the manly activities of his people, and as a patron and in some degree himself proficient in the culture of letters, he won the regard of all his people. We all know that in Japan the phrase "the divinity which doth hedge a King" is not merely, as it might be elsewhere, the expression of romantic loyalty, but represents the profound conviction of a whole people; and therefore with all the deeper sympathy we offer the condolences of this House to His Majesty the Emperor who has just succeeded, to the whole of his Royal House, and to the people of Japan, and by this Address we beg our own honoured Sovereign to express as the representative of his people the sentiments of the entire country.</membercontribution></p>

We shall all of us, I am sure, without distinction of Party, desire to assure His Majesty the King of the regret with which we have learned of the death of His Royal ally and friend. We shall also wish to convey our sympathy to the Royal mourners and to the Government and people of Japan. The events of the last few years have drawn this country and the Empire of Japan very closely together. Probably there is no case in history in which, within so short a time, two nations have been so suddenly drawn together and united by so firm a friendship. The development of that friendship would have been remarkable even if the two nations concerned had been Western nations; it is more noteworthy still when we consider, not only the position of the two countries upon the map of the world, but the fact that until quite recent times Japan was as politically remote from this country as she is widely divided from it geographically. At this moment the two countries are on such terms that no great public misfortune could befall the one without deeply moving the people of the other. Such a public misfortune has befallen the Japanese Empire by the loss of a Sovereign who had found the secret of inspiring his people not only with the profoundest patriotism but also with a deep personal regard for himself. The Emperor has been gathered to his ancestors after a long and eventful reign, wonderful in its vicissitudes and glorious in its achievement. For it fell to the lot of the late Emperor to see a complete political transformation in the Government and Constitution of his country, to see that country emerge triumphantly from a series of great historical struggles, and to see her promoted to a place among the Great Powers of the world. In all these pregnant events the late Emperor bore a dignified and momentous part. He was able to combine both in his public and his private life the part of an Eastern Sovereign clothed, as the noble Marquess told us a moment ago, in the eyes of his people with almost divine attributes, with the part of a Constitutional ruler whom any civilised community would gladly have welcomed. If it were appro

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02429"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that His Majesty's Government do not propose to proceed with the other stages of this Bill, although there is a
<col>804</col>
Motion on the Paper to suspend Standing Order No. XXXIX, until the House is seized of the Finance Bill, which will be not until to-morrow. I believe the noble Marquess the Leader of the House, who has much wider experience, will admit that I am right in saying that the system of bringing up the Consolidated Fund (Appropriation) Bill before the Finance Bill is one which has only grown up in the last two years. It is certainly a great novelty in the practice of this House. This House has always hitherto been acquainted with the amount of the taxes and the system by which they are to be levied before it is asked to agree to the appropriation of the sums. That principle becomes more important because the dates on which the Finance Bill has reached this House have been getting gradually later. I have taken the dates for the last ten years, for the first four of which the late Conservative Government was responsible. In 1902 the Finance Bill reached this House on June 26, in 1903 on June 25, in 1904 on July 29, and in 1905 on June 6. The present Government, having inherited sound traditions in this respect, began by acting upon them; but, <i>facilis descensus Averni,</i> they have rapidly gone to the bad. In 1906 they sent up the Finance Bill on June 14, in 1907 on July 31, in 1908 on July 27, in 1909 on November 8, in 1910 the rejected Finance Bill (after four months of discussion in the House of Commons) on April 27, and the Finance Bill of the year on November 23; in 1911 the Finance Bill reached this House on December 14. And to-morrow the Finance Bill of the year is to reach us at four o'clock with the Royal Commission fixed for six o'clock; and since the matter was first mooted as to when the discussion should take place I would point out that considerable changes, we are informed, have taken place in the Bill in the other House. Your Lordships will see that we are consequently placed in this dilemma, that if we were to summon all those who are qualified&#x2014;and there are a large number of members of this House qualified to speak on finance&#x2014;to discuss this Bill we could only have such a discussion by adjourning the consideration of the Bill for two months; and we are told whenever this House adjourns even for a short time the passing of the Finance Bill of the year that it has a most deleterious effect. Failing such an adjournment we must forego our undoubted right of effectively criticising the Bill.
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0407"/>
<col>805</col>
The noble Marquess opposite, who is an upholder of the traditions of this House, will see that this is a very serious inroad on our privileges, and, what is much more important, on our usefulness; and I cannot help associating it; as I believe it is associated in the country, with the action by which the Prime Minister has deprived this House of direct Ministerial representation of various important Departments, which has a tendency to nullify the advantages of our debates. My noble friend Lord Lansdowne is not anxious to put the slightest difficulty in the way of these Bills passing, even in this hurried manner; but we have some right to ask for a pledge that this will not be drawn into a precedent, especially as there has been, as shown by the dates with which I have troubled the House, a successive deterioration in this respect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02430"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, were I to attempt to answer at length the indictment of the noble Viscount I should have to go through in some detail all the rather tumultuous history of the last few sessions of Parliament, especially in regard to the relations between the two Houses and their bearing on this question of the Finance Bills of succeeding years. It is quite true that for many years&#x2014;not only when the noble Viscount and his friends were in power, but for many years before&#x2014;the Finance Bill came up here as a matter of course and was dealt with as a rule in a couple of somewhat perfunctory speeches by the respective Leaders on both sides and passed through all its stages without any opposition or further comment. The noble Viscount is as familiar as I am with the various changes, upon which we are all entitled to entertain our own opinion, which have caused a variance of the practice as between the two Houses. But I can say frankly to the noble Viscount that it is no desire of ours and it is far from being our intention that there should be any departure from the earlier practice of Parliament. We shall be very glad indeed when, as I trust may be the case, a reversion is made to the practice of bringing up the Finance Bill here in the course of the earlier summer, and I myself see no reason why that should not become at any rate the general if not the invariable practice. As regards the minor point with which the noble Viscount opened his speech as to the respective precedence of the Consolidated Fund (Appropriation)
<col>806</col>
Bill and the Finance Bill, he, of course, recognised that in the present instance the House has no subject of complaint, because, although the Consolidated Fund Bill is to be read a first time to-day and the Finance Bill has not yet reached this House, there is no question of passing the one Bill before your Lordships are in possession of the other. I have not got in my mind what the practice of former years has been in another place as to the respective dates and times of passing these two Bills. It no doubt has often happened, as was evident from the dates which the noble Viscount quoted, that the Finance Bill of the year has had a considerable precedence in time. Of late that precedence has no doubt been disturbed, and if the pious hope to which I have given utterance, that we may in time revert to the practice of passing the Finance Bill of the year through both Houses in the course of the earlier summer, is realised, then no doubt the Finance Bill will once more have precedence of the Appropriation Bill. But in the meantime the noble Viscount will not, I think, maintain that any untoward results have followed or are likely to follow from the disturbance of that practice; and I hope he will be content with the protest he has made.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02465"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to ask the noble Lord who represents the Scottish Office a Question of which I have given the Department private notice. I wish to repeat the Question I asked in this House as long ago as May 15 last&#x2014;namely, when will the Report of the Congested Districts Board of Scotland for the year to March 31, 1912, and the Report of the Crofters Commission be laid on the Table? When I asked this Question on May 15 Lord Willingdon, who then replied for the Scottish Office, told me that the Reports were in a forward state of preparation
<col>814</col>
and would be laid on the Table as soon as practicable. On going to the Scottish Office five months later I discover that these Reports are apparently in the same state as they were then in, whatever that may be. Last year we had a similar complaint to make of the Scottish Office. The more important of these Reports&#x2014;namely, the Report of the Congested Districts Board&#x2014;consists of this: the Scottish Secretary as Chairman of the Congested Districts Board reports to the Scottish Secretary as Scottish Secretary. In these circumstances there does not seem any particular reason for delay in the publication of this Report. Last year these Reports were not laid upon your Lordships' Table until the month of August, it having always been the custom up to that time to lay them in the month of June; and this year, although on May 15 they were said to be in a forward state of preparation, they are not laid on the Table even now. I need scarcely point out that the result of the delay is to prevent any examination of these Reports by members of your Lordships' House while there is time to call attention to them. In this matter the Scottish Office has been even more dilatory than it was last year. I therefore venture to ask when we are to receive these Reports.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE WAR IN THE BALKANS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02475"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have given the noble Marquess who leads the House private notice that I would ask him whether he was able to give us any information with regard to the most recent phase of the situation in South-Eastern Europe. We have, of course, all of us had an opportunity of considering the statement made last night in the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a statement which, if I may be allowed to say so, seemed to me to be as satisfactory as the circumstances could possibly permit. But that statement was of necessity couched in very general terms. We gather from it that the Great Powers are intent upon doing all that is possible to avoid a breach of the peace. But it is stated this afternoon in the streets that war has actually been declared. I dare say the noble Marquess will be able to tell us how far that is the case or not. We also gathered from Sir Edward Grey's statement that the Powers intend to press for the introduction of administrative reforms in Macedonia, and also that the Turkish Government admits the necessity of such reforms.
<col>816</col>
That, my Lords, is very satisfactory, but of course the difficulties commence when you begin to consider what the reforms shall be and what guarantees shall be taken for their execution. Of course, we cannot expect the noble Marquess to give us details upon a point of this kind, but he may, perhaps, be able to tell us whether it is the case that the reforms under discussion are to be based on Article XXIII of the Treaty of Berlin, and more particularly whether they are to be in general accordance with the scheme of reforms proposed by the International Commission for the reorganisation of Turkey and Crete&#x2014;a scheme which is generally referred to as the Statute for Eastern Roumelia. We remember the circumstances in which that Statute was produced, and in which it unfortunately became completely abortive. The House will be grateful for any words of explanation which the noble Marquess sees his way to give us upon any of these points.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02476"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall, of course, be glad to give the House all the information it is in my power to give, though I am not able to add much to the statement made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House of Commons yesterday, a statement which I have no doubt is within the knowledge of your Lordships. My right hon. friend stated that two questions were before the Great Powers of Europe. In the first place they desired that peace in the Balkans should, if possible, be maintained, and with a view of impressing on the Balkan States the sentiments entertained by the Powers the two Great Powers most particularly concerned&#x2014;namely, Austria-Hungary and Russia&#x2014;were to make, and presumably have made, representations to the Balkan States on lines agreed upon by all the Great Powers. Those representations were to the effect, in the first place, that the necessity for the introduction of reforms would be seriously impressed upon Turkey by the Powers. The second point was this, that in no circumstances would the Great Powers agree to any change in the <i>status quo</i> in the South-East of Europe. Now, we are told to-day that a breach of the peace has already taken place, that there has been fighting on the Montenegrin frontier, and for a time it did not seem to be certain&#x2014;we had no information&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0413"/>
<col>817</col>
as to whether this was the beginning of an actual state of war or whether it arose out of one of those frontier incidents which, as your Lordships are aware, have not infrequently occurred on those disturbed frontiers. But I am sorry to say that we have this afternoon received information that the fighting on that frontier is a sequel to a Note presented by the Montenegrin <i>Charg&#x00E9; d' Affaires</i> at Constantinople involving what was tantamount to a Declaration of War. Then as regards the latter part of the noble Marquess's question, it was agreed that at Constantinople identical communications should be made by the representatives of the different Powers in respect of reforms to be instituted by Turkey in the European Provinces; and, in reply to the particular point raised by the noble Marquess, it is clearly intended that the basis of discussion, the starting point from which the discussion between Turkey and the Powers will take place, will be Article XXIII and the Law of 1880, to which the noble Marquess has alluded&#x2014;that is to say, it is intended that the reforms should be carried out in the spirit of those two instruments. It is also clearly stated at the same time that the reforms shall be carried out without infraction of the territorial sovereignty of Turkey. The one feature which, I think, we can all regard as encouraging in a situation of great stress and anxiety is the accord which has been arrived at and is being maintained between the Great Powers with regard to the representations which they are unitedly prepared to make.</membercontribution></p>

<title>LONDON INSTITUTION (TRANSFER) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02477" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02478">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02479"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill is one which I think I may say has very cordial support from both sides of the House. With the Eastern Hemisphere of the world this country has very extensive relations, far more extensive than those of any other Power. We trade with some 600,000,000 of people who speak Eastern languages, and our trade with them amounts to well over &#x00A3;200,000,000. Besides that we have relations with them of different kinds&#x2014;not trade relations&#x2014;which involve on the part of our diplo-
<col>818</col>
matists, our soldiers, and our sailors a knowledge of various Oriental languages. While this is so the country has done very little indeed to meet the necessity of giving opportunities to those who will be engaged in these relations of acquiring these Oriental languages. In Berlin, where the relations to the Eastern Hemisphere are less than with us, the State spends &#x00A3;10,000 a year; in Paris about &#x00A3;7,000 is spent; while we spend almost nothing, and of what we do spend very little comes from the State.<lb/>
In these circumstances the attention of the Government was called to what really amounted to nothing less than an evil, and it was resolved some time ago to see how it could best be dealt with. To that end a Committee was appointed by the India Office, under the presidency of Lord Reay, and, in 1909, that Committee reported on the desirability of founding a school in London which should devote itself exclusively to instruction in Oriental languages. Following upon that a very important Committee was appointed to consider the best way in which the scheme brought forward by Lord Reay's Committee could be put into practice. Lord Cromer, I think, was chairman of that Committee, and the noble Earl, Lord Curzon, was also a member. The second Committee reported in favour of what seems to the Government to be a very practical scheme, and upon that scheme steps have been taken.<lb/>
The design is to found a School of Oriental Languages, which may be available not only for commercial men but for those who require the other kinds of training to which I have referred. It seemed desirable, if possible, that the school should be placed in the City of London, where those who required that training might find it more easily available. In the City of London there exists an old institution called the London Institution. It is one of those organisations which belong more to the Victorian period than to the period of to-day. It was founded for the purpose of giving lectures and providing a library, reading rooms and a place of study. The shareholders of that institution, taking a very public-spirited view of the desirability of utilising it for national purposes, were willing to take a step forward, and, subject to certain arrangements for their existing members which would give them access to the building, they expressed their willingness that the Government should
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0414"/>
<col>819</col>
take their building over and remodel it for the purpose of the new School of Oriental Studies.<lb/>
With this view an arrangement has been come to between the Treasury and the London Institution under which a large sum is to be spent on remodelling the building, and under which a very substantial grant of money is to be given for the purpose of maintaining the school. We have reason to believe that there will be other revenues, but there will be a grant of &#x00A3;4,000 a year and &#x00A3;25,000 capital money will be expended on adapting the building. The arrangement is that the buildings are to be taken over and vested in the Office of Works as trustees, and that there should be a governing body, on which, of course, the Government will be represented but it will be a body best adapted for promoting the functions of the new institution. The present Bill is to enable the transfer to take place. All the terms have been agreed. I have had the satisfaction of an interview with Lord Aldenham on behalf of the London Institution this afternoon, and there is now no outstanding point of any kind with regard to the difficult questions of finance between us. In these circumstances I ask your Lordships to read the Bill a second time.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02481"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack has referred to me, and it is true that I have played a modest part in connection with this matter as a member of the Committee to which he alluded. Lord Cromer was chairman of the Committee, and I can assure your Lordships that all the parties concerned are very much indebted to him for the active energy and ability he devoted to the settlement of this question. It is only through indisposition that my noble friend is prevented from being present to-day. As the Lord Chancellor truly stated, this country has a greater stake than any other European nation in the East. We own larger Eastern possessions. We have greater commercial, political, and military interests. We send out to the East more of our nationals than any other European country. Yet hitherto we have been, in point of instructional advantages, behind the other great nations

of Europe. It is to remedy that deficiency&#x2014;I might almost call it a scandal&#x2014;that this effort is being made. The Committee over which Lord Cromer presided exerted itself to suggest a constitution for the new school when it should be started, but we should not have been able to carry it through had it not been for the very liberal view the Government were prepared to take of their responsibilities in the matter. Those who served on the Committee owe a debt of gratitude to His Majesty's Government and notably to the Lord Chancellor, who, being himself immensely interested in the University of London, with which it is proposed, in some form or another, to connect this school, has helped us by every means in his power. A word is also due to the shareholders of the Institution, headed by Lord Aldenham, who have met the proposals of the Committee and the views of the Government in every possible way. Among the smaller Bills that come before your Lordships none is more worthy of support than this, and I hope it may pass through your Lordships' House without opposition.</membercontribution></p>

<title>INCOME TAX ON MARRIED WOMEN'S<lb/> PROPERTY.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02502"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL RUSSELL</member> rose to call attention to the imprisonment of Mr. Mark Wilks at the instance of the Treasury for nonpayment of his wife's Income Tax, and to move to resolve&#x2014;
<quote>"That in the opinion of this House the present state of the law which renders a man liable to indefinite terms of imprisonment for matters over which he is by Statute deprived of any control is undesirable, and should be amended."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02503">The noble Earl said: Your Lordships will have noticed in the newspapers the case of a gentleman of the name of Mark Wilks, who, under a warrant applied for or issued by the Treasury, was taken to Brixton Prison in connection with his wife's taxes, and after spending some time there was, without any particular reason, released. I desire to call your Lordships' attention not only to the circumstances of that case, but to the principles which underlie them. The case itself presents many elements almost of comic opera, except, perhaps, as regards the unfortunate gentleman himself, who probably did not so acutely see the comic side. But the principle on which the Treasury proceeded is one which this House ought to examine and consider.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02504">The position in this case was as follows. Mr. Wilks is a schoolmaster, in which capacity he earns a comparatively humble income. His wife, Elizabeth Wilks, practises as a doctor, in which capacity she earns an income, as I understand, considerably superior to his. The exact amount of it I do not know, because Mr. Wilks was unable to inform me any more than he was able to inform the Commissioners of Inland Revenue. He has no means of ascertaining the amount of his wife's income, but it is admitted to be considerably larger than his own. In the ordinary course of events Dr. Elizabeth Wilks, the wife of this gentleman, was
<col>824</col>
asked for the payment of her Income Tax, and, being a Suffragette, she refused to pay. She was maintaining the old Liberal theory, "No taxation without representation." I do not know how far that theory meets with support nowadays. Naturally the Inland Revenue were not going to be done out of their taxes because of the political views of this lady. They therefore adopted the ordinary methods, and finally the method of distraint. But an interesting point in this case is that the distraint was made, not upon the goods of Mr. Mark Wilks, but upon the separate goods of Dr. Elizabeth Wilks&#x2014;I believe, in one instance, at her surgery where she practises in a house in which and with the furniture in which her husband has no concern whatever. I think that for two years there was distraint.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02505">Mrs. Wilks then decided to assert the rights which it appeared to her the Income Tax Acts gave her. She pointed out that under those Acts she was not liable either to make a return or to pay the taxes; that under those Acts the income of a married woman living with her husband was deemed to be his income, and that therefore the obligation was on Mr. Wilks to make the return, and, when the assessment had been made, to pay the taxes. The Treasury accepted that view and applied to Mr. Mark Wilks for the return. Mr. Wilks replied that he was not in a position to make a return of his wife's income, because he had no idea how much it was and she did not choose to tell him. That is a position which, under the Married Women's Property Act, she is perfectly justified in taking up. Her husband has no concern with her income and can receive no information about it except by her courtesy. He has no more right to demand any particulars of her income or to handle her income than I have to handle the income of any of your Lordships. Mr. Wilks, therefore, informed the Treasury that he could not make the return.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02506">The Treasury, after considerable correspondence, decided to assess him upon their own basis. They assessed his income and also that of his wife, and charged both at the rate of 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> in the &#x00A3;. That was an incidental unfairness in the case. Mr. Mark Wilks, who was obviously entitled to the 9<i>d.</i> rate on his earned income, was refused that rate because he was not able to make a return of his total income&#x2014;that is to say, the income of himself and his wife.
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0417"/>
<col>825</col>
A letter was written to him by the Treasury pointing out that this was so. Under date June 8, 1912, the Surveyor of Taxes wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, and to inform you that the only return of your income (1911&#x2013;12) which I am able to trace contains only particulars of your own salary. This does not constitute a complete return of your total income from all sources as required for the purposes of claiming abatement and relief.&#x2026; Duty is therefore chargeable on your salary at the rate of 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> in the &#x00A3;."</quote>
So that the first unpleasant incident that happened to Mr. Willis because his wife would not tell him her income and he had no means of ascertaining it was that his own income was charged at 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> in the &#x00A3; instead of at 9<i>d.</i> The Surveyor then wrote to Mr. Wilks, in answer to a further letter from him, stating that&#x2014;
<quote>"In order to claim abatement or relief it was necessary that you should have included in your return your wife's income, and as you did not do so the return that you did make cannot be held to be the 'true and correct statement' provided for by the income Tax Acts, and your statement was accordingly no return in the sense of the decision of the Judges.&#x2026;"</quote>
After citing the case in which the decision referred to was given, the Surveyor concluded his letter by offering to explain the matter further if necessary.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02507">The next process, having made the assessment, was that they required Mr. Wilks to pay the duties, amounting to &#x00A3;33 12<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.,</i> "due from you under the Statutes relating to the Income Tax"; and it was added that the costs of the writ amounted to &#x00A3;1 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.,</i> which "must be paid together with the duties." Then there ensued a correspondence between Mr. Wilks arid the Inland Revenue, in which they pressed him to pay and added that if he did not they would unfortunately be obliged to take the unpleasant step of applying for his commitment. The letters, of course, were exceedingly polite and courteous, but they contained the unpleasant hint all the time that the thing would end in his imprisonment if he did not pay. Mr. Wilks stated that he did not receive his wife's income; that he had not got it to pay with; that his own income&#x2014;&#x00A3;150 a year&#x2014;was barely sufficient for his maintenance, and that it was impossible for him to raise such a sum of money as they required him to pay. And finally, after considerable correspondence with the Treasury extending over from twelve to eighteen months, a writ was
<col>826</col>
issued and Mr. Wilks was taken up and lodged in Brixton Gaol. While in Brixton Gaol he applied to be released. The Home Secretary, I think I am right in saying, was not able to interfere. Mr. Wilks was held there by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, and I do not think the Home Secretary could have released him.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02508">Mr. Wilks sent a petition to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue stating his position, and they replied to the effect that they were unable to release him. He received a letter from the Inland Revenue, dated September 24 last, as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"The Board of Inland Revenue have had before them the petition addressed to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, in which you apply for your immediate release from prison&#x2014;</quote>
I might add that meanwhile, of course, this gentleman's prospect of continuing in his employment was suffering, and he was running considerable risk of losing his position&#x2014;
<quote>"In reply thereto I am directed to acquaint you that the Board have not at any time accepted, and cannot now accept, the view that payment of the Income Tax, for which judgment was obtained in the High Court, has been impossible for you owing to your lack of means&#x2014;</quote>
I do not care whether it was or was not possible. It does not affect my case in any way whether Mr. Mark Wilks could have scraped together &#x00A3;33 out of his income to pay these duties or whether he could have persuaded his wife to lend hint the money. His contention was that out of his income of &#x00A3;150 a year he had not the &#x00A3;33 to pay with. The letter proceeds&#x2014;
<quote>"I am to remind you that this matter has been the subject of correspondence for upwards of two years. The Board's information is that during that period you have personally been in receipt of a regular income out of which von could have paid the amount due if you bad been willing to do so. But, in spite of explanations of the law and warnings of the consequences of non-payment, your attitude has throughout been one of refusal to recognise the liability which the law clearly imposes upon you. In these circumstances the Board desire, before considering the question of your release, to know what proposal you have to make with a view to securing the satisfaction of the debt due from you to the Crown."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02509">I pause here to say that in the remarks I make this afternoon I do not challenge the complete legality of Mr. Mark Wilks's imprisonment. Indeed, its legality is my ease. The law is an absurd law; it is contrary to the Married Women's Property Act, and should therefore at the earliest possible
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0418"/>
<col>827</col>
date be amended. I in no way challenge the legality of what was done, but I do challenge its natural justice and its common sense. There was. I take it, no further correspondence with the Commissioners; but without Mr. Mark Wilks, so far as my information goes, having made any arrangement to pay the money or any proposal for the liquidation of the debt due to the Crown, and most decidedly without his having paid it, he was, after a certain period, released from Brixton Prison. Now, what is exactly the position of the Treasury in this matter, and what attitude do the Government take up in enforcing this rather antiquated provision in the Income Tax Act? If they take up the attitude, not only that it is legal&#x2014;which I admit&#x2014;but that it is a justifiable and a reasonable and proper law, why have they released Mr. Wilks? I do not understand what justification there can be for the releasing of Mr. Wilks in these circumstances. There was ample legal justification for his imprisonment, and I think it is not altogether a regrettable thing that that course was taken by the Treasury, because it has called attention to this provision of the law. The provision is such that, in the case of a man totally impecunious married to a wife with a considerable separate income, it would be absolutely in the wife's power to have him detained in prison whenever she chose not to make a return and not to pay her Income Tax. We are told sometimes that legislation is unduly favourable to men, but this particular legislation might hit us very hardly if our wives were inclined to take advantage of it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02510">This is really an antiquated piece of legislation no longer appropriate to the circumstances of the case. When a wife's income was in effect her husband's income, when he had control of it and was able to use it, it was extremely reasonable to require him to make a return of it and to let the obligation for any taxes imposed upon it fall upon him. But the whole circumstances have been altered by the passing of the Married Women's Property Act, and the provision is no longer justifiable. In addition to that, it is unreasonable because you are putting a particular difference in taxation upon two people who live together when they happen to be husband and wife as distinct from the case when they are father and son or two brothers or two sisters in the same house; and incidentally it does not tend to the establishment of the
<col>828</col>
regular relation of matrimony, because you put a distinct premium upon two people living together without the legal bond of matrimony, for if only they were not lawfully married they would then not be liable to this harsh provision of the Income Tax Act. That also is a point that might well be considered. A Question was asked of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on this subject in another place last week, and I have seen his answer variously reported. In one newspaper he was made to say that he would not continue to enforce this provision of the law while he was considering its amendment, whereas in another report the answer was that he would not interfere. However that may be, the sooner this provision of the law is altered the better, for it is obviously an unreasonable provision imposing upon a man as it does an obligation which another Statute prevents him from fulfilling, and I think that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, having already had since 1910 in this particular case to consider the point, might have introduced an amendment in his Budget.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02511">I do not know whether the answer to-day is going to be that because this provision is on the Statute-book it is therefore perfectly right and proper and ought not to be changed. I dare say the practical answer in another place against any pressure is that, a Liberal Government being in power, it is not fitting that it should be disturbed by Liberals. I do not take quite that extreme Party view, and I do not think that a particular law is right because it is a Liberal Government which has enforced it. I hope, therefore, that we shall be assured this afternoon that at as early a time as possible this provision, which is quite out of date and in no way accords with existing facts, will be considered and the law amended so as to place it upon a basis where it can be enforced without causing an outcry. I suppose the reason Mr. Wilks was released was that the Government felt that it was ridiculous to keep him in prison and that they had no moral right to so detain him. That being so, I beg to move the Motion standing in my name.</p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02513"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am far from making any complaint, such as my noble friend seemed to anticipate, that he has brought forward this case of Mr. Wilks, and I am free to admit that there is a distinct illogicality in the situation he has revealed. That illogicality is recognised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who, in reply to a Question addressed to him in the House of Commons on the ninth of this month, made a statement which I will read to the noble Earl as he does not seem to have a very certain view of what that answer was. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said&#x2014;
<quote>"I will consider the question of amending the law so as to obviate the necessity of such action&#x2014;</quote>
that is to say, the imprisonment&#x2014;
<quote>"But in the meantime I am certainly not prepared to instruct the Revenue authorities to refrain from administering the law as it stands."</quote>
I would, with your permission, like to be allowed to say one or two things on the observations which the noble Earl has addressed to your Lordships, and I desire to make it clear to the House that Mr. Wilks, who seems to have appealed for public sentiment on the ground that he was unable to pay, was not at all in that position. Mr. Wilks was a schoolmaster under the London County Council and in receipt of an income varying from &#x00A3;160 to &#x00A3;170 a year. His wife, who practises as a doctor, is supposed to be in receipt of an income of about &#x00A3;700 a year, so that it is idle to try and make out that these two people were unable to pay the Income Tax demanded.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02514"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: I never suggested that the two were unable to pay; only the one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02515"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: It is very difficult for the noble Earl to suggest that Mr. Wilks himself was unable to pay the Income Tax, lie was enjoying to a great extent the proceeds of his wife's income, he was living in a house which is said to be her house, and I have no doubt whatever that he was in a position to pay this tax; and if the Revenue authorities had believed that he was unable to pay, then the same pressure would not have been exerted as was exerted in the present case. The fact of the matter is that there is every reason to believe that this is not a normal case exemplifying the hardship of the present system. This is something in the nature of a political demonstration, with
<col>830</col>
the objects of which we may or may not sympathise. But when we are invited to consider the justice of the present law and procedure I think we have a right to examine the circumstances in which the protest is made, and I hope the House will bear these in mind when they consider both the present state of the law and the action of the Department in question.<lb/>
The Revenue Department is charged with the duty of collecting the revenues. The successful establishment of Mr. Wilks's contention would involve a very serious loss to the Exchequer, and it is obviously the duty of the authorities to take all the steps at their command to prevent such loss. The only two methods which the Revenue Department has in these cases is to proceed either by distraint, or, in default of distraint, by imprisonment. It may occur to your Lordships that, seeing that Mr. Wilks was in possession of this income from the London County Council, there should have been some power to attach his income to meet the debt and avoid the necessity of proceeding by imprisonment. I am advised that there is no such power, and that therefore it was not open to the authorities to take such a step. It may be a matter for consideration whether the ordinary proceedings of attachment of income might not be extended to cover Crown cases, and also whether a debt to the Crown should not be recoverable on the husband's or wife's goods when they are living together. If that had been possible the present case would not have gone as far as it has. But I think the noble Earl knows that that is not the case, and that directly Mrs. Wilks protested that the furniture was hers the Revenue authorities were unable to proceed by distraint.<lb/>
A word on the question of the general justice of making the husband responsible for the payment of Income Tax. In the vast majority of cases the husband is the salaried partner, and where he is not he almost invariably benefits from his wife's income. I may remind your Lordships that this procedure is not applicable to the case where the parties are separated. It is only where the husband and wife are living together and presumably where the husband is enjoying his wife's income to some extent that time present provisions apply. Unless one party is made responsible it is found in practice that the goods upon which the Revenue Department would naturally
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0420"/>
<col>831</col>
distrain have the habit of belonging to the other party, and in that way the security for the Crown debt disappears.<lb/>
I would like to make this further point, which I think bears upon the case. Exemption and abatement, all relief of Income Tax, is calculated on the basis of joint income. If you aggregate the income for purposes of relief and separate it for purposes of collecting the tax, immense difficulties of apportionment arise. It seems necessary to have one clear and simple method of dealing with it. If the incomes are taken together for purposes of abatement they should be taken together for purposes of collection, and, if that is so, one party of the two must be made responsible for the Income Tax. Perhaps you may say, Why not treat the husband's and wife's incomes as entirely separate? That is a suggestion which appears to have some advantages, but it would be attended with much loss to the Exchequer, and on that ground alone I think it is not likely to be contemplated. But, my Lords, after all I admit&#x2014;and my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has admitted&#x2014;that there is a certain substratum of hardship in the fact that a husband should be imprisoned for failure to pay the Income Tax on his wife's income, and I think there is something especially out of date in the fact that such imprisonment can be at official discretion.<lb/>
The noble Earl asked for the justification for the release of Mr. Wilks. This imprisonment is intended to be a deterent in other cases, and this case having gone as far as it has and Mr. Wilks having been in prison it was thought that this result had been to a great extent achieved, and that other husbands were not likely to put themselves to the same inconvenience which Mr. Wilks had welcomed. That is the justification of Mr. Wilks's release. It is true that the Treasury regulations which govern this subject were framed many years before the Married Women's Property Act of 1872, and therefore there is a certain anachronism in maintaining the present Treasury regulations in view of that Act. Moreover, I admit that the Super Tax, which, of course, is a recent impost, treats a woman's property as separate from her husband's. There is therefore a good deal to be said in favour of some amendment of the Treasury procedure in these cases, and I am very glad that my right hon. friend the Chan-
<col>832</col>
cellor of the Exchequer has promised to take the matter into consideration. At the same time, whatever may result from those considerations I think the noble Earl will agree that the new provisions must be of such a kind as to safeguard the Treasury from the serious losses which might arise if any ill-considered action were adopted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02516"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether the noble Earl who introduced this subject this evening is satisfied with the statement made on behalf of His Majesty's Government. The speech of the noble Lord who has just sat down showed, at all events, that they are prepared to admit that the present state of the law is not entirely satisfactory. The noble Lord admitted that there was what he called a substratum of hardship, and that His Majesty's Government are prepared to consider whether at certain points the law should not be amended.<lb/>
Although I do not pretend to any knowledge of the intricacies of this matter, there certainly seem to he sonic points at which the operation of the law is extraordinarily inconsistent. Take, in particular, the contradiction between the manner in which the property of married couples is treated, in the one case for the purpose of Income Tax, and in the other for the purpose of what we generally describe as the Death Duties. Unless I am quite wrong, in the case of assessment for Income Tax during the joint lives of husband and wife the separate income of the two is aggregated and treated as one single income. The result of that was touched upon in the speech to which we have just listened. The effect of it is that there are people who come within the Income Tax limit who but for that condition of the law would not do so; there are people who cannot claim a rebate of Income Tax who but for that condition of the law would be able to claim it; there are people again&#x2014;the noble Lord referred to them&#x2014;who are brought within the operation of the Super Tax who would not be in that position if the law were different. All those features of the case are, no doubt, advantageous to the Treasury, because they bring more grist to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's mill.<lb/>
Take, on the other hand, the case of the Death Duties. In that case when the husband or wife dies the estates, which were pooled for
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0421"/>
<col>833</col>
Income Tax purposes, are treated as separate estates. In some cases that works very hardly indeed. Take the case of the death of a professional man. The breadwinner of the family disappears, and the widow obviously finds herself in very straightened circumstances; yet Death Duties are charged upon any part of the husband's estate which is retained by the survivor. It is rather difficult to see why a married woman should pay Death Duties on an income which she has in fact shared with her husband during his lifetime and on which Income Tax was levied upon the assumption that it was not a separate income but a joint aggregate income. I hope these matters will be looked into, and I think the noble Earl was justified in bringing this Question before the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02517"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR, (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no doubt it is true, as the noble Marquess has just pointed out, that the Income Tax and Death Duty laws are full of anomalies. In the case of Income Tax, the law dates from a period when the position of married women was very different from what it is to-day, and legislation has become commonplace which would have been looked upon with the utmost disfavour half a century ago. To-day we treat the income of a married woman as nearly as possible as though it were the income of an unmarried person, and yet the machinery for enforcing the Income Tax laws remains in a large measure what it was half a century ago. The result of that, of course, is hardship. I entirely agree that the case of Mr. Wilks is one where there is an anomalous state of the law which cannot be defended, and my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as Lord Ashby St. Ledgers has told the House, has undertaken to consider it. When I say that I do not wish to be understood to convey that the matter is other than an intricate one to deal with. The machinery for the collection of Income Tax and the machinery for the collection of Death Duties both give rise to very complicated problems. Things which look simple on the face of them bear, when you come to look into their real significance, a quite different aspect. Some of the points touched on by the noble Marquess are points which well deserve our attention, but we cannot be too careful lest in making
<col>834</col>
changes we stumble into the temptation, which is very great to those who are fashioning machinery for the collection of the revenue, to take advantage of provisions which belong to a past state of the law while at the same time taking advantage of changes which have been made in quite other directions. The whole subject is one which is not likely to escape our consideration, and I hope my noble friend will be content with the discussion he has elicited and not press his Motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02518"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think in all the circumstances I might perhaps withdraw my Motion, although in itself it is absolutely harmless, because it merely states that the present state of the law which renders a man liable to indefinite terms of imprisonment for matters over which he is by Statute deprived of any control is undesirable, and should be amended. If the noble Lord will accept the Motion, I should prefer that course, so that we may have it on record that this state of the law was called attention to arid that it was thought undesirable. I do not found myself for one moment on the particular case of Mr. Wilks or on any other particular case, but simply on the fact that it is undesirable, and particularly undesirable in connection with taxes, to have laws which on the face of them seem inequitable and unfair.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE PUBLIC TRUSTEE FOR IRELAND.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02532"><member>LORD ORANMORE AND BROWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government whether, in the event of the Government of Ireland Bill becoming law, the Public Trustee for Ireland would be responsible to, and under the control of, the Irish Executive or of the Imperial Government, and by whom would future vacancies in this office be filled. This may appear to some of your Lordships a matter of very small importance, but I can assure you that it is not so regarded in Ireland. A considerable amount of the funds
<col>836</col>
administered by the Public Trustee in Ireland consists of moneys derived from the sale by landlords of their estates under the various Land Acts. At present there are few landlords who are actually dependent upon the interest which they derive from these funds, because, even if they had no property elsewhere, they have their houses in Ireland in which they live, and they still have the demesne lands which they either farm themselves or let out to the best possible advantage.<lb/>
But if a Home Rule Bill were passed this might not be the case. There are many of us who believe that it would be impossible for Unionists in the three southern Provinces to remain in Ireland after the passage of that measure. As to the revenues which might be derived from demesne lands, we are strongly of opinion that they would amount almost to nothing, owing to specially vindictive taxation against them; and if it turns out that the Public Trustee is under the jurisdiction of the new Irish Government, and that instead of the gentleman who at present occupies that office some individual were appointed by the new rulers in Ireland, and, in addition to that, if the Irish Parliament were to pass a measure varying the securities in which these trust funds might be invested to the detriment of the beneficiaries, the lot of the Irish landlord would indeed be a very hard one.<lb/>
I hope the noble Lord who will reply on behalf of His Majesty's Government will not content himself by referring to the paper guarantees in the Government of Ireland Bill, because he knows as well as I do that those guarantees could not be enforced except by a British army. I also hope he will not refer to the amicable expressions and promises made by the Nationalist Party. We have had experience of such promises. Similar ones were made at the time of the passage of the Local Government (Ireland) Bill in 1898, and they proved to be absolutely untrue and valueless. I trust that the noble Lord will be able to assure me that the Public Trustee for Ireland will remain an officer of the Imperial Government, and that thus he will be able, if necessity arises, to move the funds committed to his charge from the power of those to whom His Majesty's Ministers propose to entrust the future government of Ireland.</membercontribution></p>

<col>837</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02533"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just addressed your Lordships has conjured up for your edification a series of horrors as to what will happen under the proposed Home Rule Bill. He has spoken of the almost certain vindictive taxation of demesne lands, and has referred with contempt to what he calls the "paper guarantees" that exist in the Bill. I do not think the noble Lord need have worried your Lordships, because a very elementary study of the Bill would have convinced him that, quite apart from all these considerations which may or may not be likely to happen, the position of the Public Trustee for Ireland is not affected by the Bill in question. This individual must not be confused with the English Public Trustee. Your Lordships will remember that this is an official appointed under the Land Purchase Act of 1903, and his duties are confined wholly to circumstances which arise out of the purchase of land under that Act. He has certain duties to perform, mainly, I think, of advice. That is what it amounts to in practice, although he can also occupy the position of Trustee at the desire of the tenant for life. This official would remain in exactly the same position under the proposed legislation as he is in now.<lb/>
Clause 2, subsection (11), of the Bill provides that the subject of land purchase and all matters connected with it are to be treated as a Reserved Service. The Public Trustee will therefore be appointed by the Lord Lieutenant as he has been in the past, and his position will be in no wise altered. I think sonic confusion, perhaps, has arisen on this subject owing to the dual nature of the functions which the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland will perform in the future should this Bill become law. Concerning purely Irish affairs, the Lord Lieutenant will act upon the advice of his Irish Cabinet; but with regard to the services which are reserved, such as the Land Purchase Act, he will act, as he at present acts, under the advice of the Imperial Government. It may be, as I have said, that it is this dual capacity which the Lord Lieutenant will occupy which has given rise to the misgivings entertained by the noble Lord and prevented his seeing that under the clause which I have quoted the situation remains
<col>838</col>
exactly as it is. In these circumstances the noble Lord can set his mind at rest. Such funds as the Public Trustee in Ireland deals with at present will be dealt with in exactly the same manner in the future.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02565"><sup>*</sup><member>The LORD CHANCELLOR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to explain very briefly the character of this Bill. It originates with the Foreign Office, and its purpose is to bring the enlistment law of this country, as contained in the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1870, into harmony with the provisions which were agreed upon in The Hague Convention. A Committee has sat for the purpose of working out the details, and they are embodied in this Bill. I should state that the Bill imposes no restriction, but gets rid of a certain undue severity with which the law presses upon British shipbuilders. The Hague Convention agreed that the law should be that when a ship was being fitted out for merely commercial purposes as distinguished from purposes of war it was quite legitimate that it should be
<col>842</col>
bought and sold in the ordinary way, but the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1870 was drawn with such stringency that it goes beyond that; and the Foreign Office have prepared this Bill in order to make our law accord with the provisions of the Convention come to at The Hague Conference upon the point. The Bill is in every respect, I think, beneficial to the interests of British shipowners and shipbuilders, and it brings the law, as I have said, into conformity with the law recognised by other nations and by ourselves at The Hague Convention. The point is a very small one, but I think the Bill will prove useful. There is another provision in it to the effect that if a ship has been contracted to be built in time of peace but has warlike equipment connected with it, then the contractor may give notice to the British Government, and the British Government will decide what is to be done. The contractor is not allowed to let the ship leave these shores unless the consent of the British Government has been obtained. I move that the Bill be read a second time.</membercontribution></p>

<title>KING'S BENCH DIVISION&#x2014;ADDITIONAL<lb/> JUDGE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02570"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I now rise to move au Address, in the terms which appear on the Notice Paper, for the appointment of an additional Puisne Judge of the King's Bench Division. I do not propose to take up much of your Lordships' time in making this Motion. The matter was fully discussed in another place last Friday, and the Address which I move is in the same terms as the Address which was there agreed to. There are a good many points about which difference of opinion exists in connection with the general subject of the sufficiency of Judges, and whether the arrangements in regard to the Long Vacation, the County Courts, and other matters are the best possible, but I will not enter upon them to-day; because, as your Lordships are aware, the Government propose to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into these things. Consequently, at the present time our attention is directed simply to the much more narrow question whether at this moment another Judge ought to be appointed.<lb/>
Your Lordships may recollect that a Joint Committee of the two Houses sat in the year 1910 and made a recommendation for the appointment of two additional Judges, but that was coupled with a recommendation that when the number of Judges in the ordinary course shrunk to the normal number of sixteen the vacancies should not be filled without an Address presented by both Houses. That recommendation is embodied in Section 1 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, 1910, and this Address is moved in pursuance of that section. I hope it will be found that this provision gives the control which Parliament desired to have over the appointment of the Judges, and at the same time proves to be not an embarrassing provision. The Royal Commission will throw considerable light on the whole question as to whether one additional Judge is enough, or whether in the future it may be that more Judges are wanted, or whether with certain changes the sixteen Judges of the King's Bench Division can get through the work which is normally assigned to them.<lb/>
In the last few years various Acts have been passed which have increased the work of the Judges, notably the Act setting up the Court of Criminal Appeal, and your Lordships may recollect that
<col>844</col>
Lord Coleridge was appointed an additional Judge on the occasion of the passing of that Act. I will, however, not go into that matter now. I will only say that we are at this moment satisfied that, whatever arrangements may be made in accordance with the recommendations of the Royal Commission to enable the Judges to get through their work more easily, the case has arisen for the appointment of at any rate this additional Judge. We do not wish to prejudice the question whether there ought to be more than one additional Judge. We are simply face to face with the fact that there is a congestion of business, and that the public interests seem to us to demand the appointment of an extra Judge; and if your Lordships assent to this Address the consequence will be that au extra Judge will be appointed at once. We have the great advantage to-day of the presence of my noble and learned friend the Lord Chief Justice, who is more familiar than any one with the conditions of business in the King's Bench Division, and I do not propose to occupy your Lordships further than simply to move the Motion standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02571"><i>Moved,</i> That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty representing that the number of the Puisne Judges of the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice now amounts to fifteen, and that the state of business in the said Division requires that one additional Judge should be appointed to the said Division under the first section of The Supreme Court of Judicature Act, 1910, and praying that His Majesty will be graciously pleased to appoint a new Judge of the said Division of the High Court of Justice accordingly.&#x2014;(<i>The Lord Chancellor.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02572"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor has appealed to me. I do not intend to occupy your Lordships' time at any length, but as I know the facts it is, I think, desirable that I should put your Lordships in possession of the present state of business in the King's Bench Division. I am most anxious to avoid entering upon any controversial question or saving anything of an argumentative character. The Joint Committee to which reference has been made unanimously agreed that there was congestion of business in the King's Bench Division at the end of the legal year 1910. Accordingly they recommended the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0427"/>
<col>845</col>
appointment of two additional Judges, subject in the future to a revision when a vacancy occurred. They accompanied that Report with a further recommendation to which I will refer in a moment.<lb/>
I wish, in the first place, to tell your Lordships why the urgency now exists. My task has been rendered very easy on account of the, if I may say so, singularly fair and able speech made by the Attorney-General in the House of Commons last Friday. He had obtained the information, and he used it in a way for which His Majesty's Judges are grateful, because his speech led at any rate to the nonappearance of some of the things that were said&#x2014;unjustly said&#x2014;on previous occasions. At that time&#x2014;I am speaking of Michaelmas, 1910&#x2014;the total number of cases in the King's Bench Division was 1,120, included in which were 867 actions. We enjoyed the privilege of the two extra Judges for little more than a year. The result was most satisfactory; and may I here say how glad I am to see my noble and learned friend Lord Lore burn back in your Lordships' House. Mr. Justice Grantham died at the end of November, 1911. At the commencement of the next Term the total had gone down from 1,120 to 599, and the causes from 867 to 348. It is said by people who do not know the facts that immediately a vacancy arises the Judges press for it to be filled. I am glad to say that that did not apply in this case, for on the death of Mr. Justice Grantham I communicated at once with Lord Loreburn and said that in my opinion we might be able to get on without the vacancy being filled, and with my entire approval he did not take any steps to fill that vacancy. I might incidentally mention that Mr. Justice Grantham was one of the hardest workers in the King's Bench Division, and did as much work as any Judge I could name. Practically contemporaneously with the death of Mr. Justice Grantham Mr. Justice Lawrance was taken ill. The result was that from November, 1911, down to the present time we have only had fifteen Puisne Judges in the King's Bench Division. At once I began to see that I had probably made a mistake in thinking that we need not fill the vacancy caused by the death of Mr. Justice Grantham. The work began to get into arrear, and by Easter, 1912, the number of cases was 694, included in which were 412 causes, and at the beginning of the Michael-
<col>846</col>
mas Sittings the cases standing for hearing amounted to 966, in which there were 659 actions for trial. I had meanwhile given to a Committee of the Cabinet all the information in my power. I will not say anything about their judgment. They have put down a certain Motion on the Paper. I can well understand that they may not have been able to go further. It is admitted by the Attorney-General and agreed to by the Lord Chancellor that there is now again very nearly the same congestion, and that the state of business in the King's Bench Division necessitates the appointment of an additional Judge.<lb/>
People who do not understand the facts do not hesitate to say that it is the fault of the King's Bench Judges that there is this congestion. In regard to that I wish to say a word. I desire, first, to refer to the recommendation which was made when the two additional Judges were appointed. The Committee asked that the reforms and improvements they suggested should be taken into consideration. What these Reforms were has never been stated, but as far as it is possible I believe His Majesty's Government have carried them out. The first point is the question of the Circuit system. Lord Loreburn and myself were in constant communication, and almost one of the last acts that he did as Lord Chancellor to improve the condition of matters was to pass a new Order under which fresh facilities were given to Liverpool, Manchester, Cardiff, Swansea, Exeter, Ipswich, Newcastle, Chester, and Lewes; and, in addition, the Order provided that Civil business might be taken at any town on the Autumn Circuit on the suggestion of the Lord Chief Justice with the approval of the Lord Chancellor. Except under an Act of Parliament nothing more can be done to improve the business upon the Circuits, because, as your Lordships are aware, criminal business must be taken in the county in which the crime has been committed. Therefore if you are going to do more with the Circuit system you must be prepared with an Act of Parliament for forcing people to try their cases or prisoners in counties other than that in which the matter arose. I therefore wish to point out&#x2014;and the Attorney-General said the same thing in the House of Commons on Friday night&#x2014;that except under Statute we cannot do more to get work out of the Circuit system.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0428"/>
<col>847</col>
The next point raised was that there was loss of Judicial time by the Circuit system. There is not the slightest foundation for that suggestion. It is astonishing how long an erroneous idea remains, and people quote it over and over again. In the year 1904 the late Lord Wolverhampton, then Sir Henry Fowler, who took a great interest in this matter, came to me and asked whether I could show him that there was no waste of time. I had a Return prepared and presented to Parliament for the years 1905 and 1906, from which it appeared that during those two years 395 hours more were occupied by sittings of the King's Bench Judges on Circuit than would have been the case had they been in London sitting full time. I continued that Return, and in 1908 the King's Bench Judges sat 231 hours more. I have kept up the Return since, and for the period from May 31, 1911, to August 1, 1912, the Judges sat on Circuit 477 hours more than if they had been sitting in London. This is due to the late hours to which they sit when on Circuit. It is a mistake to suggest that the Judges gain anything by going on Circuit. On the contrary, they work harder than if they remained in London. I may say that in the figures no allowance whatever is made for days occupied in travelling. The figures are the net result of the sittings of the Judges on Circuit. That Return, made up to the present time, will again be presented to Parliament and will be available for the investigations of the Royal Commission. If these sittings are taken into account, the King's Bench Judges sit more hours than any other High Court Judges. I am not saying anything against the other Judges, but am endeavouring to show that there is not the slightest ground for suggesting that the Judges of the King's Bench Division sit fewer hours by going on Circuit than would be the case if they remained in London.<lb/>
I will refer only for a moment to the suggestion that the Judges were slack in London. We never knew from whom that statement originated, but the Judges felt it very keenly. I determined that there should be no doubt on the matter, and I placed before the Committee of the Cabinet the record of the daily sittings ever since the Joint Committee reported. With the exception of myself and unless prevented by illness the Judges sit on every available working day. I do not say
<col>848</col>
that there may not be a rearrangement of business that might make the Saturday-sitting more effective, but there is no shirking of work in the way of sittings on the part of any Puisne Judge of the King's Bench Division. For myself I will not speak. All I will say is that I have a great deal of work to do, and I have designedly said that I will not sit on Saturdays, although very often a great part of Saturday is occupied in getting up papers for the Court of Criminal Appeal. I shall be content to put before anybody the actual figures for every working day of the year. I hope I have satisfied your Lordships that there is a state of matters requiring the appointment of an additional Judge.<lb/>
I will, in passing, call attention to the reforms which were suggested as possible. I do not refer to the County Courts, because there, again, there is necessity for a Statute. My noble and learned friend Lord Loreburn was anxious to pass a County Courts Bill which would have had far-reaching effect. But we cannot say we will not do the work because an Act of Parliament is going to be passed. We are obliged to ask to be sufficiently manned to be able to do the work. Then, again, the King's Bench Division is the one which is always drawn upon. If the Court of Appeal wants a Judge application is made to me to go, and I do at times go to the Court of Appeal. If the Court of Admiralty wants a Judge the King's Bench Division has to supply one. I put in a Paper before the Committee in which I stated that I estimated that the work additional to the ordinary King's Bench work&#x2014;such as work at the Central Criminal Court, Admiralty cases, Election Petitions, and so on&#x2014;would require 407 extra days, which represent the time of a Judge and a-half. As a matter of fact I was wrong in that figure, for we had to give 545 extra days of Judicial time from the King's Bench Division during the twelve months ended May, 1912. Nothing that we can do can get more work out of the King's Bench Division as matters stand at present.<lb/>
I should, of course, have been glad to see a Motion for the appointment of two Judges&#x2014;and there was a very strong body of opinion in the House of Commons in favour of that&#x2014;but I recognise the difficulty which the Government have had to face and I do not wish to press them unduly. I hope and believe that I satisfied the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0429"/>
<col>849</col>
four distinguished members of the Cabinet that two were really necessary. It may be that Parliamentary difficulties arose, and that we could not have a Motion for the appointment of two Judges. I recognise that the Government have felt that they could submit a Motion for one Judge only, and I thank them for going so far. They have coupled it with a determination&#x2014;which I, and which His Majesty's Judges of all Divisions, certainly of the King's Bench Division, welcome from every point of view&#x2014;to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into these matters. I do not know what the terms of the reference may be, and I shall not speculate in anything more than mere generalities to show the difficulties. If you are going to inquire into the Circuit system&#x2014;and by all means do so&#x2014;do not think that you are going to touch an easy subject. It is a system which has existed for 600 or 700 years, and it is the outcome of our Judicial system as it has been for centuries. It is not a mere question of the number of Judges or the manner in which the Judges do their work; it involves a fundamental principle. I express no opinion upon it. But remember that if you abolish the Circuit system you are going then to deprive people in the counties of having the Judges cone down to them. You will find it a most difficult question. I doubt whether a day of Judicial time could be saved. But, whatever is done, you must devise a system which will give as great facilities as exist now to people to have their cases tried and crimes inquired into. It is not right to tell a man who lives in Cornwall, for instance, that he must come up to Exeter to have his case tried. All I say is, Do not enter into this Inquiry thinking that it is a mere question of a. few Judges going here or there. It is not. It involves fundamental questions of principle.<lb/>
Again with regard to the Long Vacation, all I say is this. You have not got the King's Bench Division only. You have the House of Lords, you have the Court of Appeal, you have the Chancery Division and the Probate and Admiralty Division, and you have the solicitors and the Bar to deal with. I express no opinion whatever myself. I think the Judges work enough. All I say is, Do not imagine that this is a thing that can be determined with a few meetings. It raises questions of very great importance which will have to be looked at from
<col>850</col>
a national point of view in order to see what is the best way of doing the work. As I have said, I am grateful to His Majesty's Government for moving this Address. I am sure that at the impartial Inquiry which is to take place everything that I have said will be justified. It was a mistake&#x2014;quite a pardonable mistake&#x2014;for the Lord Chancellor to think that Lord Coleridge was appointed in consequence of the Court of Criminal Appeal Act. He was appointed on the recommendation of the Judges owing to the state of business in the King's Bench Division quite independent of the Court of Criminal Appeal Act and if the Lord Chancellor will study the speeches of Lord Loreburn and the then Attorney-General, Sir John Lawson Walton, he will see that I am correct.<lb/>
I thank His Majesty's Government for having given us this concession, which will be an immense relief to those who have day by day to arrange for the conduct of work in the King's Bench Division. We cannot help illness&#x2014;at present a most efficient Judge is away through illness&#x2014;and we cannot help Judges being engaged in long cases. It is quite impossible for those who have not the responsibility of arranging the work to know what the anxieties of it are. I must say I fear that this extra Judge will not enable us to keep down the arrears, but no doubt sooner or later an opportunity will occur for again raising the question. I support this Motion, and I can assure your Lordships that the state of business in the King's Bench Division is such that additional assistance is urgently needed.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02591"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel quite sure that on this occasion your Lordships will expect me to refer to the loss which this House has sustained by the death of the late Lord Peel. It is quite true that the life work for which his name will always remain in English history was finished before he came to this Rouse, but after his entry here he accepted the position of Chairman of the Royal Commission upon the Licensing Laws, a position in which he was accepted by both sides in a rather acrimonious discussion as a person of extraordinary impartiality and high character. It is especially on occasions like this when we are dealing with the particular subject of this Bill that we shall miss his advice and counsel.<lb/>
The Temperance Bill which I have the honour to ask your Lordships to read a second time this afternoon has been for a long time before the people of Scotland, and I should like to give, in the first place, some particulars showing the interest which is taken in this particular measure of temperance reform by the people of that country. As long ago as the years 1880, 1881, and 1882 resolutions on the lines of Local Veto were moved in another place by the late Sir Wilfrid Lawson, and they were supported by Scottish Members to the numbers of 38 to 3, 37 to 3, and 36 to 2 in those three years; and in 1884, following upon the success of those resolutions, a Bill was introduced dealing with the subject. Then the Peel Commission in 1899 referred to the subject, and the Minority Report of that Commission, while it did not recommend the adoption of a popular measure for England, spoke in these words of Scotland&#x2014;
<quote>"In Scotland and Wales, how-ever, the case is different. There opinion is very much more advanced on the part of temperance reform, and we are prepared to suggest that at the end of a given period a wide measure of direct popular control might be applied under proper safeguards to Scotland and to Wales."</quote>
In that year&#x2014;1899&#x2014;and on six other occasions since Bills embodying this principle have been introduced into another place, and the average vote of the Scottish Members for the measure has been 41
<col>854</col>
and against it only 7. In 1907 a Private Members' Bill was carried by a majority of 156, and in 1908 by a majority of 117.<lb/>
Practically this Bill which is now before your Lordships was carried in 1909 by a majority of 110. In the year 1910 it was reintroduced, somewhat amended, and again in 1911, in which year the Secretary for Scotland promised to make it a Government measure for this session. At the beginning of this session the Bill was read a second time by a majority of 113, and since that time it has been through the regular and usual form of Standing Committee and Report in another place. Therefore we may fairly say that this Bill has received a full measure of attention, and that the people of Scotland outside the House of Commons have had ample opportunity of forming a matured opinion upon its provisions. The Bill has been supported by a number of resolutions, and some, if not all, of the resolutions which have been sent up from the larger corporations seem to show anxiety to go even further than the provisions of the Bill. I say advisedly that this Bill as it stands has received general support in Scotland.<lb/>
I am anxious this afternoon to avoid dealing with Committee points, but there is one subject, that, of disinterested management, on which it is perhaps desirable that I should say something at this stage. I am quite sure that anybody who considers this question of disinterested management, attracted though he may be by the title, will find that enormous difficulties attend the practical working out of any scheme, and if any practical scheme is suggested it will be very interesting to see how far it avoids the difficulties which, as it seems to me, must be encountered by anybody who tries to deal with this question. Let us consider what some of these difficulties are. It is suggested, in the first place, that a new society should be formed. That new society must find a sufficient amount of money. The security for that money will not be very great. Supposing, for instance, that at the end of three years there was another vote in accordance with the provisions of this Bill and that a no-licence resolution was carried. It would then be binding on the Court to take away all these various licences, and the money which had been subscribed for the purpose of business management would be left without any opportunity of earning the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0432"/>
<col>855</col>
4 per cent. which I think is generally suggested as a proper amount. It is not as if disinterested management was to exist at the same time as other forms. It would be necessary that in these areas there should be a monopoly of disinterested management and that no other form of management should be allowed within the area, whether large or whether small. Those, lily Lords, are at any rate two of the primary objections, which perhaps we shall have an opportunity of considering again when your Lordships come to the Committee stage.<lb/>
I can imagine an objection being raised to this Bill upon the ground that it goes further in the direction of making a distinction between the law in Scotland and the law in England with regard to licensing. That is perfectly true. But it has always been accepted&#x2014;it was accepted by the Majority and Minority Reports of the Licensing Commission&#x2014;that there is a great distinction between the licensing laws in the two countries. The governing Act at this moment with regard to the licensing laws is the Consolidation Act of 1903, with which certain amendments were also incorporated. Under that Act the Licensing Court is of a popular, or in some cases semi-popular, character. In the larger towns of 7,000 population and upwards the Court consists, as it has done for something over 150 years, of provosts and bailies. The smaller towns in Scotland, except in the case of certain royal burghs, are merged in the county system. In the counties, there are various licensing dis- tricts, each of which has a Court consisting, as to one-half, of justices elected by the justices of the county, and, as to the other half, of county councillors elected by the county council, and the Appeal Court consists of an equal number of the two classes. So your Lordships will see that there is in Scotland a popular element which is quite unknown in this country, and which makes the administration of the licensing laws in Scotland far more amenable to public opinion than is the case with us in this perhaps less fortunate country.<lb/>
But there are a great many differences in the laws of the two countries. There is the closing hour. In London we have a closing hour of half-past twelve at night. In Scotland the closing hour is ten o'clock; and whereas in towns and populous places in England the closing hour is generally
<col>856</col>
eleven p.m., it is only in the country districts of England that we have the same closing hour as obtains throughout Scotland. The licensing authorities in Scotland have wider powers. They have unlimited discretion over the certificates, and they may make binding regulations with regard to the method and expediency of issuing these certificates. There are only three classes&#x2014;hotels, public-houses, and grocers' certificates&#x2014;and it is always expressly stated in these certificates that they shall continue in force until May 28 following and no longer. One of the consequences of that is expressed in an extract from the Report of the Royal Commission which I shall venture to read to your Lordships&#x2014;
<quote>"In Scotland there has never been the slightest doubt as to the state of the law. The absolute discretion of the licensing authority over all kinds of certificates, without any exception, has always been recognised. It is true that in some parts of Scotland certificates have been renewed front year to year without much question, but any one investing in a public-house ought to have done so with full knowledge of the law, which is contained on the face of the certificate in the words that the certificate is to continue in force for that one year and no longer."</quote>
And lastly, illustrating the difference between the licensing laws in the two countries, is the point that the tied house system does not generally prevail in Scotland, and that the law does not recognise anybody as having an interest in the licence except the occupier.<lb/>
Now a word with regard to this Bill and the alterations it will make. In the first place, it is no exaggeration to say that it does not introduce any new principle. Power to reduce the number of existing licences is already within the power of the licensing authority, and they have often exercised that power. What this Bill does, however, is to transfer from the Licensing Court to the voters of the district the power of reducing or abolishing entirely the licences in that area. Being merely a transfer of the power which already exists from the Court to the people of the locality this proposal can scarcely be I criticised, I think, by anybody as being of a very revolutionary character. It is true we hope that in the future this power will be more largely exercised. It is, in fact, a Referendum, and as such I venture to recommend it to Lord Balfour of Burleigh, who has spoken upon that subject in this House. It is a Referendum for special purposes to a certain confined area on three particular points.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0433"/>
<col>857</col>
The Bill provides that after June 1, 1917, there shall be power to ask for a poll on these particular questions. Until that time the powers of Licensing Courts remain exactly as before, with two exceptions, to which I shall refer in a moment. They will have full power to experiment should they desire to give licences to houses which will be under disinterested management. They will have full power also to see that the houses in future shall be, if they think it desirable, improved and made more attractive. The Bill in no way limits their powers, except that it says that no structural alterations may be ordered by the Licensing Court between now and the date when this Bill comes into operation. The Bill provides that there shall be an earlier closing hour than at the present time. It would, perhaps, be clearer to say that the opening hour is to be made later than now. Instead of public-houses opening at eight o'clock in the morning, they are in future not to open until ten a.m. The period fixed in the Bill is the one which was recommended by the Peel Commission, which also contemplated a large reduction of licences in the meantime; and the period of five years, in the opinion of His Majesty's Government, gives ample time for all concerned to make any precautions they may think necessary.<lb/>
If your Lordships will turn to the Bill, you will see that in subsection (2) of Clause 2 the questions which are to be submitted to the electors at a poll are three-fold. They will have an opportunity of voting for a no-change resolution, or for a limiting resolution, or for a no-licence resolution; and in the next subsection of the same clause your Lordships will see the conditions upon which a no-licence resolution may be passed. Three-fifths at least of the number of votes recorded must be in favour of the no-licence resolution, and not less than 30 per cent. of the eloctors in the area must have voted in favour thereof. Your Lordships will see in the first part of Clause 3 what will be the result if such a resolution is carried. In that case no certificate shall be issued by the authority, except that they may grant certificates in respect of hotels, restaurants, and so on, on condition that no drinking bar is attached to them. The limiting resolution must be carried by a majority of the votes recorded, and not less than 30 per cent. of the electors in the
<col>858</col>
area must have voted in favour of it. Your Lordships will see in subsection (2) of Clause 3 the result of carrying that resolution, which is that the Licensing Court may not grant a number which shall exceed 75 per cent. of the number of certificates in force at the time the resolution is carried. There are minor provisions with regard to the transfer of votes. It is provided in Clause 2 that if a no-licence resolution is not carried, the votes in favour of that resolution are added to those in favour of a limiting resolution; and in the same way in Clause 4 it is provided that where a further poll is taken in any area where a limiting resolution or a no-licence resolution is in force and the majority of the votes recorded is not in favour of the repeal of such resolution, such repeal shall not be carried.<lb/>
In the first part of Clause 4 your Lordships will see that three years elapse between one vote and another. In Clause 5 there are a number of supplemental provisions, one of which says that the request shall be signed by not less than one-tenth of the electors. Another says that on the day on which the poll is taken the certificated premises shall remain closed, and another is to the effect that the poll shall be by ballot. Clause 7 touches upon a point to which I have already referred&#x2014;the later hour of opening, namely, ten o'clock instead of eight; and Clause 8 deals with the question of clubs. Here your Lordships will see various important amendments to the Act of 1903. It is now thought desirable to strengthen the provisions with regard to clubs in certain directions. Your Lordships will see how that is done. Under the present system clubs must be vouched for by two justices of the peace of the county. In future it must be by two justices of the peace who for the time being are members of the Court of Appeal. In Clause 10 your Lordships will see that the question of theatres is dealt with, and in Clause 12 we apply to Scotland a provision which is already the law for this country as to closing certificated premises in case of riot. Clause 13 is a small one inserted in response to a demand from the trade. Clause 15 your Lordships will see some definitions of importance. There is, first of all, the definition of "area" and of "elector." The electors in this matter will include the Parliamentary electorate, and, in addition to them, Peers and all
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0434"/>
<col>859</col>
women married or unmarried who have a qualification, but husbands and wives do not vote for the same qualification.<lb/>
It is only right that I should explain to your Lordships that provisions of a somewhat similar character are in existence in various other countries throughout the world, and they have acted there to the complete satisfaction, so far as we can tell, of the majority of the population affected. There are already a great many areas in this country where there is no public-house. It is quite true that that has been attained, not by vote in favour of such a procedure, but because the landlord's action has deprived the population there of any opportunity of having a licence. The landlord, of course, has power to prevent a licence being asked for. In Toxteth Park, Liverpool, there are no fewer than 94,000 people who live without a public-house in their area. In London, on the estates of the Artisan Labourers' Dwellings Company, 40,000 people live without any licence on those estates. In Letchworth the prohibition was confirmed by ballot of all men and women of twenty-five years and over; there voted in favour of opening a public-house 521, and against 1,117. In Throckley, a large colliery village near Newcastle-on-Tyne, they have had prohibition for forty years. On several occasions a vote has been taken at largely attended meetings there on the subject, but the action of the colliery company has always been approved. In Canada, out of nine provinces, no less than eight have the powers for which Scotland is asking in this Bill, and that, of course, is quite apart from the number of districts in those provinces which have adopted and made use of the powers given in the 'Bill. Practically in the whole of Canada they have the powers which Scotland is asking for in this Bill.<lb/>
In the United States of America forty-two out of the forty-nine States possess these powers, and it is a curious fact that of the 87,000,000 people who make up the population of that country 41,000,000 live in no-licence areas. Amongst the Colonies and Dominions with power to adopt total prohibition there are New Zealand, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Cape Colony, and the Transvaal. I have not thought it necessary to-day to enter upon
<col>860</col>
the larger question of temperance or of the licensing laws. The evil effects of intemperance, not only to the individual but also upon our larger national life, are common facts within the knowledge of noble Lords on both sides of the House, and I have been content with commending this Bill to your Lordships this afternoon as a businesslike and simple measure designed to reduce those evils. This power has worked well in the Dominions and elsewhere, and is desired by the people of Scotland. In these circumstances I venture to hope that your Lordships will give the Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02593"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to associate myself entirely with the tribute paid by the noble Earl at the commencement of his speech to the services which the late Lord Peel rendered on the Commission over which he presided for so many years. As the noble Earl said, Lord Peel gained for himself in that difficult work a reputation for fairness and impartiality which I think will never be forgotten either in Scotland or south of the Tweed. Perhaps the noble Earl will allow me to say a word of congratulation to himself upon the accuracy with which he stated the existing law of Scotland and the clearness with which he expounded the provisions of this Bill so far as he went into them. I am sure he must have spent a certain amount of "study in getting up the existing state of matters, which is naturally not altogether familiar to him. If he will accept a compliment from me, I may tell him that I do not think, so far as the existing law is concerned, there is a single point upon which it is necessary for me to controvert anything which he stated.<lb/>
We are engaged to-day in discussing a part of a very large question. I shall not weary your Lordships by going far into the general considerations, although I do think the noble Earl somewhat underrated&#x2014;I do not say unfairly, but with the skill of a practised advocate&#x2014;some of the points of great change which this Bill undoubtedly does make in the existing state of affairs. The present system, as the noble Earl told your Lordships, is one of magisterial discretion. It is now proposed to substitute for that, at least to a large extent, for some
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0435"/>
<col>861</col>
powers remain, a popular vote&#x2014;a more or less popular vote, because the areas are so restricted and the proportion of people necessary to vote in order to bring about the change proposed is so small that I do not think it can fairly be described as to any extent a reference to the people as a whole. Let us clearly understand one point. The option which is to be exercised is only an option to prohibit retail sale. There is nothing in the nature of general prohibition in this Bill. It is not prohibition of manufacture in any area, or prohibition of what I venture to call general sale, but only a prohibition of retail sale over the bar or over the counter as the case may be.<lb/>
I agree with the noble Earl that this proposal in one form or another of giving more popular control in this matter has been for some years before the people of Scotland, and that in a general way it has received approval. Various suggestions have been made, most of which have now been given up. The noble Earl stated, quite correctly, that in some of the burghs of Scotland those who have to decide these matters are in the last resort dependent on the popular vote for their position, but there is in no sense direct election for the particular purpose to give them the powers which they have to discharge, and I do not think many people would advocate mixing up the question of the control of public-houses with our general county council elections or other matters of that kind. The idea at one time suggested of having a Board elected for this particular purpose has been, I think, now altogether abandoned. The noble Earl gave an account of the history of this question, but he did not tell us the history particularly of this Bill. It is a Private Members' Bill adopted by the Government, and I think on many of its pages it bears unmistakable traces of very mingled handiwork.<lb/>
As far as I understand, a Bill on these lines was first introduced at about the conclusion of the Parliament which ended in 1906. There were other Bills in 1908, 1909, and 1910, which met with varying fortunes in another place. As I understand it, this Bill, or a Bill practically the same as this one, was presented in 1910 in which all the Government Amendments of the previous year were adopted by the promoters and also other suggestions, some
<col>862</col>
from the Unionist side of the House, as to clubs, and that it is in that form that this Bill was ultimately adopted by the Government. I frankly confess that the noble Earl did not overstate his case in so far as the support which has been given to the general principles of this Bill by many temperance societies in Scotland and by church organisations of various kinds. At the most this Bill is an experiment. In my own opinion it is a very large experiment. I also admit that the present state of matters in Scotland urgently requires reform, and I am not at the moment prepared to suggest any method which would be more likely to receive general approval in Scotland than the power to try the experiment that is given in this Bill.<lb/>
I do not want to take a pessimistic view of the state of matters in Scotland. There is improvement, continuous improvement, in the matter of intemperance. There is, as statistics show, a considerable decrease in the consumption of spirits in spite of the increase of population. But, my Lords, the improvement is slow, and I think the possibility of quickening that rate of progress urgently demands the attention of all who have the interests of the country at heart. We should unite to diminish what Mr. Arthur Balfour described as the "great and ever present tragedy of drink." No one is fonder of his fellow-countrymen than I am or prouder of their achievements, but it is impossible for any one to mix among the people in parts of their daily life, especially at their holiday times, without a sense of profound shame at the sights which one is obliged to witness. No one of your Lordships who has seen Glasgow on a great Edinburgh holiday, or Edinburgh on a Glasgow holiday, can deny&#x2014;no candid man can deny&#x2014;that there is a real case for consideration and reform. I agree with those who say that legislation is required and that legislation can do something. But, my Lords, legislation cannot do everything. Legislation, however wise and well considered, is no substitute for what I venture to describe as moral self-control on the part of the individual. You may help by diminishing temptation. You may in that way decrease intemperance. The Legislature has admitted that it is so, because for longer than any of us can remember it has regulated this traffic. In no part of the country is the sale of strong drink absolutely unlimited and at
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0436"/>
<col>863</col>
the sweet will of the seller. It has always been the subject of regulation. If you go in for blank, pure repression and for nothing else you are not only bound to fail, but in some aspects you will intensify the very evil you desire to cure.<lb/>
We have gone very far in the diminution of the public-house; in some respects I venture to think we have gone too far. And here I touch for a moment upon differences which I know exist between the conditions in England and in Scotland. In Scotland we have disadvantages. We have to deal with the fact that the popular drink is stronger and less easy to control in its effect than the more popular beverage south of the Tweed. But we have another special difficulty in Scotland. It is that in Scotland much less than in England is the public-house the club, so to speak, of the working-class population. I do not know why it is so, but the fact remains. There is, therefore, always a greater risk in Scotland of the absence of that sensible, wise public opinion which prevails in well-managed public-houses. I do not think I am using too strong language when I say that the ordinary public-house in Scotland, at any rate in the urban districts, approaches much more nearly to what we know as the gin palace than the ordinary public-house as you know it in England. It is far too apt to become merely a place for the sale of drink and nothing else. In my opinion, it would be much better if we could raise its position and make it much more than it is at present a place for social enjoyment, for recreation, for sensible, rational pleasure, rather than the mere drinking-shop into which it too often degenerates.<lb/>
As I have said, you cannot altogether by legislation eliminate drink, but you can do away with some of its worst evils, and I agree with the noble Earl who moved the Second Reading of this Bill that the time has conic when the public opinion of Scotland in favour of legislation should be given effect to. The legislation that we have in force now recognises the manifold mischiefs which arise from the sale of drink, and it goes in the direction of preventing the undue multiplication of places for sale. I go further and say that public opinion in Scotland is ripe for further control and for the further curtailing of opportunities for the purchase of drink.
<col>864</col>
Then arises the question how it can most judiciously be done and who is to do it. In recent times we have extended the area of local self-government. Education, the Poor-law, Public Health, and a great many other things are now regulated locally by popularly-elected bodies, and people are more and more becoming accustomed to the management of their own affairs. I agree quite ungrudgingly that the time has come when my fellow-countrymen in Scotland may fairly be trusted in this matter to manage their own affairs, if only you can get them consulted fairly and fully in a proper way and after due deliberation. I go further and say that if you want to reduce public-houses this is the only way in which you can do it. It would be an altogether unfair burden to put upon the justices to ask them to do it of their own motion. They would have a difficult and delicate task in the selection of those licences which they would have to refuse. It is the people themselves who have much the most direct interest in this matter. To a large extent control is local, because the magistrates are those who have a real knowledge of the locality; but their difficulties are very great, because, after all, the immense majority of them are individuals to whom it would not matter a bit if there was not a public-house in the whole area over which they have control. That is the reason why the people who are mostly concerned should be given in this matter a certain amount of management of their own affairs.<lb/>
The question of area is a very great problem. The noble Earl passed over this matter very lightly. I venture to say that the areas which are selected in this Bill are absolutely impossible. Urban and rural divisions are wholly different, and the boundary lines of ordinary local government will not do for this purpose. I speak feelingly and from some experience. I was chairman of the Welsh Sunday Closing Commission about twenty years ago, and the one thing that was brought prominently to my mind, which I shall never forget, was the inexpediency of a great many different areas with different conditions in close contiguity and without a very strong dividing line. If you have a community in a valley with hills surrounding it you can put them all under one condition of affairs, and if their condition of affairs is different from their neighbours' it does
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0437"/>
<col>865</col>
not do so much harm; but if you divide the valley by the stream instead of by the watershed and a man can go across a bridge and find public-houses open on that side when they are shut on his side, you are putting the greatest possible premium on difficulty and disadvantage. In this matter the provisions in the Rill will not stand a moment's criticism. The areas are much too small.<lb/>
I shall not go far into this matter on the Second Heading debate, but I will give one illustration. I have had prepared a plan which gives the exact circumstances in one of the towns I know best, Alloa, which is three miles from my own home. Under this Bill Alloa will be divided into four wards, but those wards are in the main divided by the chief street which goes from end to end of the burgh, and it is the simple fact that if this Bill were to pass as it stands, and if the voters in one of the wards were to resolve to shut the public-houses, they would shut the majority of public-houses in the burgh; yet there is not one single point along the whole length of the main street at which you cannot, by simply crossing the street, go into any of the other three wards, and there you might find not only hotels but public-houses and licensed grocers' premises open without any restriction. That is a state of affairs which cannot possibly be approved of. The plan of this burgh, which I have put on the Table of your Lordships' House, is open to inspection and to criticism by those who are in favour of the particular provisions of the Bill. If this Bill is to do any good there will have to be a very large reconsideration of the areas, and there will have to be also, in my humble opinion, a reconsideration of the numbers who are required to vote. Take my case again. Number 2 ward in the burgh of Alloa has 530 voters; yet if 160&#x2014;I think that would be the proportion according to the Bill&#x2014;were to vote in favour of closing public-houses the majority of the public-houses in that burgh would be compulsorily closed. There are something like 2,000 or 2,200 voters in Alloa. How can it be said that a scheme which puts it into the power of 160 to effect this great change can be a real taking of the opinion of the people who are most concerned?<lb/>
Again, I think some of the burghs are much too small for this purpose. Take the
<col>866</col>
burgh of Culross, near my own home. It is one of the Dunfermline district of burghs, and was represented in the House of Commons by the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. In that burgh there are not 400 voters. A large coal mine has been opened in the immediate neighbourhood, but in the county, and I submit that it is absolutely impossible to separate a little area like this from the district round about it. This is not the occasion to move an Amendment. I am merely indicating the absolute absurdity of these proposals, which, mind you, have run the gauntlet of criticism in another place. They have been before Grand Committees; they have had discussion in the House itself; and they represent at the present moment the summit of wisdom in this matter of areas which is put before us. I dare say I shall have difficulty in making a thoroughly satisfactory area, but I will leave the subject now by saying that it is my intention to endeavour to substitute a more rational proposal than this when we reach the Committee stage.<lb/>
The noble Earl went somewhat fully into the question of compensation and of so-called property in licences, and with a great part of what he said I find myself in agreement. I agree with him that in the strict sense of the term there is no real vested interest and no real actual property in a licence. It is perfectly true that in every Scottish licence words are inserted stating that the licence is for one year and no longer. The difference between England and Scotland is not quite so great as the noble Earl would have us believe. I have laid stress upon it in the past&#x2014;I used it when I was responsible for the Act of 1903 &#x2014;that it is more or less an accident that this has survived in Scotland more than in England, because in one of the early Acts applying to England&#x2014;the Act of 1823, I think it was&#x2014;the words there are "for one year and no longer" also. The point really is this, that a system of renewal has grown up. The publican who obeys the law, who conducts his business on sound and proper lines, gets a renewal, and he knows that if he goes on conducting his business on those lines he will get a renewal almost as a matter of course. And I go so far as to say that it is in the public interest that he should do so, because the mere fact that he gets the renewal in this
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0438"/>
<col>867</col>
way is a premium on that sound management which you want to encourage. No other system is possible. It is all very well to say that it is not a renewal of an old licence but a new licence each year. No doubt if the present condition of affairs was to be allowed to continue those who conduct the trade at present would be satisfied with the present condition of affairs. But you are here coming down and altering the system, and you avow that you are doing it in the public interest so as to secure a reduction in the number of licences. It seems to me that when we are ourselves making this change we are bound to consider the proper rights which have grown up under the present system and to deal justly and reasonably with those interests. I say, quite frankly, that so far as I am concerned I think the period given in the Bill&#x2014;namely, five years&#x2014;is too short, and in Committee some material addition will have to be made to that period.<lb/>
The noble Earl dealt with the matter of disinterested management, and referred to two of the great difficulties in the way of introducing a system of that kind. He pointed out that there might be no security for the money invested, and that it would be necessary to give these bodies a monopoly. I am not quite so sure of the second point. I think those who are advocates for this particular system of management have been in the past prepared on many occasions to invest their money for the purpose of trying experiments even when they had not a monopoly. I do not think the fact that they may lose their money is an argument against the scheme. It might be an argument against an individual so investing his money, but if he chooses to do so there is no public interest hampered by his being allowed to make that investment. I profoundly regret that this system of disinterested management does not find a place in the Bill. I believe myself, from a somewhat lengthy study of the problem involved, that this is one of the most hopeful lines of reform, and I will tell your Lordships why. I am not going at length into the matter, because I propose to move Amendments in Committee to give effect to the policy I have indicated. Why I say it is the most hopeful line of reform is this. It would once for all practically eliminate the idea of private profit from the sale of spirituous liquors.<lb/>
<col>868</col>
I say fearlessly, from a forty years' experience of sitting on a licensing Bench, I that the greatest problem we have to consider is, not so much the number of houses, but the method and the system of management which goes on in those houses. If you could only transfer to independent and unselfish management the sale of liquor you would make a longer step towards wise and sensible and practical reform than anything else which has been done in this country for many years. There is a strong, continuous, and ever-increasing volume of opinion in favour of this reform. I am perfectly aware that it is opposed by extreme partisans on both sides. Not unnaturally it is not liked by the trade. Equally not unnaturally it is disliked by the extreme temperance man who thinks that any use of alcohol is little short of a deadly sin. But if you agree with me that you cannot altogether prohibit but that you must regulate, you will do more by regulating on wise and sound lines and giving an interest to the person who keeps the house to see that it is kept in an orderly, systematic, and proper manner than by any police regulations or any penalties which you can impose. I should like to see a body of men with no private interest, with nothing but the public interest, to serve given a free hand to conduct experiments of this kind. Under the existing system it is the object of the trader to sell as much as he can. I do not blame him. It is his livelihood. He has to do it to live. His livelihood depends on what he can make. His interest is to extend the sale of drink in every way he possibly can, and it is in that respect that his interest is the exact opposite of the interest of the community. The interest of the community is that there should be wise and reasonable facilities for-procuring drink which individuals require, but there should be no premium in any way upon, or undue temptation to, excess.<lb/>
For fear of being misunderstood I wish to say that I make no general charge against those engaged in the retail trade. I am proud to number many of them among my personal friends. I believe that in the great majority of cases they are fair in the conduct of their business. But some push the sale unduly. As restrictions are brought in so the temptation to push the sale increases. If you want a real, wise, sensible reform which is safe and
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0439"/>
<col>869</col>
practical and likely to bring good results you will endeavour to put this trade into the hands of those who have nothing to gain by unduly pushing it. On that point I shall venture to move an Amendment when we get to the Committee stage. The other matters of which the noble Earl spoke towards the close of his speech are, without exception, purely Committee points. I do not know that I have myself either thought of or received any material representation against them.<lb/>
I agree that the position of clubs is one which requires a great deal of consideration. I do not think that the strengthening of the law proposed in this Bill goes in any way against public policy. But you must remember this, that it is better in the public interest that such drinking as I venture to say there must be should be in open houses rather than in clubs. The more you drive it underground, the more you put it into places where all sorts of irregularities can crop up without supervision, the more harm you do to the cause we all have at heart. That is an additional reason why I like the idea of the public-house being under disinterested management. It is not a club, it is open to the police, any one can go into it; yet there is a strong premium on those who have the management of it to see that things are done wisely and properly. I venture to hope that reasonable time will be given to us before we are asked to take the next stage of this Bill. Two of the Amendments which I have indicated will require a certain amount of consideration. I should like to be able to give notice of them, as I think I shall be able to, in the early days of next week, and it will be in the interest of all concerned if reasonable time can be given to us for the consideration of the important questions which arc involved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02594"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like Lord Balfour I venture to congratulate the noble Earl opposite on the accuracy with which he stated the present Scottish licensing law. But I roust also say that he seemed to me rather to underrate the importance of this Bill. The noble Earl said that really the Bill is not a very large extension of the powers which already exist. He stated that at the present time, which is the fact, the
<col>870</col>
licensing authority has power to take away licences and exercises that power with a considerable amount of freedom. But the extension of that power contained in this Bill is so large as to almost create a different power. If the noble Earl maintains that the giving of power to a small proportion of the electors to absolutely prohibit all other persons from obtaining drink within the area is anything like the same thing, or even that it can be compared with the power which the licensing authority at present exercises, I am afraid I cannot agree with him. I should like to see the licensing authority which would state that no one within its area should be able to get any drink. You cannot conceal from yourselves that whether you approve of this Bill or not it introduces an entirely new principle into our legislation. This Bill, as Lord Balfour said, proceeds by mere blank repression. I confess that I retain some regard for liberty. This Bill proceeds merely by repression, and says "You must live according to Act of Parliament."<lb/>
Let me point out one or two of the unfortunate consequences which, as I think, must occur if this Bill comes into operation. In the first place, as you leave out clubs the result will be that you will increase the number of clubs. In the second place, as you propose to prohibit retail sale you will increase purchase in larger quantities from grocers. In the third place, the licensing authority themselves, if there is a possibility that all licences may be stopped, will naturally be rather less inclined to act than they are at the present time. When His Majesty's Government made up their minds to fall in with the extreme temperance party I think it was a great pity that they simply adopted the Bill of a private Member. It would have been much better if they had drafted a Bill of their own which was free from all those defects of which there are very many in this Bill. I readily admit that there is a considerable feeling in Scotland in favour of some measure of this sort, but whether Scotland is in favour of this particular Bill is altogether another matter.<lb/>
The noble Earl passed rather lightly over the various provisions of the Bill. I think he might have explained to us some of the defects which undoubtedly exist in the Bill. I did not, however, hear him
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0440"/>
<col>871</col>
mention that there were any defects in the Bill. Let me go through a few of them. In the first place, I venture to think that your machinery is faulty from the very beginning. Let us start with the means which are to be taken to obtain a requisition. Your Lordships will find it in Clause 5, subsection (1). Under that clause any elector who wishes to start a requisition has merely to go to the clerk of the local authority and demand from him a paper. We know that there are a certain number of persons greatly interested in stopping the sale of drink altogether. Now supposing all the thirty persons go and demand a paper. They are entitled to have it. Then they sally forth canvassing up and down the streets and finally return, one, we will say, with two names on his paper, another with fifteen, and another with fifty. They take these to the clerk to the local authority. In the first place, how is the clerk to the local authority to have any idea as to whether those names are genuine or not? How is he to know what were the means of solicitation adopted in order to obtain those names? The requisition is lodged, and when it has been lodged it necessarily follows that there must be a poll. There are no means in the Bill, so far as I can see, of securing any scrutiny or examination of the list, unless I am referred to subsection (4) of Clause 5, where it is provided that the Secretary for Scotland shall make rules for regulating the procedure with respect to requisitions. Further than that there is nothing in the Bill with regard to the scrutiny of these names. I venture to think it is a very bad habit into which we have at present got that matters of very great importance, which ought to be settled in the Bill by Parliament, are relegated to some Department and legislative power placed almost entirely in their hands. The next stage is the poll. Every voter is told he may only vote once. I want to know how it can be just to give two votes to a person who is in favour of no-licence. Surely every man ought to be able to make up his mind before he goes to the poll as to what he wishes, and if he does not obtain his wish he must wait until three years afterwards when another poll occurs. How can it be just to say that a man who votes for a no-licence resolution and is defeated shall then have his vote transferred to the limiting resolution? It would be just as reasonable to say that a second vote ought to be given
<col>872</col>
to the person who is in favour of limiting the licences. I cannot see how it can be fair to insert this provision in a Bill which is supposed to be fair and impartial between all.<lb/>
The next question is that of the hour of opening, The Bill provides that the hour of opening public-houses shall be changed from eight to ten o'clock in the morning. I do not see any particular objection to that change. But the noble Earl must remember that circumstances are very different in different localities, and that while there may be no particular reason for opening before ten o'clock in some places there may be every reason in others for opening at an earlier hour. I would suggest to the noble Earl that before we go into Committee on this Bill he should consider whether it might not be wise to leave this to the discretion of the licensing authority of the place, and say that the opening hour should in no case be earlier than eight or later than ten o'clock, leaving the time between to be settled by the licensing authority. Lord Balfour has spoken about the areas. I concur with him in thinking that the areas as they are at present in the Bill cannot stand. I will not go into that matter now, but it is clear that this question must be considered very carefully indeed when we reach the Committee stage. So much for the machinery of the Bill.<lb/>
Let me now say a word or two with regard to the omissions. In the first place, I think the most prominent omission is that of which Lord Balfour spoke&#x2014;disinterested management. Your Lordships will remember that in the other House of Parliament there was very great difference of opinion indeed on this question of disinterested management, and I think the Government found themselves more hardly pressed on that particular question than on any other that was considered. All the more moderate advocates of licensing reform were in favour of disinterested management, and when we come to the Committee stage no doubt we shall have a very interesting debate on that subject. There is another omission. There is no system proposed for compulsory insurance. I have this afternoon presented a petition from half of the licence-holders in Scotland in favour of compulsory insurance. I do not know at the present time what the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0441"/>
<col>873</col>
attitude of the Government is with regard to that particular question. There was great difference of opinion in the other House even among the reforming party. What the Government did was this. They opposed for different reasons every scheme that was placed before them. One objection seemed to me perfectly futile. They said it was necessary for the Government to guarantee an insurance scheme if they admitted it into the Bill. Those who proposed compulsory insurance never suggested for one moment that the Government should guarantee anything. Indeed, as the noble Earl knows, when there was a question of national insurance the Government entirely refused to guarantee anything. Another objection that was taken to the various schemes was this. The Government said that the relief proposed was not complete. No doubt the relief was not complete, but it was relief as far as it went. The whole question was whether it was better that no relief at all should be obtained or such relief as the scheme provided.<lb/>
My difficulty in understanding the attitude of the Government was increased very much by the speeches made by members of the Government on this subject. On the Second Reading Mr. Ure, the Lord Advocate, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The question of compulsory insurance has always presented itself to me in two aspects&#x2014;first, as an indispensable act of justice to a dispossessed publican and, secondly, as a method of smoothing the path to the passing of a no-licence resolution."</quote>
Yet after that Mr. Ure opposed every proposal that was put forward. Mr. McKinnon Wood, the Secretary for Scotland, although he had opposed every scheme that was submitted, stoutly maintained, on the Third Heading, that he was not an enemy to compulsory insurance. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"If the trade can prove to Parliament that compulsion is necessary, and that, if not the whole trade, a large majority are in favour of compulsory insurance, I not only would not view it with hostility, but with a very benevolent eye. It must not lie said, then, that I am hostile to the trade insuring itself."</quote>
After those statements I do not understand that the Government can be hostile to a good scheme of compulsory insurance. During the month of October very great progress has been made in this matter. I am not speaking in any way as an
<col>874</col>
advocate for the trade; I am merely stating facts that I know. This very day I presented a petition representing more than one-half of the licence-holders in Scotland in favour of a scheme of mutual insurance. I will not say anything further on that point now. It must, of course, be considered when we get into Committee.<lb/>
Then there is the question of clubs. I confess that to me the position of the Government in the matter of clubs is most extraordinary. They say that, their reason for not including clubs is that clubs have always been dealt with in a separate manner. But they must remember that this Bill introduces a new kind of legislation altogether with regard to the licensing question; and when you say that electors may make it impossible for any one to obtain drink in public-houses it is very natural that those who frequent public-houses should say, "Oh, but, why not extend this to clubs?" If you do not so extend it the result is this, that the clubman will be at perfect liberty to vote as he chooses because he knows that any vote he may give will not in any way affect him, and thereby he may be far less indisposed to close public-houses than he would be if his vote was also to apply to himself. I do not know whether it is possible to make any distinction between residential and drinking clubs; but that, again, is one of the matters we shall have to consider in Committee. I hope adequate time will be given to us to draft Amendments. That course would be as much for the benefit of the noble Earl opposite as for our benefit, as the Government will naturally wish to have ample opportunity of considering the Amendments before they are discussed.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOATS AND<lb/> DAVITS COMMITTEE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02598"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member> rose to ask His Majesty's Government whether, in respect to the composition of the Boats and Davits Committee, there is only one member who has had experience in command of a merchant ship, and, if this is so, whether he has had any experience in this capacity in large passenger vessels engaged in the Atlantic trade; also whether it is the case that the representative societies of captains and officers are entirely unrepresented on this Committee, and whether it is the intention of the President of the Board of Trade to so amend the composition as to include members of proved experience at sea in matters relating to life-saving on board ship.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02599">The noble Lord said: Since I placed my Notice on the Paper this Committee has, I believe, received a new member in the person of the captain of the "Lusitania," but with the exception of this gentleman I think there is no member of the Committee who has been in command of an Atlantic liner. As this Committee has chiefly to deal with boats and davits for Atlantic liners, I suggest to His Majesty's Government that it would be well to appoint to the Committee one or two more officers who have served on such ships.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02600"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: There are two members of this Committee with recent sea experience in command of foreign-going ships, and one of them is Captain Charles, the master of the "Lusitania." It should be pointed out that Captain Charles was appointed a little time after the Committee was originally constituted, and that he was specially relieved by the kindness of the Cunard Company from his services on the "Lusitania" for as long a time as the Committee should last. We are indebted to the Cunard Company for being so good as to put the services of Captain Charles at the disposal of His Majesty's Government. No society representing captains and officers, or shipowners or underwriters, or any other interest connected with the sea service was asked to nominate representatives to sit on this Committee. The Committee was appointed by the President of the Board of Trade, and the selection of gentlemen who were invited to serve on the Committee was made by the Board of Trade. The Board naturally attach very great weight to representations made to them by any of the associations connected with shipping, and it is their practice frequently to consult these associations as occa-
<col>876</col>
sion requires. But a Committee consisting of delegates of different associations, which may or may not have pronounced views on the subject at issue, may not always be the best arrangement for obtaining advice on a particular question. In the present case the Boats and Davits Committee is an expert body and not a collection of representatives of different interests, and the President cannot see his way, therefore, to amend the composition of the Committee in the direction the noble Lord desires.</membercontribution></p>

The Bill consists of only one clause, and its object is to amend subsection (1) of Section 1 of the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, by substituting the word "three" for the word "six." The reason for the proposed change is this. The promoters of the Act of 1911 had inserted in it the

<col>879</col>
penalty of six months' imprisonment instead of, under the old law, three months as the maximum penalty which a Court of Summary Jurisdiction could impose; but they did not discover until the Act was passed that the effect of this provision was to remove the case from the jurisdiction of the magistrates if the defendant claimed trial by jury, because, under the Summary Jurisdiction Act, where the maximum penalty exceeds three months there is a right to claim trial by jury. All that this Bill does is to return to the old procedure and enable Courts of Summary Jurisdiction to deal with these offences of cruelty, which in the majority of cases, I am glad to say, are not serious, and can be well dealt with on the spot by the justices sitting in Petty Sessions without the necessity of their going before a jury.

<title>MERCANTILE MARINE GRIEVANCES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02629"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member> rose to call the attention of His Majesty's Government to grievances affecting the commanders and officers of the mercantile marine in respect to insufficiency of pay, inferior accommodation, undue hours of labour, and other matters which are of serious moment to the mercantile marine as a whole; and to move for a Return showing the legal obligations of the owners of merchant vessels trading under the flags of Germany, France, Norway, Sweden, Italy, Russia, Denmark, Austria-Hungary, Netherlands, Greece, and Belgium towards their captains, officers, and seamen with regard to the following:&#x2014;Old age pensions, pensions to widows and orphans, accident compensa-
<col>880</col>
tion, Sunday labour, daily hours of labour at sea and in port, payment for work performed in excess of fixed hours of labour, medical treatment, accommodation and passages of distressed seamen; also including in such a Return the regulations of these different countries for the preservation of discipline on board their merchant ships.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02630">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the grievances to which I am calling your attention are not new ones. They have for a long time furnished the subject of constant action and representation on the part of the Imperial Merchant Service Guild, and from what I can gather even many shipowners in this country admit that in the way of pay and other conditions their captains and officers are not treated as they should be. As to the position assumed by the Board of Trade, their usual contention is that they have no power to intervene in this, that, or the other subject. Though I am not always disposed to accept such an argument, still if it is really the case that they have no powers of this kind then it is time that they applied to Parliament to obtain such powers. The Board of Trade and other Government Departments are ready enough to intervene in all such matters as those I am dealing with where they concern other industries; but where it is the interests of our mercantile marine and our merchant seafarers which are at stake they will not intervene, neither will they seek the powers that may be necessary to enable them to do so. In other occupations the Government and our Government Departments have gone to quite extraordinary lengths in regulating pay and improving the material conditions of those labouring in great industries ashore. Then why should those employed in our most important industry be excepted?</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02631">That captains and officers on our merchant ships suffer through the miserable nature of their pay is unquestionable. As a well-known shipowner stated publicly at Cardiff not long ago&#x2014;
<quote>"It has been a great grievance that the officers in our mercantile marine service have been so inadequately paid considering the great responsibility that is attached to masters and the responsible officers and after the loyalty that they have displayed in troublous times. Their efficient service in all parts of the world in the past makes it, I think, only fitting that such loyalty and devotion should be recognised by a more adequate wage."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0445"/>
<col>881</col>
Sir Walter Runciman, a large shipowner, in a recent speech on the mercantile marine at the Autumn Conference of the Chambers of Commerce, made the following statement&#x2014;
<quote>"He wanted to say to parents that he did not know a an occupation which gave such a splendid outlet to their boys as sea-service. The boys would be well accommodated, well fed, and well trained in proper kindly discipline, and they would have robust health. At the end of seven years they could rely upon occupying the position of captain."</quote>
It was a matter of no surprise to me that Mr. Moore, the Secretary of the Imperial Merchant Service Guild, promptly denied the truth of such extraordinary assertions. That youngsters after seven years' experience at sea would find themselves in command of merchant vessels was characterised by Mr. Moore as quite too preposterous for the wildest imagination, and he truly stated that ally man getting a command after fifteen years service at sea might consider himself very fortunate. Mr. Moore went on to show how a miner could, if he chose, in a five-days or five-and-a-half-days week, comprising not much more than say forty hours work altogether, with ease earn as much as or more than the chief officer of a large steamer (such as those owned by Sir Walter Runciman) holding a master's certificate, who has spent long years at sea, who has to put in a seven-days week, who is on duty fifteen hours per day, whose sleep is obtained in short snatches of from three to four hours, and who, when in port on the Sabbath day is expected to and does work just as on any other day of the week. In an official statement issued by the shipowners it is stated that "the maritime wage is well understood to cover a seven-days week."</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02632">Personally, my Lords, I am not at all in favour of the State interfering in any sort of way between employer and employee as regards the fixing of wages, but, as the Government have thought otherwise and have intervened in the matter with regard to fixing a minimum wage for miners, then I do not see logically how you can avoid extending the principle to others, and especially to those who deserve it far more and whose responsibilities are far greater&#x2014;namely, to the captains and officers of our merchant service. The Government have regulated hours of labour in nearly
<col>882</col>
all our great industries, except the most important one; they have been most zealous in this way in the interests of philanthropy. It is only very recently that they devoted an immense amount of trouble and time to the passing of the Shop Hours Act, but they have never stopped to think for a moment that the officers of our merchant ships have far more serious grievances in this way than shop assistants ever had. As to accommodation for officers and crew on board ship, it is about the last thing thought of in the construction of a ship. No regard whatever is paid to hygienic principles. All that is done is that the spaces provided should be such as can be certified as sufficient under the Act by the Board of Trade ship surveyor, who has no knowledge whatever of hygiene. The accommodation for officers is frequently placed in positions not only far from congenial but insanitary and unhealthy, whilst the space provided is, as my noble friend Lord Ellenborough said on a former occasion, just about sufficient to bury him in. We find that the cubic space allowed to an officer or seaman is 72 cubic feet; but if a mall seeks shelter in a common lodginghouse ashore he must have not less than 400 cubic feet.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02633">The scandalous nature of this accommodation on board ship has been the subject of continual comment on the part of medical officers at certain of our large seaports. For instance, a few months ago the Port Sanitary Committee at Newport, Mon., adopted a resolution to the effect that&#x2014;
<quote>"They were strongly of opinion that it was full time that something was done with a view to raising the standard of hygiene at sea, and that the conditions of living, storing of food, nuisance arising from foul contaminations, damp, dark, dirty and ill-ventilated living spaces, foul sanitary arrangements, lack of opportunities for personal ablutions, faulty designs and other matters, must render the merchant service most unattractive to self-respecting individuals who can earn a living ashore, and call for early Government inquiry."</quote>
Dr. Herbert Williams, Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London, says that until the Legislature takes some more practical interest in the welfare of seamen pulmonary tuberculosis will continue to be a cause of much mortality amongst this class of men.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02634">Dealing with Sunday labour, it is a national disgrace that the officers of our
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0446"/>
<col>883</col>
merchant ships should be compelled to work on their ships when lying in ports both at home and abroad on the Sabbath-day. We pride ourselves on our humanitarian instincts, but, in spite of this, still allow our officers to be treated in this way, when foreign maritime countries have long ago put a stop to it. I will read two short extracts from a letter just received from the officer of a vessel now abroad. He had evidently seen a letter in the papers from a shipowner in which he compared the holidays of ships officers at sea with the holidays of shore staffs. The officer writes&#x2014;
<quote>"We were rather amused at a paragraph comparing ships officers' holidays with the holidays of the 'office' and 'shore stalls', and as a comparison we would like to quote our own ease&#x2026; We have been in continuous service since &#x2026; [nearly three years ago], not having had a Christmas Day free; and as for Sundays and other holidays, well we have got into the habit of working on Sundays for the slip and if we got a Sunday free we would not know what to do on that day."</quote>
Later on in his letter he says&#x2014;
<quote>"I venture to say that there are not many members of an office or shore staff who could say that they have been at work for nearly three years without even a Sunday off."</quote>
I will not go into details, but you will find that France, Germany, Russia, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and, I think, others will under no circumstances allow their merchant officers to be worked when their ships are in port on Sunday. I exempt sudden stress of wind or where the safety of the ship is concerned. Here is a matter where I suppose the Board of Trade will tell us that they have no powers to act, but I insist that it is their duty to apply for such powers without any further delay.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02635">That these and other grievances are of national moment in seriously affecting the position of our merchant service is quite clear from certain statistics which have been placed in my hands by the Imperial Merchant Service Guild. We are always assured by those representing the Board of Trade that the official statistics are a clear indication that matters are improving in this respect. It is the old story of working statistics in order to show that the Marine Department of the Board of Trade are right in their position of inaction, just the same as was done in connection with the light, load line. In the course of the "Titanic" debate the President of
<col>884</col>
the Board of Trade stated that he found that the proportion of British sailors had very largely increased, and that all foreign sailors had lamely diminished in the mercantile marine. Mr. Leslie Scott, the spokesman for the shipowners, said in the course of the debate that&#x2014;
<quote>"From 1893 to 1903 there had been an increase in the number of foreign sailors in our ships from 29,000 to 40,000. From 1903 to 1911 that balance had been largely diminished, and there were today 30,000 more British sailors than in 1909, and 10,000 foreigners had been replaced by 10,000 British sailors."</quote>
"That," Mr. Scott said, "was all very much to the good." Mr. Scott's figures would be very much to the good were it not for other figures which are obtainable from the Quinquennial Return which is issued he the Registrar-General of Seamen, and which is a much clearer, more comprehensive, and more reliable document than those comprised within the Tables relating to Merchant Shipping which are issued annually.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02636">From the last Quinquennial Return, issued seven days ago, we find that, very properly, the manning of the mercantile marine is divided into different departments. In this matter we are not concerned so much with departments such as the stewards' department and others. We, I think, need only confine ourselves to what the Registrar-General terms the "sailors' department," and in this department between the years 1891 and 1911 there is a clear reduction of British seamen to the extent of no fewer than 16,221. This statement, I think your Lordships will agree, is very startling, and one which should completely destroy our confidence in the satisfaction expressed by the Board of Trade and the shipowners. Some of your Lordships may not be aware that under the Merchant Shipping Act every person who is on the ship's articles is termed a "seaman"&#x2014;that is, with the exception of the captain and any apprentices who may be on board. Stewardesses, stewards, hairdressers, barbers, bar-tenders, and all such attendants on passengers are seamen by Act of Parliament. This is, of course, very nice and convenient for all those people who desire to throw dust in the eyes of the nation by making out that British sailors in the mercantile marine are on the increase instead of decreasing. With the building of the enormous passenger liners
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0447"/>
<col>885</col>
of the present day there has been all enormous increase in all these, if I may so call them, domestic departments, but there has not been such increase as regards the seamen. Take, for instance, the "Titanic," the largest vessel then afloat. The seamen on board her numbered fifty-eight; the firemen numbered 300; and the other 494 were all composed of what I have termed "seamen by Act of Parliament."</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02637">Now, my Lords, we are continuing to build fresh ships for the Royal Navy, but, even taking the ships that we have at present, I venture to say that if all of them had to be put in commission it would be impossible to efficiently man them or half man them. Yet while we are providing new ships, a corresponding increase in the <i>personnel</i> of the Navy has not taken place. In the old days the Royal Navy had to depend for her reserves upon the merchant navy, and though times have greatly altered it is the same to-day. The only possible reserve for the Royal Navy is to be found in the seamen of the merchant service, and I venture to point out to your Lordships that should the Navy ever have to fall back on this reserve, as it is certain to do should war arise, then the seamen by Act of Parliament., such as stewards, hairdressers and cooks, are not those who would be required on the battleships. The men required would be the seamen and the stokers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02638">It has been an opinion generally expressed in this House that the Return which was issued four-and-a-half years ago showing the methods of other maritime countries was one of a very valuable and enlightening character, showing, as it did, that British shipowners had in reality much more latitude in dealing with their masters, officers, and men than is allowed to foreign shipowners by their respective Governments. I earnestly hope that such a Return will once again be agreed to, as, beyond a doubt, great developments and changes have taken place in the meantime. Preparation of the Return presents no real difficulties, as all the desired information can readily be obtained by our representatives in the different countries. If your Lordships agree to the Motion, I think I must in fairness ask that the Return should be issued with very much more expedition than the last one. That Return was agreed to by your Lordships on May 28, 1906, and was not ordered to be printed until February
<col>886</col>
17, 1908. There could be no possible excuse for such undue delay, and I hope that the new Return, if agreed to, will be issued with far greater promptitude. In conclusion, let me once again urge upon your Lordships how serious these grievances are as regards the welfare of the merchant service and how they imperatively need urgent and effective attention. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02639"><i>Moved,</i> That there be laid before the House a Return showing the legal obligations of the owners of merchant vessels trading under the flags of Germany, France, Norway, Sweden, Italy, Russia, Denmark, Austria-Hungary, Netherlands, Greece, and Belgium towards their captains, officers, and seamen with regard to the following:&#x2014;Old age pensions, pensions to widows and orphans, accident compensation, Sunday labour, daily hours of labour at sea and in port, payment for work performed in excess of fixed hours of labour, medical treatment, accommodation and passages of distressed seamen; also including in such a Return the regulations of these different countries for the preservation of discipline on boars their merchant ships.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Muskerry.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02640"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, His Majesty's Government will certainly place no difficulty m the way of the Return for which the noble Lord has moved, and I will certainly see that steps are taken to bring to the notice of the Department concerned the complaint of the noble Lord as to the delay which took place before the last Return was printed and presented to Parliament. I hope that, so far, he will be satisfied with the reply of His Majesty's Government. With regard to his general discussion of the conditions of the mercantile marine, I hope it is unnecessary for me to assure the noble Lord that His Majesty's Government are in no way blind either to the services which are rendered by the officers and men of that service, or to the dangers which they undoubtedly run. Indeed, in this year no one can forget how great those dangers are. But I think the officers may be congratulated very warmly on having so consistent a champion as the noble Lord opposite, who has brought before us to-day, not for the first time, the various complaints which they have to make.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0448"/>
<col>887</col>
The noble Lord specially referred to the question of the pay of the commanders and officers of the mercantile marine. I am not quite sure that when on previous occasions His Majesty's Government have introduced legislation dealing with pay in other occupations it has always met with the unanimous approval of this House. I am not inclined to rely upon the opposition which such a measure would certainly invoke in this House, but I think it would be quite impossible for His Majesty's Government to try to deal by legislation with the pay of the officers of the mercantile marine. If it was necessary I think it would be easy enough to draw a very clear distinction between those classes of labour to which the noble Lord referred and the mercantile marine. Those to which he referred were concerned with a trade which is of vital importance to the country, and without which the life of the country could hardly be carried on. It is not possible to say that in the same way of the service of which the noble Lord specially spoke this afternoon.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02642"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord will have an opportunity of enforcing his argument if he wishes to later in this discussion. As Lord Musketry knows, it has been until now the policy of Parliament to allow this question of the wages paid, not only to officers but to seamen generally, in the mercantile marine to be left to the shipowners to settle with the persons whom they themselves employ. The Board of Trade understand that quite lately the Imperial Merchant Service Guild has approached the shipowners with a view of securing increased rates of pay, and that their representations have met with a certain measure of success. There is, however, no official information on this matter within the knowledge of the Board of Trade, although I understand that what I have stated is the fact. Certainly representations have been made lately to the Board of Trade with regard to the accommodation provided for officers on certain vessels, and the Board are obtaining reports of these cases from their officers and they will do their best to consider them. But meanwhile the noble Lord must remember that, provided the minimum requirements of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906, are complied with,
<col>888</col>
the Board of Trade have no power to interfere.<lb/>
The noble Lord specially referred to one other question&#x2014;hours of labour. One of the sections&#x2014;Section 92&#x2014;of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, does deal with that question, not directly as to the number of hours of labour, but it deals with the number of officers who should be carried on a merchant vessel, and therefore that indirectly touches on the amount of labour which has to be performed by each of the officers on hoard the ship. As a matter of fact, the minimum requirements of that Act are almost invariably exceeded to a considerable extent by shipowners. It appears from some statistics compiled by the Board of Trade that in the year 1911, with one exception, every foreign-going ship of 4,000 tons or upwards carried three or more mates, as also did two-thirds of the vessels between 2,000 and 4,000 tons. The question of amending Section 92 of the Act of 1894 so as to increase the statutory minimum of certificated officers is at present under the consideration of the Board of Trade. I regret that I am unable to add more than that on the present occasion. If, however, the noble Lord will allow me to make a suggestion, it would be that when this Return has been secured and printed he should, if he desires to do so, raise once more the question in your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02643"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my only object in making the very mild, and, I hope, friendly interruption in the noble Earl's speech was to give him an opportunity of withdrawing or qualifying a remark which he made, I think, without sufficient thought. I mean when he said that the national life depended more on the coal-mining industry than on our shipping industry. Surely the noble Earl, if he had thought for a moment, would have recollected that a very large proportion not only of our daily bread, of our sustenance, is brought over-seas, but also the raw material with which we manufacture goods and pay for our food. Therefore it is not open to argument that any other industry is more important to the national life than the shipping industry. I did not think that a remark of that kind, as it has not been qualified, ought to pass unchallenged in this House, and that is why I have made these remarks.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02644"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution></membercontribution><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with a great deal of what has fallen from my noble friend Lord Muskerry, but I cannot concur in his idea that the establishment of a minimum wage would improve matters. It has been rather a failure in dealing with the miners, and I think if you attempted to introduce it into the mercantile marine you would bring about endless trouble and endless strife. The question of Sunday labour has been referred to. Sunday labour is sometimes necessary. It should not be absolutely forbidden but discouraged. The best way to discourage it would be to make extra pay compulsory at a fixed sum per hour, varying in accordance with the rate of wages for each seaman. Contracting out of this should be illegal. There are at least two classes of Sunday labour, one connected with the ship and the other with loading and discharging cargo. There are a number of small repairs and adjustments to engines which cannot be carried out while they are moving. They very often only require three or four men to attend to them. If neglected, the ship would break down, and I think that it would be too hard in face of competition to expect an owner of a ship to delay her for twenty-four hours in order to give a Sunday holiday to three or four men only. All your Lordships who own motor-cars must be aware of the constant touching up and attention that all classes of engines require. I think that it would be sufficient if this Sunday work was discouraged by giving extra pay to the men who either do it themselves or who superintend work done by mechanics hired locally.<lb/>
With reference to handling cargo, I am glad that Lord Muskerry has put this question as regards foreign countries as it is well to know what restrictions on Sunday labour our trade rivals have submitted to. Some lines of steamers would be seriously affected by restrictions, whereas others would scarcely feel them. very careful inquiries ought to be made before making any legal enactment that would have the effect of stopping Sunday labour altogether, whereas the grant of extra pay per hour would do much to check it without being a very serious annoyance to owners. As, however, the captain of a ship has much to do with the question of Sunday labour, I should except him from the grant of extra pay for fear of his being accused of being unduly influenced whenever he ordered
<col>890</col>
Sunday labour to be undertaken. I would, as I have said, save him from the chance of being wrongly accused in this way by making him the one exception to the people who should receive extra pay for Sunday work.<lb/>
Complaints are constantly being made about the number of hours that railway signalmen have to work, but little notice is taken of the number of hours that a watch-keeping officer has to be on duty. When ships are run with two watchkeeping officers, one of whom has to be constantly on the bridge, it means a twelve-hours day to begin with. As lie is never below more than four hours at a time, he never gets a. real square sleep, but only snatches of three and a-half hours at a time. But on a long voyage he really has a very fair time of it in comparison with what he has to put up with on a coasting trip. In addition to keeping his watch at sea he has to be on deck both when entering and leaving harbour, and to superintend loading and unloading whether by day or by night. When the loading is completed he must remain on deck while the ship is leaving harbour, and then go on the bridge without the previous rest to which human nature is entitled. There is no limit to the number of hours that an officer may have been continuously at work. I do not complain of this when there is danger or stress of weather, hut I do think that the officers of the mercantile marine have a right to complain when kept at work in this manner as a matter of ordinary routine and in the absence of exceptional circumstances. I think that an Act of Parliament ought to be passed making it necessary to carry three watchkeeping officers in ships above a certain size, and that in the long run owners would find it beneficial, and that they would not he losers in consequence.<lb/>
Then as to the question of the housing of seamen. Whenever experienced travellers make arrangements for sea voyages of some days they look at the carefully drawn plans, which show the sizes and situation of cabins, saloons, sanitary arrangements, &amp;c., and then they have a pretty fair notion as to what degree of comfort they are likely to get for their money and select cabins according to the size of their purse. On a ship being designed, similar drawings of the housing and sanitation provided for crew and officers should be deposited at the Board
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0450"/>
<col>891</col>
of Trade, and when approved of framed, glazed, and permanently hung in a public place just as is done to certain documents in passenger steamers. At present, as far as I am able to ascertain, the Board of Trade do not intervene until the vessel is built. When a ship has already been completed it would cost the owners a great deal of money to make alterations in accordance with the laws of hygiene which at an earlier period would not have been expensive. The situation, ventilation, and proximity to steam winches and other fittings have a great deal to do with the comfort of a living room on board ship. The amount of space of 72 cubic feet, which, as Lord Muskerry informed the House, is now allowed, is far too small for a man to do his sleeping and his eating for the greater part of his life. In 1906, when the last Merchant Shipping Act was before your Lordships' House, I tried to get the space increased, but failed. Another reason why I think the officers of the mercantile marine have a claim upon Parliament is this. They as a body are rightly averse to striking. The men can contrive to get what they want by striking. The mercantile marine officers, however, know that it would be injurious to the country if they did the same, and therefore I think they have a special claim to rely upon Parliament to improve their condition of life.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02645"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think my noble friend who has made this Motion will be satisfied at having obtained the promise of His Majesty's Government to give him this Return and to give it to him without the undue delay which characterised the publication of the Return on the last occasion. There was one observation in my noble friend's speech with which I was much struck, and which I was sorry the noble Earl opposite did not deal with. It has to do with the statistics of the progress of the merchant service. We were all gratified the other day to read in the newspapers, upon the authority of the President of the Board of Trade, that the numbers of British seamen in the merchant service had increased over the last ten years, and the newspapers wrote in their ordinary way to say how glad they were that the pessimism of some people had turned out to be wrong and that as a matter of fact we had improved our position very much
<col>892</col>
in this respect. My noble friend Lord Muskerry has made a very severe criticism of those figures, because he pointed out that a large number of the so-called "seamen" in those statistics are not seamen at all, but are other residents in the ship who have nothing to do with what may be called the maritime part of the vessel. I do not for a moment desire to say that their interests ought not to be studied in any discussion or determination as respects the accommodation, for example, in the marine service. They are entitled, of course, to consideration like anybody else.<lb/>
But when the country is asked to be reassured as to the condition of the merchant service and as to its progress, what is meant, of course, is the maritime part of the merchant service. What we are interested in is to know whether the population of our islands engaged in the calling of the sea is diminishing or in-increasing, and the effect left by the observations of the President of the Board of Trade in another place was that it was increasing, whereas my noble friend shows that it was diminishing. That is a very important matter, and ought not to be lost sight of. I am quite sure that the President of the Board of Trade did not intend for a moment to deceive the country, but this misconception has got abroad. I am very sorry that it should be so. I should have been much happier if the President of the Board of Trade had turned out to be not merely literally but in spirit right. It is, however, much better that we should face the facts, and if it be true that the number of those engaged in the marine service is really diminishing that is a serious matter which, in my humble judgment, ought not to escape the attention of the Board of Trade and of His Majesty's Government.<lb/>
How does that bear upon the present discussion? My noble friend behind me (Lord Muskerry) who understands this subject, I need not say, far better than I do, and my noble friend who has just sat down have both pointed out that the accommodation, for example, for the officers of the merchant service is not at all luxurious. Indeed, it is very shocking from the point of view of those who study housing on land to know what people have to put up with in the matter of housing at sea. We would he very glad to see that
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0451"/>
<col>893</col>
state of things improved, because unless we can improve the conditions of the merchant service we cannot hope that the tendency to which I have called attention of diminishing numbers will be arrested. If we mean that there should be a change in this tendency and that instead of a diminishing service it should be an increasing service, we must hope to improve the conditions of the service. Now the question I should like to put to the noble Earl and through him to the Board of Trade is, Are they satisfied that those conditions ought not further to be improved? What, of course, they have to consider in arriving at a determination on that subject is this&#x2014;whether if they put a greater burden upon shipowners they would do an injury to the trade; whether the trade can bear the increased expenses which better accommodation would involve. If it could not bear it, the thing falls to the ground.<lb/>
I am not prepared, certainly at this moment, to advocate a change which would injure the shipping trade of this country. But if it be true, and it may be true, that improvements in the condition both of officers and men of the merchant service could be brought about without throwing an undue burden on shipowners And those engaged in the trade, then I say such changes should occupy the serious attention of His Majesty's Government. I do not want to give the impression to the Government that reckless changes ought to be made without reference to the conditions of the service or to the burden which it already has to bear. All I say is this, that I do not think we can be better employed than in improving, so far as they may be improved safely, the conditions under which the merchant service is carried on, because upon the welfare of the merchant service and upon its progress depends the supply of the maritime population of these islands, and upon the supply of that maritime population must to a large extent depend the trade of our country and the safety of it in time of war.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02646"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess who has just sat down has drawn attention to one or two points in the speech of the noble Lord who has made this Motion, in the first place with
<col>894</col>
reference to an observation made in. another place by my right hon. friend the President of the Board of Trade with regard to the increasing number of British seamen. On that point it seems to me that the subject rather divides itself into two parts. Lord Muskeriy stated that, as matters now were, those who were described in the Return as sailors were not sailors in the strict sense in which we understand the word, but included persons of all kinds, many of them employed in domestic capacities on board ship. The noble Lord instanced the case of a great passenger liner. It is, of course, quite true that there are on board ships of that kind a great number of persons on the strength of the ship who are in no sense sailors, and so far as they are included in any Return enumerating the number of sailors in the mercantile marine the Return is hound to that extent to mislead the public. That we all admit.<lb/>
But there is also a further point in connection with this matter&#x2014;namely, that the whole character of service at sea has as years have passed somewhat changed. That observation could be applied no less to the Royal Navy than to the mercantile marine. In former days a sailor was assumed to be a man on the strength of a ship whose life was spend in going aloft and in the ordinary routine of seamanship, in many cases in a sailing ship and in others in a steamer, which depended also to some extent upon masts and sails. But now, as we know&#x2014;and this applies equally to the Royal Navy&#x2014;a very large proportion of a ship's complement are artificers and skilled men in various branches, electricians, and others, rather than seamen as we understand the term, and the fact must apply also to the mercantile marine, that in that sense, too, a very large proportion of the men employed, who would properly be described as forming part of the ship's company, are not sailors in the old-fashioned sense. Therefore it is not quite fair to state, although the fact may have a serious bearing on the consideration which the noble Lord mentioned&#x2014;namely, that our mercantile marine must be regarded as in some sense the reserve of our Royal Navy&#x2014;it is not quite fair to regard every man who is not a sailor in the conventional sense of the word as not being available for that purpose, or as not being properly included in a Return such as that which my right
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0452"/>
<col>895</col>
hon. friend the President of the Board of Trade made.<lb/>
As regards the second point to which the noble Marquess alluded, that of accommodation, I am quite certain that the President of the Board of Trade, when he becomes acquainted with the observations which were made by the noble Lord opposite and by the noble Marquess, will desire to give his close attention to this question. It is quite true that to an outsider the figures of cubic space and similar matters mentioned by the noble Lord are somewhat startling in comparison with those with which we are used to deal on land. I think that my noble friend behind me (Earl Beauchamp) stated the fact that the Board of Trade are now engaged in obtaining reports with regard to the accommodation provided for officers of the mercantile marine, and that when they receive these reports they will give close attention to them. As a matter of fact, however, unless further legislation can be introduced the Board are bound, as I have no doubt the noble Lord knows perfectly well, by the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1906, which provide a certain minimum space, and if that minimum space is provided the Board of Trade have no further <i>locus standi</i> and no means of interfering. I do not know whether the noble Lord considers that the <i>minima</i> provided in that Act are too low, but he will remember that the Board of Trade are absolutely bound by that Act and cannot exceed its provisions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02647"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member><membercontribution>: That is exactly my point.

<title>IMPORTATION OF IRISH CATTLE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02650"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask His Majesty's Government in how many counties in England the importation of cattle from Ireland is prohibited, and from which counties the Minister for Agriculture has received approval of his relaxation of the restrictions in regard to the importation of Irish cattle into England; and whether considering the admitted increase of the foot-and-mouth disease in Ireland and the almost unanimous refusal of the local authorities to admit Irish cattle within their county areas the Minister of Agriculture will now consider the advisability of revoking the objectionable Order and thereby relieve England from the considerable risk involved in the transit of cattle from Ireland without any advantage and against the general wish of those responsible for local government in the different counties of England.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02651"><sup>*</sup><member>THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, thirty-three administrative counties out of fifty-one have prohibited the importation of cattle from Ireland; the remaining eighteen have made no regulations to that effect. The noble Lord asks from which counties my right hon. friend has received approval of his relaxation. If by that he means official approval from the local authorities concerned, I do not know that he has received any. On the other hand, I think you may take it that the eighteen administrative counties who have not applied these restrictions have at any rate expressed a tacit approval of the relaxation. As far as unofficial approval is concerned, I can assure the noble Lord that my right hon. friend is overwhelmed with masses of it, which come in by every post.<lb/>
As to the latter part of the noble Lord's Question, I would like to point out that what he calls the almost unanimous refusal of these local authorities is, in view of the figures I have given, hardly an accurate statement of the case. I can only say, with regard to that, that we are not prepared to revoke the Order, because in our opinion nothing has occurred to alter materially the situation since the time when we first decided to put the Order into force. This whole question has, I think, been prejudiced to an undue degree by somewhat exaggerated assertions on both sides. This is essentially not a case where you can
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0453"/>
<col>897</col>
marshal an overwhelming array of facts on one side or on the other. It is a case where you have to proceed with the greatest caution, where you have to weigh the risk with the utmost care, and on the balance of possibilities and of probabilities you have to decide your course. Therefore any action taken does require the sanest and coolest judgment, which is not always applied in this particular case.<lb/>
When one is considering what measures can be taken one cannot leave out of sight the magnitude of the interests that are at stake. I do not want to refer especially to the case of Irish farmers, who are suffering very materially from this prohibition, because I am responsible primarily for the interests of British farmers, but I think that is an aspect of the case which this House at any rate cannot afford to disregard. When you consider the position from this side of the Channel, the figures of the export of store cattle are alone sufficient to show how big the interests are. Out of the 950,000 store cattle that were exposed for sale in Great Britain last year no fewer than 540,000 of those cattle were of Irish origin.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02652"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: In Great Britain?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02653"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: Yes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02654"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: My Question had reference to England only.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02655"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I have not the figures for England only, but the majority of these cattle come to England. Not only is that a very large importation, but this is the time of year when the importation is at its greatest. Yet during the months of September, October, and November, when in a normal year 200,000 store cattle would come into this country, it will probably be found this year that by the end of November the number will not be more than 4,000 or 5,000; at the present moment it is something like 2,000. That is a ridiculously small number, and that in a year, too, when in a great many parts of the country there is an exceptional amount of feed and therefore a great demand for store cattle. That shows sufficiently what the size of this trade is and the seriousness of the interests involved.<lb/>
Then you conic to a question which is more important still&#x2014;the question of the risk. Far be it from me to try and make out that there is no risk. You cannot say
<col>898</col>
there is no risk. The great problem is to try and ascertain what the degree of risk is, because this is essentially a question in which the degree of the risk is everything. There is one important fact with regard to that&#x2014;namely, that from July 8 (the day on which we began to remove the restrictions against Irish cattle and allowed stock to come into this country) up to the date when the most recent figures are available 440,000 head of live stock have come to this country and there has not been one single case of foot-and-mouth disease among them, though they were all subjected to the most careful veterinary examination. Then you have to consider the nature of the safeguards which are applied. These animals have to be quarantined for fourteen days at the place of landing, and removed therefrom by licence of an inspector of the Board of Agriculture to premises in which they have to be isolated for twenty-one days. Further, all animals have to be examined in Ireland before shipment, store cattle have to be accompanied by a declaration of their place of origin, and there is a special examination of the mouth of each beast, so that you have what in our opinion are restrictions and safeguards sufficient to remove, I will not say the whole of the risk, but a very great amount of the risk.<lb/>
In view of the facts I have quoted it is our opinion&#x2014;and it is an opinion that we have arrived at after most carefully weighing all possible circumstances and all probabilities, and which I would like to say we have arrived at with no pressure put upon us by any outside body whatever&#x2014;that the risk, such as it is, is not sufficient to justify the entire exclusion of Irish store stock. We have done what we always do in cases of outbreaks of disease. When the severity of the outbreak begins to decrease or when it becomes more strictly localised we begin to relax gradually the restrictions. That is what has happened in the present case, and we hope to be able to continue to relax them. There are some local authorities which disapprove of the course we have taken and have not availed themselves of the relaxation, but I do say most emphatically that it is our opinion that there is not sufficient risk to justify us in refusing to let those counties have Irish store stock which want to have them and testify to that by not putting in force these prohibitive restrictions.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE NATIONAL INSURANCE ACT.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02656"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member> rose to call attention to the National Insurance Act and the impossibility of workers understanding the unlimited amount of regulations and literature issued by the Insurance Commissioners from time to time to modify or explain the complicated provisions of the Act; and to ask whether it is the intention of the Government to introduce an amending Bill during the present session of Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02657">The noble Lord said: My Lords, in the summer we had several what the noble and learned viscount on the Woolsack called useful conversations with regard to this Act, and we were told that there were colossal difficulties in the way. I want to know what has been done to meet these great difficulties. First, with regard to medical benefits, your Lordships passed a resolution that it was absolutely necessary that the Government should come to an agreement with the medical profession in order that the Act might be carried out. A similar resolution was also adopted by the House of Commons. Three months elapsed and nothing was done. Now the Chancellor of the Exchequer is reported to have said that he always knew that the terms offered in the Act were insufficient; also that it is absurd to ask labouring men in rural districts to send prescriptions to a chemist, and that the doctor ought to be allowed to dispense his own medicine. I made exactly the same suggestion last July, but I did not receive very much sympathy from the Government Bench with regard to it at that time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02658">We are also told in the Press that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has now after three months offered new terms. I should like to ask the noble Earl who is going to reply to me what are the exact advantages of the new proposals over those of the Act which have already been refused by the doctors and which the Chancellor of the Exchequer now admits he did not think were quite fair to them. I am quite sure that no settlement will be satisfactory to those who have to contribute under this Act unless they have a free choice of doctors and unless the doctors are allowed to dispense their own medicines in the rural districts. One of the great faults of the Insurance Act is the failure to recognise the entirely different circumstances and requirements of workers in country districts and workers in the
<col>900</col>
towns, and the great distances which the doctors have to travel in country districts to see their patients, necessitating their keeping either horses or motor-cars. Had there been a greater distinction made between what is required by rural contributors and contributors in towns, and a recognition of the conditions of medical service in the country in comparison with that in towns, I think the Act would have worked much more smoothly. There is one thing which I am quite certain, having had some experience lately in forming a rural workers' association in Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire, will not satisfy the contributors. They will not consider that a staff medical service of doctors set up from among the medical students of Wales or Ireland, or perhaps of England will carry out the contract entered into with them in the Act by the Government. They desire to have the best medical advice at their disposal, and to have the free choice of the medical men whom they desire to employ.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02659">There is another question to which I desire to call the noble Earl's attention, and that is the transfer question. He will recollect that in the summer I called attention to what would be certain to be the result of the misleading pamphlet which was circulated through the Post Office. My prognostications have proved to be absolutely true. An enormous number of labourers in the country districts were raked into the Prudential and other societies through fear that they would be under a penalty if they did not become contributors by July 15. The Insurance Commissioners have had to take cognisance of that, and for the last six weeks these people have been allowed to transfer to societies which were more beneficial to them without the societies of which they had already become members being allowed to prevent them. But the period fixed has already expired or expires in the course of a few days. What I want to know is, What are the conditions under which transfer is to be made in the future? I do not wish to press the noble Earl too far on that point, because I happen to know by accident that the matter is still under the consideration of the Commissioners, and that they have not perfected the circular which they are going to send out. At any rate I hope that these misguided people will be allowed every freedom possible to enable them to transfer to societies which
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0455"/>
<col>901</col>
will be more beneficial to them. I have been led to put this Question on the Paper partly by a resolution which was passed by the Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire Rural Workers' Insurance Society, a copy of which resolution the noble Earl has in his hand. Therefore I will not trouble to read it to the House, as no doubt the noble Earl will, in the course of his remarks, reply to the points therein referred to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02660">The greatest difficulties have arisen in regard to sub-contractors, estate and casual labourers, and outworkers generally, and these difficulties have been pressed from time to time upon the attention of the Commissioners, not only by the Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire Rural Workers' Association, but by the friendly and other societies. I should like very much to know what has been done with regard to these different classes. There are also two other classes in connection with which great difficulties have arisen&#x2014;charwomen and domestic servants. The conditions with regard to these persons all require to be made clear. It is not fair that it should be left to the Insurance Commissioners to decide from day to day who are and who are not legally compelled to be contributors. A great many hard cases have arisen. I know from my own knowledge that a large number of women who have been in the habit of earning a small pittance, and also casual labourers, have been thrown out of employment, in some eases through a misunderstanding of the Act and in other cases through the Act itself. One of the reasons why so much confusion has been caused is that with regard to two different classes the words "exceptions" and "exemptions" have been used. The two words are so similar that people who do not understand the Act&#x2014;and I admit that I do not understand it myself&#x2014;confuse those who come under the exemption clauses with those who come under the exception clauses. All that requires to be made clear. It is impossible to keep pace with the number of pamphlets and regulations which are issued to us day after day, and as far as I am concerned I have entirely given it up. I ask that when these questions have been considered&#x2014;and I should think they ought to have been considered by now&#x2014;an amending Bill should be brought in and passed through Parliament making absolutely clear what the clauses do mean, and where they require alteration they
<col>902</col>
should be altered in a fair and reasonable manner.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02661">I wish to call attention to the char women's question. It has always been understood that women were not to be compelled to become contributors if what they earned was not their real means of livelihood. That is to say, if a wife or a daughter was adding to the breadwinner's earnings some two or three shillings a week apiece by going out chasing or washing, that should not compel them to come under the Act. But I can assure the noble Earl that in a great number of cases they have been told that they must come under the Act. Take the case of a woman who goes to assist at a public-house on the occasion of a cricket match or a football match. She gets 1<i>s.</i> for the day, and out of that 1<i>s.</i> she has to pay 3<i>d.,</i> and her employer has to pay 3<i>d.,</i> because she has been employed for the purposes of trade. I am informed that if she had gone to the noble Earl's house or to the house of any other noble Lord at the time of an entertainment she would not have been chargeable, because entertainments are not supposed to be a profitable part of the householder's business. There is even a worse case than that, to my mind, the case of the poor woman who comes in to clean schools for an hour, we will say, every day in the week. She only gets 6<i>d.</i> a day, and the most she could earn in the week is from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.;</i> but out of that she has to pay 3<i>d.,</i> and another 3<i>d.</i> in respect of her has to come out of the rates; and I am told that in Parts of Lindsey the cost for these school-cleaners will amount to &#x00A3;1,000 in the year on the rates.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02662">I would impress upon the noble Earl and upon those more responsible for the conduct of this Act that it is no good going on issuing these complicated leaflets when the Act must be amended and made clear. The Government have had nearly a year with advisory committees in existence, and they must know what they intend the Act to mean. At any rate, if they do not they ought to say so. The sanatoria arrangements are at the present moment most unsatisfactory, and from all I hear, unless some clear and satisfactory agreement is made with the medical profession before January 12 next there will be a tremendous revolt among all classes against this Act, and it will not be as successful as, now that it is the law, I should wish it to be.</p>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0456"/>
<col>903</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02663"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Earl replies I should like to associate myself with everything that has fallen from my noble friend Lord Heneage in regard to the Insurance Act. Probably no Act that has ever been passed by Parliament was drawn up in such a slovenly fashion, or has caused so many difficulties to those who really wish to administer the law in the best possible manner. I can speak as one who has worked on a county council and also on a couple of approved societies, and I can assure your Lordships that the number of leaflets we receive on this subject every day would take one hour if not two hours to read through. Surely the time has arrived when these leaflets might come to an end. I suggest that His Majesty's Government should convene meetings of the advisory councils and consult with them, and finally make up their minds about a great many points concerning which questions are continually being sent up by county councils, insurance bodies, and approved societies, and which questions very often are either not attended to or ambiguous answers are returned which leave those bodies in the same state of doubt as before. The treatment meted out to those who are trying to carry out this slovenly Act and the difficulty in interpreting it really make it almost impossible for those concerned to see that the insured individuals get the best possible return for their contributions.<lb/>
I should like to say a word on the question of transfer from one society to another. I do not think the majority of insured persons understand the transfer regulations, and I am sure that a great many would wish to transfer from some of those societies into which they were driven on July 15 by misleading statements on the part of His Majesty's Government. I am certain that those who have not paid close attention to the working of this Act are not aware how absolutely important it is for healthy individuals to join societies which deal with healthy individuals. I mean that people employed in the country should join approved societies which are mainly filled with men employed in country occupations. I will quote examples from Scotland. I am sure they are identical with what exists all over Great Britain. In connection with two or three farms in Scotland we got the farmers to make a return showing what would have happened had the Act been in force and their farm hands been employed over a five year period. We asked them to
<col>904</col>
show exactly what the farm hands would have received in respect of maternity benefit, what they would have saved themselves in the matter of doctors' attendance, and what they would have got during the five years in sickness and other benefits, and we found that the very large majority of the men would have received absolutely nothing during that period. In the case of one large estate on which there are 140 employed individuals the return showed that, with the employer's contributions added, something like &#x00A3;800 or &#x00A3;900 would have been paid in during the five year period, but, including maternity benefits, only &#x00A3;60 would have been received. It is obvious that these people are only benefited if they enter societies which comprise employees engaged in other healthy trades. These men were taken in by the statements made in July last and rushed into societies which deal with all individuals, some good lives and some bad. Therefore I wish to insist on the point brought out by Lord Heneage, that the minds of insured people should be disabused of the idea of any difficulty in transferring to more suitable societies. Then men occupied in healthy country pursuits will once again have the opportunity of getting into those societies which deal with healthy employees, so that they may get full advantage out of the Act.<lb/>
No mention was made by Lord Heneage of the subject of unemployment. It is surely a gross anomaly that men like estate carpenters and men engaged on timber works who are not in the trade and who are paid by the year or by the month should have to pay that contribution. There have been several instances brought to my notice, but as yet, as far as I know, the cases of these men have not been attended to. The Act being passed both sides wish to make it a success, but I can assure the noble Earl that those concerned with its administration are growing tired of the obstacles that are put in their way, the little attention that has been given to their recommendations, and the difficulty of getting answers to questions, mainly on account; no doubt, of the very slovenly way in which the Act was drawn.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02664"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I know quite well that when on previous occasions Lord Heneage has brought up for discussion in this House subjects connected with the Insurance Act we have not always been able to agree, but I should be sorry if he thought we did not regard his
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0457"/>
<col>905</col>
efforts with sympathy, because we know he has been good enough, in Lincolnshire especially, to take great interest in the working of the Act, as also has Lord Lovat in Scotland. I am glad to have this opportunity of expressing our acknowledgments to Lord Heneage for all the trouble he has taken on behalf especially of the Rural Workers' Society in Lincolnshire. But I think, so far as the number of circulars is concerned, that both noble Lords have probably received a double number, for this raison&#x2014;they probably received them as members of this House, and also in the case of the noble Lord below the Gangway, as the trustee of a society, and in the case of Lord Lovat probably as a member of an insurance committee. Therefore having received two copies of every document which has been issued by the Insurance Commissioners, they, perhaps, have an exaggerated view of the total number, which really is not so large as they think.<lb/>
But I freely admit that a large number of circulars have been issued by the Insurance Commissioners, and I think it is quite right that they should have done all they could to explain the provisions of the Act. On a former occasion the noble Marquess opposite did me the honour of quoting from an imperfect report of a speech I made on the subject, in which I laid stress on the complications of the measure. It is quite true the Act is complicated, but any Act which deals with the organisation of society as a whole must necessarily be complicated. In the history of the world society was never so complicated in its organisation as it is to-day. Therefore in so far as it was determined&#x2014;and rightly determined&#x2014;that this Act should deal with something more than the main first principles it was bound to be complicated. Although it would have been possible to lay down one or two principles and he content with that, it was quite rightly thought that that was an improper way of conducting legislation of this importance and magnitude, and as an alternative it was thought right that we should deal in some detail with the conditions of the people of to-day. That being so, I quite admit that the Insurance Commissioners have had to issue a number of circulars dealing, with the different classes.<lb/>
It is not necessary, however, for all the insured people to study all or even a large
<col>906</col>
part of the documents issued. In the ordinary course insured persons will apply to their approved societies for information as to the conduct of business under the Act, and the literature issued on this subject is intended more especially -for the officials of societies. Let me give an example. It is quite unnecessary for soldiers and sailors to study the circulars which are issued with regard to charwomen, nor is it necessary for charwomen to consider the circulars which deal with soldiers and sailors. The Commissioners have issued a subject-index, of which I shall be glad to send a copy to the noble Lord if he has not already received one, and this distinguishes seven circulars and memoranda as being of special importance. The Commissioner would be prepared, if desire was expressed for it, to extend that index into a handbook for society officials. But the general part of the literature dealing with sanatoria and medical benefits is addressed to the members and clerks of insurance committees and not to insured members. It will be for them to disseminate the information to insured persons in their area. In the same way documents explaining provisions of the Act with regard to particular classes of employment are intended, in the first place, for the employers concerned, with whom rests responsibility for seeing that the proper contributions are made. No society or person is required to read the whole of this literature. The total number of documents issued in connection with the insurance of 14,000,000 persons through more than 20,000 societies and branches must necessarily be considerable.<lb/>
The noble Lord has asked whether it is the intention of His Majesty's Government to deal with this matter by legislation during the present session. It is not the intention of His Majesty's Government to do so, and for this reason. A great many of the matters referred to by the noble Lord&#x2014;matters, I think, of real difficulty&#x2014;must, in their Opinion, be settled by administration by the Insurance Commissioners. There is direct power given in the Act itself to the Commissioners to settle a good many of these points, and it is in the opinion of the Government right that they should exercise that power rather than that there should be introduced an amending Bill. We do not at present see the need for an amending Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02667"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: Therefore it is only within the Act that they can act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02668"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I think it is quite easy to compose tremendously difficult puzzles about charwomen and the method of their employment, questions which I do not think any legislation can fairly settle. You must in these complicated and difficult questions settle the principle, and then give the Insurance Commissioners power to decide within the limits laid down in the Act. That is the line on which the Insurance Commissioners are proceeding at the present time. I can assure the noble Lord that if he would be good enough to communicate to us the points on which he thinks that amendment is desirable we should be very glad indeed to consider them, though, so far as we are at present advised, not with a view to any immediate amendment of the Act.<lb/>
With regard to medical benefits, to which the noble Lord referred, I am sorry to say that I did not expect from the terms of his Question that he would lay so much stress upon them as he has done; but it is, I am sure, matter of common knowledge that fresh terms have been suggested and are now being considered by the medical associations throughout the country. It was only yesterday or the day before that there was an important meeting of the doctors in London, and if, as seems likely, their willingness to work the Act is followed very generally throughout the country, I think we have every reason to hope there will be an efficient medical service at the disposal of the insured people upon the day on which it is promised in the Act itself.<lb/>
The noble Lord referred to a certain resolution which has been sent by the committee of a society in Lincolnshire. I hope the noble Lord will allow me, in referring to this, to say that from the documents which I have here I understand that a conference, which met on September 12, appointed representatives to a joint meeting which met on September 27, and that they sent to the Commissioners a certain letter. It was despatched, I
<col>908</col>
think, on September 27. It was acknowledged at once, and a further letter in answer to it was sent on October 16 to the secretary from whom the communication had been received. This resolution to which the noble Lord refers dealt, in the first place, with the question of transfer. That matter has already been referred to by the noble Lord on a previous occasion in this House. It was after that discussion that a conference took place between the representatives of a large number of societies and the Insurance Commissioners, and some 700 societies in all agreed for the time being to a system by which transfers should be possible from one society to another without any objection being made or without any discussion of any kind; and that was to last until September 30. A good many of these societies, by mutual arrangement, have agreed to extend the time or did agree to extend it so long as it concerned the first quarter card. That, of course, as the noble Lord knows, has now expired. All transfers after October 26 have to be dealt with under Section 31 of the Act. The noble Lord probably remembers that the Insurance Commissioners were required to issue instructions. Those are in an advanced state, and the Commissioners hope they will be immediately issued, perhaps even to-night, but certainly in a few days. This matter has already been dealt with in another place. No doubt the noble Lord remembers that no society may unreasonably withhold their permission from any individual to transfer from one society to another; and in another place Mr. Masterman said&#x2014;
<quote>"The Commissioners in the early months of the Act would require very clear proof that the society from which a member was withdrawing would suffer material harm by his withdrawal before they decided not to pay his transfer value to the second society."</quote>
Therefore it is clear that for the next month or so it will be easy for any individual following the prescribed course to secure his transfer from one society to another. The appeal will lie to the Insurance Commissioners, and it will be for them to say whether in their opinion the consent is being unreasonably withheld. It is clear that the temporary arrangement which was in force during the months of August and September cannot be continued, because it was dependent upon the mutual consent of a number of these societies. The time for which they agreed has now elapsed, and unless they came together and agreed
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0459"/>
<col>909</col>
among themselves that there should be a renewal of that arrangement it would not be possible for the Insurance Commissioners to force it upon them.<lb/>
The noble Lord's reference to the Lincolnshire resolution reminds me that difficulties have arisen with regard to the administration and the interpretation of the Act in reference to sub-contractors, estate workers, casual labourers, charwomen, and outworkers generally, as well as regards domestic servants. We are quite ready to admit that there may be exceedingly difficult questions of interpretation and administration, but we do not yet feel that they are such as to require any amending legislation at the present time. I can assure the noble Lord that the Insurance Commissioners are doing their best to settle all these questions as they arise, and I do not suppose they will find any real difficulty to contend with at the expiration of a month or two from now.
<col>910</col>
If I understood rightly the reference which was made by Lord Lovat to estate workers, he allude rather to unemployment. As the unemployment section of the Act refers more to the Board of Trade than to the National Health Insurance Commissioners it would be more convenient that it should be dealt with on a separate occasion and in a separate way. That question is not intimately connected with the health side, at any rate, of national insurance, and is not administered by the same Commisioners. On the whole, therefore, I do not know that there is anything more I hace to say, except to express the hope that Lord Heneage will continue to take the same interest in the administration of the Act in the future, and to assure him that we shall always be glad to consider any suggestions he may have to make on the subject.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02678"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BARNARD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before this Motion is agreed to, I desire to ask Lord Lucas, who represents the Board of Agriculture, a Question of which I have given him private notice. I wish to ask him whether his attention has been directed to what took place six days ago at the meeting of the Council of the Central Chamber of Agriculture, at which the question of this Bill was again under consideration. I would remind the noble Lord that the Central Chamber of Agriculture is practically the most important agricultural body in this country. It represents not only occupying tenants, but also landowners, agents, valuers&#x2014;in fact, every class connected with agriculture. I therefore suggest that the opinions of such a body are worthy of great weight and of every consideration. In June last the Council of this body passed a resolution to the effect that this Bill ought to be withdrawn as it did not meet the case which it was intended to meet. On the strength of that this House declined to proceed with the Bill at that time, but there was a distinct understanding that at a later period in the session the further consideration of this question should be resumed. Now, I take it, is the occasion for again considering this matter. At the meeting held on Tuesday last the Central Chamber absolutely refused to deal with the question of this Bill any further. The Committee which they had appointed to go into the subject and to suggest a remedy for the evils complained of put into their report this paragraph&#x2014;
<quote>"Your committee desire to reiterate the resolution passed by the Council in June last, that the Agricultural Holdings Bill now before the House of Lords should be withdrawn."</quote>
That paragraph elicited very little comment, except a few remarks which entirely concurred with it; and notably the chairman for the time being of the Council, Sir Luke White, M.P., a member of the Liberal Party, summed up the debate by expressing the opinion that the Bill, in its present shape, at any rate, would be of no use to agriculture, and that the Government ought to withdraw it. In these circumstances, I venture to appeal to the noble Lord whether it is worth while to cumber the Statute-book with a piece of legislation which the body for whom it is intended definitely state will never be of any use to them, and which they do not desire.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02679"><sup>*</sup><member>THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when we adjourned this debate last July we did so to give agricultural opinion generally a certain amount of further time in order to form itself. The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition said that by postponement he expected to gain an opportunity of ascertaining whether the disfavour was only superficial or whether it represented a deep-seated conviction in the minds of the people of the country; and the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, said that an adjournment was advisable in order that we might have the matured views of the Central Chamber of Agriculture upon the proposals of this Bill. Since July the only further resolution that we have received has been this resolution, the importance of which I do not in the least want to belittle, from the Central Chamber of Agriculture. No other bodies of farmers have sent in anything; neither does there appear to have been very much discussion of what has taken place. Therefore so far as the situation has changed at all since last July, it has only changed to the extent of what is contained in this resolution. I suppose the attitude of noble Lords opposite is to a certain extent dependent upon the attitude that the Central Chamber has taken up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02680"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BARNARD</member><membercontribution>: I should like to relieve the noble Lord's mind of any doubt on that point. The Central Chamber of Agriculture is not a Party institution, and noble Lords on this side of the House are not bound by any attitude that the Central Chamber may take up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02681"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I did not mean to imply that there was any Party feeling in the action taken, except in so far as noble Lords opposite did definitely adjourn the debate last July in order to see what action the Central Chamber would take. I take it that noble Lords opposite are to that extent influenced by this report, and that in so far as the report is unfavourable to the Bill the opinion of noble Lords opposite is to a certain extent hardened. If that is the cage, I think we are entitled to ask what the attitude of noble Lords is going to be with regard to the report in question. I do not think I am misconstruing the resolution when I say that the Central Chamber are against the Bill, not so much because of what it does contain but because
<col>914</col>
it does not contain a number of things which they consider vital. The most important of the resolutions contained in the report of the Central Chamber are the two which demand further compensation for improvements than tenants receive at present and the one which asks for compensation for disturbance where the tenant receives notice through no fault of his own. It would be interesting to hear what the opinion of noble Lords opposite is upon those two points. We have been taken seriously to task in the course of these debates because we have included certain recommendations of Lord Haversham's Committee and have not included other recommendations. I do not know whether noble Lords opposite are going to lay themselves open to the same censure if they simply adopt the recommendations as to the withdrawal of this Bill and entirely disregard the two recommendations I have read out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02682"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BARNARD</member><membercontribution>: I desire particularly to draw attention to the fact that these are not the resolutions of the Central Chamber. They are only the resolutions of a committee of the Chamber and are to go out to the country to be considered by the affiliated farmers' clubs and chambers of agriculture throughout the country. The Central Chamber has not pronounced upon the report at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02683"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I would like to say a word or two as to the committee of the Central Chamber of Agriculture which drew up this report. In the first place, this question of compensation&#x2014;and I take it that it is because of the absence of these further provisions on compensation that the committee of the Central Chamber have summed up against the Bill&#x2014;was carefully considered by Lord Haversham's Committee, and it is interesting to take note of one particular point. I have no criticism to offer against the committee of the Central Chamber, but I would like to point out that on that committee were two members of the Departmental Committee presided over by Lord Haversham. One of them, Lord Clinton, was not present at the meetings, and the other member, though down as being present, was, I understand, only there for a short time and refused to sign the report. Of the remaining ten members who were present at the meetings of the committee of the Central Chamber no fewer than five did place fully
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0462"/>
<col>915</col>
their views as to compensation before Lord Haversham's Committee, and that Committee, after fully considering them, definitely summed up against them. You are demanding an impossible thing if you ask us to fly in the face of the recommendations of the Haversham Committee and accept in lieu of them the views of what I may call the unsuccessful witnesses before that Committee. In Paragraphs 25 and 51 the Departmental Committee definitely sum up against the recommendations of these witnesses. Therefore we cannot accept the point of view of these witnesses. I do not think it is possible, for the reasons I have given, to make use of the report of this committee of the Central Chamber as a reason for not proceeding with this Bill. This Bill was definitely framed to give effect to all the recommendations that we could accept of Lord Haversham's Committee. The question of compensation is barred out for two very good reasons. The first is the reason I have given&#x2014;namely, that the Committee definitely recommended against any alteration of the present system. The second one, which is, I think, an equally important one, is not so much a question of principle but of expediency. We all know that the question of compensation is one of the most difficult and thorny of the particular subjects that are grouped under this head. Had we tried to include any provision dealing with compensation I think it is fair to say that it would have been of a highly controversial nature, and there would not have been the faintest chance of passing it in the present crowded session. As I stated when I introduced this Bill, it does not attempt to cover the whole of the ground, but it does attempt to go a certain way towards alleviating a very pressing difficulty that has arisen with regard to the sale of estates. So far as we have seen at present, though it may be said that a great deal of argument has been put forward in favour of further steps, very little indeed&#x2014;I might say hardly anything at all&#x2014;has been said against the actual proposals that are contained in this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02684"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think any of your Lordships can have been surprised that my noble friend Lord Barnard should have put the question which he addressed a few moments ago to the Parliamentary Secretary of the Board of Agriculture. Lord Barnard has taken part in the recent proceedings of the Central Chamber, and no one has a better
<col>916</col>
right to address himself to these topics than my noble friend. I am sure I am within the mark when I say that most of us have awaited with very great interest the result of the deliberations of the Central Chamber. It is, as my noble friend observed, the most important agricultural body in the country, and it is certainly not open to the imputation which I remember the noble Marquess opposite, Lord Lincolnshire, making against chambers of agriculture at large, which he described as being all of them in fact, though not in name, Conservative associations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02685"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LINCOLNSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: Not all, but most of them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02686"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The Central Chamber, at any rate, is not under that suspicion. The report, not of the Central Chamber, but of the committee of the Central Chamber, does, indeed, form a somewhat remarkable climax to the long series of expressions of opinion adverse to this Bill which have proceeded from every quarter throughout the country, and it would not have surprised me in the least if the noble Lord who represents the Government had come down to the House and stated that in the circumstances His Majesty's Government did not consider it worth while to proceed with the Bill.<lb/>
There is one point upon which I must, I am afraid, insist for a moment, and that is the extraordinary reluctance of His Majesty's Government to disclose any of the evidence upon which they have based themselves in laying these proposals before the country. We have again and again, in the most temperate and friendly manner, asked the noble Lord whether he cannot produce some, a few, favourable expressions in regard to this Bill. I remember one conversation in the summer when I challenged him on that subject, and he replied, with great reason, that I had not given him notice of the question. He said that he had come to the House inadequately supplied with the evidence for which I asked, but that he had every reason to believe that the Bill received a considerable amount of support. He had not, he said, brought with him chapter and verse, but at any rate the Government had sufficient evidence to satisfy themselves and were prepared to back up their own opinion that the Bill would be a useful one. I must say I thought that on this
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0463"/>
<col>917</col>
occasion the noble Lord would have brought down with him to the House some of those blessings which are stored somewhere or other in the pigeon-holes of the Board of Agriculture. Although, however, no such evidence is forthcoming the noble Lord, speaking with all the weight and authority of the Board which he represents, tells us that this Bill is a useful one, and that His Majesty's Government desire to persevere with it. In these circumstances we have to consider what our attitude should be, and I am bound to say that, considering the views that we on this Bench have expressed with regard to this question, I find it impossible to resist the appeal of the noble Lord or to suggest that we should not proceed with the discussion in Committee.<lb/>
We remain of opinion that the better remedy was that recommended by Lord Haversham's Committee, and that this particular remedy, if it be one, affords only a slight mitigation of the hardship of the sitting tenant who finds himself dispossessed in consequence of the sale of the estate. But I think the Bill will afford some mitigation, although I am bound to say that in its present shape I doubt whether that mitigation will be considerable, and I hope that if we go into Committee we shall endeavour to find in some of the Amendments which are on the Table the means of improving to a greater extent the position of the sitting tenant. Then may I notice a kind of challenge which the noble Lord threw out just now. He said he hoped that we on this side of the House would tell him what we thought of the recommendations embodied in the report of the committee of the Central Chamber. The noble Lord was reminded, I think very properly reminded, that those were not the recommendations of the Central Chamber of Agriculture; they were the recommendations of a committee; and so little was the Central Chamber satisfied that the committee was upon solid ground that, instead of passing an opinion upon the report of the committee, they referred the report back to the local agricultural chambers for an expression of their opinion. I think it will be ample time for us to consider a number of questions which the noble Lord, I thought very properly, described as some of them extremely thorny when the Central Chamber knows its own mind about them. The conclusion to which I venture
<col>918</col>
to come is that your Lordships' House would do well to resume the discussion of this Bill in Committee in the hope of making it a rather better Bill than we believe it to be at present.</membercontribution></p>

If I read the Bill aright, under the proviso of Clause 1 if any land is taken by a county council for the purpose of small holdings the provisions of the Bill will not apply. I ant not going to attempt to take up your Lordships' time by arguing in favour of small ownership as against small tenancy. I only ask your Lordships to say that whilst the question of small ownership is very largely advocated in this country by one section of opinion and the alternative system of small holdings is advocated by another section, this House shall maintain the scale fair between the two. If the Amendment which I beg leave to propose is

passed, all persons who become small owners of holdings under fifty acres will be placed in the same position as the same persons would be if they came in as small holders under a county council. There is an additional reason why I ask your Lordships to insert this Amendment, and it is this. It has been alleged by some that where tenants of large farms have to move at comparatively short notice in cases where notice to quit has been given before the sales of their farms took place, they incur considerable loss in disposing of the large amount of stock which naturally they own on a large holding; but the disability under which men holding large farms suffer must naturally be very much mitigated and may be held to be almost non-existent in the case of men with small holdings under fifty acres. I therefore ask your Lordships to accept this Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

The only argument he quoted was that big farmers have a lot of stock to sell and that this does not apply to small holders. I may say that I know small holdings which are much more heavily stocked in proportion to their size than large farms; and it may further be argued that where a big farmer can get a good sale a small holder selling a small amount of stock must always have a bad sale. Apart from that, I do not think the noble Lord has made out a case against these small men. I think you are bound to treat them in this respect exactly in the same way as the big men.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02698"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord's Amendment applies to existing small holders whose holdings are sold. In a great many cases of that sort the statutory small holdings under the Small Holdings Act do not come in at all. There are something over a quarter of a million small holdings
<col>920</col>
established before the Act came into existence which have nothing whatever to do with the Act. A certain number of those come into the market every time land is sold, and those are the small holders whom the noble Lord wishes to exclude from the benefit of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02699"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid the Amendment trenches on rather dangerous ground. In the first place, if we are to have a limit at all I doubt whether the limit of acres alone is a sufficient one. As a rule where a limit is taken it is a limit both of acreage and rental amount. But quite apart from that, I am afraid that by taking a limit of acreage we shall draw a quite arbitrary distinction between the larger farmer and the smaller farmer, greatly to the disadvantage of the latter. I do not quite agree with my noble friend that the smaller man does not require the same amount of protection as the larger man. I think if he needs protection at all he stands quite as much in need of it as his larger neighbour. Upon the whole I think these arbitrary limits, although it is quite true we are not unfamiliar with them in our land legislation, are dangerous things. They give you a frontier which it is extremely difficult to defend, and they lead to the kind of anomaly which one always wishes to avoid&#x2014;I mean the anomaly which arises when you have on one side of the road a man farming forty-five acres who enjoys no advantages at all, and on the other side of the road a man farming fifty-five acres who is amply protected by the law.

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02704"><member>LORD ST. LEVAN</member> moved to omit from the first paragraph of the clause all the words after "Where the landlord of a holding" down to "determine the tenancy accordingly," and to insert other words. As the noble Lord proposed to amend it, the first paragraph would read&#x2014;
<quote>"Where the landlord of a holding gives to the tenant notice to quit in view of the sale or offering for sale of the holding or any part thereof, the notice shall state that it is so given, and a notice to quit so given shall be void unless an agreement for the sale of the holding or of some part thereof is entered into, and information in writing thereof is given to the tenant before the date on which but for this section the notice to quit would have taken effect; and if an agreement for sale is so entered into the notice to quit shall not take effect until one year front the day of expiry next succeeding the date on which information that an agreement for sale has been entered into is given to the tenant: Provided that within two months after the receipt of a notice to quit under this section a tenant may give notice in writing to the landlord that he accepts the notice as notice to determine the tenancy on the date on which but for this section it would have taken effect, and thereupon the notice to quit shall operate to determine the tenancy as if this Act had not been passed."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02705">The noble Lord said: It was pointed out during the earlier debates on this Bill, and I think the point was alluded to again this afternoon, how seriously occupiers of land have been affected by the necessity imposed upon owners by recent legislation to sell their estates. His Majesty's Government propose to lessen this inconvenience by the present Bill, the chief provision of which is to enable a tenant, on receiving a notice to quit for purposes of a sale, to give a counter-notice which will have the effect of turning the one year's notice into a two years' notice. This proposal was met by strong criticism from noble Lords who are well informed and as well qualified to speak on this point as any one in the United Kingdom, and evidence was produced to show that it was not accepted as satisfactory by responsible bodies of agriculturists. I am afraid it is impossible to altogether avoid the inconvenience and trouble caused both to owners and to tenants by the recent legislation to which I have referred. It is obvious that in an industry like agriculture any measure
<col>922</col>
which interferes with one of the parties is bound to re-act upon the other; but it did occur to some members of your Lordships' House on this side that means might be found to alleviate this convenience other than those proposed in the Bill, and that, my Lords, is the origin of this Amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02706">The first part of the Amendment is meant to ensure the notice being only acted upon in the event of a sale taking place, so that the tenant who has received notice to quit on account of a sale will not have to quit for any other reason. The next object of the Amendment is to give to the tenant under the new conditions reasonable security against being disturbed in his occupation of land without having sufficient time and opportunity to make arrangements to suit the position in which the transference of his holding from one owner to another places him, when he will either have to come to terms with the new owner or else look out for another holding. Under the Bill as originally framed by His Majesty's Government that result was not assured. It would have been possible for an owner to have given his tenant not ice to quit at the end of a year and for the tenant to have given the counter-notice proposed in the Bill, and then for the landlord not to have sold till, say, a month before the expiration of the counter year. That would have left the tenant only one month in which to come to terms with the new owner or to look out for another holding, for until the sale had actually taken place the tenant could not know for certain who the new owner was going to be. By the Amendment which is now under your Lordships' consideration the tenant would in either case have at least one clear year after the contract for the sale of the holding had been entered into in which either to come to terms with the new owner or to look out for another farm.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02707">Take this case. A landowner gives notice to a tenant, say, in February, 1912, and then enters into a contract with a purchaser in August, 1912. In the case of a Michaelmas letting the tenant would still have until Michaelmas, 1913, and if the landowner did not effect the contract for sale until after Michaelmas, 1913, the tenant could remain in possession of his holding till Michaelmas, 1914. I venture
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0466"/>
<col>923</col>
to think that by this Amendment a tenant is put, as far as regards this point, in a better position than he would be under the Bill as it stands. The last part of the Amendment is intended to enable the tenant to accept the notice to quit as definite should he wish to do so, and so avoid the uncertainty of having to wait till the owner has effected a sale. That is, as shortly as I can put it, the effect of this Amendment. I admit that the noble Lord in charge of the Bill has attempted to meet one of the points I have mentioned. What I feel is that there are a great many members of your Lordships' House who are far better qualified to speak on this subject than I am. I hope we shall hear their views, and I shall be content to leave it to their judgment to say which of the two alternatives before the House is the one that should be adopted.</p>

It has always been held that a six months notice to expire at Lady Day is a most useful notice, especially in the interests of the tenant. If you make this clause compulsory in spite of any agreement the tenant may have with his landlord that the notice should be a six months notice, that tenant will be saddled with the farm for a year and a-half longer than he desires. The overriding of these contracts in this way will be prejudicial to all Lady Day tenants who at present have contracts for six months notice. I should like to ask the noble Lord in charge of the Bill whether he has had any application from Lady Day tenants for this change. If not, why interfere with the present system?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02733"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: This clause, in the first place, carries out a definite recommendation of the Departmental Committee, which went pretty closely into the question of six months tenancies and strongly recommended that they should be done away with. I understand the reason why they made that recommendation was that they thought that a six months tenancy was on the whole detrimental to good farming. Agriculture is an operation the cycle of which takes a year to complete, and therefore a yearly notice seems to be the proper thing. I quite see the noble
<col>926</col>
Viscount's point about Lady Day tenancies, but I should have thought that, except in very exceptional cases, you would not alter the time at which the tenancy expires but simply give the notice six months earlier&#x2014;that is to say, give the notice on one Lady Day to expire on the following Lady Day. We know a large number of cases where the six months tenancy does not lead to good farming and in our opinion it is better to ensure a yearly tenancy than to give up this principle because of the isolated cases referred to by the noble Viscount.</membercontribution></p>

I do not pretend to have access to information which the noble Lord possesses, but I have been approached by an important agricultural authority belonging to the part of England which is in question who assures me that this particular system under which six months notice is given is immensely valued there by a great body of tenant farmers. If that be so, it is not a matter to be swept away as of no importance. I would point out that Clause 2 does not seem to me to be in any way essential to Clause 1, which, as amended, is now a watertight proposal. Clause 1 works perfectly well whether the notices run for six months or for a year. Perhaps between now and the next stage the noble Lord in charge of the Bill will consider how far Clause 2 is essential to the Government's scheme, and that must, of course, depend upon the information which reaches him as to the popularity of this particular kind of tenancy in the parts of the country referred to by the noble Viscount.</membercontribution></p>

The arguments for and against this Amendment have been already to a great extent discussed. It seems to me to be rather a sweeping measure to say that in no circumstances whatever shall a shorter notice than a year be allowable, and that it would be void under every possible circumstance. I agree that as a general rule a notice of a year is far preferable to any shorter period, but I can quite conceive the possibility, in fact the probability, of its often occurring that a tenant may wish to vacate his holding at a shorter notice than a year; and if the matter can be agreed upon by mutual consent between the tenant and his landlord I do not see why such an arrangement should not be come to. The object of my Amendment is to preserve the possibility of a shorter notice being accepted by mutual agreement between the landlord and tenant.</membercontribution></p>

What this Amendment would do would be to give effect to that provision in the Bill which your Lordships so much criticised when it was first introduced&#x2014;that is to say, there would be nothing to prevent a tenant who was on a two years agreement from having his farm sold three months before the termination of his notice; and that man would then be in that very position of hardship which by the adoption of Lord St. Levan's Amendment we have successfully avoided. Under the Bill in its amended form the position would be this. If a tenant whose contract of tenancy required that he should have two years notice was given notice and during the first of those two years the farm was sold, then his tenancy would terminate at the end of the two years and there would be no question of giving him an additional year, because he would have had twelve months clear after the sale of his farm. But, on the other hand, if the farm was not sold until the end of the second year, then the tenant would be entitled to an additional year. That seems to be in keeping with the general principle which your Lordships have now accepted, and I therefore hope the Amendment will not be pressed.</membercontribution></p>

I do not know whether your Lordships have considered that certain cases of very real hardship may arise under this Bill as it stands in the case of land in respect of which Undeveloped Land Duty is charged. In the first place, I do not think it was very carefully considered on what land Undeveloped Land Duty should be levied. We are told that agricultural land is exempt from this duty, but I am afraid that is not a theory which will bear very critical examination. The point of my Amendment is that to land subject to Undeveloped Land Duty this Bill shall not apply. The value of land very largely depends upon the moment when you can get possession of it. I can conceive cases where it may be of the utmost importance that the landlord should get possession of the land immediately, either for the purpose of sale or development. As it at present stands, this Bill only applies where the land is immediately wanted by the landlord or purchaser for building thereon. But it might not be ripe for building thereon at the moment. Take the case of a farm near to a town. It may be ripe for building or it may not. The Commissioners come along and say that the land is worth more than &#x00A3;50 an acre, and it at once becomes subject to Undeveloped Land Duty; but the actual value of that land for the purposes of this duty arises because it can be used for building, yet under this Bill the landlord will not be able to get possession of it for two years which materially reduces its assessed value. I am quite willing to accept an assurance from the noble Lord in charge of the Bill that this land is protected, but it seems to me that it would be difficult to prove that land such as I have in my mind at the moment is land which would be protected from the burden which this Bill imposes.</membercontribution></p>

Either it may be required for building, in which case the landlord can at once give notice and nothing in this Bill applies&#x2014;this is clearly stated in Clause 3(1)(<i>a</i>)&#x2014;or else it is not ripe for building, and in that case, whether it is paying Undeveloped Land Duty or not, I do not see what justification there is for turning the tenant out at very short notice. Possession of land which pays Undeveloped Land 'Duty and yet is not required for building is usually considered a misfortune if you cannot sell it, and good fortune if you can. I do not see from the noble Earl's point of view what objection he can have to this clause, because the moment the landlord wants to sell the land for building it comes under the paragraph of Clause 3 to which I have referred and then the counter notice does not apply.</membercontribution></p>

I submit that if land is unable to be sold it ought not to be subject to Undeveloped Land Duty because the land is thus not available for development. On the other hand, it is possible that a man may want to buy the land not for immediate building but for future opening up. My point is that if the land is sufficiently valuable, or is considered by the Commissioners to be sufficiently valuable, to be charged Undeveloped Land Duty it stands to reason that that land ought to have exceptional treatment.</membercontribution></p>

There are, I suppose, tens of thousands of acres held temporarily in this way for agricultural purposes outside big towns, and the Amendment moved by the noble Earl is designed to meet those cases. There is no doubt that under the Finance Act Undeveloped Land Duty will be charged on every single acre of this land. Is it fair that the owner should have to pay this duty for a year longer than is necessary, as would be the case if some Amendment such as this is not inserted? I hope the Committee will recognise the absolute justice and fairness of the request of my noble friend, and insert his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

Assuming an agricultural holding which is so much in the neighbourhood of a large town as to have a building value but <i>ex hypothesi</i> is not likely to be built upon for some little time, it seems to me to be hard upon the tenant farmer who is occupying that land that he should be placed in a worse position than his next door neighbour immediately outside the possible building circle who will be protected by Clause 1 of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

I should have thought that all the cases which the noble Lord had in his mind would, as a matter of fact, have been covered by that proviso. The noble Lord will note that the land is merely to be sold "with a view" to building. The proviso does not say that it has to be built upon next day.

If the landlord has to wait a long time the opportunity may have passed, and the man may have gone elsewhere to buy land which was more readily available. Why should not the landlord be able to close with the intending purchaser at once? He has been bled all the time because he owns this land, and has been told that he has monopolised it; yet when he comes forward to sell he is not allowed to do so without giving a long notice.

The noble Lord said: Your Lordships were dealing just now with the question of the gradual development of building land. It is a common practice, I believe, for agreements for the tenure of land of this description for agricultural purposes to contain a clause that the land shall be given up by the tenant if it is required for other than agricultural purposes. Those words are a little wider than the words "if required for building thereon." The words I ask the Committee to insert are no novelty; they are, as I have said, commonly inserted at the present time in a great number of agreements dealing with land of this description, and they would cover cases where land was wanted for laying out a road or for purposes connected with the laying out of a building estate, or where a small bit of land was wanted for an additional piece of garden in connection with a building already on the estate. Those purposes would not be covered by such strict words as "for building thereon." Therefore I ask permission to insert the words in my Amendment.</p>

Paragraph (<i>b</i>) of this clause provides that nothing in the Bill shall apply to a notice to quit for any purpose specified in Section 23 of the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1908, or any other industrial purpose. Section 23 of the Agricultural Holdings Act is very wide indeed. It includes the erection of farm labourers' cottages or other houses, the provision of gardens for cottages and other houses, the provision of allotments, the construction of any improvements or buildings to be used in connection therewith, the making of roads, and so on, and then there are the words in this paragraph "or any other industrial purpose." Surely that covers every possible purpose. The only purpose to which one has ever seen such land put which is not covered here is a golf course, and I think the tenant has

I think it is only just that the tenant should have a fair opportunity of testing the <i>bona fide</i> nature of the notice. As the clause stands, there is no necessity to state for what particular building purpose the land is to be used.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02794"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: If anybody on selling land is to be allowed to give notice that he intends it for building and is not to be liable to any action in case no building takes place I do not think this Bill will have any effect at all, because everybody will give a notice of that sort.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02795"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord spoke just now of the resumption of land for building purposes, but it is quite clear that the words we are discussing refer to notices to quit given for other purposes also. The words are that the notice is to specify not only "the purpose for which the land is required" but also "the matter on account of which the notice is given." Take the case of a notice to quit served on account of a breach of covenant by a tenant. Does the noble Lord suggest that in that case the notice would have to specify exactly what covenant had been broken?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02797"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: That would arise later under Clause 4, which provides that if any question comes up under this Bill as to whether a notice to quit has been given in connection with the sale or offering for sale of a holding or part thereof, or as to the purpose for which or matter on account of which it was given, the question may at any time after the notice is given be referred by the landlord or the tenant to arbitration under the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1908. Surely the time for specifying would arise when the matter went to arbitration. The notice to quit would have to state why the notice was given, but need the particulars in the case which I am imagining be gone into until the arbitration is entered upon?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02798"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Surely in the case which the noble Marquess has mentioned, that of a breach of covenant, it would have to be stated in the notice to quit, "I give you a year's notice to quit on the ground that such and such a thing has been done in contravention of the covenant." Without these words it would be in the power of an unscrupulous landlord, supposing there were one, merely to say, "I give you notice on account of a breach of covenant," without entering into any explanation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02799"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I quite agree that it is desirable the tenant should know the reasons for which he is receiving notice to quit. The noble Marquess is wrong in believing that an unscrupulous landlord could in the case which he supposes keep these matters out of sight, because obviously the case would go to arbitration, and the first thing that would be expected of the unreasonable landlord would be that he should disclose what particular covenant had been violated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02800"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: But surely it would be better that the tenant should know what covenant he had broken without the question going to arbitration at all.

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02812"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: I have placed on the Paper an Amendment to leave out Clause 4, and I should like to call your Lordships' attention to the very serious position which has arisen in this country since the passing of the Agricultural Holdings Act of 1908, when for the first time matters of great importance to landlord and tenant were referred to a single arbitrator&#x2014;a gentleman appointed, I believe, by the Board of Agriculture; a gentleman of whose qualifications we know nothing, whose decisions in many parts of the country have given the gravest dissatisfaction, and against whose decisions there is no appeal. This House, I believe I am right in saying, only passed the clause in the Act of 1908 permitting the appointment of these single arbitrators with the gravest reluctance, and did so, I think, largely in consequence of the persuasive manner in which the noble Marquess, Lord Lincolnshire, always addresses this side as well as his own side of the House. He asked us to consent to the appointment of these unskilled arbitrators on the ground that great expense would be saved, that no expert witnesses
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0475"/>
<col>941</col>
need be called, and that these arbitrations would be conducted in a simple, cheap, and easy manner. But I think the noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, either on that occasion or on some other occasion pointed out that you may secure certain things too cheap, and that if you are to have these ignorant and inexperienced persons sent down on the ground of cheapness to settle important questions between landlord and tenant, with no appeal against their decision, the advantages of their being cheap do not outweigh the other great disadvantages. When the present Bill came up for discussion on Second Reading I ventured to give your Lordships a concrete instance of the way in which this system of a single arbitrator nominated by the Board of Agriculture worked in the case of land belonging to a not unimportant charity&#x2014;Smith's Charity&#x2014;and I pointed out that the sufferers through the decision of the arbitrator in that case were the London hospitals; and at the time I ventured to tell Lord Lucas that if he cared to have particulars in order to examine into this case I should be very happy to supply them. The noble Lord, however, has not thought proper to enter into any communication with me on this matter. I dare say he knows who the gentleman was who was sent down as arbitrator in that case. He was described to me as an auctioneer. I will not trouble your Lordships this evening with the full details of the case, because I mentioned it on the Second Reading. Several noble Lords agreed with me that a miscarriage of justice appeared to have occurred. I have since been informed that a similar miscarriage of justice has occurred in other cases. How could it be otherwise when there is no appeal against the decision of this single arbitrator, and when there is nothing to prevent totally ignorant and unscrupulous men, who would naturally do what they could to please their masters, being appointed so-called arbitrators? This Bill proposes to extend this undesirable custom. Any question arising under this Bill is to be referred to a single irresponsible arbitrator. As a protest against this system and against its extension I have put an Amendment on the Paper for the rejection of the clause, and if I can find a noble Lord who will go into the Lobby with me in support of the Amendment I shall put the Committee to the trouble of a Division.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02814"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I should like to put in a word on behalf of these gentlemen whom Lord Hylton on the last occasion described as departmental inspectors and on this occasion as cheap and ignorant arbitrators. The fact is that when arbitration becomes necessary and the Board have to appoint an arbitrator the invariable practice is to select a local valuer or surveyor of standing&#x2014;a person of quite independent position who has nothing whatever to do with the Board at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02815"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: The arbitrator in the case of Smith's Charity was described to the persons interested as an auctioneer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02816"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: The information which Lord Hylton has is wrong. He may be an auctioneer, but he is also a surveyor and valuer of considerable standing. The gentleman in question is Mr. C. F. Moore, who is a well-known surveyor and valuer in Cirencester. These gentlemen have no axe to grind by serving one party or the other: they go down absolutely independent, and it is a matter of indifference to the Board of Agriculture what the nature of their award may be. I will give your Lordships the facts regarding Smith's Charity, to which Lord Hylton has again referred to-night. On the last Occasion Lord Hylton was good enough to give us figures. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"A very well-known surveyor appointed on behalf of this Charity, whose name I am quite willing to give to the noble Lord in charge of the Bill if he desires it, valued the land at a rental of 40<i>s.</i> an acre, and was quite prepared not only to prove that land of a similar character adjoining it was actually rented at 40<i>s.</i> an acre but was in demand at 40<i>s.</i> an acre. Your Lordships will be surprised to hear that the arbitrator sent down by the Board of Agriculture decided that the land was to be in future rented by the county council at 17<i>s.</i> an acre."</quote>
The Duke of Northumberland, who is, I gather, one of the noble Lord's co-trustees in this matter, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The land in question was actually let at the time for 30<i>s.</i> It was not only valued as worth 40<i>s.</i> by the valuer, but was actually let at 30<i>s.</i>"</quote>
We did not refer to Lord Hylton, but we have made an inquiry into the actual facts of the case, and I will give them to your Lordships as supplied to us by Mr. Peter, the county land agent. As your Lordships are aware, the arbitration was for the leasing of land by the county of
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0476"/>
<col>943</col>
Gloucester for the purpose of small holdings. Mr. Peter was acting on behalf of the county council, and was in full possession of all the facts. The noble Lord told us that the value of the land was put at 40<i>s.</i> an acre by the gentleman whom he referred to as a well-known surveyor.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02817"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: It was Mr. Clutton.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02818"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: I do not know how much reliability they placed in this gentleman because the fact is that at the inquiry which took place they only claimed 30<i>s.</i> an acre.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02819"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: I can explain that if the noble Lord wishes to know the reason.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02820"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD LUCAS</member><membercontribution>: The rest of the facts are that the whole farm, comprising 240 acres and including house and buildings, is at present let for 20<i>s.</i> an acre, which presumably is a reasonable rent as the trustees are bound to get the best rent they can for this land. Out of this 240 acres a piece of about 60&#x00BD; acres was wanted for small holdings. It had no accommodation value and is three-quarters of a mile from the farmhouse and buildings, and therefore no one has suggested that there was any "cutting the eye out" of the farm. Mr. Peter understood from the tenant that he valued it at 10<i>s.</i> an acre. Your Lordships will notice that the whole of the farm was rented at only 20<i>s.</i> an acre. This piece of 60&#x00BD; acres, the least good part of the farm, the tenant valued at 10<i>s.</i> an acre; the county council's valuer put it at 14<i>s.</i> an acre; and the arbitrator appointed by the Board of Agriculture valued it at 17<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> an acre.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02821"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LINCOLNSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: I should like to say a word of protest against the attack which the noble Lord opposite has made on these arbitrators. When I was at the head of the Board of Agriculture we took the greatest possible trouble to get the best men we could to arbitrate in these cases, because we knew, of course, that by their decisions our proposals stood or fell. I do think the noble Lord went a little too far when he
<col>944</col>
described them as irresponsible persons and said they would do what they could to "please their masters" in this matter. That is a perfectly unjustifiable charge to bring against very straightforward, hardworking, and honourable men. If while I was at the Board of Agriculture we had any fault to find with them it was that they were too much landlords' men. They seemed to us always to put too high a price, in some instances much too high a price, on the land which they had to value, and on two or three occasions it was impossible to get land for small holdings on account of the extreme value which some of these men thought they were justified in putting on the land. I regret that such a charge should have been brought against these honourable men, and I am sure that on reflection the noble Lord opposite will regret having made it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02822"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I spoke with too much warmth, but I feel very warmly on the matter. It is nothing to do personally with the trustees of this charity, but we are bound to administer the property as carefully as we can in order to give the revenue resulting therefrom to the London hospitals. When we thought that in consequence of the action of the arbitrator in this case, against whose decision there was no appeal, the amount we could devote to the London hospitals was largely reduced, we naturally felt warmly on the subject. I do not think it is necessary for me to weary the House by dwelling in further detail on this particular case, but I could say a good deal in answer to what Lord Lucas has alleged. If the noble Lord will take the trouble to inquire about the way in which this charity estate is administered he will find that the farms are very low rented in the general opinion of the district, and I submit that the arbitrator sent down to settle the fair price that should be paid for the portion of the land that was to be taken should not have been influenced by the amount which the trustees of Smith's Charity took from the tenant for the whole farm but should have had regard to the real true value of the land to be taken for the purposes of small holdings, and we felt that 17<i>s.</i> an acre for all grass land was too low. Although the noble Lord says that the tenant of the remainder of the farm had stated that this land was of little value, he may be interested to know that the tenant has
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0477"/>
<col>945</col>
since sent in an application to the trustees saying that since this valuable land has been taken off he is entitled to have his rent reduced. I think the landowners of this country are entitled to claim that the greatest care should be taken to see that the persons sent down to arbitrate under the Act of 1908 and under this Bill possess proper qualifications.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02823"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am not more enamoured than my noble friend of the procedure under the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1908. Indeed I have more than once in this House raised my voice against what I conceive to be the growing danger of entrusting more and more authority to courts which are not courts of law, but which are, so to speak, improvised for the purposes of a particular statute. But that really is a large question and is hardly before the House at this moment. All I will say is that so long as this practice continues so long you will have it said that the arbitrator is either a landlords' man or a tenants' man, as the case may be. My noble friend behind me proposes to omit this clause altogether. I do not quite know where we should be without a clause of some kind providing a tribunal for dealing with the matters which must necessarily arise under this Bill. Under the preceding clause questions may arise as to the purpose for which a notice to quit has been given, whether it is for building, whether it is for a breach of contract, and so on, and it seems to me that you must have some authority in cases of that kind to decide as between the parties. I think we should incur considerable responsibility, after accepting this Bill in principle, if we took out of it a clause which seems to me to be an essential wheel, so to speak, in the machinery of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<title>WARREN HASTINGS HOUSE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02828"><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Question that stands in my name runs as follows&#x2014;<lb/>
To ask the Secretary of State for India whether the house known as Hastings House, Calcutta, which was built and occupied by Warren Hastings and was purchased by the Government of India in 1900 partly as a historic monument and partly as a State guest-house has been offered for sale, or has already been sold, by the Government of India; whether its contents have already been sold by auction; what is the reason for these measures; and whether steps cannot be taken to preserve in the hands of Government so interesting and unique a historic memorial.<lb/>
I have left the Question on the Paper in the form in which I put it down in order to enable the Secretary of State to give us as full a reply as he may find convenient. But I ought to add that only yesterday I received a letter from the Viceroy of India in which he informed me, with regard to the sale of the contents of the house to which I referred in the Question, that all the most important furniture was reserved, and that the Government of India have not the least intention of parting with the house itself. I need hardly say that this was very good news to me, as I believe it will be to the majority of your Lordships, and I only hope that the Secretary of State may be able to tell us that this assurance applies, not merely to the house itself, but to the beautiful garden by which he may perhaps remember the house is surrounded.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02829"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not at all surprised at the keen interest which the noble Earl opposite takes in this house, which owes its preservation and improvement to his energy when he was Viceroy of India. I was surprised myself when I saw a letter which he wrote to <i>The Times</i> on the subject on the 26th of last month, because he appeared to assume, what I certainly had never heard hinted at when I was in India at the beginning of this year, that the sale of the house was actually contemplated. He stated in this letter that he founded that opinion upon a paragraph which appeared in the <i>Statesman,</i> a well-known Calcutta newspaper, and he appeared to assume that the statements contained in that paragraph were altogether accurate. The <i>Statesman,</i> if I remember right, announced
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0478"/>
<col>947</col>
the approaching sale as an absolute fact. Now that the noble Earl has received an intimation from the Viceroy, there is not very much more that I can tell him than was, as I gather, contained in that letter. The house, as the noble Earl has stated, was employed by him when the seat of the Imperial Government was at Calcutta as a guest-house for Indian chiefs paying visits to the capital. With the change of capital it was no longer required for that purpose, and it contained a quantity of ordinary furniture which has been the subject of the sale to which the noble Earl alluded. The pictures which were in the house have been reserves and removed, and that applies also to anything which it contained which could be regarded as of particular value. The whole question of the future destination of the Imperial buildings at Calcutta has naturally been referred for their advice to the Government of Bengal, and I hope it will be in a very short time that we shall receive their opinion of the proper destination of those buildings. As soon as we do I shall have pleasure in informing the noble Earl of what is decided. But there certainly never has been any question of the demolition of the house, as to which a Question was asked in another place by Sir John Rees. There has, in fact, never been any question of its sale. I am glad to be able to answer in the affirmative also that the intention of the Government of India is to keep the grounds altogether intact, so that there is no opportunity of their meeting the fate which the noble Earl has dreaded for them&#x2014;that of being cut up for
<col>948</col>
building. As to the use to which in future the house may be put I have myself no idea, and it is certainly not worth while to endeavour to invent hypothetical uses for it. But I am quite sure we all share the feeling of the noble Earl, that so important a historical monument, connected with the great ruler of India to whom both Englishmen and the natives of India owe so much, is worthy not merely of preservation but of being treated with all respect. I trust, therefore, that some use will be found for it which is worthy of its past.</membercontribution></p>

<title>TERRITORIAL RECRUITING AREAS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02841"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member> rose to move to resolve, "That in the opinion of this House the recruiting areas originally allotted to the various counties for the raising of the Territorial Force should not be affected by any extension of county boundaries not contemplated at the inception of the scheme, in view of the fact that on those areas the proportion of the Force to be raised by each county was calculated, and that in those areas the respective counties have up till now been recruiting."</p>
<col>950</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02842">The noble Earl said: My Lords, this matter arises out of the Act which was passed last year extending the boundaries of Birmingham. That Act has had a considerable effect on the recruiting areas of three counties&#x2014;Warwickshire, Worcestershire, and
Staffordshire. Handsworth, which was in Staffordshire and now goes to Warwickshire, is a very important district, and in that area we raise four units representing three different kinds of arms&#x2014;one Infantry, two Army Service Corps, and a Field Ambulance. I would remind your Lordships that under the original scheme the country was divided into six principal commands, and within those six commands were ten grouped regimental districts in which various counties were placed. Each of these grouped regimental districts had its full proportion of the various arms&#x2014;Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery of various sorts, Engineers, Army Service Corps, and so on. To each county, of course, was allotted the proportion of the Force it was supposed to be able to raise; but the passing of the Extension of Birmingham Act and the transfer of Handsworth to Warwickshire has, as I say, considerably affected Staffordshire.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02843">One point to which I should like to call particular attention is the fact that it was from a letter written by Colonel Brade from the War Office on August 21, 1912, we received the first intimation that the various County Associations were to deal with this matter themselves. I think I have reason to complain, because the Royal Assent was given to the Birmingham Act as long ago as June 2, 1911, and realising to the full that we in Staffordshire would be considerably prejudiced by the passing of that Extension Act I went myself to the War Office nearly two years before the Act came into force to call their attention to the fact and to beg them to take some steps to prevent any possible friction between the counties in consequence. In his letter Colonel Brade refers to the fact that a strict adherence to regulations would require the transfer of the administration of the units to the Warwickshire County Association, and in order to avoid unnecessary disturbance he suggested that we should make arrangements with the Warwickshire Association. That was, as I say, the first intimation we received that we would have to deal with the matter.</p>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0480"/>
<col>951</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02844">I would like to ask the representative of the War Office what would have happened supposing there had been strict adherence to the regulations and supposing we, as we would have been perfectly justified in doing, had declined the responsibility of raising four units in another county. Why, our action would have dislocated the whole of this scheme. Because if you look at the position you will find that Staffordshire is in the sixth grouped regimental district. It marches on the west with Salop and Cheshire, which are in the fourth grouped regimental district, and on the south with Warwickshire and Worcestershire, which are in the seventh. Therefore if we had declined the responsibility there would have been four units, representing three separate arms, transferred from Staffordshire to Warwickshire, which means that the sixth grouped regimental district would have been representatives of three arms short, while in the seventh grouped regimental district these arms would have been duplicated, which would have entirely destroyed the original scheme, and, I gather, would have made it impossible to carry on. I may say that, as far as Warwickshire, Worcestershire, and Staffordshire are concerned, we have arranged our difficulties, but it has given us a considerable amount of labour, and what I wish to avoid in the future is that it should be left to the respective counties, with all the possibilities of friction, to adjust these matters. I ask in my resolution that the War Office should take upon themselves now to say that no future extension of boundaries shall affect the recruiting areas.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02845">I have had a correspondence with the Secretary of State for War, and there are one or two points in the right hon. gentleman's letter on which I would like to dwell. The Secretary of State says that as the boundaries of Warwickshire have been changed by the Act to which I have referred the sphere of the Warwickshire County Association would, if we took no action, be correspondingly increased. That is exactly what I complain of. It is owing to the inaction of the War Office that the Warwickshire area has been increased and that we proportionately suffer. They left action to us. I suggest to your Lordships that it is not our business to re-arrange recruiting areas. Staffordshire and Worcestershire are very much in the position of the children of Israel in the land of Egypt. In
<col>952</col>
the first instance the genial Pharaoh, who now graces the Woolsack, came down to us and said, "Here is your tale of bricks which you have to complete; the straw will be provided for you to complete your tale." We completed our tale; and then the War Office come down and say, "That, is all very well, but you must keep up your tale of bricks, but we will not provide the straw." That is, I submit, putting us in an unfair position.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02846">The Secretary of State referred to the fact that it would not be fair to Warwickshire to issue orders that they were not to recruit in what was strictly their own area "until we have heard their views." With regard to hearing their views, I suggest that the time to consult the various localities is when the areas are first allotted. There would have been no unfairness to Warwickshire in this instance if that had been done, for Warwickshire and Staffordshire were the first two counties in the whole of the country to complete their establishment. I suggest that the unfairness is not to the county which acquires extra recruiting ground, but to the county which loses it. Another point which was made by the War Office was that they were often attacked for issuing orders without consulting the wishes of the local authorities. There, again, the same argument applies. The time to consult the local authorities was when the original scheme was first introduced.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02847">I urge the noble Lord who represents the War Office to meet me in this matter. I would point out the great tendency there is for the extension of large centres of population. It is happening all over the country, and it is very possible that before long in Staffordshire there will be another question of the extension of an area which may affect the county boundaries, and very possibly it may occur in a locality where there is no room for two Associations. But if the War Office will undertake to do what I suggest there will be no feeling of injury to any one. The trouble comes when you have two neighbouring counties competing for an area where there is not room for both to recruit. This is easily avoidable if a settlement is made before the difficulty arises. We accepted certain responsibilities under certain conditions, and it is not fair to ask us to carry out those responsibilities when the conditions are entirely changed. I beg to make the Motion standing in my name on the Paper.</p>

<col>953</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02848"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the first place I should like to express regret that the noble Earl who has just spoken should feel himself aggrieved in this matter, and I should like to say, on behalf of the Secretary of State, that nothing could possibly be further either from the desires or from the intentions of the War Office than to cause any grievance to one who has worked so whole-heartedly and in so disinterested a way for the furtherance of the interests of the Territorial Army. I hope, therefore, that if there may appear to have been a disagreement the noble Earl will not think that the services he has rendered have been in any way lost sight of. Before dealing with the specific questions which are before the House, I may also say that it is the earnest desire of the War Office to avoid causing any unnecessary friction between County Associations. That is an object which they would always have in view.<lb/>
On the general question, as the noble Earl has stated, the legal position is quite clear, and is as follows. Under the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act an Association may be formed for any county, and a county for territorial purposes coincides with the administrative county; and by an Order in Council of March 19, 1908, Section 59 of the Local Government Act of 1888 was applied to the Territorial Force, thus providing that any changes in county boundaries authorised in pursuance of that Act would be recognised for Territorial Force purposes. Accordingly the area within which an Association is appointed to exercise its powers legally alters with any alteration of the county boundaries, and the reasons for this are not far to seek. The whole basis of the territorial organisation being by counties, and Associations being appointed to represent county interests, it is quite obvious that any wide divergence between the areas of County Associations and the areas of administrative counties would tend to confusion and overlapping, not only between neighbouring Associations, but also between the Associations and the civil county authorities. But while legally the County Association area follows the civil boundary of the county, it is at the same time open to the War Office to direct, on administrative grounds, that particular functions of the Association should be exercised over an area which does not coincide with the county boundaries. In particular
<col>954</col>
the War Office may issue directions as to the areas in which Associations should be allowed to recruit, but these directions are matters of administrative convenience and do not affect the legal position.<lb/>
The recruiting areas allotted to Associations being co-extensive with counties, when a change of county boundaries takes place it is then for the Army Council to decide how the units and detachments of units in the affected areas are to be raised&#x2014;that is to say, whether they shall remain under the administration of the Association out of whose area they have passed or whether they shall be transferred to the Association into whose area they have passed. It is the view of the War Office that each case where there is a disturbance of county boundaries the case must be considered on its merits, for while, on the one hand, it is obviously necessary to preserve as far as possible a county basis of organisation, at the same time it is inexpedient to disturb existing conditions where such disturbance can be avoided. Such cases as these involve an infinity of local considerations of convenience, of prestige, of local sympathies. Therefore before giving a decision in such matters the War Office hold that it is absolutely essential that the views and wishes of the Associations concerned should be ascertained. They do not consider that it would be possible to lay down in advance a general rule for all future cases of change of county boundaries. That is to say, a general rule which would give no consideration to changes of population or of local conditions.<lb/>
With regard to the particular case of the Birmingham area, in 1910 the Local Government Board made a Provisional Order for the enlargement of the boundaries of the borough of Birmingham, and as that borough is reckoned within the county of Warwick the effect was to transfer certain districts from Staffordshire and from Worcestershire to Warwickshire. The Bill was passed in June of last year, and the first communication, I believe, that was received direct from an Association by the War Office was in the middle of December of last year. A considerable delay then occurred owing to certain difficulties in collecting the necessary facts, and also the War Office were of opinion that, while it
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0482"/>
<col>955</col>
was obviously necessary that a decision should be come to in due course, it was not specially necessary for hurried intervention so long as no difficulties arose between the Associations. But having collected these facts it became evident that the general principle hitherto followed, that Associations should administer all the operations of units within their own county areas, was contravened in several instances, and that such contravention was likely to lead to confusion in administration generally and particularly in recruiting. Difficulties were also foreseen to be possible through the overlapping of civil representatives of Associations on the question of police jurisdiction, nursing committees, National Reserve registration, and other points, all of which points, in the opinion of the War Office, would be much more obvious to those actually concerned in the local administration than they would be to the War Office. Therefore, before deciding whether any transfer of units should or should not be made, a letter was sent to the three Associations concerned pointing out the position under the Act, and asking them to confer and to recommend a solution which would be mutually satisfactory. This solution, I understand, has actually been arrived at in the present case. But as regards the whole position of the matter the point of view of the War Office is that in these questions the local conditions can only really be properly ascertained by obtaining the views of the various Associations concerned, and it is, therefore, essential that the Associations concerned should in the first instance consider and discuss the matter to see whether any arrangement could not be come to. Obviously if no arrangement could be come to then the War Office must take such measures as appear necessary, but at the same time they would assist in every way the County Associations in arriving at some conclusion.<lb/>
With regard to the actual Motion on the Paper, the War Office feel that they cannot tie their hands for the future, but must preserve the right to decide a matter of administration in accordance with the merits of each case. While it is only logical to preserve as far as possible a close co-relation between the county areas and the recruiting areas, as the whole organisation of the Territorial Force is based on counties, at the same time practical considerations of administration
<col>956</col>
may make it undesirable in special cases to interfere with pre-existing recruiting arrangements. I fear that the Government are unable to accept the Motion of the noble Earl as it stands on the Paper, and I venture to think that possibly your Lordships may hesitate in accepting the Motion in view of the fact that you would thereby be binding yourselves to retain indefinitely the same recruiting areas as were instituted, in the original Act. I do not know whether j the noble Earl might think it worth while to alter his Resolution and with the object of placing on record the protest which he has made. If it would meet his views to alter it by omitting all the words after "scheme," and inserting the words "without consultation with the County Associations concerned," then the Government would be quite prepared to accept that amended Resolution. But as it stands the Government would have to resist the Motion.</membercontribution></p>

I endeavoured as far as I could to find out what Acts did affect the Territorial Force, and that is one which was overlooked.

<title>THE PURCHASE OF SILVER FOR INDIA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02852"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD INCHCAPE</member> rose to call attention to recent purchases of silver on behalf of the Government of India, and to inquire whether any decision has been reached regarding the coinage of gold in India; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02853">The noble Lord said: My Lords, it is within your Lordships' knowledge that some discussion has recently taken place in regard to a new departure made by the India Office in their system of purchasing silver required for silver coinage in India. As your Lordships are aware, after the Mints in India were closed to the free coinage of silver some nineteen years ago when Lord Lansdowne was Viceroy, the Government undertook to provide until further notice the silver currency required by the public at the price of 1<i>s</i>. 4<i>d.</i> per rupee, or 15 rupees to the pound sterling. To meet the demand for rupee coinage, which cannot conveniently at times be given out of the Currency Note Reserve, the Government are obliged to purchase silver and to coin this silver into rupees precisely as His Majesty's Government in this country do in regard to the silver coinage here. To some small extent it has been possible to buy silver in India, but practically the whole of the silver required for currency in India has had to be purchased on the London market. Up to a few months ago the India Office employed the Bank of England to buy their silver, but recently the purchases appear to have been made through a firm of bullion brokers in the City, and the change of purchasing agent has led to some criticism. I am convinced that the change was only introduced because it was believed that it would be to the advantage of the Indian taxpayer, but I think it would be convenient if the noble Marquess the Secretary of State for India were to explain to your Lordships the circumstances which led him to sanction the change.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02854">To move from silver to gold when the Mints in India were closed to the free coinage of silver the sovereign was made legal tender at the ratio of 15 rupees to the &#x00A3;1 and sonic years ago&#x2014;in 1901&#x2014;when Lord Curzon was Viceroy and when Lord George Hamilton was Secretary of State for India, a proposal went from Whitehall to the Government of India, with the approval of the Lords of the
<col>958</col>
Treasury, for the coinage of sovereigns in that country, so that the gold produced in India might be coined there instead of having to be sent home. If my memory does not betray me, the arrangements would have gone through, but the Government of India at that time ascertained that the Indian mining companies preferred, for reasons known to themselves, to send the gold home, and the Government of India were of opinion that there was, therefore, nothing to be gained by establishing a branch of the Royal Mint in Bombay. Looking to the fact that the gold standard had been established in India and that sovereigns and half-sovereigns were legal tender and were beginning to circulate freely throughout the country, I think it was unfortunate that the suggestion made by the Secretary of State in 1901 was not then accepted. It was true, no doubt, that the Indian gold mining companies at the time found it convenient to ship their gold home and that only a small amount of gold at the outside might have been offered for coinage; but seeing that the standard of value had been changed from silver to gold I think it would have been better if facilities had been offered for the free coinage of gold in India. The question of opening the Mints to the coinage of gold has lately been raised again, and I venture to ask the noble Marquess whether there is any likelihood of his being disposed to urge once more on the Government of India, as Lord George Hamilton did, the desirability of giving facilities for the coinage of gold in India. I beg to move.</p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02856"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SWAYTHLING</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it would be in the interests of the House if I intervened for a moment in this discussion, and in doing so I venture to ask your Lordships to extend to me that kind indulgence which you always extend to Members who address you for the first time. I am sorry that, after a history of business of over sixty years, it is necessary for me to defend my firm against attacks which have been made in the public Press and in the other House of Parliament. Those attacks have been made under various heads. The first and most important is
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0484"/>
<col>959</col>
a charge made in several newspapers that my firm has conspired corruptly with my brother, the Under-Secretary for India, to obtain a large order for the purchase of silver for the Indian Government. I would like to state to the House that from first to last my firm has had no correspondence or communication whatsoever with my brother, the Under-Secretary. From the commencement to the end all the orders were conveyed to us from the Secretary of State for India in Council, on which body, I am informed, my brother has no seat, and in connection with whose proceedings he has no vote and is not allowed to speak. The purchases and orders were regulated by the Finance Committee through their Chairman, and I am informed that my brother was never present at a single meeting at which the question of the purchase of silver was discussed, although I believe that technically he has a right to attend. I wish also to state to the House that I have never had a conversation with my brother on Indian finance since he has been Under-Secretary for India except on one occasion when, after the comparative failure of the last Indian Loan, I said to him that I thought it was the duty of the country, when it desired to borrow, to consult the lenders&#x2014;in other words, that it should go into the market and discover whether long-dated bonds were required by the market and then issue long-dated bonds, or whether the market required short-dated bonds, in which case short-dated bonds should be issued. With this single exception I have never discussed Indian finance with my brother, nor has any member of my firm to my knowledge, and I understand that he has nothing to do, in the way the Office is arranged, with Indian finance of any kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02857"><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02858"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SWAYTHLING</member><membercontribution>: I need not refer, I think, to the reasons why the order of the India Council was given to my firm. Anything that can be said on that matter the noble Marquess the Leader of the House will be able to say better than I can. But I think I may say this one thing, that it is common knowledge that a ring was formed some time ago in India for the purpose of "rigging" the market against the Indian Government.
<col>960</col>
There are only four firms who deal largely in silver in London, and three of these had acted and were acting at the time for this ring. That left one firm, our firm, which was the only one not connected with this speculative ring. I would also like to say that when in the instructions to us secrecy was made one of the chief objects, the reason will be evident to the House. When you have a large purchase of silver to make it is desirable that it should be kept secret in order to avoid the probable or the certain rise that would occur in the market if that information leaked out. We were verbally informed that after the reasons for secrecy were over the India Council would probably go back to their old channels for purchasing. We acted absolutely under the daily instructions of the Finance Committee who gave us orders for half a million and a quarter of a million at a time, sometimes telling us to abstain from and sometimes telling us to resume purchase&#x2014;at one time telling us to abstain quite for a long time because of the uncertainty of the monsoon, under which circumstances, if this proved unfavourable, they might not have required to purchase as much silver or perhaps no more.<lb/>
Practically no inkling of the purchase crept out until the first shipments of silver had arrived in India and were sent to the Mint. We were complimented by the Indian banks, whose business it was to find such a fact out, on the way in which the secret of the India Council was kept, and we had a letter of thanks from the India Council for the way we had carried out their instructions. Your Lordships can therefore imagine the surprise and disappointment we experienced when we read the attacks upon us in the public Press, chiefly through lack of information. One newspaper&#x2014;and the statement was copied into a great many others&#x2014;actually published a statement that the Under-Secretary was a member of my firm. I do not think it is necessary for me to say that he has never had, and has not now, any connection whatsoever with our firm, beyond the fact that he has a few hundred pounds which were deposited with us at interest when he was a boy and which still remains with us. That is the only connection in any way between my brother and the firm, and I wish to contradict any question of his having any further connection with our firm. I can only imagine
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0485"/>
<col>961</col>
that some of the attacks on our firm and on the Indian Government have been instigated by the speculators in India who, having carried their silver holdings for several months, losing interest thereon, were balked of the huge profits, not confined to the &#x00A3;99,000 mentioned in the House of Commons, but of a far larger sum which they had expected to make from the India Council.<lb/>
The third subject with which I must trouble your Lordships is a reference in the public Press to the statement that on tenders to the India Council there was an intimation that firms having a partner in the House of Commons must not tender. This may be so, but I have never seen such a clause, nor till now have I heard of such a clause. We never made any tender to the Indian Government, and no such clause appears in any of the instructions sent to us nor in our sale notes to them. It never occurred to me nor to any of my partners that such a rule would apply any more in this case than with regard to transactions with Canada or any other part of the Empire.<lb/>
The fourth subject, and the last, to which I would like to refer is the attack that has been made upon us because of the large loans that we have had from the India Council during the past year. We have done business of this kind with the India Council for over twenty-seven years, as other firms have done, and I would like to mention that these sums that have been lent to us have frequently been of large amounts. During last year the largest amount it ever reached was &#x00A3;1,050,000. I have in my hand some figures which I have had looked up, and I find that in May, 1909, before my brother was Under-Secretary, the figures reached &#x00A3;850,000, and in February, 1905, when there was no Liberal Government in power, the amount was exactly the same. The reason that it has increased to &#x00A3;1,050,000 is this. When the India Council are large and anxious lenders in the market their loans are governed by three considerations: first, the willingness of the borrowers to take the money from the India Council; secondly, the trustworthiness of the approved borrowers; and, thirdly, whether those firms approved have sufficient of the particular securities
<col>962</col>
which the India Council requires when it makes loans to approved borrowers. As far as the question of the willingness of borrowers to take these loans is concerned, that depends on the market value of money. At the time of these large loans from the India Council the rate was 2&#x00BD; per cent. during a short period, as mentioned in the Press, but the rate varies, and at the present moment the rate charged by the India Council is 4&#x00BC; per cent., so that the statement that they borrow at 3&#x00BD; per cent. and lend at 2&#x00BD;, per cent. certainly does not apply at the present moment as they are making a profit. But I do not wish to enter into that question at the moment.<lb/>
As to the third point, which is the most important&#x2014;the question of the sufficiency of securities of the particular kind required from the approved borrowers&#x2014;it is well known that so large were the amounts during this year that were at one time lent out by the India Council that there was a scarcity of these particular securities among the approved borrowers, and for that reason the India Council lent large sums to the clearing banks generally at lower rates than they could have lent to the approved borrowers if the approved borrowers had more of the securities upon which they could borrow from the India Council; and I can only believe that it was because my firm happened to be the holders of a large amount of "short-dated floaters," as these securities are called, that the amount reached this large figure, although it is only &#x00A3;200,000 more than the loans to us under previous Governments.<lb/>
I have to thank your Lordships for the kind manner in which you have listened to what I have had to say. If there is any further information upon these transactions which, after the noble Marquess has answered the noble Lord who initiated this discussion, the House would like me to give and it is in my power to give it, I am perfectly willing to do so. I have waited under attacks against my personal honour and the honour of my firm until this opportunity has occurred for me to address you, and I am very grateful to the noble Lord that the Question he has put on the Paper has enabled me so to address you.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02859"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was greatly interested in the remarks of the noble Lord who brought tins subject to our notice to-day, and I listened very sympathetically to what fell from the noble Lord who has just sat down. Personally I do not look at this matter of the Gold Reserves from the political point of view. In fact, so far as that goes I think the India Council have been right in the majority of the actions they have taken. I look at the matter from the business point of view, because business circles are greatly interested in the position of the Gold Reserves held in India and here for the India rupees. More interest has been excited lately than would otherwise have been the case by reason of three or four very good articles that have appeared in <i>The Times,</i> evidently written by an expert. When the Indian Government came to the conclusion that a sovereign was to represent 15 rupees they put India practically on a gold basis. In the meanwhile the India Council bought a great amount of silver bullion because of the great demand for rupees and coined the bullion into rupees, which were worth a great deal more than the bullion. The result of that transaction over a series of years is that we have now &#x00A3;20,000,000 in the Gold Reserve of India, which is invested partly in gold, but the greater part in securities. That opens a very interesting question. I am told that the Gold Reserve is to be increased by &#x00A3;5,000,000, which is wise and right. I cannot think it was good finance on the part of the Council when they took part of the reserves which they had accumulated from the coinage and used it for other purposes, such as constructing railways, and so on. The amount of profit made out of the coinage should have been kept wholly and solely for the purpose of redeeming silver in gold if tendered. The balances in London appear to have been too large lately, but I am told there is good reason for that. It is that short-time bonds are maturing in large amount, and the money is held to pay the bonds as they fall due. That is the proper course to pursue.<lb/>
Now we come to the difficulties. First of all, should the Gold Reserve that we have be kept in India? To that I answer, Yes; and for this reason. The promissory note in the shape of the rupee will be
<col>964</col>
presented in India, and the gold ought to be there to pay it. The next question is whether the &#x00A3;15,000,000 or &#x00A3;18,000,000 which is the greater part of the Gold Reserve, should be kept in gold or in securities. Academically speaking, it should be kept in gold, but that is a very costly proceeding, entailing a loss of interest of &#x00A3;600,000 or &#x00A3;700,000 a year. Is there any danger of so sudden a rush for gold in India in exchange for the rupee that the India Council would not have time to telegraph to England to sell securities and remit gold to India? It is not easy to get &#x00A3;10,000,000 of gold in a short space of time, but with all the reserve we have in London and the well-known credit the Indian Government enjoys I would have thought that there was no fear of a sudden rush for gold. Writers in the Press take the view that all the reserve ought to be kept in gold. My commercial mind does not like the idea of throwing away &#x00A3;600,000 or &#x00A3;700,000 interest if it can be helped, and I do not think the necessity is great enough to justify us in keeping all the reserve in gold. I may be a heretic in this matter. I allow that gold is the bedrock of credit, but I think our experience must count for something, and if we kept the whole of the reserve in gold it would be an expensive luxury indeed. I hope that the noble Marquess will give some indication of what is in his mind, because this is an important business point.</membercontribution></p>

It is, indeed, true that for a considerable time past a series of attacks have been made in different quarters both upon the India Office as a whole and upon various individuals in and out of that Office.
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0487"/>
<col>965</col>
So far as the general system of assault upon the financial methods of the India Office is concerned, that is no new story. There always have been a number of people who have taken distinct exception to our methods and proceedings, and very often from quite different points of view. Some of the criticisms which have been made from Indian sources in India represent, generally speaking, a kind of national Indian <i>amour propre,</i> which resents the fact that so large a part of Indian financial business should be conducted here in London and not in the Peninsula itself. That, like all questions of <i>amour propre,</i> is a sentiment with which it is not always easy to argue. But there has also been a more definite line of attack from those same natives of India and also from a great many Anglo-Indians engaged in business in India, who have regarded with suspicion the kind of deference which they say that we at the India Office show to the opinion of the City of London, thereby sacrificing the commercial interests of those engaged in business in India&#x2014;they are not for the moment speaking of the Indian taxpayer and revenue-producer, but those engaged in business&#x2014;in favour of those engaged in business in London.<lb/>
As the noble Lord who has just sat down reminded us, there has been lately a series of articles in <i>The Times,</i> written, as that newspaper was careful to point out, from a distinct and somewhat biased standpoint, but representing, no doubt, a certain volume of opinion in India. Those articles covered practically the whole ground of Indian finance in all its aspects. I do not propose to touch at any length upon a great many of those points, but to confine myself so far as possible to the two questions raised by my noble friend Lord Inchcape in his Question. But it is important that the House should realise what the character of some of the other attacks made upon us has been, and for that purpose I will read an extract, from an article in an evening newspaper of, I suppose, large circulation and at any rate a great reputation in the past&#x2014;I mean the <i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i> The <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> of October 31 said&#x2014;
<quote>"It is quite evident now that the scandals of India Office finance are going to be brought into the light of day. Only an Edmund Burke could do full justice to their magnitude. The venality of the Nabobs of an earlier era, the evils of Tammany Hall, the revelations of Radical rapacity in other directions in recent years, all become insignificant

when compared with the vast and impudent perversities which have been organised in Whitehall M the last six or seven years. The ramifications of the affair are very serious. Some names hitherto honoured are about to be called in question. The abuses are of varying forms, and have escaped attention chiefly by reason of their incredible size and their astonishing effrontery. Sometimes institutions and corporations have derived benefit, while the individuals really concerned are in the background; at other times the 'benefits' have been more directly individual. It is only when we get down to the way Indian Loans have been floated in the London Money Market that we begin to realise the practices going on unchecked, while Secretaries of State, present and past, have been persistently fooled and hoodwinked. We repeat that this is going to be a very nasty business."</quote>
We are passing generally through a phase of violent and unqualified statement in many places and on many subjects, a phase which has lasted for some time, but which I hope will not last for ever. If, for instance, we were now to read in an article that one controversialist had said of another that his proper fate ought to be that he should be publicly impaled in Trafalgar Square and that his disembowelled carcase should be exposed on a gibbet on the Horse Guards Parade, we should feel entitled to infer that the two gentlemen concerned perhaps did not, as the phrase is, see altogether eye to eye on some question affecting the elementary education of youth, or perhaps the importation of manufactured goods from abroad. But even after making all allowance for the habits of to-day, one would not be surprised if on reading an article such as that which I have just quoted people outside ventured to surmise that something was slightly wrong. Therefore it is desirable that an authoritative statement should be made in relation to these purchases of silver about which my noble friend has asked.<lb/>
In making that statement I can testify to the complete accuracy of everything which HI from my noble friend Lord Swaythling in relation to the part played by his firm. As is well known, the Government of India is always prepared to give rupees in India&#x2014;silver coins&#x2014;in exchange for gold. Rupees in India are an unlimited tender, just as 5 franc pieces are in France and silver dollars are in the United States. Of course that fact does not mean that either France or the United States or India has adopted a bi-metallic system, because that would involve the opening of the mints in these respective countries to the free coinage of silver for anybody who chose to tender that, metal
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0488"/>
<col>967</col>
There is, in fact, a single standard of exchange&#x2014;that is to say, gold&#x2014;although there is a double standard of value in the country itself in the case of all those three nations. The result has been that since the recommendations of the Fowler Committee were accepted the rupee has remained stable at the value of 1<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.&#x2014;the fifteenth of a &#x00A3;1. It is important to note that the number of rupees issued does not rest on any act of the Government, but is the act of the public in India. The number of rupees required depends on the amount of gold which the Indian public chooses to tender desiring to receive rupees in exchange. The Government of India holds its rupees in large quantities, partly in the Paper Currency Reserve in India and to a smaller extent in the silver branch of the Gold Standard Reserve.<lb/>
The usual custom for many years past in India has been that somewhere about the 1st of October, at which time the busy trade season in India begins and rupees are likely to be in great demand, the Government of India should at that time hold in rupees something like sixteen millions sterling, or, in the rupee term, 24 crores of rupees. During the trade season that stock diminishes as rupees are asked for in the course of business, and in the following spring, before the slack season begins, the Government of India has to make up its mind whether in the following October, in order to be in the position of strength signified by the sum which I have mentioned, it will have to engage in smile purchase of silver and coin it into rupees. That is not always an entirely simple matter to decide. A great deal depends upon the character of the monsoon, upon which, as your Lordships know, the prosperity of India and Indian trade so largely depend. If there is a very bad monsoon and trade is consequently slack the demand for rupees may become very much less, and the Government reserve may therefore not be diminished to the extent anticipated. It is therefore by no means an automatic process to purchase silver, particularly in any given quantity, at the beginning of any one year. In the spring of this year it became quite evident, as the stock of rupees was getting low, that purchases would have to be made. As a matter of fact that proved to be the case to a very large extent indeed. As a matter of fact, purchases of silver to the extent of some-
<col>968</col>
thing like six millions sterling were proved to be necessary from the early part of this year.<lb/>
It is important to note one or two facts in relation to silver. One is that the fluctuations in the price of silver are both marked and sometimes rapid. The change in the price of silver moves sometimes between two figures involving no small difference where large sums are concerned. In the ten years between 1902 and 1911 inclusive, silver was at one time quoted at 211/1&#x2159;<i>d.</i> to the standard ounce, and the highest rate reached during that period was 331/1&#x2159;<i>d.</i> I will show in a moment what the bearing of that fact might be expected to be upon the transactions in which we were engaged. Then, as my noble friend behind me has pointed out, there was no doubt whatever that speculators in India, acting perfectly within their rights, as speculators may and do act, and foreseeing the probability that large purchases of silver would have to be made on behalf of the Government, made up their minds that there was a chance of driving up the price and thereby making a profit, which might be very large indeed.<lb/>
If your Lordships will forgive my quoting again I would quote from a well-known Indian newspaper, the <i>Pioneer.</i> In its mail edition of December 11 last year it stated&#x2014;
<quote>"The silver position has of late caused a good deal of anxiety to those interested in the welfare of the metal, the turn of the wheel having once more put the key of the situation into the hands of the Bombay group of speculators, whose operations have for long been watched with keen interest, and who have held on to their venture with such pluck and tenacity through good and evil report &#x2026; The recent movement has shown very clearly to what a large extent the Bombay group of speculators are able to control the market, and how readily they rise to the occasion."</quote>
And then on January 29 it said&#x2014;
<quote>"To these men [the speculators] the question of the hour is, What will be the policy of the Indian Government in respect of their currency requirements? Will they have to come on the market very soon and buy largely for coinage purposes, or will they be able to hold off as they have done over the last years? The latest returns show a gradually diminishing stock of rupees. &#x2026; It is a long time now since the Bombay Syndicate embarked on their venture, and more than once Las shipwreck appeared imminent. &#x2026; Heavy buying by the Indian Government would certainly assist to this end&#x2014;</quote>
that is, to the success of their venture&#x2014;
<quote>"and it is for that that they have been waiting."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0489"/>
<col>969</col>
Those statements, I think, confirm what Lord Swaythling said of the general opinion as to the existence of an Indian ring determined to push up the price of silver.<lb/>
Then, as my noble friend stated, the position as regards the purchase of silver is complicated and obviously made more difficult by the fact that there are only four firms in the City of London who act as bullion brokers. Our usual custom in the past has been to employ the Bank of England to arrange these purchases for us. They have employed two particular firms of brokers, firms of high standing and repute, and they intimated that when purchases were made through the Bank of England again they would feel bound to still employ those same firms. That left only two firms if the business was to be done in a manner which would not excite the suspicion of the silver speculators, and oblige us, therefore, to go to much greater expense in making our large purchase; and of those two firms&#x2014;both I need not say, of high standing&#x2014;the Finance Committee at the India Office chose my noble friend's firm, the firm of Samuel Montagu and Co., because their dealings were considerably the largest, and it was supposed, I believe rightly, that the particular transactions could in practice be carried out by them and by them only. It is right, in view of the character of the attacks that have been made, to state who the Finance Committee of the India Office are by whose agency these transactions took place. The chairman of my Finance Committee at the India Office is Sir Felix Schuster, very well known in the City and especially as the chairman of the Union of London and Smith's Bank. The other financial member of the Council is a gentleman connected with an equally well-known bank&#x2014;Mr. Lawrence Currie, of the firm of Glyn, Mills and Currie. The other members of the Finance Committee are Sir Charles Egerton, who is well known as a distinguished officer of long and varied Indian experience; Sir Krishna Gupta, whose Indian experience is also well known, he having been for a long time a valued public servant in India; and Sir Theodore Morison, the character of whose service in India is also well known to your Lordships. And I ought to add that during the whole carrying out of these transactions the advice and concurrence was obtained throughout of a gentleman whose pre-
<col>970</col>
mature loss we all deeply regret both on public and private grounds&#x2014;I mean my friend Sir Richmond Ritchie, the late Permanent Under-Secretary at the India Office. Those are the men, with myself at their head, about whom language is used in the public Press of a character of which I have given a specimen to the House. Abuse of that kind, of course, does not hurt any of those gentlemen individually, but I suppose a certain amount of mud sometimes sticks when it is thrown, and it is therefore desirable, even at this length, to explain quite fully all the circumstances and the reasons for the action which the Council of India took.<lb/>
The effect of the employment of Messrs. Samuel Montagu and Co. for this purpose was entirely successful. It is, I think, an undoubted fact that it was not known to those who were interested in increasing the price of silver that the purchases of Messrs. Montagu, carefully made, as I believe, in a great number of different quarters, were made on behalf of the Government of India, and consequently the market movements were not such as to oblige us to pay more than a moderate price for the silver which we bought. I am informed that the commission actually earned by Messrs. Montagu and Co. on the entire transaction amounted to &#x00A3;7,513. That, no doubt, is a considerable sum of money, but it is not a very large sum for us all to agree to sell our souls for in the manner that we have been accused of doing by these critics. Now as regards the saving which was effected to India, I stated just now the figures for the highest and the lowest prices of silver within the last ten years. The difference of a purchase, at the highest of those prices and the lowest, of &#x00A3;6,000,000 worth of silver would have been &#x00A3;3,150,000&#x2013;52 per cent., that is to say, being the range of prices during that period. Of course, I do not pretend for a moment that by taking the course we did we saved a sum of that magnitude or anything approaching it, but I do say with the utmost confidence that by, employing the firm of Montagu to buy silver in this particular way and thus defeat the operations of the Market a saving of many hundreds of thousands of pounds was made to the revenues of India; and I venture to state, therefore, that the course which we took in employing that firm
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0490"/>
<col>971</col>
for this purpose was absolutely justified by the result.<lb/>
There is, of course, the further point to which my noble friend behind me alluded&#x2014;the fact that his brother, Mr. E. S. Montagu is Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the India Office, and that fact has been made the groundwork of a charge against Mr. Montagu, against the firm, and against ourselves. I have endeavoured to show, I am afraid at rather excessive length, exactly why the Finance Committee, authorised by the Council to do so, employed Messrs. Montagu for the purpose of this purchase, and the question we have to ask is, Was the purely nominal connection between that firm and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary a bar to a transaction which was of such real moment in saving the money of India? In our view&#x2014;and it is a view which I still maintain&#x2014;the circumstances were so special and of such a critical character that we should have been unwise and wrong on the bare fact of the relationship between Mr. Montagu and my noble friend to sacrifice that great advantage to the Government of India. It must be remembered that as a matter of fact Mr. Montagu has no more to do with the finance of India at the India Office than he has to do with the finance of the Panama Canal, and he has no more connection with the firm of Samuel Montagu and Co. than he has with the firm of Marshall and Snelgrove. Thus, the facts being as they are, I cannot think that we should have been right, in obedience to a possible prejudice against the blood relationship of the Under-Secretary and the head of the firm, to have sacrificed this great benefit, although I entirely agree that in such matters appearances are important and cannot be altogether ignored.<lb/>
Some of your Lordships may remember a debate which took place at the close of the year 1900, raised by my noble friend Lord Rosebery, who is not now in the House, with reference to the appointment of Lord Hardwicke to the same post as that which Mr. Montagu now fills. The late Lord Hardwicke was a valued friend of many of your Lordships, and I have pleasure in thinking that he left behind him at the India Office a tradition not merely of particular popularity but
<col>972</col>
also of efficiency as an Under-Secretary which certainly none of his successors has ever surpassed. As a matter of fact, when he was appointed he was a partner in a firm of stockbrokers in the City&#x2014;work which he undertook in circumstances which did him all the credit in the world&#x2014;and he explained, in accepting from Lord Salisbury the position of Under-Secretary for India, that although he could not cease to be a partner in the firm, because he had to think of his future, yet he would not take any active part in its business while holding office and would altogether relinquish an active share in the conduct of the firm. I thought at the time, and still think, that Lord Hardwicke made out a good case. But in connection with this particular charge against our present Under-Secretary it is fair, I think, to remind the House that Lord Hardwicke did remain a partner of a firm of stockbrokers, which at any rate involves, I think, a closer connection with the City of London than the fact of the relationship between my noble friend and Mr. Montagu which has given rise to such embittered attacks upon both. I hope I have disposed of that part of my noble friend's Question relating to the purchase of silver.<lb/>
As regards the coinage of gold, as Lord Faber reminded us, in 1899 the Fowler Committee recommended that the sovereign should become legal tender at the value of 15 rupees. That was enacted the same year and has been the law ever since. A long time ago&#x2014;before 1835&#x2014;there used to be a real double standard in India. The gold mohur was a gold coin of the value of 15 rupees, and although it was not often seen or greatly used in actual currency it was one of the legal Indian coins. But since that time, although I dare say many of your Lordships have seen gold mohurs; they are as a matter of fact gold medals worth their weight in gold but have no established position as coins now that the sovereign and half-sovereign are the gold coins of India. As the noble Lord said, the Fowler Committee also recommended that sovereigns should be coined in India, that there should be a Mint for gold coinage there, and a long correspondence took place between the India Office and the Government of India at that time on the subject of instituting such a Mint. One difficulty,
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0491"/>
<col>973</col>
which perpetually exists in connection with this subject, is that if you start a Mint in India for coining sovereigns and half-sovereigns it must be a branch of the Royal Mint, and therefore, so far as it coins those particular coins, under Treasury control, and that has always been regarded as a difficulty, though possibly not an insuperable difficulty, in starting a Mint of that kind in India. Then Lord Faber pointed out that in 1902 the Government of India found that the gold of the Indian mines was being sent, I imagine under some kind of contract, to England, and was therefore not available for the purposes of coinage in India, and that being so they thought it better to drop the question altogether. Lord George Hamilton, who was at that time Secretary of State, agreed that that was the wisest course to take, and from that day until quite lately there have been no communications between the Government of India and the India Office on the subject.<lb/>
But last year and the year before the question of an Indian Mint was raised in some detail on the Imperial Legislative Council, and the idea was certainly not unsympathetically received by those who spoke on behalf of the Government. So far as the foundation of a Mint for British coinage is concerned, the objections and difficulties which existed to having a branch of the Royal Mint in India of course are still there. But there is another claim for which much, I think, may be said, and I may tell the House frankly that if the Government of India favour the adoption of such a plan, as it is quite possible they may, I personally should give my assent to it, and that is for the institution of a gold coinage in India of Indian coin. The denomination of the coin which I think would probably be the most convenient would be a ten rupee piece&#x2014;that is to say, a gold coin of the value of 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. It is too early yet to say whether a plan of that kind will be seriously contemplated by the Government of India, and still more whether or not it will be soon set on foot; but so far as I am able to form an opinion I think that the foundation of such a Mint would, at any rate to some extent, satisfy Indian opinion on the subject, and would get rid of such difficulties as exist in connection with a branch of the Royal Mint in that country.<lb/>
<col>974</col>
It is, of course, impossible to say how far gold coins, whether sovereigns or ten rupee pieces, will be now or will be in the future generally used in India. I think there are signs, however, that the almost instinctive habit of hoarding gold which at one time was so marked in India, is being to a considerable extent broken through. The fear of an investment as distinct from a stocking, which was present to the mind of so many Indians of all grades from the highest to the lowest in the past, is, I should venture to hope, greatly diminishing. For instance, there have been hopeful signs in the direction of investment in such a fact that the great iron works lately started in Bengal by Messrs. Tata Brothers, with a very large capital, hundreds of thousands of pounds, represent, with the exception of an almost ridiculously small fraction, Indian money and Indian money only. That is a satisfactory and hopeful fact, possessing a certain bearing on this question of currency, and therefore I should think that we may venture to look forward with some confidence to an increased use of a gold currency in India among the people, although it may be a long and indefinite time before it becomes the habitual or favourite coin of the country at large.<lb/>
There are one or two other matters which are not covered by the question of my noble friend and with which, therefore, I will not deal at any length, but as they were raised by the noble Lord opposite and one of them was touched on by my noble friend Lord Swaythling I will speak of them very briefly. One is the question of the loans to approved firms made by the Secretary of State for India in Council from our home balances. Lord Swaythling explained very clearly the circumstances in which those loans are made, and it is not necessary for me to repeat anything that he said. I will only say this, that it is quite possible to exaggerate the favour which is done by the Council of India to such firms as those who take these loans. Bearing in mind the standing of the firms and the security which they have to offer, I appeal to the noble Lord opposite, who as a partner in a very distinguished bank is thoroughly cognisant of these subjects, whether it is not the fact that these particular gentlemen to whom we lend money could, if they wanted it, get it anywhere else.</membercontribution></p>

<col>975</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02862"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: That being so, it is rather ridiculous to attempt to pick out the names of particular institutions and firms as being favoured by us in some astonishing manner, as though they were going begging all over the world to raise money and we from our hoards produced money which they could not find elsewhere. Then the noble Lord said a word on the subject of the Gold Standard Reserve, and I was certainly glad, especially in view of the showers of abuse which we have been receiving from so many different quarters, to find that he was good enough to express some general approval of the manner in which we invest a considerable part of that reserve in first-class securities over here. It is true also, as he added, that we are about to keep &#x00A3;5,000,000 in gold in this country. That is an addition to our securities in a form which I have been for some time anxious to bring about, and so far as I am personally concerned I should not at all mind if the amount were somewhat increased. But if it were to be increased to a very large extent the consideration which the noble Lord pointed out with such force conies into mind&#x2014;that if we lock up an enormous sum of gold in a reserve without absolute necessity for doing it, we are sacrificing the interest of the Indian taxpayer and the revenues of India to an extent which might, and I think would, lay us open to reasonable criticism.<lb/>
I have heard it suggested by Indian gentlemen of standing that it would be a grand thing if we had an Indian Gold Reserve here in bullion of &#x00A3;100,000,000 sterling, that it would place India in a splendid position, and I have also heard it added that this would add very much to the strength of our own position, of the British position in the world's markets, because it would be known&#x2014;although I think if these arguments were mentioned in India it might to some extent destroy the attractiveness of the idea&#x2014;that, after all, this &#x00A3;100,000,000 would be at our disposal if ever we wanted it. I think India would be entitled to say that if Great Britain wants to keep a Gold Reserve of &#x00A3;100,000,000 it is possible for her to do it, but she ought to do it herself, and that to ask India to sacrifice &#x00A3;3,000,000 or &#x00A3;4,000,000 of revenue for that purpose is scarcely a fair demand. The noble Lord expressed the view that the bullion of the Gold Standard Reserve ought, at any rate in fairness, to be kept in India rather than in England. I know that that view is held
<col>976</col>
by some people in India as well as here. I do not think myself it is a point of very great importance, but it is fair in this connection to point out that there is a great deal of gold in India. The Paper Currency Reserve at this moment has got 18,000,000 sovereigns in gold, which, although it is the Paper Currency Reserve, is, of course, available in the last resort for the maintenance of the standard.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02864"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Yes; and that being so, although I am prepared to keep an open mind on the point, I do not feel sure that there is anything substantial to be gained from the Indian point of view by not keeping the Gold Standard Reserve here, where in one sense, I think the noble Lord will agree, it is closer to the demand than it would be in India itself. I think, my Lords, those are all the points on which I have to touch. I must apologise for having detained the House at such length, but the personal aspect of the case obliged me to enter into it in a great deal of detail, and I hope that noble Lords opposite will think that I have dealt fairly and satisfactorily with the various charges which have been brought against us in connection with these different matters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02865"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should be very sorry if the importance of this subject were to be measured by the size of the audience which has assembled to listen to our discussion this afternoon. As a matter of fact, it is scarcely possible to imagine a subject more worthy of detailed scrutiny by either House of Parliament at the present moment than Indian finance, and I hope that our discussion this afternoon, which has ranged over only a small portion of the field, may be the prelude to another debate on another day in a fuller House, when with greater advantage we may be able to deal with the branches of the question not discussed to-day. With the concluding remarks of the Secretary of State I am sure we shall all agree. There is not one of us who does not think that the noble Marquess was entirely justified in taking this opportunity of making a statement, irrespective of our views about the strength of the case that he has put forward. He was not only justified, in my view, in taking, but was bound to take, an early opportunity of
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0493"/>
<col>977</col>
giving his views to Parliament, because of the undoubted feeling of uneasiness that has existed for some time both in India and in England as to the present management of Indian finance.<lb/>
Several expressions of that feeling of uneasiness have been alluded to this afternoon. We have had references made to the articles in <i>The Times,</i> to Questions that have been asked in the Legislative Councils in India, and, I might add, to Questions that are being asked from day to day in the House of Commons. As regards the articles in <i>The Times</i>, the authorship of which is quite unknown to me, although the writer is evidently a man cognisant with his subject, I should like to say that there is a good deal in those articles with which I am not in personal sympathy, and there are several charges made by the writer to which I think a good answer can be made. Still less am I in sympathy with the sort of language which the Secretary of State quoted this afternoon. It was language which by its own violence defeats itself, and which I am sure I may pass by without another word. But I do not think the Secretary of State can complain that this feeling of insecurity and apprehension prevails, to which the Questions in the other House of Parliament are so eloquent a witness. It is almost the inevitable corollary of the system of secrecy, I might almost say mystery&#x2014;though, perhaps, secrecy is sometimes inevitable&#x2014;that attends the manipulation&#x2014;I use the word in no invidious sense&#x2014;of Indian finance in this country. Therefore I welcome any occasion when the Secretary of State comes forward and gives us an explanation of his policy.<lb/>
We are really bound to treat our Indian constituents in this matter with the fullest amount of confidence and candour possible. The finances of India which yon administer are not like the revenues which come from the taxpayers of this country who have Members of Parliament to protect them and look after their interests. They come from the taxpayers of a remote part of the Empire who have no official representatives here except the Secretary of State himself, who is not merely the official guardian but almost the only guardian of the interests of the Indian taxpayer in this country. A further consideration which always seems to me to place special responsibility on the Secretary of State in this country is the
<col>978</col>
peculiar system of dual government by which we administer India&#x2014;partly the Secretary of State in Council here and partly the Government of India in India. In all points of finance it is the English partner, the Secretary of State in Council, who is almost, I think I might say quite, omnipotent. He can over-rule, and does I over-rule, the Government of India on important matters of finance. Indeed, the India Office is not only a financial arbiter, but almost a financial autocrat; and if that be so&#x2014;and it certainly was my own experience&#x2014;all the greater is the necessity for treating with absolute sincerity and candour those whose interests are so completely in your hands, who are so helpless in your grasp.<lb/>
The discussion to-night has related mainly to three questions, and perhaps I may be allowed to say a brief word about each. Firstly, there was the matter of the dealings of the India Office with the firm of Messrs. Samuel Montagu and Co. I am sure there is no one in this House who will not have listened with sympathetic respect to the remarks which fell from Lord Swaythling. He made a spirited defence of the honour and of the action of the firm with which he is connected. May I say, as regards his brother, the Under-Secretary, that no one acquainted with that gentleman could for a moment believe him guilty of any conduct unworthy of the highest standard of British political life. We know, from what we have heard to-night, that he is not even a member of the firm for which his brother has spoken, and I can state from my own experience of the India Office&#x2014;I was Under-Secretary there myself&#x2014;that the Under-Secretary has nothing to do, or next to nothing to do, with the Finance Committee. And so I can well believe that Mr. Montagu was quite ignorant of the whole transaction. On the point of prudence, raised by the Secretary of State, I am not certain that I wholly agree with him. The Secretary of State said that while appearances have to be considered, at the same time they were making so good a bargain for the Government of India, they were saving them so many hundreds of thousands of pounds, that they had to risk possible misapprehension of their relations with this firm. I am not certain that His Majesty's Government were altogether justified in taking that risk. We are very sensitive, wisely sensitive, in English public
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0494"/>
<col>979</col>
life, about the business connections and the honour of our public men, and I think it might have occurred to the Secretary of State when undertaking these transactions that when at a later date they would be divulged a good deal of not altogether unreasonable suspicion might be aroused by the connection of their Under-Secretary with the firm in question.<lb/>
Then there comes the question, with which the noble Lord opposite dealt, of the relations of the India Office with his firm in the purchase of silver. I think the noble Lord made his own position clear upon that point, and I doubt not that his firm was chosen because of their peculiar qualifications for this particular undertaking and because they were not members of the ring to which he has referred. But there was another matter which has scarcely been touched upon, and that is the employment of his firm, not merely for the purchase of silver to be coined into rupees in India, but as the recipients of large sums of money lent out at a small rate of interest from the cash balances of the Government of India in the hands of the Secretary of State in London. I cannot enter into that question to-night, because it raises a large question of policy. I am not discussing the question of right or wrong conduct at the moment. But it does raise a big question of policy&#x2014;whether you are justified in keeping huge cash balances in London, as you have been doing recently, and in lending millions of money at a very low rate of interest&#x2014;I think only about 2&#x00BD; per cent.&#x2014;to large bankers and business men in London. I am not certain that that is sound policy, and I am certain that it excites a great deal of suspicion in India. In Indian newspapers you constantly see the statement that you are taking the money away from a poor country, India, in order to give an advantage to the richest country in the world, England; that you are using Indian money and Indian credit in order to put money into the pockets of big London bankers and dealers, and so on. The charge may be exaggerated; it may even be unfounded; but it is undesirable that it should be made. I think I am right in saying that in the past when I was responsible for the Government of India we never had cash balances in the hands of the Secretary of State at all approaching the present figure. I believe that in the spring of this year you had &#x00A3;18,000,000 of cash balances.
<col>980</col>
That, I know, was an exceptional and inflated sum, which has now fallen to &#x00A3;8,000,000 or &#x00A3;9,000,000. I do not believe that in the time I am speaking of we ever had &#x00A3;9,000,000 of cash balances here. I do not think we ever had more than &#x00A3;4,000,000 or &#x00A3;5,000,000. I do not see why these large balances should be kept here, and I say, in passing, that one of the reasons against the policy seems to me to be the misapprehension to which it may expose you in India.<lb/>
The next question was the gold coinage. This is a matter on which I may, perhaps, be allowed to say a word, because I happened to be in India when the Fowler Committee reported, and was largely responsible for the steps we took to carry its recommendations into effect. It is quite true, as the Secretary of State has said, that we accepted and did our best to put into practical effect the recommendations of the Fowler Committee, both as regards the institution of a gold standard and of a gold currency. I remember particularly interesting myself in this matter somewhat against the views of Sir Edward Law, my Finance Minister, who was more concerned in building up the Gold Reserve and securing the stability of the currency policy than he was in encouraging the use of gold in India. I argued that it was good policy to familiarise the people with the sight and touch of gold, and I urged that by the use of our currency offices and of the treasuries in the great cities, as well as in the Post Offices and banks we should do everything we could to familiarise the people with gold. We were ready to coin gold. We were quite prepared that the Bombay Mint should be made a branch of the Royal Mint in London. The reasons, which have not been fully stated to-night, for which we were anxious to have a Gold Mint in India&#x2014;and it is important that this should be known&#x2014;were these. In the first place, there was the view, perhaps rather a sentimental view, that India ought to coin her own money. Secondly, there were the &#x00A3;2,000,000 of gold coming from the Kolar Goldfields in Mysore. My recollection does not quite agree with that of Lord Inchcape in that respect. It is true that by the time we set to work the firms exporting this gold had made other arrangements, but I do not think there would have been any difficulty in intercepting that gold at Bombay and making arrangements to coin it there. Thirdly, we felt that a Gold Mint at Bombay
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0495"/>
<col>981</col>
would do a great deal to popularise the gold currency; and, fourthly, we felt that India ought to have one open Mint. Her Mints for the coinage of silver being closed, we thought she ought to have one Mint for the unrestricted coinage of gold.<lb/>
Our arrangements broke down because of the obstruction that was offered us here at home, not by the India Office, but by authorities outside the India Office. Every sort of difficulty, technical and legal, was raised, and after struggling for two years I remember throwing up my hands in despair. I gather that some of those difficulties still exist&#x2014;I mean the difficulty about having a branch of the Royal Mint of England in Bombay; and the Secretary of State, I gather, proposes to deal with the matter by allowing the coinage of small gold coins in India&#x2014;I think he said a ten rupee piece. That is a matter that I have no doubt he will look carefully into. I remember we discussed very closely whether it would be desirable in India to have a gold Indian coinage of a smaller value than a sovereign. We discussed a ten rupee piece and a five rupee piece, and there was a great deal of difference of opinion on the matter. A great many people said that the Indian peasant and even the Indian merchant was quite satisfied with a currency partly in silver and partly in paper, and that these smaller coins Would not be wanted and that the experiment would be a costly one. There was a good deal of difference of opinion about that. But one thing did rather surprise me in what the Secretary of State said. I gather from him that the present Government of India do not express a strong view in favour of a Mint for gold coinage in India. I was under the impression that when the questions were put in the Legislative Council to which the noble Marquess referred the present Finance Minister in India did express himself strongly in its favour. I may be wrong. If there is a strong feeling in India in favour of the experiment, I think on the whole I would like to see it made, if in no other shape, then in the somewhat attenuated form suggested by the Secretary of State, although I myself should like something larger.<lb/>
There is one other point, raised by Lord Faber, on which I wish to say a word. It was not included in the subject brought before us by Lord Inchcape, but as the Secretary of State referred to it perhaps
<col>982</col>
I may be allowed to say a word upon it. I speak of the Gold Reserve Fund. In the existence and in the use of that reserve I take great interest, because it is the result of a proposal made by the Government of India at the time when I was at its head. I think, on the whole, my general sentiments are those of Lord Faber. We did deliberately propose at that time that the bulk of this Gold Reserve should be invested, and we did so for two reasons. Firstly, because we wanted to put it in securities in this country which were easily saleable; and secondly, because we wanted to have the advantage of the interest. At that time we did not contemplate that the reserve would touch the enormous figures it has since reached. We thought that if we got a Gold Reserve up to about &#x00A3;10,000,000 it would, in addition to the &#x00A3;10,000,000 or &#x00A3;11,000,000 of the Paper Currency Reserve, give us &#x00A3;20,000,000, which would be sufficient to guarantee the success of our currency policy and give us steadiness of exchange. Matters have gone much further since those days, and I gather from what I read in the newspapers that you now have about &#x00A3;20,000,000 in the Gold Reserve.<lb/>
There are one or two changes that have been made of which I venture to disapprove. There was the change made on the recommendation of Lord Inchcape's Committee, under which a certain portion of this reserve&#x2014;I think &#x00A3;1,000,000&#x2014;was taken for railway expenditure. I do not say that Lord Inchcape's Committee directly recommended that, but they recommended that part of the profits of coinage set aside for this reserve should be used for railway extension, and &#x00A3;1,000,000 was taken. We have had a strong warning to-day against the use of violent language, and therefore I will not use the word "misappropriation," but I suggest that this was not altogether a wise or sound appropriation of that portion of the Gold Reserve. Of this &#x00A3;20,000,000 I understand that nearly &#x00A3;3,000,000, according to a recent answer given in the House of Commons, is held in rupees. That rather puzzles me. I cannot understand why any portion of the Gold Reserve should be held in silver. The rest is held in securities in this country. The Secretary of State told us that he is contemplating some sort of change, that in future he contemplates holding &#x00A3;5,000,000, I think he said, in gold.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02867"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: &#x00A3;5,000,000 in gold in this country, and the noble Marquess seemed to be doubtful about the policy of holding any portion of it in gold in India because of the enormous gold accumulation in the Paper Currency Reserve. But the Paper Currency Reserve exists for a different purpose. It exists in order to sustain your rupee notes in that country; and I should like, in addition to the &#x00A3;5,000,000 he proposes to hold in gold in this country, that he should hold a certain amount of the Gold Standard Reserve in gold in India. These are the observations that have been suggested to me by the discussion that has taken place to-night, and I hope that at a later date we may have another occasion when, on a larger field, we may raise other issues of Indian finance at least as important as those we have been examining this evening.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02868"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will not detain your Lordships for more than a moment, but as an ex-Financial Member of the Council of India I should like to say a few words. I generally agree with my noble friend Lord Curzon as to the great undesirability of secrecy in all these transactions, but I must confess that in this particular instance I do not see how secrecy was to be avoided. If the Secretary of State had a ring to deal with it was absolutely necessary to break it down, and if it had been known that he was going to employ Messrs. Samuel Montagu and Co. to buy silver the price would have been raised and the operation would have been unsuccessful. It was, no doubt, unfortunate that all sorts of suspicions should be excited, but it was only natural that these suspicions should have been excited. I think that on the whole the action taken by the India Office was perfectly justifiable. As to the question of cash balances, I hope that matter will receive attention. It may interest the noble Marquess to know that when I was appointed a Financial Member
<col>984</col>
of Council in 1880 I remember having a long conversation with Mr. Gladstone on Indian affairs, and the point he chiefly directed my attention to was the question of Indian cash balances. He urged me to reduce them, and spoke of the unwisdom of having unnecessarily large cash balances. When I went out to India I found that Mr. Gladstone had not been well informed as to the Indian cash balances. But it has struck me that the cash balances here are rather excessive, and therefore I trust that the matter will receive the consideration which it certainly deserves at the hands of the Secretary of State.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02915">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I do not think it is necessary that I should trouble your Lordships by reading the list of Questions standing in my name on the Paper, but I would ask the noble Lord who is to reply to me to be good enough to answer each Question <i>seriatim.</i> Perhaps I might run through the list, touching upon any Question upon which there may be a point requiring explanation. Questions Nos. 1 and 2 are perfectly clear, and I think speak for themselves. They are very similar to those put by me last November to the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack. As regards Question No. 3, the figures there given of officers and non-commissioned officers and men who were absent without leave from camp in 1911 are the figures that were given to me in November last, and I specially want to know whether those men have been, as they ought to be, properly punished. As regards Question No. 4, I am specially anxious to get an answer in regard to re-engagements, because, as those of your Lordships who are connected with military matters are aware, it is usual in the Regular Army only to allow 10 per cent. to reengage in order that you may maintain a sufficient Reserve. I have no comments to make upon Question No. 5; and in regard to Question No. 6, I ask what steps are taken to verify the ages given by recruits taken for the Territorial Force.
<col>990</col>
I want to know whether a boy's mere statement is sufficient, or whether any steps are taken to verify the statement. Question No. 7 speaks for itself.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02916">As regards Question No. 8, in which I ask how many battalions of Infantry carried out battalion field firing and how many carried out company field firing, I should like to read to your Lordships a private letter which I have received from a responsible officer. It is a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> letter, although I am not in a position to mention the name of the writer. I think the letter is interesting, as it illustrates how field firing has to be carried out and the great difficulty attending it when you have to deal with semi-trained men. The incidents which this letter describes took place early in August last year on a sandy stretch of sea shore on the coast of England. The general idea was that an invading force had landed or was about to land. A brigade of Infantry (Territorials) who had bivouacked close by during the night were hastily called up to repel the invader. This is the description given by the officer in his letter&#x2014;
<quote>"My orders were to weed out of my company, first, all recruits; secondly, all men who had not passed the standard test; thirdly, any men who were such fools as to be unworthy to be trusted with ball ammunition. With these heavy losses my company looked very meagre, for out of some eighty men thirty had to be turned out as unsafe and untrained in the use of a rifle. We were then allowed to advance. When we reached a certain spot we were given plenty of time to extend. In war time all these movements would have had to take place very rapidly. These extensions had to be made under the personal and individual supervision of the officer commanding the company. Owing to the shortage of officers in my battalion we had only one officer per company. When we reached another spot the left and right-hand men had to stand by certain flags. This was to ensure the whole line being absolutely straight, so that one man could not get in front of the other. I cannot imagine flags being placed in position on a modern battlefied&#x0021; All this time no ammunition had been served out, and, in fact, no ammunition was served out until the men actually reached the firing line. They were then given twenty-five rounds per man, which had to be placed in the pouches, and not in the rifle. The individual company officer could give no commands to his men except on the call of the Brigadier's bugle. Every movement&#x2014;fire, cease fire and advance&#x2014;was made by the one bugle belonging to the Brigadier. On the bugle blowing 'Fire,' then, and not till then, were the picked men allowed to load their rifles. Furthermore, although it is a general order that empty cases should be gathered after firing, on this morning the rule was suspended, and no empty cases were allowed to be picked up by the men actually firing. This was to avoid the possibility of an untrained man swinging his rifle round and firing off at his
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0500"/>
<col>991</col>
comrade at his side. It was interesting to note the way in which every officer and sergeant kept very well to the rear of his men, even though all these precautions were taken, for we all know that, with men who necessarily had had so little experience of firing, owing to excitement and lack of discipline, there was quite a sporting chance of a stray bullet finding a billet. We all felt that these precautions laid down by the General Staff were wise and necessary precautions, and that if they had not been taken casualties would certainly have occurred. The behaviour of the men on the whole was calm and good, as it ought to be, considering that it took us two hours to advance a mile over the sands. The fact that such precautions were necessary shows clearly in what estimation the Territorial Force is really regarded by those Regular soldiers who are responsible for the annual training."</quote>
That, my Lords, is a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> letter, and I think it is very eloquent of the importance of the Question.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02917">Question No. 9 is perfectly straightforward and clear, and I have nothing to comment upon it. Neither have I anything to say on Questions Nos. 10 to 15. But when I come to Question No. 16&#x2014;in which I ask, Was not the Infantry of the Territorial Force put back to "company" training by the orders of the Inspector-General of the Forces&#x2014;I do feel that if this is so it is very unsatisfactory, because, as noble Lords know, company training is, so to speak, the lowest class of training. It is very unsatisfactory if the Infantry of the Force have to be put to company training after their fifth year in camp. The next Question is perfectly clear and straightforward. I ask Question No. 18, as to how many qualified signallers there are in the Territorial Force, because I am informed, I believe on good authority, that out of the 203 battalions only 95 have officers in possession of the signalling certificate. Everybody knows of what great importance it is that in these days the signalling should be in an efficient condition. I do not wish to occupy your Lordships' time at any length. I am really out this evening for information.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02918">But before I sit down I feel that I must call attention to a speech delivered by General Bethune, the Director-General of the Territorial Force. It is stated&#x2014;I do not know for what purpose&#x2014;that certain persons and associations of persons are actively engaged in disparaging the Territorial Force. That seems to me to be in itself a very inadequate argument, because all that we have to consider is, Is the Territorial Force an efficient military machine? I am bound to say that I have never known any language more tending
<col>992</col>
to disparage the Territorial Force than the language which is being held by the Director-General and which he himself allows to be used in his presence. On October 5 of this year the Director-General went to Edinburgh for the purpose of assisting recruiting and promoting the welfare of the Territorial Force. A luncheon was given by the Lord Provost, and there was a meeting in the evening at which the Lord Provost recommended, among other things to make recruiting easier and to make the Territorial Force more popular, that it should be optional for a man to skip camp each alternate year. That was greeted with great applause. General Bethune, the Director-General of the Territorial Force and a most distinguished officer, as we know, allowed that remark to pass unrebuked; and, following the Lord Provost, he said that he would like to see every country disarm. He thought war was an "old-fashioned thing they had grown out of"&#x2014;rather an ill-timed remark to make within a few days of the outbreak of the great war in the Near East which is going to change the political map of Europe. But what did General Bethune say specially with regard to the Territorial Force? He used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"Why should not they look upon soldiering as a sport, and take it up in the same way as they took up cricket and football and golf?"</quote>
It is quite evident that General Bethune had not had the controlling spirit or the controlling advice of the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack. The noble and learned Viscount, speaking on January 28 of this year on the occasion of the opening of a new riding school at the headquarters of the 4th Northumbrian Howitzer Brigade at South Shields, said&#x2014;
<quote>"There were some people who spoke of the Territorial Force lightly, as if it were a pleasure ground on which people might amuse themselves. He hoped that notion would soon be rooted out of the minds of those who indulged in these light fancies. Defence was a necessity."</quote>
That is the language of a responsible Minister. I am bound to say it is in strange and weird contrast to the ill-advised utterances of the Director-General of the Territorial Force. Coining from hint language of the kind I have quoted in reference to the Territorial Force is especially unfortunate, because it gives a sort of official countenance, if I may say so, to the belief which is already far too prevalent and which I maintain is fatal and injurious to the self-respect of the Territorial Force&#x2014;namely, that invasion
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0501"/>
<col>993</col>
being impossible the Territorial is merely a sort of sop thrown to a stupid political antagonist. If reasonable criticism of the Territorial Force is to be twisted into disparagement of that Force it is doubly unfortunate when the Director-General gives the appearance, both in his own language and in what he allows to be said before him, that the Territorial Force is not one which ought to be really seriously considered. I ask these Questions because I think it is reasonable and just that the country should know from time to time exactly how we stand, and I hope that the noble Lord who will answer me will act up to the spirit of the noble and learned Viscount, Lord Haldane, who in November last when Secretary of State for War said that I had touched on many questions affecting the Territorial Force "upon which it was his duty to give me as full information as he could." I beg to put to the Government the Questions which stand in my name, and I again repeat the hope that the noble Lord who will reply will be good enough to answer each Question <i>seriatim.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02919"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hardly think that your Lordships will expect me to follow the noble Earl in his remarks as to the Director-General of the Territorial Force, for the matter which he has raised in that connection is entirely extraneous even to the vast number of Questions he has upon the Paper; and in view of the fact that not the smallest notice has been given that that particular question would be raised I think I may be excused from following the noble Earl in that matter. I will now deal <i>seriatim,</i> as the noble Earl has asked me to do, with the Questions of which he has given notice.<lb/>
Question No. 1. The strength of the Force on October 1 was 9,236 officers and 252,152 non-commissioned officers and men. Question No. 2. The number who were present in camp in 1912 for fifteen days and over were 6,855 officers and. 154,995 non-commissioned officers and men. (1) The number who were present in camp for eight days and less than fifteen was 1,014 officers and 66,366 men. (2) The number present for less than eight days was 47 officers and 314 non-commissioned officers and men. (3) (4) and (5) The total number who failed to attend camp was 1,362 officers and 33,350 non-commissioned officers and men, of whom 1,325 officers and 27,331 non-commissioned officers and men were absent with leave
<col>994</col>
and 37 officers and 6,019 non-commissioned officers and men without leave.<lb/>
Question No. 3. With regard to the 41 officers and 6,755 non-commissioned officers and men who were absent without leave from camp in 1911, disciplinary action was taken in the case of 20 officers and 2,490 other ranks. Of these officers 16 resigned, one was reported to his General Officer Commanding, and action is still being taken in the case of the remaining three. Disciplinary action was taken against 2,490 of other ranks, of whom 1,012 were struck off the strength under Paragraph 268 of the Territorial Force Regulations, one was discharged on the grounds of unsatisfactory conduct, 895 were prosecuted, 347 were prosecuted and fined, 97 were fined by County Associations, three were allowed to purchase their discharge, 53 were warned, three were reduced, and action is still being taken in the case of 79. Question No. 4. The number whose engagements expired between October 1, 1911, and September 30, 1912, was 80,403, and the number who re-engaged during this period was 39,681. Question No. 5. For the year ended September 30, 1909, 110,020 recruits joined; for the year ended September 30, 1910, 42,239 recruits joined; for the year ended September 30, 1911, 39,086 recruits joined; for the year ended September 30, 1912, 57,946 recruits joined. Question No. 6. The number of non-commissioned officers and men under 19 on October 1, 1912, was 40,684. The steps taken to verify the ages given by recruits taken for the Territorial Force are laid down in Paragraph 132 of the Territorial Force Regulations.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02923"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: I understand that is so. Question No. 7. In the musketry year 1910&#x2013;11, from the Yeomanry, Field Companies, Royal Engineers, and Infantry 52,590 recruits were tested in musketry; 31,976 qualified, and 20,614 failed; 125,322 trained men were tested, of whom 111,432 qualified, and 13,890 failed. All the men given above as
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0502"/>
<col>995</col>
having qualified passed the standard test. In addition to the number I have given as having qualified 17,932 recruits and 12,316 trained men qualified in musketry by attendance at classification 30 yards, or miniature ranges, in accordance with Paragraph 361 (2) or (3), of the Territorial Force Regulations. I presume that this is what the noble Earl means by the latter part of his Question. At the same time it is not for one moment admitted that the object of these Regulations is to enable County Associations to draw allowances. The object of the Regulations is to ensure that those men who are unable, owing to various circumstances, to do the training necessary to pass the standard test shall at any rate be in a position to have some training in the use of the rifle. Question No. 8. Thirty-four battalions of Infantry carried out battalion field firing. The number of battalions in which all companies have been exercised in company field firing is 92. There are 62 battalions in which some, but not all, companies have been exercised in company field firing, and there are 53 battalions in which no company field firing was performed. Question No. 9. There were 20,817 horses in camp with the Yeomanry. Of these, 8,034 were the property of officers, non-commissioned officers and men, 12,761 were hired, 14 were the property of the Government, and eight were the property of County Associations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02924"><member>THE EARL OF PORTSMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: Did the noble Lord say 14,000 were the property of the Government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02925"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: No, fourteen. The total number is 20,817 and I had already accounted for 8,034 and 12,761. Question No. 10. Territorial Horse and Field batteries were not marked for "fire tactics" at annual practice. In 1912, 131 batteries carried out annual practice, and, in addition, the eleven batteries of the 1st London Divisional Artillery fired a modified course at Shoeburyness during Summer on Saturday afternoons. For this horses were not required. This represents 78 per cent. of the total number of Horse and Field batteries, not counting the eleven batteries mentioned. Of all the Horse and Field batteries that went to camp, 102 took their full complement of horses. The average deficiency in the remaining 29 batteries was eleven horses, but almost all had sufficient for the <i>personnel</i> who attended camp. Question No. 11. The actual cost of the Territorial Force for the year ended
<col>996</col>
March 31, 1912, cannot be given, but it is estimated at &#x00A3;3,200,000.<lb/>
Question No. 12. During the period from October 1, 1911, to September 30, 1912, 1,364 officers were appointed to the Territorial Force, including the Unattached List, and 1,184 resigned. These figures do not include the reduction owing to death, transfer to the Reserve, and compulsory retirements. Question No. 13. The strength of the Territorial Force Reserve on October 1, 1912, was, according to the Army List, 313 officers and 865 men. The increase of non-commissioned officers and men in the Reserve during the year has been 375, and this is roughly the number who have joined from the Territorial Force during the period. Question No. 14. The National Reserve is not part of the Territorial Force. As, however, it is administered by County Associations it was considered convenient to record its strength in that part of the General Annual Report which deals with the Territorial Force Reserve which is also administered by the County Associations.<lb/>
Question No. 15. According to information received from the Commands, in the Eastern Command the Surrey Yeomanry and the 1st Home Counties Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, trained with Territorial Infantry units. In the London District the 3rd County of London Yeomanry trained with the Infantry of the 2nd London Division. The Artillery of the Honourable Artillery Company trained with the Infantry of the same unit. The Artillery of the 1st London Division trained with the Infantry of that division. In the Northern Command no Yeomanry or Artillery units trained with Infantry except the following: The 1st and 2nd North Midland Brigades Royal Field Artillery, and North Midland (Staffs.) Heavy Battery Royal Garrison Artillery trained with their division. The 1st and 2nd East Riding batteries Royal Field Artillery carried out their second week's training at Army man&#x0153;uvres. In the Scottish Command no regiments of Yeomanry or batteries of Artillery trained with Infantry; these arms trained separately. In the Southern Command the South Midland Royal Garrison Artillery trained with the Infantry of the South Midland Division. The 1st Wessex Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, trained on Salisbury Plain at the same time as two Infantry Brigades of the Wessex Division. The 1st South
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0503"/>
<col>997</col>
Western Mounted Brigade took part in Army man&#x0153;uvres. Other Yeomanry regiments trained separately. In the Western Command no regiments of Yeomanry trained with Infantry. Eight batteries of the West Lancashire Division, five batteries of the East Lancashire Division, and six batteries of the Welsh Division trained with the infantry of their Division.<lb/>
Question No. 16. The Territorial Infantry was not put back to company training by the orders of the Inspector General of the Home Forces. That officer has, however, had occasion to call attention to the advanced nature of the training carried out by certain units, and the attention of the General Officers Commanding-in-Chief has been directed to the principle laid down in Training and Man&#x0153;uvre Regulations that, as the time available for the training of the Territorial Force is so limited, Squadron, battery, company, and battalion training is all important.<lb/>
Question No. 17. The information as to the average number of drills, exclusive of camp, performed by the men of the Artillery, the Yeomanry, and the Infantry of the Force respectively does not form part of any of the ordinary returns furnished to the War Office. The following figures for the year 1911 have been obtained at the cost of a vast amount of labour for Mr. Hunt, in reply to his Question in the House of Commons, by calling for a special Return and it is hoped that these figures which I am about to give will prove sufficient for the noble Earl, as it would be hardly justifiable to ask the staffs of the Territorial Force units to work out these figures again for 1912. During the year from November 1, 1910, to October 31, 1911, the average number of drills, exclusive of camp, performed was&#x2014;By the Yeomanry, officers 11&#x00B7;92, other ranks 16&#x00B7;58; by the Artillery, officers 24&#x00B7;96, other ranks 22&#x00B7;72; by the Infantry, officers 18&#x00B7;19, other ranks 18&#x00B7;35. The average number of working days spent at courses of instruction, including attachment to training centres, was&#x2014;By the Yeomanry, officers 2&#x00B7;79, other ranks &#x00B7;17; by the Artillery, officers 5&#x00B7;42, other ranks &#x00B7;27; by the Infantry, officers 3&#x00B7;63, other ranks &#x00B7;09. The average number of weekends spent in camp&#x2014;that is to say, extra training&#x2014;was: By the Yeomanry, officers &#x00B7;12, other ranks &#x00B7;08; by the Artillery, officers &#x00B7;57, other ranks &#x00B7;24; by the Infantry, officers &#x00B7;48, other ranks &#x00B7;22.<lb/>
<col>998</col>
Question No. 18. The number of qualified signallers in the Territorial Force is as follows: 257 offcers (instructors), 428 assistant instructors, and 1,444 qualified signallers. These figures are taken from the Report of the Commandant, Army Signal School, for 1911. The numbers in the previous year were 234 officers (instructors), 417 assistant instructors, and 2,635 qualified signallers. It is to be observed that the examination has been made more severe, and this accounts for the large drop in the number of qualified signallers. In conclusion, I may say quite frankly that the signalling in the Territorial Force is not at present in an altogether satisfactory condition, and that the subject is engaging the attention of the Army Council.</membercontribution></p>

<title>TEMPERANCE (SCOTLAND) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02932">Order of the Day for the House to be put into Committee, read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02933">Moved, That the House do now resolve itself into Committee.&#x2014;(<i>Earl Beauchamp.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02934"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the House goes into Committee on this Bill I desire to say a few words, not with any idea of retarding the progress of the Bill, but more or less in the way of a personal explanation. I have always believed since I have been in this House that when the Government of the day introduce an important measure it is right and proper and due to the Government and also to your Lordships' House that some notice of it should be taken by those who sit on the Front Opposition Bench. The other evening when this Bill came up for Second Reading I had fully intended to say a few words upon it, but by one of those accidents that sometimes happen the debate abruptly terminated at a moment when I, unfortunately, was not in my place, and I lost my opportunity. I do not greatly regret that, because after the speeches made by my two noble friends on this side of the House I should only have been able to tell your Lordships that I had arrived at the same conclusion as theirs, and that we did not desire to deny the Bill the Second Reading which we were asked to give it.<lb/>
I will this evening make one observation, and one observation only. This Bill comes to us in the guise of a Temperance Bill. It is described as a Bill to promote temperance. I am not at all convinced that that is a proper designation to give to this Bill. There are, it is true, clauses in it with regard to clubs and one or two other clauses which do touch the question of temperance, but the real object of the Bill is not the promotion of temperance. Its real object is to transfer the power which is now entrusted to the licensing authorities in Scotland to a majority of the electors within the areas provided for by the measure. No doubt that change in the law is suggested in the hope that temperance may result therefrom; but it is quite evident that if, contrary to the expectations of the promoters of the Bill, the electors should prove to be indifferent, or if the extinction of a large number of certificates should
<col>1000</col>
lead to a great increase in the number of clubs, or if, again, the areas should be so prescribed as to lead to additional drinking in one area while drink is diminished in that which adjoins it&#x2014;if any of these things happen the result will not be the promotion of temperance. I am strengthened in my opinion that the Bill ought not to be described as a Temperance Bill by an observation made in the other House of Parliament by the Lord Advocate, who used, these words&#x2014;
<quote>"The object of the Bill is not to extinguish licences, but to transfer to voters in certain areas discretionary powers now confined to the magistrates."</quote>
That, said the Lord Advocate, was "the sole object of this measure," and I think that is a more correct description than that which was given to us the other evening by the noble Earl in charge of the Bill.<lb/>
The noble Earl told us that in his opinion the Bill did not introduce a new principle. I venture to say that it does introduce a new principle, and a principle which may prove extremely dangerous and far-reaching. The principle is this, that from a tribunal which is in a sense an experienced tribunal, which has responsibilities attaching to it, which has a judicial character, you are going to take these functions away and hand them over to a body of electors who have no judicial characteristics, who have no responsibilities, and who have no experience. Now that, as I said a moment ago, is a new principle, and to my mind a very important one. I will say no more upon it. We have been told on excellent authority that this Bill is largely supported in Scotland. That being so, we on these Benches did not desire to refuse it a Second Reading; but we regard it as a very hazardous experiment, and we desire that this experiment should he carried out under the most careful conditions possible. We do not think that the conditions laid down in the Bill as it now stands are sufficient for the purpose, and I am very glad that several of my noble friends on this side of the House have put Amendments on the Paper with the object of rendering those conditions more adequate than I believe them to be at present.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02938">Clause 1:</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02939" align="center"><i>Date of Act Coming into Operation.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02940"><b>1.</b> This Act shall, except as otherwise in this Act provided, come into operation on the expiration of five years front the first day of June nineteen hundred and twelve.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02941"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I move to leave out "five years" and to insert "fourteen years." In this Bill the Government aim at introducing an entirely new licensing authority based wholly on the popular vote instead of on the elective principle as at present. Whether or not the result will be that a certain number of licences will be taken away, it remains, I think, for this house to see that as far as possible adequate compensation is given to those who are deprived of their licences. It is now proposed that the Bill shall come into operation at the expiration of five years, and I venture to suggest in my Amendment that the period shall be altered to fourteen years. This point turns on the question of the property in the licence. It is quite true, as the noble Earl in charge of the Bill pointed out in moving the Second Reading, that the certificates are only made out to May 28 of the year following the date on which they are issued, but it by no means follows that the receiver of the certificate is not likely to obtain a renewal. In fact, the very reverse is the case. Except in the event of default by bankruptcy or improper conduct, or in the case of the premises not being suitable, or in the case of a conviction having taken place, it is the universal rule that these licences should be renewed. So much is that the case that, when licensed premises are bought and sold, from fifteen to eighteen years of the net profits is the rate at which they change hands. These premises have been so dealt with for a considerable number of years, and men of all sorts and kinds, poor men as well as rich men, have invested their money in them, and some have sunk their little all in property of this nature.<lb/>
Again, the fact that these licences are renewable is taken into account for purposes of local taxation, and it is customary for the sum which is assessed for the goodwill of the premises to be calculated by
<col>1002</col>
the number of years for which the lease runs. We have in Scotland County Assessment Rolls, and it is easy to see for yourselves exactly what the assessment is fixed at for all these premises, and the fact that the assessment is high and is based on the principle of the number of years of the lease shows that it is an accepted principle that, given good conduct on the part of the licensee, a licence once granted will be renewed. Then, again, we have the question of the Death Duties. The Death Ditties are based as a rule on something like seven years' profits of licensed premises. If there is no expectation or certainty of a renewal of the licence, it is very difficult to see on what grounds Death Duties are so charged. One might even say that the mere fact of five years' grace being given in the Bill as it now stands clearly shows, even if it is not, admitted by the noble Earl in charge of the Bill, that the framers of this Bill, who were private Members and not the Government, had the idea in their minds that some grace should of right be allowed to the licence-holder. Therefore it does appear that the licence-holders have a right to reasonable treatment.<lb/>
The question is to fix exactly what this reasonable treatment should be, and I have inserted in my Amendment a period of fourteen years. I think it should be possible in that period for the people affected to so arrange matters as to give up their licences at the end of the period without absolute and complete loss. The noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack, speaking at Perth in September, 1908, on the English Licensing Bill, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The brewer, the distiller, and the owner of licensed premises were just as much entitled to justice as any one else, and the Government intended to deal fairly with them."</quote>
The noble and learned Viscount went on to say that in the case of the English Bill they had fixed the limit of time at fourteen years, and that the result of their careful calculation had been that this wits a fair estimate of time within which licence-holders might recoup themselves. I ask, it being admitted that licence-holders have a claim to have their position considered, that Scottish licence-holders in the year 1912 should be given fourteen years in the same way as it was proposed in 1908 to treat English licence-holders.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0506"/>
<col>1003</col>
There is another argument in favour of extending the period now in the Bill. Should it be considered in any district that the individual licence-holder is not fairly treated, it is more than probable that the question of the reduction of licences would be decided from the point of view of justice to the licence-holder rather than of advantage to the community. If it is felt that the man holding the licence has had sufficient time in which to work out his own salvation, I think there will be much more probability of those who believe that the reduction of licences would be a good thing voting to reduce the number. After all, the question of the reduction of licences is largely in the nature of an experiment. A reduction may reduce the drunkenness with which, I regret to say, Scotland is so cursed at the present day, but we are by no means certain that that will be the result. I can only offer an opinion about a small stretch of the country that I know. I can assure your Lordships that the two most drunken districts there are those in which public-houses have been ruthlessly put down. The explanation is simple. Where an individual is unable to buy a single glass of whisky he is forced to buy a bottle. Moreover, it is not the liquor that is purchased and consumed in public-houses which causes the disgraceful drunkenness which takes place certainly during the last ten days of December, but the bottles of whisky which men carry with them, the contents of which they not only partake of themselves but share with every one they meet. My experience is that it is much more a question of the management of the public-houses and the class of liquor that is sold there than the number of licensed houses which exist in special districts. It is for these reasons that I urge that these licence-holders should be treated with justice, that they should be given time in which to work out their own salvation. I believe also that those who have studied the question carefully and consider that in any particular district it would be advisable to reduce the number of licences will be much freer to vote for such reduction if they feel that the licence-holders are given time to get back a certain portion of the capital they have invested. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02943"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: I regret that the speech of the noble Lord, following that which was made by the noble Marquess upon the Motion to go into Committee, is somewhat ominous with regard to the prospects of agreement being generally reached during the Committee stage in this House. The noble Lord has moved an Amendment which makes so large an extension in the time to be given before this Bill comes into force that it goes almost beyond the limits of amendment, so great a difference does it make. But although the period in the Bill is set down at five years the licence-holders themselves have had a great deal more than five years in which to prepare for a Bill of this kind. The noble Lord himself probably remembers that the Minority Report of the Peel Commission, which was issued in 1899, recommended a period of five years for Scotland, and they said that at the end of that time a wide measure of direct popular control might be applied, under proper safeguards, to Scotland. Further, it was undoubtedly contemplated by the Minority Report that there should be considerable reductions during the fiveyears period. It is not expected that that would be the case with regard to this Bill. It is probable that during the five years the reductions would be very few in number. It is only after the five years that they would begin to take effect. It seems to be suggested that at the end of the five years all licences will be swept away. I need hardly say that none of us expect that.<lb/>
Lord Lovat laid emphasis upon the fact that there is a great deal of drunkenness in no-licence areas, and he is of opinion, therefore, that in the districts where a limiting resolution is in force drunkenness will probably decrease. But the noble Lord's Amendment applies equally to the limiting resolution as it does to the no-licence resolution, and it would be quite impossible for any reduction of licences to take place on the scale contemplated by the Bill if this Amendment were carried. The matter has been before the country since the year 1899, and this Bill has been before Parliament for three years. Everybody admits&#x2014;the noble Lord himself admitted&#x2014;the existence of drunkenness and the urgent need for legislation. The Amendment constitutes indirect compensation of a large
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0507"/>
<col>1005</col>
kind to licence-holders. His Majesty's Government do not admit the necessity for that compensation. We think five years a reasonable notice to give to licence-holders. Lord Balfour of Burleigh, in the Second Reading debate, admitted the necessity of further control and reduction, and I think on the whole, subject to Amendments, he considered that this Bill was the proper way in which to secure those ends. It would be a lamentable prospect to have to look forward to fourteen years before anything of the kind should take place, and therefore on behalf of His Majesty's Government I am afraid I must say that we are quite unable to accept this Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02944"><member>EARL GREY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope my noble friend will not press his Amendment. I think a time limit is a very bad method of compensation. I do not propose to argue what compensation it is desirable to give to a dispossessed publican, but to prolong the time during which he might press the sale of alcoholic liquor on the public is about the worst form of compensation you could possibly devise. I do not like five years as a time limit, but to extend it to fourteen years would be a most lamentable thing. The noble Lord concluded his speech by pointing out that it was not the number of public-houses but the character of the management which is the real question we have to discuss in Committee on this Bill. Amendments will be moved later to insure the people having the opportunity of securing disinterested management for the houses in the locality in which they live, and there are Amendments which go further and propose that of the profits made by the houses placed under disinterested management a certain percentage should be used to give a money compensation to the dispossessed publican. If there is to be compensation&#x2014;I do not wish to commit myself on that point at the present moment&#x2014;I say that money compensation is a sound way of proceeding. But to extend the time limit, as proposed in the Amendment now before the House, is the worst possible form you could adopt for compensating a publican.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02945"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have some hesitation in intervening but my reason for doing so is that I am one of those who are sincerely anxious to see this Bill in some form or another become law. If there is to be no compromise, no arrangement, no give and take between some of the
<col>1006</col>
extreme proposals in this Bill and some of the Amendments put forward, I think the prospects are not very hopeful. In my opinion the speech of the noble Earl in charge of the Bill was at least as discouraging to any one who wants to see a middle course pursued as, I might even say more discouraging than, the speech of the noble Marquess on this side of the House. The noble Earl referred to the Minority Report of Lord Peel's Commission and to the fact that this Bill had been for three years before Parliament. But, my Lords, any fair study of the Minority Report must, I think, carry with it this, that there was to be, in the opinion of the Commissioners, five years from the time when the new arrangement, whatever it is, was brought into force. You cannot say, because that Report is some years old, that licence-holders have had such and such warning that such and such things may happen. Nobody begins to make their arrangements until they see that Parliament has really carried into effect the proposals put before it. The noble Earl went on to say that every licence would not be taken away in five years. That is true. But it is no consolation to the unfortunate individual whose licence has been taken away that somebody else is allowed to keep his licence and perhaps make a profit by what I regard as the injustice of taking away by a popular vote a licence in so short a period as five years.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Grey, says a time limit is a bad form of compensation. I am not prepared to suggest anything better. But there are one or two considerations I want to put before the Government as against the proposal now in the Bill. I agree that to adopt this particular Amendment would postpone the whole operation of the Bill. It is not an Amendment which I could support. But I do say most earnestly from a careful study of the question that five years is too short a period for bringing in a popular vote on the subject of prohibition in any particular area. It is perfectly true, as the noble Lord who moved the Amendment said, that a licence is usually renewed except in case of misconduct. That is common ground. Nobody who supports this Bill will attempt to deny it. I say it is the inevitable result of the system which for long years has been pursued in regard to licences. You regulate the traffic. People are selected to hold licences, and it is inevitable if a man behaves
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0508"/>
<col>1007</col>
himself and fulfils his contract that the licence will be renewed. It has been in the public interest that the good man should have his licence renewed. That was the only check&#x2014;it may not be a satisfactory check&#x2014;upon bad management. I do not put the matter as high as some people, but the fact is beyond dispute that property in these licences has been allowed to grow up. The licence is a marketable property. It is so acknowledged by the Exchequer, because they take Legacy, Exchequer, and Death Duties on the value of the licence. If they are right in taking those duties from the estate of a man who leaves the licence to a son or a widow, it seems to me perfectly idle to deny that there is a property in the licence. It is an asset, and such an asset as ought to be acknowledged fairly and properly when you are making a change of system.<lb/>
I had some experience in this matter in 1903. I went very carefully under the guidance of the Law Officers of the Crown into the conditions of licence holding in Scotland. I came to the conclusion that they were not actually the same as in England, and that they varied much more as between one another in Scotland than the average English licence. I believe there are licences in the case of well-conducted houses in good districts which go up to a long period of years in value when they pass from hand to hand. There are others I know, in less orderly parts of large towns, which live from hand to mouth, so to speak, and whose transfer is not more than one year's profits or something like that. The only point I want to make at this stage of the Bill is that there is a real and substantial asset in the possession of the licence, and you will be doing an injustice, a rank injustice, if you arbitrarily take it away without due compensation to the holder in some form or another. Since the Minority Report of the Peel Commission the position of the licence-holder has been made much more onerous that it was before. He is much less able to make provision in these days on account of the extra taxation than he would have been at the time of the Peel Report. I am not able to support this Amendment as it stands, and I am disappointed with the speech of the noble Earl in charge of the Bill, because he did not seem to me to hold out any hope of a compromise on this particular point. I am not convinced myself of the fairness of the same period for total prohibition and for a
<col>1008</col>
reduction, and I think that is a matter well worthy of consideration.<lb/>
But what I really rose to do was to make an appeal to the Government that they should hold out some hope of a reconsideration and extension of the period of five years now in the Bill. Unless they can do that, and also see their way to stand to it in another place, there is extreme fear of what I shall venture to describe as the calamity of the loss of this Bill. It is very difficult to take a moderate line in this matter. I have been in receipt of a great many communications since I made my speech on the Second Reading of the Bill. Some of the extreme advocates of prohibition, of what they call temperance, are intemperate in their language, and cannot even believe that a person who differs from them can be honest. I received one letter which, contrary to the custom of many, was signed by the writer. He wrote to me, I admit, more in sorrow than in anger. He said that he once had a great deal of respect for me, but my speech on the Second Reading of this Bill had made it entirely evaporate. He contended that there was no asset at all in a licence, and that the period of five years was too long. He went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"one would think that a leading elder in a Christian Church would rather disagree with the Government in giving five years; but Jacobus says, and says truly, a man's high position in the Church is no positive proof of his piety and no absolute security against perdition. Wicked men may be appointed to important posts in the services of Christ."</quote>
That may be perfectly true and it may be applicable to myself, but I replied to the letter&#x2014;the whole of which I have not read to the House&#x2014;in courteous terms, and expressed my sympathy with the gentleman at his want of logic and his total absence of Christian charity. But that is the sort of thing with which we have to deal. I venture to say that in that sort of spirit you will never get a settlement of this matter. Unless you can make up your minds to deal fairly with those who have invested their money in a legitimate undertaking and whose property has been recognised by the Exchequer, you will never carry with you the opinion of the people who are going to vote; and unless those who are going to vote feel that their neighbours are going to get fair terms, you will not carry into effect the provisions of this Bill as they stand. It is for that reason that I appeal to His Majesty's Government to reconsider the matter with a view to meeting this undoubted difficulty.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02946"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just sat down has rendered great service to the cause of temperance, and we know the practical character of his mind; but for once I confess I feel a little disappointment. He appealed to us to do something, but he has given singularly little light as to what he would have the House do. He starts out by saying that fourteen years will not do. He will not have the proposal in the Amendment. Indeed he could not, because the noble Lord himself, in the discussion on the English Licensing Bill, warned this House and his colleagues in the strongest way against applying English analogies to Scotland and recognising that right of property which, he said, truly existed in a qualified form in English licences but never has existed as regards Scottish licences. Then the noble Lord said, quite truly, that there is reasonable security for renewal, and that the Crown takes toll of it for the purpose of the Death Duties. That is so. But it is so of a great many things in connection with which there is no tangible legal right. When you come to that you get involved in a sea of difficulty out of which the noble Lord did not help us.<lb/>
What is to be the measure in a case of this kind? Certainly not fourteen years. You could not defend that because we all know that the principle on which licences are renewed from year to year in Scotland is totally different from that which obtains in Ireland, and very different front that which obtains in England. It has been insisted time after time, and never controverted, that the licensing authorities reserve to themselves full discretion. No doubt it is true that when a man carries on his business well and in an orderly fashion there is usually a renewal. But that it not always true. The licensing authorities always have insisted that they have the fullest discretion in the matter. If that is so, you have got something; but whatever it is it is not a right of property of a kind which you can measure, and when you come to deal with a question of this kind you must look at it from a practical point of view The noble Earl, Lord Grey, in what seemed to me to be the admirable speech which he made upon this subject, said, Whatever you do, do not have a long time limit. I entirely agree with him. A long time limit is fatal to every possibility of temperance reform. On the other hand, the noble Lord
<col>1010</col>
opposite did not have the courage to suggest that a money compensation should be raised out of the rates or the taxes, and I gather from his manner that he would scout any such proposal.<lb/>
We cannot have a time limit. We cannot have money compensation. What are we to have? The view of the Government is to have a time limit of moderate length based on what may be reasonable expectation. Lord Lovat quoted a speech of mine, made some years ago, about its being wise as well as right in those who bring forward temperance legislation to have regard to the position of others, and particularly to the position of licence-holders and brewers and distillers, who, after all, carry on their business with the sanction of the law. I entirely agree. I think you must have regard to their position, but because you ought to "have regard," do not rush into the other extreme, do not destroy every possibility of bringing forward a workable Bill by setting up a right of property which does not exist. Fourteen years is out of the question. Money compensation is equally out of the question in Scotland. What you come to is some time limit, a warning&#x2014;whatever you like to call it&#x2014;and the scheme of the Bill has been to take five years. I cannot agree with the argument of the noble Lord that you ought not to take into account the fact that this was the period mentioned in Lord Peel's Report a long time ago, and that this whole question has been the subject of a settled determination on the part of a large number of people that they mean to redress a great social evil and that a measure of this kind is one of the ways of doing it. Those who have taken on licences have taken them on with the knowledge that their chances of renewal were more precarious than hitherto. The Bill gives a full five years, indeed, more than five years, because a certain period will have to elapse before the machinery can be got into working order. In these circumstances I think it is reasonable to say that five years is, on the whole, just about as near as you can get to the equivalent for that chance of renewal which has existed hitherto, but which cannot be measured in terms of figures. I venture to think, having regard to the totally different position in which the title to renewal of a licence-holder in Scotland stands to that elsewhere, that five years is a reasonable time. If your Lordships tried to fix another period
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0510"/>
<col>1011</col>
you could not find any better example than in the speech of the noble Lord who has just addressed the House of the extreme difficulty of doing so. On the whole we think five years a fair period, and that is why we cannot accept the longer period proposed by the noble Lord in the Amendment now before us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02947"><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: After the description given by Lord Balfour's correspondent of those who occupy offices in the Church, I feel some diffidence in intervening in this discussion; but I should like to say how cordially I support the appeal made by Lord Balfour To the Government to make the period a little more than five years. The noble and learned Viscount who has just spoken complained of Lord Balfour because he did not state the specific period of years&#x2014;somewhere between the five years and the fourteen years&#x2014;which he would like to see adopted. I understood my noble friend to refrain from a specific proposal with a view to leaving it to the Government to make the suggestion themselves. To many of us who are thoroughly in accord with the principles of this Bill, with the spirit in which it is drafted, and with the general intention of it, it will be exceedingly hard if we find a lack of support in many quarters where we might have hoped for it because of this provision fixing the period at five years. I believe that there are many, who would otherwise agree to the proposals in the Bill, who would feel that the bringing into operation of the machinery of the Bill in five years was not reasonable or fair. Many of us will feel deeply disappointed if, at the outset of the discussions in Committee, we are told that five years is the fullest possible time that can be allowed for reaching the very different state of things which this Bill would bring about; and speaking as one who would support the Bill in its main principles right through I feel it would be difficult to do so as readily if one were limited in that way. Personally I could not go as far as fourteen years, but I should have thought ten years a reasonable time. I do not, however, express any opinion regarding that. If the Government would hold out some hope that they would modify the term now suggested in the Bill it would relieve many of us who desire in a large way to support the Bill. Therefore I join in the appeal made by Lord Balfour.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1012</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02948"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Like my noble friend Lord Balfour, I greatly regret that the noble Earl in charge of the Bill should have charged us&#x2014;I think he did so in effect&#x2014;with unreasonableness because we propose to extend the somewhat ruthless time limit which the Bill at present provides. Is it not quite obvious that a time limit of this kind must be an open question, must be a question of degree? No one can say that the five years term of the Bill is calculated on a scientificbasis and is therefore absolutely right, and that fourteen years is absolutely wrong. The noble and learned Viscount who spoke afterwards on behalf of the Government said that five years was as near as His Majesty's Government could get to it. I think that shows that in his mind, at all events, this question is not one that can be determined in any very reasoned or precise manner. The position of my noble friend Lord Grey seems to me to be much more logical. He objects to a time limit altogether, and would desire to get rid of it. He says it is the worst possible form of compensation. I will not argue that question with him now. But what I wish to point out to the House is that it is at present the only form of compensation to be found in the Bill, and if the people who are to be dispossessed under this Bill are to be compensated at all it must apparently be in the form of a time limit.<lb/>
The noble Earl in charge of the Bill told us that we were making too much of the grievance because it would not follow that the whole of the licences would be swept away. But surely I am right in supposing that wherever a no-licence resolution is carried the whole of the licences will disappear, and that that will happen which the noble Earl seems to think impossible. To my mind my noble friend Lord Lovat demonstrated the inadequacy of this five-years time limit. He referred&#x2014;I think very properly&#x2014;to the precedent of the English Bill of 1908, when, as we all remember, the Government proposed a fourteen-years time limit with a seven years "run," as it was called, afterwards&#x2014;twenty-one years altogether&#x2014;accompanied by compensation. The noble and learned Viscount told us that the circumstances were different in Scotland from the circumstances in this country. That, no doubt, is true. Nevertheless I venture to maintain that, so far as the principle is concerned, the two cases are at any rate analogous&#x2014;that in both cases there is an
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0511"/>
<col>1013</col>
interest which is a valuable interest, which is bought and sold as a valuable interest, which is taxed as a valuable interest, and which ought to be treated by any Government with at any rate a certain amount of consideration. It seems to me a monstrous thing that the same Government should tax an interest of this kind as heavily as the value of these certificates is taxed upon the assumption that there is some amount of permanency or durability about them and then should proceed to legislate with regard to them upon a wholly different basis. I feel very strongly with my noble friend Lord Balfour that in the interests of the policy which this measure embodies it is desirable that the terms upon which these people are dispossessed of something which, if not legally property, is at any rate something of a by no means negligible value, should be terms reasonably generous; and I am convinced that if we fall short in that respect the result is likely to</membercontribution></p>

We have now before us the second question as to what number of years shall be inserted. I voted with the majority against the retention of five years, but I frankly say that I think fourteen years is too long a period. If Lord Lovat's Amendment were agreed to in its entirety it would put off the whole operation of the Bill for fourteen years. I do not think that can really be intended, but that would be the effect of inserting the word "fourteen" in this particular place. I have no authority to speak for anybody but myself, but I am inclined to make a renewed appeal to the Government not to confront us with an absolute <i>non possumus</i> in this matter. If it is open to me to do so&#x2014;and on this I should like the opinion of the Lord Chairman&#x2014;I shall vote against the insertion of the word "fourteen" for the purpose of inserting "ten." I further say that it seems to me illogical to bring both options in necessarily at the same time, whether it is five, ten, or fourteen years.

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02958"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I venture with much diffidence to make a suggestion to the House. His Majesty's Government have given no indication of a desire to accept any figure other than "five." It seems to me that this question of compensation ought to be considered as a whole. There are other Amendments on the Paper which certainly affect the question of compensation, and it occurs to me that we should be in a better position to deal with this point of the time limit when we know how we stand with regard to the other Amendments that will come before the House. Personally I think it would be a relief to some of us, having struck the five-years limit out of the Bill and agreed provisionally to put in its place a fourteen-years limit, if we could reserve the further consideration of the limit question until the discussion on the Bill has gone further.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02960"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships have struck out "five," and you must put something in its place.

I think we shall be in a much better position to determine the precise figure when we have gone through the Committee stage of the Bill. The straightforward thing would be to carry through the Amendment now before the House and insert "fourteen," and consider the matter again when we come to the Report stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02961"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships have agreed to strike out the word "five," and the proposal now before us is that the word "fourteen" should be inserted. You might, of course, negative that proposal, but the difficulty
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0513"/>
<col>1017</col>
of that mode of dealing with the question is that you might have an endless series of figures suggested for consideration. I think the simpler course would be to propose an Amendment to the Amendment to the effect that "ten" should take the place of "fourteen." If that is resolved in the negative, then "fourteen" would take its place in the clause <i>instanter.</i></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02962"><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: It does not seem any use at the present stage to make a further appeal to the Government to assist us in this matter. I only rise to express the hope that, whatever course the House decides to adopt, we shall have another opportunity of voting on the figure to be inserted in the place of "five," in order that it may be possible for those who, like Lord Balfour and myself, voted with the majority to strike out five years, to make clear that we did so because we thought five years too brief a period and not because we necessarily accepted fourteen years. If Lord Balfour moves to substitute ten years for fourteen years I should vote for that Amendment. If, on the other hand, we are first asked to decide on the question of inserting "fourteen," I shall vote against that. But I hope that, whatever course is adopted, there will be an opportunity afforded of making the matter perfectly clear in the Lobby.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02964"><member>LORD LOVAT</member><membercontribution>: I suggest that for the present "fourteen" should be provisionally inserted, and we could consider on the Report stage the precise number of years to be finally put into the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

I will not divide the House to-day, on the clear understanding that "fourteen" is regarded as provisional, and that a subsequent opportunity will be afforded of making another proposal when we see how the discussion goes on the other clauses.</membercontribution></p>

I do not understand why the words which I propose to omit appear in the Bill. I understand that they were not in the Bill last year when it was a private Members' Bill, but the Government after accepting the Bill appear to have made this alteration themselves. It was always customary that an Act of Parliament should come into force on the day of its passing or at some later date, and never until a year or two ago, have we had instances of Bills coming into force before they have passed. In this particular case the reason is obvious, because the Secretary for Scotland admitted in the other House that the first of June was inserted for the purpose of getting round the Parliament Act. The Lord Chancellor said just now that this Bill would not come into force for nearly six years owing to elections and other matters of that sort, but he forgot to notice the fact that according to Clause 1, as it now stands, six months of the time have already run. I submit that it is contrary to the practice of Parliament to make a Bill retrospective, and for that reason I propose to strike out these words and to substitute "passing thereof."</membercontribution></p>

By the proposal in the Bill as it stands the inspection of the register may be made by any elector, and if the requisition is defective the poll may be declared void and a forged signature or the defacing of a requisition is subject to heavy penalties. Already in the Bill we have provided against the improper use of the power of requisition. The object of the noble Earl's Amendment is to provide a method by direct enactment for ascertaining whether a requisition is duly signed. The Bill as it stands provides that the Secretary for Scotland shall be the authority to make regulations to provide for the procedure

being correct. The noble Earl, as an alternative, suggests that this should be done by direct enactment and that the duty of seeing that the requisition is in order should be laid on the local authority. Under the Bill as it stands the Secretary for Scotland would have to issue regulations. Under the noble Earl's Amendment the local authority would be empowered to do it, and to that Amendment I am quite willing to agree without prejudice to anything which may happen at a later stage.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02990">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02991"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member> moved to omit from subsection (2) the words "a no-change resolution," and to insert "a disinterested management resolution." The noble Lord said: This Amendment raises a large and important point of policy, and it will probably be convenient to take that point of policy and argue it on this Amendment. I am in favour of the additional option to the electors of what is known as disinterested management. There is an Amendment which follows immediately afterwards in the name of the noble Marquess on the Front Bench (Lord Salisbury) which is also in principle for disinterested management, but he proposes to make a less change in form upon the Bill than I do. As I understand his Amendment, he would put an additional option into the Schedule so that there would be four options instead of three. If your Lordships refer to the Schedule of the Bill you will find that as it stands the voter may vote for one of three alternatives. He may vote for no-change; he may vote for a reduction; or he may vote for prohibition in the particular area with which he is concerned. I have never been able to understand what the object of the no-change resolution is, and I hesitated to put a fourth option in the Schedule mainly for the reason that I thought it would introduce undue complication in the voting. Therefore the proposal in my Amendment is to change the form of the Schedule. There will still only be three options before the voter, but those three will be disinterested management, a reduction of licences, or total prohibition.</p>
<col>1022</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02992">I suggest this change, that each voter shall have the power of voting for or against, and, of course, if he votes against all the three options that is equivalent to a no-change resolution. On that point the difference, while material in form, is not, I venture to suggest to the House, very great in substance. There are other points in the Amendment of the noble Marquess, Iris form of disinterested management and its details, which are very different from what I suggest. But in this preliminary explanation of the particular issue which is before the House I shall not discuss the details of the noble Marquess's Amendment, but endeavour to explain in as few and as simple words as I can the option for disinterested management which I propose to insert, and my reasons for doing it. In the discussions on this matter I hope those concerned will remember that under the Schedule in the Bill each voter would have only one vote&#x2014;namely, in favour of the particular option. In my proposal he would have a vote for or against, thereby making a more distinct record of the opinions of those who vote. The form of ballot paper which I suggest is not altogether new. It is nearly the same as that proposed in a three-fold option Bill brought into the House of Commons so long ago as 1899 by Mr. Parker Smith.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02993">I pass from questions of machinery to the merits of the proposal of disinterested management. In the first place, it is not municipalisation of the liquor trade. It has sometimes been misrepresented as being the same as that, and people have argued against it on that ground and for the reason that it would practically make the whole community, whatever their opinions are about the lawfulness or unlawfulness of drinking at all, partisans and parties to the sale of drink. The proposal I venture to put before the House avoids that danger. The public as a constituency would have no more concern with the liquor traffic than they have at the present time. All that would be done would be that a company of disinterested unselfish persons would be formed to manage the traffic which every one admits requires careful management and regulation, upon unselfish and disinterested lines, and I respectfully suggest to the House that this avoids the danger present in any individual interest in a licence that there would be undue or extravagant inducements put before customers to take more than they would
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0516"/>
<col>1023</col>
otherwise desire to take. In other words, if I may repeat one suggestion I made on the Second Reading of the Bill, the interest of the community is essentially different from and opposite to the interest of the individual seller of drink. The individual licence-holder has a great temptation as a man of business, as a man who wants to make his livelihood, to sell as much as he can of the particular article in which he trades. I do not blame him; it is natural; but it is not in the interests of the community that that sale should be so pushed. If people want it, this is a free country and in my opinion they ought to have it. I will resist to the last any control over what I regard as a legitimate thing. Undue control and the prevention of getting what one desires seems to me an interference with what is legitimate freedom which is in itself indefensible. At the same time I am as anxious as anybody can be to do away with illegitimate inducements to people to take more drink than they would naturally do of their own accord.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02994">We must assume in this matter, or at least I must for the purposes of my argument, that there will be public-houses. We are far away from the time when you can hope to prohibit them altogether. It seems to me an idle and foolish idea that you can attain to that within any measurable time. If that is so, then the best interest of the community is surely to see that they are as legitimately, as unselfishly, and as well managed as possible. The licensing authority would remain, and would regulate these disinterested management houses in the same way as it regulates ordinary public-houses. The houses would be open to the police, and there would be none of the interference with private premises which is involved in control of clubs. The locality, under my proposal, would have no direct financial interest in the amount of drink that was sold. The accounts of the company would be open to a Government audit. I am bound to say that during the last few years this idea has been gaining ground. I have received many communications from those whose opinions I value in favour of the idea. But the difficulty of bringing it into operation is very great, because unless you purchase an existing house at an extravagant price or go to the licensing authority and increase the number of houses you cannot get a footing for disinterested management. Our idea is, in
<col>1024</col>
cases where the people are willing that the experiment should be tried, that we should substitute this class of management for&#x2014;using, I hope, not an undue term of reproach&#x2014;the selfish management which now exists. It has support from the Minority Report of the Peel Commission, and it has the support of a Committee of your Lordships' House so long ago as 1879. I will not quote the words, because I do not wish to weary the House by so doing. After all, what is proposed is only an option, and I think I may appeal in the presence of the Government to a most notable memorial presented to the Prime Minister from Scotland a week or two ago, to which there were thousands of signatures of some of the most respected men all over Scotland, in favour of having this Amendment inserted in the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02995">Now, my Lords, I touch upon another point as to which there may be a certain amount of controversy. In my opinion to give this scheme a fair chance you must, in the district in which it is established, give it a practical monopoly. I do not say that you must give it a monopoly as opposed to hotels and restaurants, which cater for a different class of custom, but I do think if it is to have a fair chance it must have a monopoly in the area of retail sale over the counter of ordinary spirits and spirituous liquors. I point out also that it would extinguish&#x2014;and here is another controversial point&#x2014;what are known as grocers' licences. There are more of these licences in proportion to the population in Scotland than anywhere else, and I am bound to say that I regard grocers' licences as one of the most pernicious forms of licences. I see no reason why the grocer should sell spirits any more than the butcher or the baker, and from what I hear the sale of spirits by grocers, in the means afforded to women secretly to get these things to a greater extent than they ought to have them, has been productive of a great deal of evil. Therefore it is one of the advantages to my mind that if we could establish this form of disinterested management of public-houses it would put an end in a large measure to one of the worst aspects of the grocers' licence.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02996">I again touch upon a point of controversy. If disinterested management is to be brought in after the period, whenever it is, when total prohibition is enacted,
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0517"/>
<col>1025</col>
then I can see no reason why the disinterested management people should have to pay compensation. If, on the other hand, the suggestion which I ventured to make a few moments ago was to bear fruit, and there was to be an option given for a reduction of licences at a less distant period than for total prohibition, and if there was also an option at the same time to bring in disinterested management, I cannot myself see any reason why those who become responsible for disinterested management houses, or disinterested management companies, should not pay their fair quota of compensation to those whom they dispossess. In that matter, however, I speak for myself, and I merely say that because I want to make a real effort to convince the House that I want to be as fair as possible to all the interests concerned. There are details involved as to certificates and the keeping of accounts, the control which the Government, through the Secretary for Scotland or otherwise, would have to exercise, and other matters that do not touch upon at this moment because I am not now moving that Amendment. The question we have to debate on this occasion is whether or not we are to have a disinterested management option in the Schedule, and, if so, in what way it is to be inserted. I am perfectly aware that it is a controversial point, but I am bound to say on the whole, having regard to the balance of opinion, that it seems to me the time has come when the country should be given a real opportunity of saying whether they will accept this proposal. If they want it they can have it under my proposal; if they do not want it, then they will not vote for it. I cannot see that any interest is harmed by the proposal I make, and I am sanguine enough to believe that this is the one hope of rapid temperance reform in the real sense.</p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-02998"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I was anxious, if your Lordships are going to discuss on this Amendment and at once the whole system of disinterested management, that the various schemes which have been put before the House on the Order Paper should be submitted to your Lordships, and that we should discuss the matter as
<col>1026</col>
a whole. That seems to me a much more desirable course than taking the single Amendment of the noble Lord opposite and discussing it. In those circumstances it would probably be more convenient to your Lordships if we now listened to the arguments in support of the other Amendment in favour of disinterested management.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-02999"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: There seems to me to be an extraordinary reluctance on the part of His Majesty's Government to commit themselves to anything. It appears to me an astonishing way for the noble Earl to treat your Lordships' House, that on every Amendment he stands back and waits for others to indicate to him the line that ought to be taken. Everybody must admit that my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh moved his Amendment with the greatest moderation with a desire to provoke a perfectly temperate and non-controversial discussion, and with a view to helping His Majesty's Government to pass a good Bill. My noble friend laid a good many facts before your Lordships and appealed to many authorities, and he did not, as far as I made out, desire in any way to make a controversial speech. But for some reason or other the noble Earl in charge of the Bill prefers to reserve himself for a later moment. With most of what my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh said he knows very well that I agree. He knows that I and those who sit on this Bench beside me are also believers in disinterested management, and as far as I know none of us have ever said anything inconsistent with that view. We believe that the time has come when the effort which has been made for many years towards disinterested management in a spasmodic sort of way should receive a more official sanction, and we hope that before this Bill passes into law an Amendment in that direction may be inserted.<lb/>
I do not think that your Lordships would wish me to repeat the arguments of my noble friend, because I should only say far less efficiently what he has just stated, and there is no reason why I should repeat it. I desire, therefore, in one sentence to associate myself with most of what my noble friend has said. But when we come to the precise proposal which he has made I see considerable difficulties, and we have thought it right to put another
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0518"/>
<col>1027</col>
proposal before your Lordships' House. In the first place, I do not think my noble friend's Amendment, if he will allow me to say so, errs on the side of simplicity. It is very elaborate, and it makes a radical change in the drafting of the Bill. I think that is unnecessary. No one will accuse me of being too respectful to the Bills of His Majesty's Government, but I do not think it is necessary that we should make changes unless they are changes of really considerable importance, and many of my noble friend's changes seem to me to be not really necessary, although he may think them advisable for the object he has in view. I take, for example, his method of voting in his Schedule. He thinks that he would get a truer picture of the popular view by means of his Schedule, but I confess that if I were an elector presented with his Schedule I should feel a great deal of difficulty as to what the result of my voting would be. I do not profess to be particularly intelligent, but I dare say I am as intelligent as many electors are, and I should find great difficulty in that respect. Every elector is to have six votes, for or against any one of the three propositions. [Several noble LORDS: Three votes.] No; he has six alternatives which lie may adopt, with three votes. That is an accurate way of putting it, I think. I confess I should not be at all sure what the result would be if I voted with a voting paper of that kind. If, for example, I vote "Aye" in favour of a limiting resolution and there were no limiting resolution, I have no idea what the result of that would be. [A noble LORD: A spoilt paper.] Why should it be a spoilt paper? The Bill says that every elector must indicate his vote by placing a cross opposite the resolution for which he votes, but no elector may place more than one cross opposite any one resolution. I do not propose to put more than one cross opposite any one resolution. I propose to put one cross opposite the limiting resolution, and one opposite the no-change resolution, both for. What is the effect of that? I may be very stupid, but I confess I do not understand it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03000"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: It seems to me the effect is perfectly clear. When the votes are counted those resolutions which get a majority of the votes will be carried into effect, and those which have not a majority will not be carried into effect.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1028</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03001"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: But as you may vote in all three cases it seems to me that the elector who would have to choose where he would put his crosses would be placed in a position of very great difficulty. And let me say this. If, after considerable discussion in this House, we did arrive at what actually would take place that really is not sufficient. You have to have something which is quite clear to the elector, and unless the thing is perfectly simple and clear for him to understand I submit that in this, after all, very small matter of machinery my noble friend's Amendment is not well drawn. I rather gathered from him&#x2014;I am sure I do not desire to misinterpret him for a moment&#x2014;that he is quite open to accept the other form of voting, namely, the voting which I suggest&#x2014;that there should be four options, and in the ordinary way the elector should be asked to vote for any single one of the four he desires, and that that should be the only alternative open to him. That seems a simple matter. My first reason, therefore, for not quite agreeing with my noble friend is that I think his Amendment is too complicated.<lb/>
I think that in other respects my noble friend's proposal goes a little too far&#x2014;not too far, let me say, in the case of new licences. With regard to all licences granted after the passing of the Act I think he and I are absolutely agreed that where the electors have chosen the disinterested management option all new licences should be granted subject to disinterested management. That is a very large measure of agreement. In all growing neighbourhoods where this option is adopted henceforward every new licence would be granted subject to the condition of disinterested management. That seems to me a very important point upon which we are entirely agreed.<lb/>
Now I come to deal with the much more difficult question of the existing certificates, as I ought to call them, in respect to Scotland. What ought to be done in the case of existing certificates? In the first place, I am not quite sure whether my noble friend and I are agreed or not as to whether the authorised companies should be called upon to make any payment. I think I gathered from my noble friend that lie was not averse to asking them to make a certain payment. If that be so, that is another point of agreement between
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0519"/>
<col>1029</col>
us, because in my Amendment, differing in that respect from the Amendment of my noble friend, I provide that the disinterested companies should be asked to pay what they reasonably can pay for the privilege&#x2014;I use "privilege" in its technical sense&#x2014;of having a sort of monopoly, a limited monopoly as I shall show in a moment, for the sale of intoxicating liquors. Why should they not pay? I think they ought to pay. Let them get the proper interest on the money of the shareholders, the 4 per cent. with regard to which both he and I are agreed. Let them have a sufficient sum of money laid by in order to make a proper reserve fund&#x2014;that is provided for in both Amendments. But after that it seems only reasonable that they should pay something out of the surplus profits which they earn towards carrying into effect this Act. Not only is it fair in itself, but it would mitigate to some extent the necessary susceptibilities of the dispossessed publican. After all whatever view we may have in this House and in Parliament generally of the proper treatment of publicans, Ave must allow that the publican is entitled to a certain feeling of grievance at being thrown out of his means of livelihood by the operation of this Bill. Personally I think he has got a very strong grievance, and I think all of your Lordships will agree that it is very natural that he should feel a certain amount of irritation at his fate. I think he would feel that it was only reasonable, if he is to be dispossessed, that out of their surplus profits his supplanters&#x2014;for that is the sort of word he would use&#x2014;should pay something towards mitigating the blow. There should be some relief granted to him by those who are going to take his place out of the profits which they are going to make from his business, but I do not propose that they should be asked to pay anything unduly. I am quite aware that the disinterested management people will not make so good a business of it as the dispossessed publican. Obviously they will not. It is for that very reason that we want to put this disinterested management in&#x2014;namely, in order that they shall not press the trade in the way in which the publican naturally, from his point of view, does press the trade. But still they can pay something, and there is no reason in the world why they should not pay something towards mitigating what must be to the dispossessed publican a serious grievance. Upon that there is no very
<col>1030</col>
great difference between me and my noble friend, although he does not provide for it in his Amendment and I do provide for it in mine.<lb/>
Then comes the question of whether the option is to involve an absolute monopoly, or only a limited monopoly, of a restricted trade. My noble friend says it must be all or nothing. I confess I rather shrink from so extreme a course. I do not think it is likely to be very successful, or to recommend itself to a great body of reasonable men, for, after all, we know very little as to the financial success of these disinterested management companies. They have been in existence a long time and have had a certain amount of success in England, but I do not think any of your Lordships, except one or two noble friends of mine that I see here who have a special knowledge of the subject, are in a position to say for certain that any of these disinterested companies are an assured success. I hear a noble friend of mine say that in one county in England they are a failure. At any rate, they are upon their trial, and I think when a movement is in that position it is not reasonable to say to the electors of a particular locality, "You are in favour of disinterested management, but you do not know much about the companies who offer to give you disinterested management; you do not know much about their financial success or their management success; but if you choose disinterested management at all you must have all or nothing." Surely that is not a proposition which is likely to commend itself to any body of our countrymen, whether they live North or South of the Tweed. They are almost certain to say in the great majority of cases, "We cannot take so extreme a course as that; we shall be very glad to see this experiment of disinterested management tried; we shall be glad to give it official sanction and give it the power of the law behind it in order to bring it into being; but if we are to say straight off that we will abolish every other means for the provision of this necessary refreshment except such as can be obtained by disinterested management, without knowing anything about the subject, then you will not get it at all." If you try to press it intemperately and drive it, as it were, down the throats of the people you will not get it in that way. Therefore I suggest that it is a far wiser thing, wiser in the interests of the movement itself, to allow it to be
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0520"/>
<col>1031</col>
tentative. What is the objection to that The objection, so far as I know, is this, that those who are in favour of the extreme form of my noble friend's Amendment are not willing to trust the licensing authority to strike the particular line to the extent to which the experiment ought to be carried. Why should you not trust them? Do you distrust the licensing authority as a matter of fact? I ask noble Lords from Scotland, do they distrust the licensing authority there? Have they found that those authorities are unwilling to interpret what is the public opinion in Scotland? I feel a certain diffidence in speaking on Scottish matters because I have no immediate acquaintance with Scotland, although I have a profound respect for that country, but I believe it to be true that the licensing authority there is already more or less a popular body. A large part of it is subject to direct or indirect election.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03002"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: The noble Marquess will excuse my saying that in some burghs the licensing authority is entirely in the hands of the justices of the peace. In those burghs in which licensing is in the hands of the town council the town council are, of course, elected, and they appoint the bailies. The bailies are the equivalent of justices of the peace, so to speak, Although the licensing authority is to a certain extent popularly elected there is the intervening secondary election, for the council elects the bailies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03003"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I am quite aware that there is the element of secondary election, but in respect to this Bill the burghs are much more important than the counties. No doubt it is in the burghs that the evils which this Bill is directed against mostly exist, and no doubt the licensing authority there is subject more or less to the wishes of public opinion. Would it not be a perfectly reasonable system that you should submit an option to the locality so that the electors may determine whether they wish to have this experiment tried or not, and then the precise details of the extent to which the experiment should be tried should be left in the hands of the licensing authority? That appears to me to be a perfectly reasonable system. I think I have said enough to show both the points where my Amendment agrees with my noble friend's and where it differs. My Amendment is a
<col>1032</col>
much more tentative Amendment than that of my noble friend, and I think it is likely to be much more successful. Moreover, it is much fairer, for I provide the payment of money which his Amendment does not provide. Lastly, it is much simpler. On those three grounds&#x2014;that it is more likely to be successful and that it is fairer and simpler&#x2014;I recommend it with great diffidence to your Lordships' House as a suitable alternative to the Amendment of my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03004"><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, your Lordships are now in possession of the arguments in support of the two alternative proposals which have been placed on the Order Paper for the purpose of introducing the principle of disinterested management into this Bill&#x2014;the proposal of my noble friend Lord Balfour and that of my- noble friend on the Front Opposition Bench, Lord Salisbury. As I have for many years taken a deep and active interest in the application of the principle of disinterested management under very limited conditions to the public-houses in this country I desire to say one word to the House upon this question. There are really two points raised by the Amendment we are now discussing&#x2014;the question of the principle of disinterested management as a method of controlling the liquor trade, and the question of how, if we approve that principle, it should be applied and introduced into this Bill. I do not think it necessary to say very much about the principle, because so far as this debate has gone there seems to be very general agreement that the principle of disinterested management has a great deal to recommend it.<lb/>
But at the same time as it is a new principle which has never yet been introduced into the laws of this country and into our official licensing system I should like to say one word in passing about the main principle. Our opinions as to the merits and demerits of that principle depend upon what we look to the principle to do for us, because if it is supposed by anybody that the introduction of the principle of disinterested management is going effectively to reduce and abolish all drunkenness it is quite obvious that those expectations will be disappointed, and if we look to the countries in which this principle has been adopted we should be bound to confess that the principle has been a hopeless
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0521"/>
<col>1033</col>
failure. But the fact is that this principle has never been introduced with that object, and it is no more possible for the principle of disinterested management to abolish drunkenness than it is to abolish drunkenness by any other administrative machinery. So long as human weaknesses and appetites are what they are to-day you will never be able to abolish drunkenness by administrative machinery. The only thing claimed for disinterested management is that it is a better system for controlling the liquor trade than that of the licensing of private individuals which we have in the country to-day. From that point of view I claim that it has been an unqualified success in the only countries in which it has really been carried out.<lb/>
My noble friend who spoke just now said we knew very little about this principle of disinterested management. It is quite true that in this country we know very little about it because it has never been really completely established. Thanks to the wisdom and energy and enthusiasm of Lord Grey and of the Bishop of Chester and others who introduced the principle into this country under what we know as Trust public-houses it has been tried partially in scattered districts and under very hampering conditions. But in order to see how the principle works one must look to the country in which it has been applied without those hampering conditions and on a general scale. Therefore if we turn to Norway and Sweden, the home of this principle&#x2014;the only countries in which it has been fully applied&#x2014;I claim that in those countries it has been universally accepted as a better alternative method of controlling the retail liquor sale than the licensing of private individuals which we have in this country to-day and which existed in Norway and Sweden before the principle of disinterested management was introduced. In Norway and Sweden there are temperance societies, the Good Templars, the Rechabites, and other societies, the members of which believe in the total prohibition of the sale of liquor and look forward to that as the ultimate ideal of any temperance policy. They hold, in fact, precisely the same views on the question of temperance as do the Good Templars and Rechabites in this country, and yet all the members of those societies in Norway and Sweden, although they would certainly wish to abolish the disinterested management companies because
<col>1034</col>
they would like to abolish all facilities for obtaining liquor upon licensed premises, although they are opposed to the disinterested management system in that sense, they are all agreed in preferring it to the system which prevailed beforehand, and you will not find one of those societies who would be in favour of doing away with the system of controlling the trade through disinterested management companies and going back to the old system of private licensing. I claim, therefore, that in those countries where it has been tried, whatever may be the differences of opinion as to its merits as a final measure of temperance reform, by universal consent it is admitted that this system is preferable to one of private licensing such as we have in this country.<lb/>
Since this method has come to occupy a recognised place in the policy of temperance reform I hold that it is desirable that it should be introduced as one of the options given in this Bill. It is a recognised system in the policy of temperance reform. This Bill is a Local Option Bill; it professes to give to the locality the right of settling for itself by the voles of the majority in what way the liquor trade in that locality shall be controlled; and I say, when speaking of local option and giving to the locality the right of controlling the liquor traffic themselves, to refuse the right of trying this experiment which has been carried out with success in other parts of the world and which has been carried out in a less degree in this country&#x2014;to talk of local option and to deny that particular form of local option is simply to misuse language. Whatever our opinions may be as to whether this is a good or bad system we ought, I think, to be agreed that if you are to have local option at all the locality ought to have the right of voting for this particular form of management of the liquor trade.<lb/>
Now I come to the machinery whereby, if we agree to the principle, it can be incorporated in this Bill. There are two proposals&#x2014;those of my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh and my noble friend Lord Salisbury. They differ in two respects. They differ partly in the form of ballot paper by which the electors are to introduce the principle. I pass by that for a moment, because, after all, it is a matter of machinery, and I do not think that the change in the ballot paper made
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0522"/>
<col>1035</col>
by Lord Balfour's Amendment is at all an essential part of his Amendment. The other difference is this, that by Lord Balfour's Amendment the principle of disinterested management will be made a real option&#x2014;that is to say, the locality shall have the right of voting for or against this particular principle, but if they vote in favour of it then it shall be applied to the licences in the district just as a no-licence resolution will be applied to all the licences in the district covered by the machinery of the Bill. But my noble friend Lord Salisbury's Amendment provides that if a locality votes in favour of the principle of disinterested management then it shall be left to the Licensing Court to put that resolution into operation according to its own discretion and to the extent which it thinks desirable. In other words, if a disinterested management resolution were carried at a poll the only result which might happen would be that the Licensing Court would apply the principle of disinterested management to one public-house in the district.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03005"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: It might apply it to all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03006"><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: Quite so; it might, of course, apply it to all. My noble friend says that our objection to his form of Amendment is due to the fact that we do not trust the Licensing Court to exercise its discretion as to the extent to which this principle should be put into operation. My objection goes very much further than that. I object to it in the first instance because it is wholly inconsistent with the principle of local option. Local option may be a good thing or a bad thing, but it is the principle of this Bill, and I think it is wholly inconsistent with the principle of the Bill to give the locality a vote unless that vote is thereby going to be carried into operation if cast in a certain direction. My further objection to it is that it is impossible, as I said just now, to carry out the principle of disinterested management effectively unless it is carried out with a monopoly in a certain limited area. I say it is impossible to do that because at the present moment the experience of the Trust companies in England shows that many changes and alterations in the management of a particular public-house might be very desirable in the public interests or in the interests of temperance but impossible to be carried
<col>1036</col>
out so long as that house is conducted in competition with a number of trade houses in the immediate neighbourhood. I have in my mind at this moment a particular Trust public-house in a slum street in a small country town, and in that same street there are ten or twelve ordinary public-houses belonging to the trade. It is impossible for the Trust public-house, the disinterested management public-house, to really create any impression whatever upon the public opinion of that street or to give an adequate example of the principle of disinterested management in operation when it has to compete with these totally differing conditions, over which it has no control, in the houses immediately surrounding it. I say, therefore, it is not merely a question of the extent to which this principle should be applied.<lb/>
The root objection to Lord Salisbury's Amendment is that you cannot apply disinterested management satisfactorily at all unless it is applied with a monopoly in a limited area. Then I am told, "Oh, but that is a very large order, and more than this House will be prepared to grant." I could understand that objection if we were asking at one fell swoop to place all licences in Scotland under disinterested management. But that is not what we are asking. We are merely saying that in certain country districts or in a certain burgh, after the inhabitants by a very large majority have decided in favour of this principle, it should be applied to all the licences in that district or in that burgh, and if we are to be told that that is such a large order that it cannot possibly be passed by Parliament., then I confess I despair of ever carrying any temperance reform at all which will affect the existing licensing system. To say that you cannot apply a change of this sort even in a small locality after the votes of the population have been recorded in favour of it is simply to saddle us for all time with the existing licensing system with all its evils. I contend that it is really making a very small demand upon Parliament and asking for a very small concession to say that this principle, if it is an experiment which ought to be tried, should be tried under favourable circumstances and that it should be tried in these small districts.<lb/>
There are two other aspects in which I distinctly prefer the proposal of my noble friend Lord Balfour. As regards the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0523"/>
<col>1037</col>
arrangement of the ballot paper I confess that I like his arrangement for this reason, that it seems to me quite unnecessary and contrary to precedent to give people a vote in favour of maintaining the <i>status quo.</i> That is in effect exactly the same as if a noble Lord in this House were to move as an Amendment to any Motion the direct negative. When any Amendment which is in fact a direct negative is moved we are always told, either in this House or in the other House of Parliament, that the proper way is to vote against the Motion. That is, I maintain, in a poll of this sort the proper way of declaring yourself in favour of a no-change resolution&#x2014;namely, that you should vote directly against the proposed change, and I see no reason whatever for introducing the no-change option. However, that is simply a matter of machinery, and I am sure my noble friend will agree with me that it is not an essential part of his Amendment. The machinery could be carried even if that were altered awl disinterested management were introduced as a fourth option instead of as a third.<lb/>
I object to the limiting proposal contained in my noble friend Lord Salisbury's Amendment because in my opinion it does not really give us anything more than we have to-day. It is quite open to any Licensing Court at the present time, if a Trust company were to come forward and offer compensation to the dispossessed publican, to take away an existing licence and give it to the disinterested management company. So far as new licences are concerned, of course both Amendments are of precisely the same character; but in so far as concerns existing licences and the machinery for transferring the existing licensing system to one under disinterested management, I see in the Amendment of my noble friend very little advantage that would be gained over the existing powers possessed by the Licensing Court. Lastly, there is a matter of detail which I think has not yet been touched upon and which constitutes a difference between the two Amendments. It is that under Lord Balfour's proposals the surplus profits of the disinterested management company are to be devoted to a national fund, whereas under Lord Salisbury's proposals they are to be spent for the benefit of the locality in accordance with a scheme approved by the county council or the town council. In the evolution of this
<col>1038</col>
question of disinterested management it has come to be an accepted fact that the surplus profits of the disinterested management company ought to be devoted to a national fund and spent upon public interests generally, and should not be spent in promoting the interests of the locality from which the funds are derived. When the Gothenburg system, which, after all, is the basis of what we are discussing to-night, was first introduced into Sweden the principle of Lord Salisbury's Amendment was first accepted, but when the neighbouring country of Norway adopted the system some years later they, profiting by the experience in Sweden, were careful not to devote the surplus profits to be expended in the locality, and at the present moment Sweden is trying to alter her laws, so that the surplus profits from the disinterested management companies should go to a central fund and not be spent upon the locality in which they are earned. Though I welcome most heartily the principle of disinterested management and should be glad to see it placed on the Statute-book in some form or another, I do think it would be very unfortunate if, when we are introducing this principle for the first time, we should ignore all the experience of those who have preceded us and should deliberately make the mistakes which, if we had regarded that experience, we should have been able to avoid. For these reasons I shall certainly support the proposals made by my noble friend Lord Balfour, and I hope that they will be accepted by your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03007"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: In view of the invitation which was addressed to me earlier in the evening by the noble Marquess opposite I feel that I should not delay any longer in explaining to your Lordships what the views of His Majesty's Government on this question are. I am quite sure that all noble Lords on both sides of the House are perfectly prepared to do homage to the idea of disinterested management. Where the difficulty comes in is with regard to putting a particular scheme into the Bill, for that is now the question before this House&#x2014;as to whether or no a particular scheme should be put into this Bill. The point of difference was well expressed at the beginning of his speech by the noble Earl who has just sat down when he said that in his opinion, in view of the fact that this was a Local Option Bill, it was the duty of the Government
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0524"/>
<col>1039</col>
to give the option to have a disinterested management system whether it was a good system or whether it was a bad one. That is the point where we join issue. We would be ready to say that if any disinterested management scheme met the objections which we feel to the schemes which so far have been brought forward we would be very willing to consider it, but we believe that when you come down to the practical working of the schemes there are so many objections to those which are put forward that it is not practical to put any particular scheme into a Bill of this kind. That is illustrated by what has taken place in the course of the debate to-night. The noble Lord, Lord Balfour of Burleigh, spoke in favour of his system. Then the noble Marquess opposite, having criticised the system of the noble Lord who had preceded him, propounded a scheme of his own. The noble Earl who has just sat down criticised severely the scheme of the noble Marquess, and I have no doubt that to-morrow we shall hear from the noble Earl who sits on the Cross Benches (Earl Grey) a criticism as severe of the scheme of the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03008"><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: I may say I supported the scheme of Lord Balfour.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03009"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I quite agree. I do not think that I said the noble Earl did not. But, on the other hand, what we shall get probably to-morrow will be further speeches which will support the scheme of the noble Marquess while criticising the scheme of the noble Lord. The fact is, there are to both of the systems which have been proposed objections so strong that we do not see our way to agree to put either one or the other in this Bill. Really I think it narrows itself down almost to the question of the monopoly. The noble Earl spoke strongly, as other gentlemen who support the scheme of disinterested management speak strongly, upon the immense importance of having a monopoly. Without the monopoly they do not think that the scheme will be a success. It is against the monopoly scheme that the noble Marquess opposite brings most of his objections, and in view of that great difficulty, which meets one almost at the outset of this question, I think your Lordships will find it very difficult to agree upon either the one scheme or the other.<lb/>
<col>1040</col>
But first of all let me say something upon the question of voting, because at the present moment we are discussing a great deal more than the actual question of disinterested management. With regard to the method of voting suggested by the noble Lord, although I do not suppose he would consider that to be the really vital point in his Amendment, there is one curious fact that I do not think lie himself can have noticed&#x2014;that is, that under his Amendment it is possible for a minority of votes to carry a resolution, in a way which I will presently explain to him and I will give the figures which will illustrate that point. I think we all agree that it is very difficult to tell, as the noble Marquess opposite said, what would be the exact result of the system of voting which the noble Lord proposes. Let me illustrate what might happen. It might happen in multiples of 100, but for the sake of convenience I will take 100 votes. There will be the three alternatives put before the voters. They will be able, if they so wish, to vote for disinterested management, or for a limiting resolution, or for no licence at all. It is conceivable that the majority of those 100 people would be against any alteration at all; they would be what we may, for the sake of a label, call in favour of the trade, but they would not necessarily vote in the same numbers against each resolution. Some would vote for one and some against the other, but we might have this result that 55 would vote against disinterested management, 60 would vote against a limiting resolution, and 58 would vote against the prohibition resolution. But, on the other hand, you might have 45 people voting for disinterested management, 40 for the limiting resolution, and 42 for total prohibition. Now your Lord ships will see that in a subsequent Amendment Lord Balfour of Burleigh proposes to enact that "The resolution which has the highest number of votes cast in its favour shall be deemed to be carried, provided as follows," and so on. But your Lordships will see that in these circumstances the disinterested management resolution would be carried although only 45 people had voted in favour of it and 55 people voted against it. That hardly, I think, can be considered a very satisfactory method of voting; but I quite agree that the noble Lord would, if he were pressed, probably find some other way of securing the opinion of the people upon his resolution.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0525"/>
<col>1041</col>
This is not really the important point, or the point upon which your Lordships will divide. The real point will be how far a practical scheme of disinterested management can really be put into the Bill. We have already had, on the Second Reading of the Bill, some mention of the disinterested management scheme, and two objections were pointed out even at that early stage to anything of the kind. One was the point of the monopoly and the other was the question of finance. Let us take first of all the scheme of the noble Lord, the scheme for which a large number of resolutions have been passed in various places in Scotland. If the noble Lord will allow me to say so, I think they generally have been passed in favour of the principle rather than in favour of any one particular scheme. There is, indeed, a violent expression of opinion, which has probably reached all your Lordships, with regard to the Amendment of Lord Balfour of Burleigh. It was an expression of opinion which appeared in the <i>Morning Advertiser</i> on November 14 last. That journal said&#x2014;
<quote>"There is one set of Amendments standing in the name of Lord Balfour of Burleigh which not only sins by accepting the principle of local veto, but proposes to extend it in a manner which for cynical impudence and cold-blooded robbery exceeds anything which even the United kingdom Alliance has ever imagined, We refer to the proposals made in respect of what is called 'disinterested management. We have for our own part no sort of faith in this disinterested management. The advocacy of it proceeds on the assumption that a public-house will be better managed by a man who has no interest in the prosperity of the business than by a man whose living depends upon it. We do not believe it; and although the experiences of Public House Trust Associations may be alleged in support of the claim that disinterested management is the best, we must confess that so far as we have been able to verify them they seem to us to point to the opposite conclusion."</quote>
And towards the end there comes another sentence, the last I shall venture to quote to your Lordships, which says&#x2014;
<quote>"This is rank robbery and (subject to a four per cent. investment for a favoured few) confiscation."</quote>
Then we come to the points of compensation. I confess I do not even now quite understand the position of the noble Lord, whether he thinks that compensation should be paid or should not be paid. I suspect that amongst those who support the noble Lord there are some who think that it should be, and some who think that it should not be paid.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1042</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03010"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: That is perfectly clear, I think. Compensation should not be paid if the disinterested management resolution comes into force at the end of the period&#x2014;the time limit, whatever that period is. If it were to be brought into force during the time limit when you are taking away one licence and putting it into the hands of a disinterested management company, then I think compensation should be paid.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03011"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I am much obliged to the noble Lord, because I did not think from the terms of the Amendment that it was perfectly clear. The point I should venture to put to the noble Lord is this. I am not sure that that would he accepted by a large number of those who are interested in the question at the present time. We can all of us understand the position of those who say that if drink is a bad thing in itself and should be reduced as much as possible, compensation is unnecessary, but it drink is to be allowed and even encouraged in another form then it is not fair to those who hitherto have been engaged in the trade not to give them compensation when you merely substitute one form of administration for another.<lb/>
There are two further criticisms of the noble Lord's Amendment to which I should like to direct his attention. One is that&#x2014;although I do not suppose he meant it&#x2014;the form of the Amendment would, I think, sweep away hotels. The other is this. What would happen supposing there was no disinterested management company formed to carry on the scheme? The area would then become a no-licence area altogether, as I understand the noble Lord's Amendment, and there would be no liquor obtainable of any sort or kind, although the disinterested management resolution had been carried. The only way in which it would be rescued from being a no-licence area would be that a number of people interested in the drink trade would come forward in order to secure what profit they could. But that really brings one to the other criticism to which I have already referred&#x2014;that is, the insecurity of the finance, which I think is one of the chief criticisms to be made of the scheme of the noble Marquess opposite. He has already heard, in a way which I am afraid must be somewhat disconcerting to him, that it is
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0526"/>
<col>1043</col>
not welcome to those who are interested in disinterested management in this country, and the result of it will probably be very small indeed. It is doubtful whether under the Amendment as proposed by the noble Marquess we should have a very much larger or much more extended system of disinterested management than we have to-day. Indeed, I have seen criticism of the noble Marquess's Amendment go so far as to say that he even puts difficulties in the way of disinterested management, for this reason&#x2014;that whereas it is comparatively easy for a disinterested management company to get a licence now from a Court, because there is a natural sympathy in everybody's mind with the idea of disinterested management, the noble Marquess in future wishes the system of having a poll, and a successful poll, to be gone through before there is any large extension of this disinterested management scheme.<lb/>
There is, perhaps, one other point in the Amendment of the noble Marquess upon which I am not quite sure that I clearly understand his intentions. That is the point of how far it is to be compulsory. The noble Marquess, as I understand, is prepared to throw very great responsibility and power in this matter into the hands of the Court. He proposes that if a disinterested management resolution is carried the Court may, if it thinks fit, go so far as to grant a monopoly of disinterested management. I gather that that is so, although I am not quite sure; but it would also be possible for the Court to satisfy the requirement by granting disinterested management in one single case and no more. That seems to me to be directly opposite to the intention of the Bill. The Bill is to give power in this matter rather to the voters themselves, and to transfer to them the powers which are now exercised by the Licensing Court. The noble Marquess wishes, on the other hand, to go in the direction of giving the Licensing Court the power of saying that all or none, with the exception of a single licence in their area, shall be given to the people who are interested in disinterested management. That gives them very large and very great powers, and it also puts upon the Court a further and very great responsibility, because the noble Marquess asks the Court to say what they think is a reasonable compensation which should be paid.</membercontribution></p>

We shall have an opportunity later of discussing the question of compensation. I did not complicate my speech by going into that, because it would hardly have been in order. We shall have an opportunity later of discussing the whole question of insurance, and on that I shall have something to say, but I should be sorry that the noble Earl should think that I am of opinion that the disinterested company will, as a matter of absolute equity and justice, be able to provide all that is due for the relief of the dispossessed publican. They can only be asked to give as much as they can afford.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03013"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: But does not that lead us to the very difficult position in which we are in England to-day with regard to licensing, that the reduction of licences is limited by the amount of money which there is at the disposal of the Court for compensation? That is the position in which t he noble Marquess, as I understand, proposes to put the Licensing Court?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03014"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I can assure the noble Earl that is not so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03015"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: The Licensing Court, as I understand from the noble Marquess, is to say what amount of compensation can be paid by the disinterested management company, and of course the amount which can be paid depends upon the amount of money which the company have got. That is exactly the position which has crippled and hindered and prevented the reduction of licences in England. It is limited by exactly the same point&#x2014;that is, tire amount of the compensation fund.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03016"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I should not admit for a moment that the English Act has been hampered. It has worked extremely well. The noble Earl is quite wrong in thinking that anything I have proposed or suggested would be a parallel to the English Act. I wish it were. I think that the English Act is on a much sounder basis. What we propose is that the electors and the licensing authority between them should have complete freedom of action, but in so far as the disinterested management companies can afford to pay something let them pay it.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1045</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03017"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: What the noble 3arquess has said does not shake my conviction that he is closely approaching the position in England in which the amount of compensation is limited by the amount of money available for compensation. That has affected temperance reformers in this country because they have not been able to reduce as many licences as they would like to have done, owing to there not being enough money in the compensation fund, and that is the principle which it seems to me the noble Marquess does introduce by saying in his Amendment that the compensation which is to be paid, and which, of course, is quite separate from the point of compulsory insurance, must depend on the amount of money at the disposal and in the possession of the disinterested management company.<lb/>
Now let me refer to the question of how far, under the scheme of the noble Marquess, he is likely to secure that capital which is necessary for the successful working of the scheme. It was only this morning, curiously enough, that I received a letter from the liquidator of one of the noble Earl's Public-house Trust companies which had been started in Worcestershire, and which, unfortunately, had not succeeded. The consequence was a recourse to voluntary liquidation. That shows that disinterested management is not always or not necessarily successful, and if the Bill passes even with the Amendment suggested by the noble Marquess I want to point out how unlikely it is that people will come forward with money. They will have no such monopoly as that which those who are experts in disinterested management declare to be necessary. But supposing they raise a sum of &#x00A3;12,000&#x2014;of course, these figures are purely hypothetical but it makes the position easier&#x2014;and spend something like &#x00A3;10,000 in buying up licences and in paying compensation, while reserving &#x00A3;2,000 for working expenses and rent and so on. On that &#x00A3;12,000 they are entitled under both schemes to take 4 per cent&#x2014;&#x00A3;480 a year. They then have to raise a reserve fund if they can, which is ultimately not to exceed the amount of their capital. But quite apart from the schemes of the noble Earl, Lord Camper-down, which we shall discuss later, and which throw very heavy burdens indeed on them, surely the position of these companies is very unsound. It is quite possible that at the end of three years a no-licence resolution may be carried.
<col>1046</col>
During three years these disinterested management companies will have had to raise &#x00A3;480 a year, and also attempt to get something like a reserve fund equal to the amount of their capital. If they do not get that within the three years there is always the possibility of a no-licence resolution being carried, which would sweep away altogether the funds of the company and leave them with no more than their &#x00A3;2,000 or &#x00A3;3,000 which they had managed to accumulate as a reserve fund with which to meet their debentures or their share capital of &#x00A3;12,000. It is only when you come to the practical working of a scheme of this kind that your Lordships will see how difficult it is really to get a satisfactory measure. The point of the area to which the funds are to be devoted has already been touched upon by the noble Earl below the Gangway. I think all experts in disinterested management agree with the noble Earl that the system by which the drunkard is a public benefactor of a limited area, the local area, is thoroughly unsound. That is the scheme of the noble Marquess&#x2014;that the man who drinks most contributes most to the benefit of his immediate locality.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03018"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: That may be the best thing he has done in his life.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03019"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I agree it may be the best thing he has ever done, but it does not seem to me the best principle on which to go. I have purposely abstained from referring to the further burdens which will be put upon the disinterested management companies by Lord Camperdown's later Amendment, although it seemed to me to be of a very serious kind and to go far towards making the scheme of the noble Marquess opposite one which is unlikely to meet with success. I can only end by repeating that there is really little except the practical difficulty of a good scheme being formed which prevents His Majesty's Government from agreeing to an Amendment being put into the Bill dealing with this subject. Meanwhile we must confine ourselves to the point of hoping that the disinterested management companies may, under a voluntary system and without being brought into a State system, meet with more success in the future than has been the case in the past or is likely to be the case if either of the schemes suggested by the noble Lords opposite is put into this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1047</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03020"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The criticism of the noble Earl opposite has been directed rather against the Amendment of the noble Marquess on the Front Bench than against the Amendment of Lord Balfour of Burleigh. As I understood, at the commencement of his criticism he based his opposition to disinterested management chiefly on the ground of the difficulty about the monopolistic basis. On that point I think the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, who laid it down as almost a necessity that disinterested management should have a monopoly in any given district, was unduly pessimistic in this respect. Public-house Trusts have been carried on successfully, and I cannot see why it should not be possible under the terms of this Bill for disinterested management to be likewise successful. There are several Public-house Trust companies established in Scotland, with one of which I am connected. The noble Marquess was rather dubious as to the success that had attended their operations so far. I can say, in the case of every Trust, that they have either accumulated reserves or else given very fair sums to specific objects in their respective districts. Again, the object of the Trusts&#x2014;the promoting of the sale of food rather than that of liquor&#x2014;has been eminently successful, because whereas, to start with, they obtained very little revenue from the sale of food, the revenue from the sale of food now amounts to about 33 per cent. of their total sales. Lord Lytton criticised the suggestion of having a limited number of disinterested management houses. He said that it would prove a failure if you went on that system. But it is not only the Trust
<col>1048</col>
house itself that does a great deal for the promotion of temperance; it has such an influence on the other houses in the neighbourhood that they have to conform as much as they can to the system of management which has been adopted by the. Trust public-house. I mean they have to enlarge their premises and give facilities for eating so as to be able to compete with the Trust houses. Lord Lytton denied that there was any successful competition on the part of these Trust public-houses. I can only say that Scottish experience is distinctly the opposite. I agree with Lord Lytton in saying that any fund to be given to public purposes should be applied to national objects, and not for the benefit of the immediate locality in which the profits arise; otherwise it is likely that what has been found to be the case in Sweden would happen in this country, that people who were inclined to drink would think they were benefiting their immediate locality by the consumption of liquor. I therefore heartily support the Amendment of my noble friend Lord Balfour, on the distinct understanding that any surplus funds that are accumulated shall be given for national and not for local purposes.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03032">House again in Committee (according to Order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03033">[The EARL OF DONOUGHMORE in the Chair.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03034"><member>THE LORD CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: The Amendment before the House is the one moved by Lord Balfour of Burleigh, in subsection (2) of Clause 2, to leave out the words "a no-change resolution" and to insert "a disinterested management resolution." The Question is whether the words proposed to be left out shall stand part.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03035"><member>EARL GREY</member><membercontribution>: As has already been explained, the object of this Bill is to transfer the discretionary power now vested in the Licensing Courts to the people. That has a fine Liberal smack about it. But when it is realised that under this Bill the people will be prohibited from using their discretionary power in the way that they may desire, I think it will be obvious that this Bill does not show that trust in the people which one would have expected to find in a measure issuing from a so-called Liberal and Progressive Government. The speech of the noble Earl in charge of the Bill shows that he has a desire to prohibit, but has a strange reluctance to regulate. He wishes to veto, but is afraid to trust. Now unless we succeed in securing the adoption of an Amendment in this Bill which will give the people the power, when they so desire, to insist on the disinterested management of the licensed houses in their respective areas, I maintain that this Bill will be a bad Bill, a retrograde Bill, and a Bill really not worthy of the support of those who have at heart the well-being of the people. For I maintain that if this Bill is passed unamended it will stereotype the worst form of public-houses, it will check improvement, it will put a direct premium upon heavy drinking, and will be of no use where it is most required, and that is in crowded centres.<lb/>
I believe every one who has made himself conversant with the literature on the temperance question and who has addressed an impartial mind to the study of this subject must be convinced that efforts to prohibit the sale of drink in crowded communities have invariably led to the worst results. It has led to the nullification of law, and to widespread demoralisation and corruption. We can make a bad Bill into a good Bill by securing for the people freedom to apply disinterested manage-
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0530"/>
<col>1051</col>
ment to the houses in their respective districts. Disinterested management was strongly supported while the Bill was before the Scottish Grand Committee. It was thrown out by a small majority&#x2014;28 to 23&#x2014;and that minority of 23 included several influential supporters of His Majesty's Government. When the Bill came to the Report stage Mr. Sherwell, who has done more for temperance reform than almost any other person, refused to take any part in the debate or to move an Amendment in favour of disinterested management because he regarded it as perfectly hopeless to do so. He said that after what took place in the Committee he was left with the conviction that it was perfectly hopeless to attempt to argue the question on its merits or to get a pronouncement in the Division Lobby on the merits of the question; and owing to the great pressure exercised by the Government, through the Whips and particularly through the Scottish Whips, several Members voted against disinterested management who had assured him privately that on the merits they were in favour of it. He went on to state that he was simply refraining from moving any Amendment again because he was absolutely satisfied from the attitude and tone of the right hon. gentleman the Secretary for Scotland that, however overwhelming might be the arguments for the inclusion of this option, he would not consent to it, and under the ordinary Party pressure an over whelming majority would vote against the Amendment.<lb/>
While I have been absent from this country in Canada a Constitutional revolution has taken place which has deprived this House of the power of safeguarding the liberties of the people in the way that it used to do. But we still have some powers left, and I appeal to the House to-day that they should, so far as possible, safeguard the liberties of the people and secure for the people the power of insisting that the licensed houses in their districts should be brought under the principle of disinterested management when they wish them to be so brought. The noble Earl in charge of the Bill threw out a double challenge to me. In his hope that the supporters of the disinterested principle would disagree to such an extent as to make it possible for him to refuse our appeal, he assumed that I would bring a new element of difference into the discussion. I can assure the noble Earl that
<col>1052</col>
he is completely mistaken. It is true that I prefer Lord Balfour's Amendment to that standing in the name of Lord Salisbury, but I attach such great importance to the principle of disinterested management being inserted in this Bill that I regard the method by which it is done as a matter of comparative non-importance. I sincerely hope that before this Bill proceeds to the Report stage the supporters of the principle of disinterested management will have arrived by mutual concessions at a common agreement as to the way in which this principle should be inserted in the Bill.<lb/>
It is true that I prefer Lord Balfour's Amendment to Lord Salisbury's. Although 1 at first preferred the idea of having a ballot paper with four options, when it was explained to me by people who had given a great deal of attention to the subject from every point of view that four options would operate in favour of the trade, while three options, as the noble Earl remarked yesterday, might possibly work in favour of the principle of disinterested manage-merit, I have no hesitation in saying that, if that is correct, I certainly prefer the form of ballot paper which might be expected to work in favour of disinterested management. But that is a detail. Whether we have four options or three options I do not myself very much care. But there is a part of Lord Salisbury's Amendment which I sincerely hope he may consent to reconsider. While I listened most sympathetically as he dilated upon the possible inconvenience of handing over the whole of a new district at one time from the existing system to disinterested management, I yet do think that there are very strong objections against importing into this Bill, the principle of which is to trust the people, Amendments which will limit and perhaps nullify the use they may make of their discretion. To give the licensing authority the power to override the views of the people by insisting that the licensing authority should not be obliged to give a monopoly is, I think, a dangerous Amendment to move. I am most anxious that this Bill should be passed with this disinterested management principle in it, but if we were to send it down from this House saddled with fan Amendment that certainly violates the fundamental principle of the Bill. I should be very much alarmed lest the Bill should be lost altogether. So if we desire to make this Bill a good Bill by securing the assent
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0531"/>
<col>1053</col>
of this House to the inclusion of an Amendment which will give the people the power of insisting upon disinterested management, I think we ought to send that disinterested management Amendment down in a form that will be acceptable to the other House.<lb/>
We must also remember this. How are the licensing authorities elected? They are elected by the council, who are elected by the people. Although I speak with great deference as an Englishman on a Scottish matter, I dare say there are Scottish Lords in this House who know perfectly well that the elections for the councils which elect the bailies come very greatly under trade influence, and, if that is so, it is doubly undesirable that the licensing authority should have power to refuse to implement the declared will of the people. If Lord Salisbury will allow me to say so, I rather criticise his plan for the appropriation of the profits. I have been connected with this Trust movement from its earliest inception. I have visited places in Scotland where I have found that out of the profits of one monopoly public-house the village has been provided with a beautiful bowling-green, has been lit by electricity, and supplied with the services of a certificated village nurse&#x2014;all, as I say, out of the profits of the local public-house; and the apprehension is felt by many of our friends that if you allow the profits of such a public-house to be spent in the locality there is a tendency that people will go to the public-house and have one glass more "in order to get a cricket ground," and so on. The workers in this movement, those men who have given years of work to this question, are absolutely solid on this point. They are all agreed that it is desirable to appropriate any profits that may be made in houses under disinterested management to a national fund, and then they should be divided on some principle of equity between the various areas independently of the amount of drink they consume, so that a teetotal area would get its share. It is felt that if this fund were set up there would be no temptation to any one to go into a public-house and drink more than is good for him. There is one other word I should like to say on Lord Salisbury's Amendment. A doubt exists as to the, meaning of his compensation proposals. I certainly understood his speech to mean that compensation should be paid out of the profits of the houses under disinterested management.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1054</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03036"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Certainly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03037"><member>EARL GREY</member><membercontribution>: I am not quite sure that the wording of the noble Marquess's Amendment justifies that interpretation. But I understood from his speech that that was what he meant.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03038"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Out of the surplus profits.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03039"><member>EARL GREY</member><membercontribution>: If that could be adopted by the House it certainly would help to solve the question of compensation. The noble Earl in charge of the Bill has expressed great doubt whether schemes for disinterested management work successfully. He is troubled about finance, and he threw at my head his own county of Worcestershire, where he said a Trust company, to which no doubt he is a subscriber as he is to all good movements in his county, had gone into liquidation. But why had it gone into liquidation? It went into liquidation because it found that it was good business to amalgamate the two houses which it owned and which were both profitable houses in the People's Refreshment-house Association, which has over 120 public-houses under its management. The noble Earl, who ought to have been aware of that fact, rather misled the House with that reference. Any one who did not know what I know about the Worcestershire Public-house Trust Company would have thought that the Trust movement in Worcestershire had been a complete failure. I believe I am correct in saying that the Worcestershire Public-house Trust Company in its early career did make an unfortunate purchase of an unsuitable public-house. But, as I have said, it has gone into liquidation because it realised that, in accordance with the universal experience elsewhere, it is desirable that Trust houses should be managed by an administration which has a large number of houses to control.<lb/>
Ten years ago when I was instrumental in starting Public-house Trust Companies in most of the counties in England with the object of establishing a ring fence round existing houses so that all new licences hereafter created might be handed over to a Trust company for disinterested management, we naturally made mistakes. These different county companies found it difficult to secure houses, and they had only
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0532"/>
<col>1055</col>
two or three or four houses to administer. It was realised while I was in Canada that this form of administration was a very costly and ineffective one. Consequently the counties near London&#x2014;the counties of Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Middlesex, and Hertfordshire&#x2014;amalgamated their separate Trust companies into one united company, and the county companies which, when they were working singly, were a source of great anxiety bordering on failure became, when united, a powerful and successful organisation.<lb/>
The hope has been expressed that I will take advantage of the opportunity I have in addressing your Lordships to acquaint you with some instances of the success attending the principle of disinterested management applied to public-houses. I will, if you will allow me, point out that the Home Counties Public-house Trust Company, which has over thirty-five houses, finds no difficulty in earning the dividend it requires, although it has not the advantage of monopoly except in certain rural districts. It is earning over 9 and 10 per cent. I do not know a better gilt-edged security. It has to pay 5 per cent., but it earns surplus profits of more than double the amount required to enable it to pay this 5 per cent. dividend. How can I describe to your Lordships what is the effect of the management of these houses? I will take you to one house called the Horse and Waggon, on Ridge Hill, ten miles out of London. The noble Marquess passes it every time he goes to Hatfield. That is a monopoly house. Well, two old women in that neighbourhood who were habitual drunkards have been absolutely cured by that public-house, because they are not served. These two women, who were a source of great anxiety to their friends and a great trouble to themselves, have become respectable and self-supporting citizens simply because the Trust public-house absolutely refused to serve them with a drop of liquor.<lb/>
We have done the same thing with our Trust houses in Glasgow. In 1904 when the first three Trust houses were established there the number of refusals to serve drink was very large, and the citizens of Glasgow took pains to follow about forty cases of persons who had been refused drink at our three Trust public-houses. They followed them into other public-houses, where they got as much
<col>1056</col>
drink as they wanted. That is an illustration which shows how desirable it is to have that monopoly which obtains in the neighbourhood of Hatfield. The number of refusals now in the Trust houses in Glasgow is very small, because people have found that it is useless to go to a Trust house to obtain liquor when it is undesirable that they should be served with additional drink. Another instance. Our object in trying to reform the public-house is that we realise that the public-house is in many cases the only place where the working-man can go for rest, refreshment, and recreation, and to take away the only alternative he has to the wretched conditions of his home environments is, I say, an unkindness which I do not think any man who has at heart the well-being of the people would like to make himself responsible for. What we want is to Humanise, civilise, and improve the public-house. There are three of these houses within five miles of where your Lordships are sitting to which I should be delighted to take any of your Lordships, where we have substituted hot meals for alcoholic drinks.<lb/>
There was one public-house called the Lightship Inn, just opposite the Gas, Light and Coke Company's works in the East of London. I visited it last June. I found the dining-room crammed with working-men, all having a good hot meal, many of them having a glass of beer with it, and why should not they have it just as much as your Lordships enjoy wine with Your dinner. At the time this public-house was taken over by the Trust organisation it had nothing practically but an alcoholic trade, and the brewer who owned it paid a large fine to the landlord in order to get out of a bad bargain. It was handed over to the Trust organisation. They made a handsome profit. But how? Not out of alcohol, but out of hot meals. They served 90,000 odd hot meals during the year ended last June, and I asked the manager the other day how he was getting on and he said they were increasing the dining-room accommodation because the demand for food was so great. The demand had increased by about 50 per cent. over the 90,000 meals served in the year before my visit. There are other houses doing the same thing. Before we started this movement the alcoholic trade was from 80 to 85 per cent. of the sale in the thirty-five houses under the management of the Home Counties Public-house Trust Com-
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0533"/>
<col>1057</col>
pany. In 1912 the alcoholic trade was 52 per cent., and in the houses which had been under the control of this Trust organisation for two years the alcoholic trade has gone down to 30 per cent. and we hope to get it still lower. How is this done? If you go into one of these Trust houses you will not find any trade advertisements. You will find carefully selected pictures, and instead of the fumes of an ordinary public-house you will find the windows open and in the summer the place fragrant with the smell of flowers. This organisation has over 200 employees, not one of whom has ever been connected with the trade. Most of them are servants taken from the best establishments. I believe there is a very good cook at one of them who comes from Hatfield. The manager and his wife help to introduce a tone of respectability and refinement which has an indirect influence over the whole of the locality.<lb/>
It is our ambition to civilise and to enlighten and to beautify the life of the people through reformed public-houses, and I am sure we can do it. But this Bill is brought forward by people who think it wrong to beautify the life of the people if it is connected in any way with a glass of beer. This is a bad Bill because it is dead in the face of all experience and is based upon a distrust of the people, which I say I am more than surprised to find coming from a so-called Liberal Government. I might mention a ease in Scotland. There is a village inn near Loch Lomond where the travelling van men before the house was taken over by the Trust organisation used always to stay and soak for hours, to the great inconvenience of the people who were waiting for the goods they were carrying. Now it is the custom to serve hot meals there, and the van men, now that they have the option of consuming hot meals, do not hesitate to take advantage of that option, and some of the employers are so pleased with the difference it has made in the punctuality with which goods are delivered that they themselves pay for the hot meal for their van men.<lb/>
We are still in the experimental stage. That I admit. But we have learned a great deal during the last ten years, and we have learned this, that if we only have a sufficient number of houses to control we can improve the condition of public-houses and greatly increase the percentage
<col>1058</col>
of the sale of non-alcoholic as compared with that of alcoholic drink. I dare say I may be told that some of the Trust houses in Fifeshire have been instrumental in encouraging an undue sale of drink. That may be true. But these houses are all managed by their own little committees, who are responsible for all the duties connected with the house and are not under any wise system of organised control. To show how difficult temperance questions are I may mention t hat about nine years ago I visited one of these Trust houses in Fifeshire. It was run by a committee of miners, and I found to my surprise that they closed it at nine o'clock at night, ten o'clock being the compulsory closing hour, and, as your Lordships are no doubt aware the last hour before the closing hour is the most profitable one to a public-house. When I heard that this house was closed at nine o'clock instead of ten I expressed my surprise. I never shall forget the reply I received. The manager was a miner working-man, and he said, "My committee are all working-men, and they say that the public-house is no place for a man to be loitering in after nine o'clock at night if he is going to put in a good day's work on the morrow." I visited that house two years afterwards and asked how the early closing movement was going on. The manager said they had been obliged to get rid of it. I asked why. He replied that the women would not stand it because their husbands, hating being controlled by compulsory legislation, insisted on using their rights and chinking up to ten o'clock in the neighbouring public-house which was six miles off; so the wives said, "We have to sit up till late at night waiting for our husbands, and we beg and implore you to keep your house open till ten o'clock at night in order that we may get them home at a reasonable hour." That is another reason for monopoly. If you have a monopoly in an area you can have these beneficial regulations extending over the whole of the public-houses, and then you can have a nine o'clock closing hour, if it is thought desirable, and other reforms conducing to temperance can be instituted and carried out with success.<lb/>
The People's Refreshment-house Association has now over 120 public-houses under its control. It is the largest Trust company in existence. It has now under its control the noble Earl's two houses in Worcestershire; it has paid 5 per cent.

<col>1059</col>
for the last thirteen years with unfailing regularity, and this year it has earned over &#x00A3;4,157 surplus profits, whereas the dividend liability is only &#x00A3;1,357. I submit that the principle of disinterested management under right conditions&#x2014;and we are learning more and more every day as to how to apply them&#x2014;will bring a new contentment and a new happiness into the life of the people. I do not know anything sadder than to see these miserable boosingdens which are the only form of refreshment and recreation we give to so many men the conditions of whose life are much worse than we should like to see them, and I think it is our duty to do our utmost to supply them with something better than they have now got. We can do that through disinterested management. I would point out that in Scandinavia, where they have had disinterested management ever since 1868, the people would regard with horror the idea of going back to the system of private licensing. In 1868 there was, I think, one public-house there to every 1,200 of the people. Now under disinterested management there has been such a reduction in the number of houses that they have only got one house to 4,400 people, and I am confident that if your aim is to reduce the number of public-houses you could not adopt a better or surer method of obtaining your wishes than by enabling people to apply the principle of disinterested management to all the houses in their district, which would enable the approved society, with the approval of the Secretary for Scotland, to suppress a large percentage of these houses and make the others houses into which any lady in the land might go without losing her character.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03040"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I approach this difficult question as a convinced believer in the principle of disinterested management. It does, indeed, seem almost obvious to those who desire to promote the cause of temperance that at any rate one of the most effectual means of doing it must he to resort to a system under which licensed premises, if not all at any rate a large number of them, shall be under responsible management, in charge of persons who have no interest in pushing the sale of liquor, with a proper system of examination and auditing of accounts, and under a system which would enable the surplus profits to be made use of to the public advantage. I at any rate infinitely prefer a treatment of
<col>1060</col>
this subject which, instead of taking away the public-houses from those who frequent them and who have no other places of them and who have no other places of recreation to frequent, gives them in their stead houses decently conducted, where the surroundings are bright and attractive, and which any one can frequent without incurring the slightest suspicion of reproach. I will not labour that point further, because it has been fully dealt with in the excellent speech delivered by my noble friend Lord Lytton last night, and again in the interesting speech to which we have just listened from Lord Grey. I do not think I am wrong in suggesting that the noble Earl in charge of the Bill is himself, to some extent at all events, a believer in a principle of this kind, for he stated last night, if I remember right, that we were all of us ready to do homage&#x2014;I think that was the expression he used&#x2014;to the principle of disinterested management, and I assume that by that he meant something more than lip service to that principle.<lb/>
The logic of the case put forward by the friends of disinterested management seems to be quite irresistible. How can you defend a proposal under which, on the one hand, you put it in the power of the voters to withdraw entirely from the working-classes the right of going to licensed premises of any kind, and, on the other, you forbid the same voters to afford to the people of the locality the right of having licensed premises managed on the disinterested system? To say that the voters should be given the option of voting for the entire suppression of all public-houses and that they should be denied the alternative of placing all public-houses under a reasonable system of management seems to me, I confess, to be an utter absurdity.<lb/>
Your Lordships have before you at this moment two different proposals for dealing with this matter&#x2014;the proposal of my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh and the proposal of my noble friend Lord Salisbury. Those proposals differ at several points. There are differences in regard to the voting system; there are differences in regard to the treatment of the surplus profits. Those are, no doubt, important matters, but they do not seem to me, if I may say so, to be vital questions, and I feel little doubt that if we could come to terms upon
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0535"/>
<col>1061</col>
more essential points we should find it possible to adjust those less important issues.<lb/>
The real difference between the proposals of the two noble Lords is this, that whereas Lord Balfour of Burleigh desires to give within the area a complete monopoly to disinterested management, my noble friend Lord Salisbury proposes, on the contrary, to leave a discretion to the licensing authority in so far as existing licences are concerned. The other important difference between them is that whereas Lord Balfour does not contemplate the payment of any compensation, Lord Salisbury desires that a payment of that kind should be made. I confess that as between the two proposals that of my noble friend Lord Salisbury appears to me the most promising and attractive. I like it better, for one reason, because it is a less drastic proposal than that of Lord Balfour, and I believe that we shall stand a better chance of obtaining the recognition of the principle which we all desire to support if it is put before the public in a form which has as little as possible the appearance of severity or intolerance.<lb/>
I will just notice, in passing, one or two of the arguments that were made use of against my noble friend's proposal. I think the noble Earl in charge of the Bill suggested that in the event of my noble friend's proposals being accepted nobody would be found ready to invest capital in a disinterested management house because he might at any moment after the statutory interval find that a non-licence resolution was carried in the area, whereupon his capital would disappear. I do not mean to say that there is nothing in that objection, but I think it would apply very much more supposing Lord Balfour's proposal were to be accepted than it would apply if my noble friend Lord Salisbury's proposal were accepted. Because if you suppose a disinterested management resolution after the whole of the houses in the area have been turned into disinterested management houses, it is quite clear that then the passing of a no-licence resolution would involve something like absolute ruin to the association by which the disinterested management houses had been supported. The risk would be a much slighter one if only a certain number of houses were put under the disinterested management system instead of the whole of them. Then the noble Earl, I think,
<col>1062</col>
said that there was nothing to prevent the Licensing Courts, now, under the existing law, from giving licences on the basis of disinterested management. That may be technically correct. But surely there would be all the difference in the world between a system under which disinterested management would be allowed under the protection and with the encouragement of an Act of Parliament and one under which the thing was merely done in a wholly unofficial and irregular manner. Then Lord Lytton observed last night that unless a monopoly of disinterested management were to be given in the area a disinterested management house could scarcely be expected to hold its own in competition with ordinary public-houses by which it might be surrounded. But, my Lords, we listened to-night to a very interesting statement by Lord Grey which I think established clearly that houses of this description have not only held their own but have held their own triumphantly in the face of the very competition which the noble Earl so much apprehends.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03041"><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: I did not mean to convey the impression that they could not hold their own in competition, but that they could not adequately carry out the principle of disinterested management, and the instances quoted by Lord Grey to-day are in support of that. The regulations they would want to carry out would be valueless if there were other houses in the neighbourhood in which those regulations were not in force.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03042"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid I did not comprehend the noble Earl's meaning. So far as I have been able to follow this debate, the proposal of my noble friend behind me (Lord Salisbury) seems to me the most promising, and I do not think the case which he made in favour of it has really been shaken by anything that has been said. But I confess that unless that proposal receives a reasonable amount of support from those whom I may describe as the supporters of disinterested management in this House, I do not think it would be worth my noble friend's while to press it. To my mind it would be scarcely wise on our part to endeavour to impose on the House a scheme which was on the one hand strenuously resisted by His Majesty's Government, and on the other hand viewed with dislike and suspicion by the advocates of disinterested

<col>1063</col>
management. I must say, however, that my mind was very much relieved by what I understood my noble friend Lord Grey to say on this subject. I understood him to tell the House that although he certainly preferred Lord Balfour's proposal, for reasons which he gave, he was so anxious to obtain the recognition of I he principle of disinterested management in this Bill that he was prepared, if my noble friend went to a Division, to give him his support. If that is the case I certainly venture to express the hope that my noble friend will press his proposal upon the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03043"><member>EARL GREY</member><membercontribution>: What I intended to convey was that I attached so much importance to the principle that I am comparatively indifferent to the detail, the method by which it could be applied. But I hoped that it might be possible to effect something in the nature of a compromise between the two Amendments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03044"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: That was quite what I gathered from my noble friend. As to Lord Balfour's proposal, I say frankly although I would not vote against him, I could not, if he were to divide the House, support him in a proposal to insist upon his much more drastic scheme. My hope is that your Lordships will insert in the Bill the Amendment of my noble friend behind me (Lord Salisbury); and with reference to what was said by my noble friend Lord Grey a moment ago, I feel sure that should he or his friends wish us to consider modifications in Lord Salisbury's proposal, the noble Marquess will be ready to discuss any suggestions of the kind with an open mind. That, then, is the advice which we on this Bench would venture to give to your Lordships&#x2014;that we should accept the Amendment of Lord Salisbury upon the understanding that in points of detail it may well be reconsidered at a future stage of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03045"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: It is not without hesitation that one intervenes in a discussion on a Scottish Bill, and I do so to ask one or two questions with an absolutely genuine desire for information. As I followed the course of this debate last night it struck me that we were anxious to do the best we could in the cause of temperance and to make this as good a working Bill as it could be made. First, I should like to associate myself with the noble Marquess
<col>1064</col>
opposite, Lord Salisbury, in his criticism of the voting paper proposed by Lord Balfour of Burleigh, and I hope that at some later stage the noble Lord, if his scheme is persisted in, will explain his voting paper. I confess that. I find it very difficult to understand it myself, and I am in entire sympathy with the noble Marquess opposite in feeling that if I were asked to give a vote on that voting paper I should be in some difficulty. Under the Bill, if you vote for a no-licence resolution and that is not carried the vote counts for a reduction of licences. That is logical. Lord Balfour has sought to get rid of the no-change option and to give a "Yes" or "No" vote instead. As Lord Beauchamp has pointed out, the votes of a minority might carry a proposal under that scheme. Another point has occurred to me&#x2014;namely, that a vote "No" is very much less effective than a vote "Yes." An elector might think that his vote counted equally whether he voted "Yes" or "No," but the Noes under that scheme are quite ineffective except for the purpose of giving a quota, and an affirmative has more value than a negative vote.<lb/>
On the question of disinterested management we seem to be agreed that the principle so lucidly explained by Lord Grey is one which we should all most heartily endorse. I do not know on what authority Lord Grey said that this Bill proceeded from those who were enemies of the public-house altogether and wished to see all public-houses closed. So far as that statement has any foundation I personally might he said to be standing here in a white sheet, because that did rather incline to be my view at one time; but I have come to the conclusion that it is not our own province to deny individual liberty to that extent to our fellow citizens, and that we ought to allow them to have reasonable opportunities for obtaining drink if they desire it. We must also remember that the public-house is the club and the recreation ground of most of those who use it. Therefore it is impossible not to be in sympathy with any movement which does not simply slam the door in their faces but which seeks to make the public-house a decent place of recreation to which these men can take their wives, and a place where, above all, they shall not be cursed with incessant pressure to drink more than they want "for the good of the house." It is those
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0537"/>
<col>1065</col>
considerations which make me feel that sympathise entirely with the principle of disinterested management.<lb/>
As between the two Amendments I sympathise more with Lord Balfour's for the reasons which Lord Lytton gave us yesterday, which I think are reasons that have considerable substance&#x2014;that it is very difficult to work a Trust public-house, a disinterested management public-house, successfully and on the principles which yon want to apply to it when it is in immediate competition with an unrestricted rival next door. For that reason it is difficult to apply this principle to a few public-houses in an area. On that I should like to ask whether there exists, or whether it is certain that there will exist in Scotland at the proper time, a company sufficiently stable and with sufficient capital to take over the management of these public-houses in a district and carry on the business. I do not think anybody would tell us that such a company is in existence now or even in immediate contemplation. It is true that some time elapses before the Act comes into operation, but I should like to know whether even in five years it is certain that there would be in existence in Scotland a company which would be prepared to take this burden, and to take with it the risk of a no-licence resolution being adopted at some future time. The other question which I confess would influence my vote is this. Is this disinterested management resolution to be associated with a scheme of compensation, or is it not? I have not heard that very much dwelt on. But the scheme of the noble Marquess does involve compensation. Why there should be compensation when there is disinterested management and no compensation when there is a complete closing I do not quite know, but I think that is how it would stand if his scheme were adopted. That does not appear to me to have any financial basis, although I think yesterday the noble Marquess hinted at some sentimental basis for it. But I do not think Lord Balfour's scheme involves any compensation, and therefore it agrees with the framework of the Bill.<lb/>
Those are questions of great importance, and unless one call be satisfied that disinterested management is likely to be carried into effect it is not much use giving people an option to vote on something which is afterwards to be ineffective. I suggest that you might put into the Bill
<col>1066</col>
a provision for disinterested management, and, having arranged the whole of the machinery and how the thing is to work, limit it by making the adoption of that scheme and the possibility of its being selected as a fourth option dependent upon an Order in Council, or whatever corresponds in Scotland to an Order in Council, by the Government of the day, which they would only make if they were satisfied that there existed some company to take over and carry on disinterested management. If that were done it would remove one of the objections to voting on something which is rather in the air, and it would be possible to give power to apply that experiment partially and in districts; and as, after all, it is rather an experiment in this country it might be wise to limit its application in the first instance to certain districts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03046"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: I ask leave to interpose for a moment or two, because this is a matter to which I have given attention for a great many years. A good deal has been made evident in the discussion of this Bill as to the opinion of your Lordships, of those at least who have given expression to their opinion, in favour of some form of disinterested management finding a place in the new scheme, but I do not think adequate weight has been laid upon the amount of opinion which has found expression in authoritative quarters in Scotland and which His Majesty's Government will be resisting if they decline to give way at all on this point. I hold in my hand a memorial which was presented to the Secretary for Scotland signed by some fifty men who, it would hardly be wrong to say, are the leading men of thought and action in matters social and ecclesiastical in Scotland&#x2014;employers of labour, doctors, professors, working men, and persons of all kinds of experience&#x2014;who beg that the principle of disinterested management may find its place in this Bill. It does seem to me that a Bill which professes to give effect to the wishes of the people of Scotland and which disregards a memorial of that kind on the part of those who have a right to be regarded as the leaders of that opinion is a strange contradiction of terms; and the strength of Scottish opinion on the subject has, perhaps, not been adequately weighed in every quarter.<lb/>
The principle of disinterested management has been advocated by experts in
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0538"/>
<col>1067</col>
such admirable speeches&#x2014;I refer specially to that of Lord Lytton last night and to that of Lord Grey to-night&#x2014;that I do not need to dwell for a moment on the advantages which, as I think, all are prepared to find in some principle of disinterested management. But I should like to say this. I have always thought that the key to successful temperance reform is that there should be afforded opportunities for experiments of different kinds in different places. This is one of those things which can be best tested by experimental use under different kinds of population. It seems to me that the adoption of either of the proposals before us to-night would atleast offer some opportunity for these experiments being tried in the right sort of way, without endeavouring first to bring them into operation over any wide extent of country unless there were shown to be a desire for it, which I imagine will not be shown at first. It will take time. The success of the principle has been shown abundantly, as Lord Lytton stated last night, in Sweden and Norway. It has also been shown in some of our dependencies and in other places abroad, and it has been proved in England and Scotland under conditions very much less favourable than the conditions under which it would be tried if the Amendment is accepted. The fact that the principle has met with success in the face of difficulties gives us abundant ground for believing that that success would be far greater if the conditions were rendered easier, as they would be by the Amendment before us. I think I am right in saying that in Scotland 50, and in England 270 or 280, such experiments have been made, and very few of them have been really unsuccessful, except where some definite reason can be shown for it, either in respect to personal questions which have arisen, or in respect to the isolated circumstances of a particular house and the difficulties of its position in view of the rivalry of houses around it, or because of other local and temporary and passing reasons. But, I say again, I think a far greater measure of success could be looked for if the principle were adopted under conditions such as this Amendment would give us.<lb/>
When we come to the difference between the two Amendments and to decide which to give one's support to, I confess I must throw such weight as I possess in favour of the Amendment of my noble friend Lord
<col>1068</col>
Balfour. I perfectly see what is to be said plausibly and on the surface as regards the "less drastic" Amendment, as the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition characterised it, standing in the name of Lord Salisbury. My opinion is that it would be so little drastic that it would in some places fail to come into operation at all. We are reminded that we need not be afraid of that, though the magistrates might decline on their own initiative, even when a vote had been expressed, to transfer some existing house to the disinterested management to which they would have the power to transfer it. We have been told that we need not be afraid, because all the new licences must be, even under Lord Salisbury's Amendment, given to disinterested management. I would ask how many new licences are being given in England or Scotland in the licensing areas to-day. Hardly any; and I feel sure that if you intend to wait for these new licences you will literally have to wait till the Greek Kalends before you will find any opportunity of exercising this principle in many areas throughout the land. For, as it seems to me, we should have to wait for the magistrates to take the somewhat unpopular step of abolishing the licence, so to speak, of a particular licensee, and transferring his house to disinterested management, and to wait for the opportunity, which may never occur, of new licences being asked for when the opportunity arose. Therefore I think we ought to be on our guard lest by following the tempting line of saying we will be less drastic at first we should fail to make the real step which counts. Between the two Amendments I cast my vote for that of Lord Balfour, but I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Grey, in saying that, whatever happens, let us get this principle inserted in the Bill, so that Parliament may be said to have given its sanction to the principle of disinterested management. That that can be refused in the face of the kind of appeal that has been made from those in touch with the working classes in Scotland seems to me almost incredible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03047"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: The last three speeches which have been delivered have brought back the debate to the real point at issue&#x2014;namely, whether it is or is not a reasonable thing that a particular option in favour of disinterested manage-
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0539"/>
<col>1069</col>
ment should be inserted in this Bill, and not whether that form of management is or is not a desirable thing. Although I am sure we all listened with great interest to the speech of my noble friend on the Cross Benches (Earl Grey), he and the other speakers, with a pardonable desire to state the case as fully as possible, did not confine themselves to the question of the insertion of an option in this Bill but dealt with the merits of disinterested management as a whole. Attention has been drawn to the difference of opinion that exists between those who are in favour of some amendment in the Bill&#x2014;a difference of opinion which, as the most rev. Primate has pointed out, is somewhat deep seated. Certainly I can assure the House that I do not allude to it at all by way of taunt. This is not in any sense a Party question, and the fact that the noble Lords who take different views both sit on the Opposition side of the House does not cause me in any way to rejoice that a difference of opinion should exist. But the fact that so marked a difference of opinion does exist is relevant when one comes to consider the insertion in this Bill of a clause dealing with either one scheme or the other.<lb/>
It is, perhaps, somewhat interesting to remark that this is a Scottish Bill, that the subject which we are discussing is that of disinterested management, and that the noble Lord who in this House has the most right to speak on behalf of serious opinion in Scotland has a scheme and that that scheme is also favoured by the two noble Lords who have the best right in this House to speak on the subject of disinterested management&#x2014;I mean, of course, Lord Lytton and Lord Grey. That of itself might appear to point to the conclusion that if either scheme were to be adopted Lord Balfour's has the strongest backing behind it. Perhaps I might observe in passing&#x2014;because I am obliged to say, as I shall explain in a moment, on behalf of His Majesty's Government that we do not think it is appropriate to insert either of the Amendments in the Bill&#x2014;that in any case I should regard with some terror the form of ballot paper proposed by my noble friend Lord Balfour. It appears to me in its dealing with figures to have many of the qualities of a nightmare about it, as was pointed out by my noble friend in charge of the Bill, and perhaps, when the consultations and con-
<col>1070</col>
siderations which I understand will take place before another stage of the Bill between those who represent the two camps on the subject have taken place, some simpler form of ballot paper may be evolved even if the main lines of the noble Lord are followed.<lb/>
The system of disinterested management has received complete approval from every speaker in the course of this debate, but from the Government point of view I dare say my noble friend would say, <i>laudatur et alget,</i> for although we express approval of the system so far as we are concerned we are not prepared to advance it in the Bill. I hope when I have explained our reasons that he, at any rate, will comprehend why we take this course, even though we are in favour of the system in general terms. I said that the system had received general approval; but there are one or two points in connection with it which have not appeared in the course of the debate and which, I think, are worthy of the notice of the House. My noble friend on the Cross Benches looks forward to a day when the system of disinterested management shall have become so popular that it shall be in practice the only system under which public-houses are carried on, and he hopes, I take it, that that day will not be very remote. One cannot help asking, in view of your Lordships' attitude in previous debates on the subject of licensing, what is the view of the House as to the destiny of all the licensed victuallers in England supposing the consummation which the noble Earl desires is brought about soon. As my noble friend behind me pointed out, although compensation has been spoken of in connection with the institution of a system of disinterested management, compensation has not, so far as I am aware, been suggested in the case of a no-licence resolution.<lb/>
Then, as the noble Earl on the Cross Benches observed, a marked difference of opinion has been expressed in relation to the proper destination of such profits as may be earned. The arguments both ways, I take it, appear to be these. It is argued, on the one hand, that if a small area is allowed to enjoy all the profits that may be earned from such houses there will certainly be said to be, and may he in fact, a temptation on the part of those who use the public-houses to use them too freely in order to earn large sums of
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0540"/>
<col>1071</col>
money for local improvements. On the other hand, it is argued that if you place into a central fund to be allocated by superior persons at a distance all the profits from a very large area, then the inhabitants of small areas will so lose interest in the promotion of these disinterested management houses that they will not take the trouble to come forward as the noble Earl desires that they should, under either of the Amendments. The noble Marquess opposite also made a gallant attempt to dispose of the difficulty which my noble friend behind me has mentioned&#x2014;namely, the risk to which a company would be liable in the event of a no-licence resolution being passed, say, within ten years of the foundation of houses under disinterested management. I think it will be generally agreed that even if an average of 10 per cent., which is a considerable profit, could be earned during the ten years of the life of such a house there would not be nearly sufficient to form a sinking fund which would compensate the shareholders who put their money into the enterprise, and that is a difficulty which, although, as the noble Marquess pointed out, it would not be an invariable difficulty, yet is one which would have to be faced and which would tend to frighten the investor in these companies.<lb/>
I have no desire to trouble the House by dwelling on the question of compensation, because the whole matter of the compensation fund comes up on a later Amendment standing in the name of the noble Earl opposite. The propositions for compensation in this case are of a somewhat nebulous kind. I understand, however, that the proposition of the noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, is that it is only after paying the 4 per cent. limited dividend that a fund could be created which would make a certain provision. It could not, I think, from the nature of the case be a very large one, and certainly not if a sinking fund of the amount I mentioned a moment ago had been established. But, at any rate, something or other would be available for the purposes of compensation. I will not dwell upon that because the matter, as I say, has been left somewhat vague.<lb/>
Then we come to the difference of opinion between the two schools on the very important matter of the necessity or the reverse of an actual monopoly. That is a matter obviously of the first im-
<col>1072</col>
portance, although it has been somewhat slurred over and treated as a matter of detail by some speakers. But we are able to recognise that not only the noble Earl on the Cross Benches but also the noble Earl opposite, and, unless I am mistaken, also Mr. Sherwell (a great authority on these matters) speaking in the House of Commons, treated the existence of such a monopoly as an absolute necessity if the scheme is to be of large application and anything like a serious success. Now, my Lords, it appears to us that it is a difficult matter to ask the Government to insert a clause of this kind in a Government Bill simply&#x2014;I do not think it amounts to very much more&#x2014;to carry on a propaganda even though those who are in favour of the carrying on of that propaganda are not entirely agreed as to the necessary conditions under which it must be carried on or the proper methods which must of necessity be employed to advance it.<lb/>
The noble Earl most frankly stated that the whole thing must be regarded at present as being in an experimental stage. Therefore what we are asked to do is to give certain assistance of a moral kind in inducing people to embark in this particular experiment under some conditions which are not very clearly understood. I should have thought that from the point of view of those who are most interested in this propaganda it would have been safer to rely still for a time on the action of public opinion in this matter. As has been pointed out, in all cases except where a no-licence resolution is carried there is nothing whatever to prevent a licensing authority giving the most absolute fair play, though it cannot give a preference or a monopoly, to Trust public-houses; and if the public opinion of the area definitely desires that such experiments should be made, made you may be sure they will be by transfer or otherwise without the power of expressing the definite preference which noble Lords desire to insert in the Bill. Further, suppose in a given instance a disinterested management option is carried, as my noble friend pointed out possibly not by an absolute majority of those voting, and for some reason or another the money is not forthcoming or when the houses are established they do not entirely succeed, would not the fact of such a failure, which I think cannot be altogether left out of
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0541"/>
<col>1073</col>
sight, re-act far more severely on the cause of disinterested management if the whole proceedings were carried on under the &#x0153;gis of an Act of Parliament than if the experiment were being still tried as it is now being tried, and as I am glad to believe ably and successfully tried, under private management? For these reasons, my Lords, it does not seem to us wise further to complicate the Bill and possibly somewhat confuse the public mind by inserting an option of this kind.<lb/>
After all, the options as they stand in our Bill do not indicate any form of guidance or preference either way. No sort of pressure is supposed to be put on the voters of an area, either to say "Stop as your are," "Reduce the licences," or "Have no licences at all." But if on the invitation of those who are specially and worthily keen on this particular form of improvement this extra option for a particular system is inserted in the Bill, I think it must be taken, and I am quite sure my noble friend on the Cross Benches hopes that it will be taken, as a strong indication on the part of the Government to push forward this particular system. In the circumstances, though not without a certain regret owing to the excellence of the object aimed at, His Majesty's Government are obliged to adhere to the view that the insertion of an option of this kind would not in reality prove to lie an improvement of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03048"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I think the House will probably expect that I, as the mover of the Amendment actually under discussion, should say a word or two on at any rate some of the points which have been made during the interesting debate which has taken place. The first thing I have to say is this, that those who are in favour of the abstract principle of disinterested management and of putting it absolutely into practice have, I think, no reason to be dissatisfied with the whole tenor of the discussion which has taken place. Hardly a Peer who has spoken has not said something in favour of the advantages which are offered by this system of the disinterested management of public-houses.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1074</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03049"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Every single Peer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03050"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: Yes; I think without exception every Peer has gone that length. Even the two noble Lords who have spoken for the Government have gone almost out of their way to be civil to the principle and to do homage to it. I can supply them with a better reason, if they will allow me to do so, than they gave why it should not be put into the Bill. The fact of the matter is, the real supporter of this Bill is the prohibitionist. There is nothing the prohibitionist dislikes so much as the improvement of a public-house. From his point of view he is perfectly consistent. He wants to stop us from having anything at all, and some of them go so far as to say that it is a deadly sin to touch the particular article in question. Well, my Lords, that is not the view of the majority of my fellow-countrymen, and my opinion, knowing something about Scotsmen, is this, that if they want what they call a dram they will have it somehow or other, and I think it is better that they should have it in healthy, pleasant, reasonable surroundings than that they should be driven into secret places to get it, where in all probability they will take too much, and where it will be accompanied by other abuses which are extremely difficult to remedy. That, broadly stated, is the reason why I want to see the option of disinterested management put into this Bill, and I think it is very largely the reason why noble Lords opposite dealt with it in such a tender way and found reasons merely in the differences of opinion about particular systems of machinery of voting and a number of other things to show why this option should not be inserted.<lb/>
My particular proposal has, I think, been prejudiced by the fact that, to put it in a form in which those who advised me most desired, I had to propose drastic changes in the method of voting in the Bill. I still think that my proposals are simpler and better than putting a fourth option into the Schedule as it stands. If we were actually discussing the method of voting I think I could explain satisfactorily to the noble Lords who take an interest in it that the system I propose is at least as simple and much more likely to be effective than the one proposed in the Bill. But I hope I am a reasonably sensible person, and I
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0542"/>
<col>1075</col>
know that when I have the Government against me and not much support from noble Lords on the Front Bench on this side of the House it is not practical to go on with the proposal. I therefore say frankly that, as far as this particular scheme of voting and this particular Amendment which is under discussion are concerned, I shall ask leave to withdraw the proposal and not put the House to the trouble of a Division.<lb/>
But before I sit down I want to say a word or two as to the course which I propose to take in future. Let it be assumed that all drastic changes in the schedule of voting are out of the question, I still venture to think that a proposal on the lines such as I have put in a subsequent Amendment is better than the proposal of the noble Marquess. My main objections to the proposal of the noble Marquess are these. In effect it takes away the real decision from the people and puts it into the hands of the Licensing Bench. It seems to hold out a hope of the local application of the profits made, whatever they may be, which I believe to be a most pernicious and dangerous principle. It also, in my humble opinion, goes further in recognising a vested interest in existing licences than I think is reasonable so far as Scottish conditions are concerned. I do not elaborate this point at this stage, but these are some of the reasons why I find myself unable to support the proposal of the noble Marquess as it stands.<lb/>
There are two other points of difficulty and of difference which were alluded to by the noble Marquess the Leader of the House&#x2014;that of compensation, and that of monopoly. So far as monopoly is concerned I confess I do not think that the system of disinterested management can ever be tried under really fair conditions, conditions fair to itself, unless it has a practical monopoly of the class of trade which it is expected to do. I do not say that there should be no hotel or no restaurant, but if you mean the retail sale of wine and spirits and beer over the counter of a public-house, then I say unless you are going to give the unselfish management, a practical monopoly in a particular area you are not going to give it a fair chance of success. I do not say that even under those disadvantages it might, not succeed, but the difficulties will be so
<col>1076</col>
magnified that I do not think it will ever have a fair chance of proving what it can do until you give it at least that amount of monopoly.<lb/>
So far as compensation is concerned, I think no one has attempted to answer the dilemma put by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and I do not think that there is an answer to it. As the Bill stands there is no vote for a period of years unless at the same time the total prohibition may be brought in. I frankly say, in answer to the noble Earl's question, that if there is to be total prohibition in an area and disinterested management is only introduced into that area as a substitute for it after a period of years, then I do not think that the case for compensation at the expense of the disinterested management promoters is very great. But if the Bill is to be changed so that there is to be a different time limit for total prohibition and for reduction of licences, then I think if you put a disinterested management house into the place of an existing house the claim for compensation becomes a great deal stronger. I do not go further than that at the present moment, because I know how much those with whom we have to reckon dislike the idea of any compensation to the holder of a licence. I do not share that view. I want everybody to be treated with perfect fairness so far as we can get to it.<lb/>
With the consent of the House I propose at this stage to withdraw the particular Amendment under discussion, and, of course, all the consequential Amendments which hang upon it, and to take a few days to consider whether in the circumstances and in the light of the discussion that we have had it is possible to frame another Amendment for a subsequent stage which will put the clear issue between this side of the House and those responsible for the Bill as to whether or not we shall insert a disinterested management option. That will clear the question of all difficulties of side voting and so on, and we shall be able to get a clear issue and see whether what is the obvious intention of the House&#x2014;to have this experiment tried&#x2014;can be given effect to. In those circumstances I have to ask the leave of the House to withdraw the particular Amendment that stands in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0543"/>
<col>1077</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03051"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: I have heard with extreme regret the noble Lord express his desire to withdraw his Amendment, and I hope we are to understand from his concluding words that although he withdraws it now lie only does so with the intention of reviewing the arguments which have been raised against it at this stage with the possibility of inserting it at a later stage in the Bill. I regret that the principle of his Amendment as distinguished from that of the Amendment of the noble Marquess opposite should have disappeared. I look upon this as rather a practical question. The noble Marquess who leads the House made a most interesting speech, the gist of which was that the Government could not see their way to introduce this principle into the Bill as it stands. I have myself come to the conclusion that it is impossible to introduce Lord Salisbury's suggestion into the Bill as it stands and as I think it will be ultimately brought to your Lordships' attention. The fact must not be lost sight of that the principle of this Bill is the substitution of a popular vote for the existing machinery to regulate the number of public-houses. Democratisation of authority is the principle of this Bill, and that democratisation cannot properly be maintained consistently with the Amendment of the noble Marquess opposite.<lb/>
The noble Marquess who leads the Opposition, in the speech which he delivered on the Bill going into Committee, laughed at the suggestion that this measure should be described as a Bill for the promotion of temperance and described it as being only a Bill for changing the authority for the control of public-houses. But, my Lords, this question of the authority for the control of public-houses is really the essence of the situation. This question has been before Scotland and before the House of Commons for many years, and the principle of local option is the thing that will be insisted upon. Anything inconsistent with that principle if it is introduced will be fatal to the future of this Bill, and those who do not like the Bill may possibly push the modified suggestion of the noble Marquess opposite with a view to wrecking the Bill altogether. But I conceive that the Government themselves cannot introduce anything which will not leave the question of local option untouched. They must leave the final
<col>1078</col>
authority to the democracy in any particular area which has to vote upon the question. The plan proposed by the noble Lord opposite pays absolute respect to that authority. It is that authority which he proposes to invoke, and it is only a complementary proposition to the principle of the Bill itself, which says that the democracy shall vote upon the question whether it will have no-licence at all or otherwise, to say that the democracy shall also vote as to whether it will substitute the principle of disinterested management. You cannot work that unless the democracy is the authority that is able to declare in the whole area in which the vote is valid that one principle or the other is to prevail.<lb/>
In pressing this you may argue, "With respect to your proposal for local option we do not interfere with it, and you must remember that local option may decide against you as much as for you and your expectation of its operating in favour of no-licences may not; be fulfilled for many years, if at all." What the noble Lord has suggested fits in with the Bill as it stands, but to substitute for the Bill as it stands a method for simply permitting in each of the areas this introduction of disinterested management which the existing local authority is in some measure to square with the existing houses is to wreck the proposal before it is attempted to be put into operation, and is so inconsistent with the principle of the Bill as promoted in Scotland and urged on the House of Commons that I venture to think His Majesty's Government could not possibly assent to the Bill being allowed to become law with that substitution in it. If it is forced upon them in the form which Lord Balfour proposes&#x2014;I do not dwell on the details&#x2014;the principle of democratic authority within the area voting to determine whether or not there shall be the transformation of the principle of exclusive interested management to that of disinterested management, it might be successfully introduced into the Bill, and if you really wish to accomplish the introduction of this system at all I venture to think it is in that way only that the Bill can be successfully carried out. I therefore regret that my noble friend opposite has decided not to take the opinion of the House upon his Amendment at this stage. I hope he will take an opportunity of consulting the House again about it, and I
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0544"/>
<col>1079</col>
think in the interval between now and then it will be seen that the apparatus proposed to be introduced by the noble Marquess opposite is inconsistent with the scheme of the Bill as promoted by the Government and supported in the other House, whereas the scheme of the noble Lord opposite is perfectly consistent with that view and could not be refused except by those prohibitionists to whom the noble Lord referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03052"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord is entirely under a misapprehension. I am not withdrawing the scheme permanently. It happens that the point which first arises in the Bill turns on a question of voting. I said that I would withdraw the idea of substituting a completely new schedule because it was hopeless to carry that suggestion. That is all I have at the moment withdrawn, and I think that that is an obviously reasonable course.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03053">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03054"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: It now becomes a question as regards my own Amendment. I have listened with the greatest attention to every word which has been uttered in this debate, and the speech which has just been delivered by Lord Courtney was a refreshing speech because he was able to speak of the position of the Government with much greater clearness than His Majesty's Government themselves have been able to do. I wish I could be quite sure that he spoke for the Government. I looked at the noble Marquess on the Front Bench to see whether he assented to what Lord Courtney was saying, but the noble Marquess maintained that attitude of impenetrable gloom which characterised his speech. I wondered as he hovered from one side to the other, finding first of all faults with Lord Balfour's Amendment and then faults with mine, whether at the end we should be able to gather anything clearly as to what the real frame of mind of the Government was. Let me say this if I may with respect to the noble Marquess. Do not let him carry away the idea that he can refuse this disinterested management principle because of differences of opinion amongst us sitting on this side of the House, because if the Government will indicate in one phrase
<col>1080</col>
in which direction they would be able to support an Amendment of this kind he will find that our differences would disappear immediately. We care too much for the principle of disinterested management to defeat a good opportunity of introducing it merely because we do not agree as to the details. Therefore if this Amendment fails the responsibility will rest upon the Government and upon the Government alone. I want to make that absolutely clear so far as I am personally concerned and so far as those who sit upon this Bench around me are concerned. I cannot hope that I shall be able to illumine any further the position of His Majesty's Government to-night, but perhaps on a future occasion they may be able to speak with a little more of the clearness of Lord Courtney.<lb/>
Now comes the question what attitude I propose to adopt with regard to my Amendment. I propose, with your Lordships' consent, to move it and to put this Amendment into the Bill, but I hope very much that between this and the next stage if any noble friend of mine or any noble Lord sitting in any part of the House thinks the Amendment can be improved in any direction he will let us know and we will gladly consider it. People have spoken of the principle of the Bill. My Amendment involves several principles. The question of compensation I carefully did not discuss at great length because, as the noble Marquess who leads the House has reminded us, that has got to be dealt with in a much more complete manner upon the Amendment which stands in the name of my noble friend Lord Camperdown. But I do value intensely the principle of compensation. I believe that nothing would be more resented, and properly resented, among those interested in the licensed trade in Scotland than that they should be supplanted by somebody else who should make a profit out of the business from which they are ousted and no compensation given to them. The objection which I also feel to monopoly is not an objection of principle but a practical objection. If it could be shown that the monopoly plan would work practically better than my plan I should be quite willing, as far as I am concerned, to listen to any representation which might be made to me on that subject; but upon the other I confess I should, if I may say so, be inclined to be much stiffer. In that
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0545"/>
<col>1081</col>
spirit I think I may venture to ask your Lordships to insert my Amendment in the Bill as it stands. Of course I quite expect that my noble friend Lord Balfour and others will have changes to propose in it when we come to the next stage of the Bill. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03056"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: It is not necessary to detain your Lordships at any great length, but it is only right that we should reply to the invitation addressed to us by the noble Marquess opposite, although he probably anticipates the answer we have to give. It is not the first time that appeals of this sort have been addressed to His Majesty's Government. His Majesty's Government have introduced a Bill dealing with a particular subject, and a principle which we consider inconsistent with the principles in the Bill is moved by noble Lords opposite and they then call on His 'Majesty's Government to assume the responsibility of correcting anything which is wrong in the schemes put forward. The noble Marquess to-night invited His Majesty's Government to say on which side we incline, whether we are in favour of the noble Marquess's scheme or of that of the noble Lord. On behalf of His Majesty's Government we refuse to undertake the responsibility which the noble Marquess invites us to undertake this evening. We believe that the scheme of the noble Marquess which is now before the House and upon which we are going to vote is a bad scheme. We have heard even from those who are themselves interested in disinterested management that it is an inadequate scheme. Therefore we have no hesitation in asking your Lordships to vote against the noble Marquess's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03057"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I wish to point out to the noble Earl in charge of the Bill and to the House that the particular Amendment now before the House has nothing to do with the merits of the scheme. This Amendment is only to put an additional option into the schedule of the Bill, and as it is quite clear from what has passed that my proposed substitution of a different schedule cannot be carried the only way in which we can get
<col>1082</col>
a disinterested management scheme into the Bill is by a fourth option. All that this particular Amendment now under discussion proposes to do is to put in a fourth option. So far as that is concerned I frankly say I shall give it under the circumstances my most cordial support. When it comes to the details of the noble Marquess's scheme, which I shall not discuss now, I shall venture to make an earnest appeal to him not to put it in the Bill at this stage but leave us to work out the scheme when we know a little more what is to be the idea of compensation, the time limit, and so on. It would be fruitless to discuss that now, because the only point at this moment before the House is whether or not there shall be a fourth option in the schedule of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03058"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I might explain that we entirely appreciate the position of the noble Lord who has just spoken, and we quite understand that it is the general principle of the insertion of an option of sonic kind for disinterested management of some sort upon which your Lordships are going to be asked to vote. We have explained that in our view it is not serviceable to insert such an Amendment in the Bill, and therefore we are obliged to go into the opposite Lobby to that of the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03059"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The two speeches that we have just listened to make it absolutely clear to the House that His Majesty's Government have made up their minds to a frank repudiation of the principle of disinterested management. That is established beyond all question. And they do so upon the most singular and untenable ground that the proposal of my noble friend is inconsistent with the principle of the Bill. We have been told again and again that. the sole object of the Bill is to transfer discretion from the licensing authorities to the voter, and to my mind it would be consistent and not inconsistent with the principle of the Bill that the voter should be given that fourth option which we desire to give him.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03062">Amendment <i>agreed to</i> accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03063"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: In the absence of my noble friend Lord Clinton I beg to move the Amendment that stands in his name. This Amendment seeks to increase the number of votes which have to be recorded in favour, in order to carry it, of a no-licence resolution from three-fifths to two-thirds. It is certain that under the Bill in the present form there are a great number of licence-holders who would in fact lose their licences and their right of property subject only to a time notice. A great deal has been said in the course of the discussion by various noble Lords in regard to this right of property, but I think everybody agrees that an asset has grown up which has been recognised by the State in the past and which ought to be recognised by the State in any future action that may be taken. A great many people have invested their capital in a trade which has been recognised by the State and which has grown up under the authority and supervision of the law, and I think it would
<col>1084</col>
be not only unreasonable but would be treating these people with gross injustice if the power to carry out this deprivation of their property were to be placed in the hands of a very small minority of the people. According to this Bill three-fifths of the electors may carry a no-licence resolution. If you take into consideration that the municipal electors in Scotland on an average only represent about 17 per cent. of the population you arrive at the startling fact that this Bill proposes to enable about 5 per cent. of the population to dictate to the remainder whatever course of action they think fit. It has been said that this Bill is to place power in the hands of the people. I take it that what is meant by that is to place power in the hands of the majority of the people. I therefore have no hesitation in moving the Amendment which stands in the name of my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03065"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships would hardly expect His Majesty's Government to accept this Amendment, which really goes further, I think, than the noble Earl who has moved it realises. First of all two-thirds of the votes recorded have to be in favour, and not less than 60 per cent. of the electors have also to vote in favour at the same time before the resolution can be carried. If 60 per cent. of the electors go to the poll, which is the same as the three-fifths mentioned in the first part of the clause, 60 per cent. of the votes cast must be for the no-licence resolution in order to carry it, and a single vote given out of all those would be sufficient to defeat the resolution itself. This is a very complicated matter. We have received petitions, among others, from such an important body as the Church of Scotland against any alteration in this direction. The figures proposed by His Majesty's Government are those which are in force in other countries. Let me point out an answer to the point which was made by the noble Earl that 6 per cent. of the population would be able to carry a no-licence resolution. What that means, of course, is that to take 30 per cent. of the voters means 6 per cent. of the population. That is the calculation which, I think, is generally allowed. That would be true if not a single vote be cast on the other side. But it is equally true to say that 4 per cent. of the population would be able to stop the no-licence resolution from being carried, and I ask the noble Earl whether he seriously considers that in the event of a poll being held it would be impossible to find 4 per cent. of the population who would vote against the resolution&#x2014;4 per cent. of the population meaning 20 per cent. in votes. Of course it is only true of the very smallest poll which is conceivable, and it is really not a thing which is likely to occur. Let me give the noble Earl the exact voting which would take place on an electorate of 5,000. The present proposal of His Majesty's Government is that 30 per cent. must vote in favour of the resolution. That means that out of the 5,000 not less than 1,500 must vote in favour, and no single vote be recorded against the no-licence resolution. If 40 per cent. vote then there must be 2,000 votes in favour, and not more than 500 against, and then the resolution can be carried. If 50 per cent. vote, 2,500 in favour and 833 against is sufficient to stop the resolution from being carried. It is unnecessary really to trouble your Lordships
<col>1086</col>
with the series of figures, but we venture to hope, having regard to the double safeguard in the Bill, which we consider perfectly ample, that your Lordships will not vote in favour of the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03066"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I rather hope that my noble friend will take the sense of the House upon his Amendment. I cannot follow the argument of the noble Earl in charge of the Bill, who suggests that it is utterly unreasonable. We are dealing with the question of the no-licence resolution. That is a resolution which introduces a revolutionary change which may be absolutely ruinous to the owners of licensed premises within the area. My noble friend has worked the figures out, and I did not understand the noble Earl to dispute their accuracy. Upon a low poll and we know that in these cases the poll is very often a low one, for the voters are not always very energetic in coming to the poll, a 5 per cent. majority is sufficient to give effect to this great change. Then the noble Earl mentioned the case of the practice in foreign countries. He will correct me if I am wrong, but I am under the impression that if he will look to the practice in our own colonies he will find that as a general rule a larger percentage is required. As at present advised I am under the impression that the Amendment is a reasonable one, and I gladly support it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03067"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl in charge of the Bill, for obvious purposes, took a very large figure. He talked about a constituency of 5,000. He can hardly be aware that there are very few constituencies affected by this Bill which will approach anything like 5,000. You are proposing to divide any burgh of 10,000 population into wards for special voting. I propose to give an instance of my own burgh. There are four wards in Alloa, one of which has in its area about half the total number of public-houses in the burgh, and that ward has only 527 voters. Now 30 per cent. of 527 is about 160. Is it reasonable that 160 voters should be able to shut up the public-houses in one ward and destroy the whole conditions which exist at the present time without any control on the part of the voters in the other wards? In a population of 12,000, 160 voters can make this drastic change. That does not seem to me reasonable, and if the noble Lord behind me goes to a Division I shall feel bound
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0548"/>
<col>1087</col>
to support him, having regard to the smallness of the areas affected. Of course, if we come to a different decision hereafter as to the size of the areas there may be something to be said for the noble Earl's (Lord Beauchamp's) argument, but it is ludicrous to take as an instance an area of 5,000 when at least nine-tenths of the areas in this Bill, as far as I can read it and understand it, will consist of less than 1,000 population.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03070"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: We now come to the number of electors on the register who will be required to vote in favour in order to carry a no-licence resolution. I think the noble Earl in charge of the Bill brought forward as an argument that in our Colonies they had a more extreme measure than this Bill proposes, but I think if the noble Earl will go into the proportion of electors he will find, generally speaking, that in the Colonies they provide greater safeguards than His Majesty's Government are pro</membercontribution></p>

I do think, therefore, where a change is involved which is going to operate so harshly on people engaged in this trade, that the power to enforce it ought to be placed with a clear majority of the people.</p>

Let your Lordships notice for one moment what would be the effect of it. It would not be unusual, I think, in a case like this, that 50 per cent. of the voters would come to the poll. The result of the noble Earl's Amendment would be that unless every single one of these people voted in favour of the no-licence resolution it would not be carried&#x2014;that is to say, that if 50 per cent. of the people come and vote in favour of it then it may be carried, but if any people are to be found who vote for either of the other options then it cannot be carried. This is really so stringent and goes to such extreme lengths that I feel certain that on consideration, even if your Lordships carry it to-night, you will think that it goes even beyond what is fair in the way of giving protection to licence-holders. But after the Division we have just had we shall not ask your Lordships to go to the trouble of dividing on this.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Lord said: I move this Amendment because this is a Bill promoted by prohibitionists, and as they are such a very small body in the country I do not see why, if a no-licence resolution is not carried, the votes recorded in favour of such resolution should be added to those recorded in favour of the limiting resolution. I have no doubt that the majority of the prohibitionists in this country approve of no-licence, and are averse to any other option, but I do not see why if a no-licence resolution is not carried the votes recorded should be added to those in favour of the limiting resolution.</p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03082"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: If I recollect rightly, we have already had special approval of this provision in the course of the discussion which has taken place, and even if that had not been the case I should have urged your Lordships to retain it in the Bill, because those of your Lordships who have studied the Bill will realise that we give something to both sides in connection with this matter. It seems to me a perfectly reasonable thing that those who give a vote in favour of prohibition should, if prohibition is not carried, he treated as giving a vote for reduction. I am not sure that it could not be almost spoken of as a transferable vote, and those noble Lords who are in favour of a system of that kind will certainly, I think, be found to be in support of this particular provision. But what I may call the set-oil to this provision is to be found in Clause 4 (2) (<i>b</i>) where the people who vote for the repeal of a limiting resolution are allowed to have their votes recorded in favour of a continuance resolution; so that this Bill, while it gives an advantage to those who are anxious for restriction, does in a similar case later on give an advantage to those who would wish to have their votes recorded in favour of a continuance resolution. His Majesty's Government have, in their own opinion at any rate, gone some way in preventing the unfair treatment of licence-holders, and a number of provisions have been inserted with that object&#x2014;the provision, for instance, which says that a poll may only be taken once in three years. I do not think it fair that we should be expected to go as far as the noble Lord wishes us to go. We have done what we think is right, and in these circumstances I hope your Lordships will not agree to the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03083"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I hope the noble Lord will insist upon his Amendment. Just let us read the clause and see the absurdity of it: "An elector shall not be entitled to vote for more than one of the resolutions submitted at the poll." Surely before he goes to the poll he ought to have made up his mind what he is going to vote for, and then when he has voted you are to construe another way in which he is supposed to be going to vote assuming that he is not in a majority in vote No. 1. Lord Beauchamp attempts to justify that by saying that two pages down he commits a similar absurdity but it is on the other side. I do not think that in either of these
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0550"/>
<col>1091</col>
cases the second vote should be allowed. It is all very well to say that a man is only to vote once, but you provide that in both these cases he is to vote twice. That seems to me an absolute absurdity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03084"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: The position is not quite so absurd as Lord Camperdown imagines. We have had in principle, although not in terms, exactly the same thing on the Division we took on the disinterested management resolution. Lord Balfour voted for Lord Salisbury's Amendment putting in the words "disinterested management" although he was not in favour of the scheme. By the Bill some may vote for A and others may vote for A <i>plus</i> B, and you are desiring by this Amendment to take away altogether the effectiveness of those who wish to vote for A <i>plus</i> B. I think it is only right that you should enable the elector to say, "I will vote for A, but if A is not carried I may have the option of transferring my vote to B."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03085"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: May I point out to the noble Earl that Lord Balfour of Burleigh in his Amendment gave one vote and one vote only. What is proposed is that a man having voted for one thing shall then be held, if that vote is not successful, to have voted for another. As a matter of fact, there are people who will vote for a no-licence resolution who would not vote for a limiting resolution, because they take the extreme line of saying if you do not have a no-licence resolution a limiting resolution is of no good at all. Therefore in such cases you would be placing a construction on their first vote which even they themselves would not place upon it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03086"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I listened to Lord Russell with the respect which his observations always deserve. He was, of course, severely logical, as he always is. If we intend to give the electors a transferable vote we ought to say so, and put 1 and 2 so that the elector may know what he is about. But the noble Earl thinks that he can draw a useful analogy from the very complicated and intricate proceedings of Parliament and apply that to the electorate. In my experience very often people who have been in Parliament a long time do not even then quite understand the rules of procedure under which they act, and the idea that the
<col>1092</col>
elector is going to fathom these intricacies is mere moonshine. He must be told exactly what he is about. The noble Earl wants the result of the vote of the elector to be kept an absolute secret from him. That is not defensible on any ground whatsoever. What would be thought in our electoral system, to take the case of more than a single Member constituency, if it were to be assumed that when a man voted for one Liberal candidate and the result was unsuccessful the vote might then be transferred to the other Liberal candidate? Every one, I am sure, would admit that that was a very bad electoral system, and one upon which we could not depend. It seems to me that we must give the elector a clear choice of what he is to be asked to do, and if he votes for "no licence" let his vote be counted as a vote for "no licence," and if he votes for a limiting resolution let his vote be counted as a vote for a limiting resolution and nothing else. Let us have that understood, and let it be made clear to the elector so that he may understand what he is voting for.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03087"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: It seems to me quite clear that as the House has determined to introduce disinterested management in this Bill we ought to give the elector a chance of voting 1, 2, or 3. I therefore hope that my noble friend will insist that the voting paper should be so marked, since we can no longer presume that one who votes for no licence would prefer restricted licences to disinterested management.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03088"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I think this illustrates some of the difficulties which may be expected to attach to the Referendum when it is introduced by noble Lords opposite. It is true that what we are doing by this plan is to introduce in a quite rough-and-ready form something equivalent either to the second ballot or to the transferable vote, and the reason we propose it is this. As a matter of practice it may easily happen that a very small minority of those who vote may be able to carry a no-change resolution against a large majority of the inhabitants of the district, some of whom are extreme people and would rather see licences swept away altogether. Others, more moderate people, would like to see them reduced in number. Yet the great majority of the population will not be able to give effect to their
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0551"/>
<col>1093</col>
wishes because a small minority of the entire number of those voting are in favour of no change. That seems in practice to be a most unfair and undesirable result, and it is that which we have endeavoured to meet in what I frankly admit is a rather rough-and-ready way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03089"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I agree with Lord Sheffield that as we have put in a fourth option there ought to be a power of transfer to one of the other two options, either the disinterested management or the limiting resolution, But I sympathise with the Government to this extent, that it is quite clear that a prohibitionist will always be in favour of reduction. But supposing there are a large number of prohibitionists, not a majority, would it not be equally fair to add the no-change voter to the reduction schedule as against the prohibitionist, because if a man votes "no change" he would obviously rather have reduction than prohibition. If you are going to change the vote in one respect why not be logical and take the transferable vote right through?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03090"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS of LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I think the observations which my noble friend has just made point to the only conclusion at which your Lordships can arrive. We are asked to accept the proposal in the Bill on the ground that it has some connection with the transferable vote. What is the transferable vote? When von give a man a transferable vote he says, "I vote for A, and it is my desire, if A is not elected, that my vote shall be counted for B." That is a business proposition. But in this case the voter does not make any intimation of the kind. He votes for A and for A alone; and with regard to what was said, I think by the noble Earl, I am told there are a great many prohibitionists who are indifferent about the question of reduction. At any rate, if we are to have a transferable vote let us have the courage of our opinions, and let us introduce it with our eyes open and on the lines suggested by my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03091"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: There is one small matter of fact on which I might, perhaps, direct the House. From the second schedule your Lordships will see that any voter who does go to the poll will be fully acquainted with the fact that his
<col>1094</col>
vote may, in the circumstances which we have been discussing, be taken from the no-licence resolution and put to the limiting resolution. The schedule makes it perfectly clear to the voter, and when noble Lords opposite say this vote will be taken away from the voter and given to a cause which he does not support without his knowledge they must have forgotten that it is very clearly and expressly put in the schedule.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03102"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: Before the noble Earl, Lord Camperdown, moves his Amendment in subsection (1) I wish to ask a question in regard to the proviso in the middle of the subsection. There is a provision that in a prohibitionist area a licence may be granted for a hotel or a restaurant. The leading case on this matter is well known. It is the case of the Central Hotel at the Caledonian railway station in Glasgow. Opposite that hotel there is a large restaurant of a very important kind, and a representation was made that if a hotel licence was to be given and the restaurant licence shut out it would be very unfair. There are to be hotel licences in a prohibitionist area according to the Bill, and then is put in "or to be used as a restaurant." It is put in in the singular, and the Bench may grant a licence for an inn or for premises structurally adapted for use and <i>bona fide</i> used or to be used as a restaurant. Does that mean only one licence which may either be an inn or a restaurant, so that there may be only one inn and one restaurant, or does it mean that we may have more? It is clearly absurd that there should be a monopoly to one restaurant in a district, and surely the Bill means that they should grant one or more certificates for a hotel or a restaurant. I should like to ask those in charge of the Bill whether they mean only one licence, or whether they mean to retain discretion in the licensing Bench.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03103"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: The meaning of the clause certainly is that they may grant as many certificates as are desirable, and not create a monopoly by limiting the grant to the case of one restaurant.

I read these words as governed by the word "any"&#x2014;"on being satisfied that under the special circumstances of the case <i>any</i> certificate is reasonably required." "Any" certificate may mean that ten certificates may be required, and wherever a certificate is required they may grant it for an inn and hotel or for premises "structurally adapted for use and <i>bona fide</i> used or to be used as a restaurant." I certainly think that is the sense of it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03106"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The first Amendment to Clause 3 is in my name. I propose to leave out the proviso at the end of subsection (1), which runs, "and provided further that it shall be a condition of the renewal of any such certificate that the applicant shall satisfy the Court that he is entitled to a reduction of duty in terms of section forty-five of the Finance (1909&#x2013;10) Act, 1910." This proviso has rather a curious history. It was introduced by the Government on Report, and is an attempt on their part to define what is a restaurant. Being interpreted this proviso means that any restaurant in which more than two-fifths of the receipts are for alcoholic liquors is to cease to be a restaurant. That will, I think, tell very hardly. In fact, Mr. McKinnon Wood, in moving the words in another place, said that the proviso would tell hardly. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"There may be cases on the margin. There always must be when von have an arrangement of this sort."</quote>
And then the Opposition said, "We are willing to accept the statement that Mr. McKinnon Wood has given the matter consideration, but we do not know that he has provided a complete solution of the difficulty. In the circumstances we shall take his proposal subject to the reservation that it must be reconsidered if necessary elsewhere, because we shall not have another opportunity of dealing with the matter again here." It has been considered since, and, as your Lordships will see, it will operate in this way. Where by any accident in the case of a restaurant, say a high class restaurant conducted perfectly
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0553"/>
<col>1097</col>
properly and rightly, the receipts for liquor exceed two-fifths of the total receipts they will absolutely lose their licence as a restaurant. As the clause stood before these words were added in this hasty manner the discretion was left to the Licensing Court. Observe the way in which the Licensing Court was to act "except that the Licensing Court may, on being satisfied that under the special circumstances" and so on, "grant a certificate for an inn and hotel or for premises structurally adapted for use and <i>bona fide</i> used or to be used as a restaurant." Is it likely that under those words the licensing authority would grant a certificate to any restaurant which was not really meant to be used as a restaurant? As I say, this proviso enacts that if by any accident more than two-fifths of his receipts are for alcohol the man is to lose the licence. I do not know what would happen to him if he lost his licence. He would not have a public-house licence. I think that without the proviso the clause is a perfectly legitimate and right clause, and sufficiently protects the public.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03108"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: It would probably be to the convenience of your Lordships if I gave the history of how these words came to be in the Bill. When the Bill left Committee the only certificate allowed in a no-licence district was a hotel certificate. In this case we are only dealing with a no-licence district, a district in which by an enormous majority a no-licence resolution has been carried. Therefore we must assume that there is an overwhelming feeling in regard to drink in that area. It was represented to the Government that it might have an effect upon a <i>bona fide</i> restaurant, and the question arose as to how "restaurant" could be defined in such a way as to make sure that any licence given to a restaurant should not be abused. It was felt that great care must be taken to hedge round a concession of this kind by real safeguards in order to prevent restaurants being used simply as drinking places, or as public-houses, because if such a thing could take place the effect of a no-licence resolution would be very small indeed. In order to guard against the danger this proviso was inserted at the end of subsection (1), and I propose to make it somewhat clearer by Amendments which
<col>1098</col>
are on the Paper in ray name. Supposing your Lordships agreed to the Amendment of the noble Earl, what would be the result? The clause would end at the word "meal." What is a meal? It has been suggested that the words "square meal" should be put in, but even that is a phrase that would hardly get one much further. Is a penny biscuit or a half-penny biscuit a meal? There would be great difficulty in saying what a meal really is if the noble Earl is content to end the subsection at the words "for consumption with such meal" and does not make a further provision of this kind. We really thought that the distinction made in the Finance Act of 1910, which was a distinction we had at our hand, was a suitable one. It makes some distinction in regard to the duties which are payable. It seemed to us to be not an unreasonable one to make, and we think this is the best definition available in the circumstances. Here we have a concession made on behalf of a <i>bona fide</i> restaurant, and we think that this particular proviso does secure that it shall be a <i>bona fide</i> restaurant and that the permission or licence which is given should not be abused.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03109"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Might I point out to the noble Earl that the Finance Act is for the purpose of taxation, but a restaurant is a matter of business, and to construe what is a restaurant from a Finance Act is surely a very extreme course to take. I agree with the noble Earl that we are, of course, only dealing with a no-licence area; but the Court is only to grant certificates for a hotel or for premises structurally adapted for use and <i>bona fide</i> used or to be used as a restaurant. Surely the licensing authority is the best judge of what is a <i>bona fide</i> restaurant, and if there was any complaint made with regard to the restaurant of course the Court would have it in their power to take away the licence the next year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03110"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: May I appeal to the noble Earl not to press this Amendment. I think the provision in the Bill a reasonable one, and one which is really in the interests of the licence-holder. Section 45 of the Finance Act, which is incorporated in the Bill, begins in this way&#x2014;
<quote>"Where in the case of any licensed premises which are structurally adapted to he used and <i>bona fide</i> used for the purpose of the reception of
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0554"/>
<col>1099</col>
guests and travellers desirous to sleep in the premises, or which are licensed premises structurally adapted for use and <i>bone fide</i> used as a restaurant, it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners that the receipts from the sale of intoxicating liquor were in the preceding year less in the case of a restaurant than two-fifths"</quote>
of the proceeds they are entitled to a reduction of duty. That seems to me just about as good a definition as you can get under the very difficult circumstances. If the noble Earl's Amendment <i>simpliciter</i> were to be adopted you would be giving in the no-licence area absolute freedom to the licensing authority to put in as many restaurants as they chose without the slightest check or without any materially important check upon the management of the restaurant, and where it was really only a place for the sale of drink over the counter with or without a trifling biscuit, or something of that sort thrown in. I am far from saying that the definition is a perfect one or that there will not be great difficulties in carrying it out, but I venture to suggest to the noble Earl that if he strikes out this proviso without substituting something for it he will, in effect, nullify a prohibitionist vote.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03111"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I differ from the noble Lord. Let me read the words, "The licensing Court, on being satisfied that under the special circumstances of the case any certificate is reasonably required." Therefore they would not give a certificate for a restaurant unless it was quite certain that the certificate was reasonably required. I must say I cannot agree with the noble Lord with regard to this financial definition at the end. It is admitted that there will be many hard instances, and therefore it seems to me it would be better that those words should be removed, particularly when you bear in mind that they were only placed into the Bill at a very late stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03112"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: It is true that the words were put in at a late stage. The reason was that some kind of definition was necessary, not merely as regards the structure of the premises, but as regards the way in which the business is being carried on. If a man having premises the structure of which is adapted to a restaurant business carries on his business to the satisfaction of the Commissioners and in such a way as to show that he has really used his premises as a restaurant and his profits are apportioned as Section 45
<col>1100</col>
of the Finance Act provides, then he is entitled to the renewal of his certificate. The purpose of this is to make sure, not only that the structure is of the character which is necessary, but that the applicant is carrying on his business in the mode which the structure would suggest.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03113"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Unfortunately the proviso goes further than that, because the Finance Act says that if more than two-fifths of the proceeds is derived from alcoholic liquor the certificate is to cease. With regard to the conduct of his business, as the Lord Chancellor very properly observes, the man would be entitled to a renewal of his certificate if he carried on that business reasonably; but, unfortunately, this provision as to the two-fifths stops him absolutely. Whenever more than two-fifths of the proceeds is derived from liquor <i>ipso facto</i> the restaurant ceases to be a restaurant. In that case, how could the proprietor get a renewal of his certificate? He could not, and that is the reason I object to the proviso.</membercontribution></p>

For instance, if there were ten licences in that area they would have to take away three of them. But the point is that it seems absurd to set up a Court with judicial discretion in the matter of licences and then go and set up a lot of cast-iron instructions which would have the effect of effectually taking away any latitude which that Court might have in the exercise of its discretion. I believe that a great deal of discretion will be required in putting a limiting resolution into effect in some of the small areas under this Bill. There is one important point which I would like your Lordships to notice&#x2014;that is, that the people have been given no power under this Bill to indicate as to what number of licences they would like to see reduced under a limiting resolution. Therefore there is all the more reason that that power should be given to the Licensing Court. If any Amendment is accepted the actual reduction of the
<col>1102</col>

Under the limiting resolution, if carried, 25 per cent. of the licences must be taken away by the Licensing Court. I do not think it is unfair to say that anybody who votes for that resolution is really voting for something which he understands and for a perfectly definite number by which he believes the licences ought to be reduced. The noble Earl does not seem to think that this gives a sufficient option. There we join issue with him. The Amendment of the noble Earl goes quite contrary to the tendency of the Bill. The Bill gives to the voters themselves the power of saving what shall be done. The noble Earl's Amendment gives that power to the Licensing Court. If a limiting resolution were carried the licensing justices, under this Amendment, would have fulfilled the law if they took away one single licence.

This clause is undoubtedly a restriction, not only upon the licensing authorities, but also upon the voters. The licensing authorities are compelled, supposing a resolution of this kind is carried, to reduce exactly 25 per cent. of the licences, and the voters are obliged, when they give their vote, to vote for that figure and for no other. That seems to me to be an unreasonable restriction of the discretion, not only of the licensing authority, but also of the voters. We have often heard in this House of the necessity of having regard to the superiority of the knowledge of these local authorities. Of course they have exceptional

knowledge.

Lord BALFOUR first sought to alter the subsection so that it would read, "(5) The decision of the licensing court in refusing certificates in pursuance of a no-licence resolution shall not be subject to appeal"; and then the noble Lord proposed to add the following new subsections&#x2014;
<quote>(6) The scheme adjusted by the licensing court in pursuance of a limiting resolution and the decisions by the licensing court following thereon, at the said April meeting, reducing the total number of certificates shall be subject to review by the licensing court of appeal. Provided that without prejudice to all other powers or discretions competent to such court appeal such court of appeal shall not increase or reduce the total number of certificates granted by the licensing court in pursuance of the said limiting resolution.</quote>
<quote>"(7) The clerk of the licensing court shall within three days after the April meeting of such court or any adjournment thereof, transmit a certified copy of the scheme as adjusted by the licensing court, in pursuance of a limiting resolution and of the decisions following thereon to the clerk of the court of appeal to be submitted to the court of appeal. The court of appeal shall meet not earlier than fourteen days nor later than one month after the date of the last meeting or adjourned meeting of such licensing court to consider the scheme and decisions thereon of the licensing court, and shall have power to confirm or vary the same. The date of meeting of the court of appeal shall be advertised in at least one local newspaper at least ten days prior to the meeting of such court, and all parties interested shall be entitled to appear and be heard."</quote>
The alternative Amendment standing in the name of Lord DUNMORE was to add, at the end of subsection (5), the words "but where any certificate has been withdrawn to give effect to a limiting resolution an appeal shall lie from such decision as in the case of the refusal of the renewal of a certificate under the provisions of the Licensing (Scotland) Act, 1903: Provided always that if the result of any appeal or appeals under this provision is to render the certificates in existence in the area in excess of the number allowed by the limiting resolution, the licensing court shall, before the next general half-yearly meeting of the licensing court, prepare a scheme for the reduction of the certificates to the aforesaid number, and shall notify the same in manner similar to that prescribed in respect of the original scheme and shall proceed to give effect thereto."</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03136"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: The Bill as it stands at present provides that there shall be no appeal from the Court of first instance either in the case of a limiting
<col>1106</col>
resolution or of a no-licence resolution being carried. Clearly there can he no appeal in the case of a no-licence resolution, because an appeal in that event would be an appeal from the voting people to the licensing Bench, but I do not think it stands quite in the same position in the case of a resolution to reduce. The choice from among those public-houses which are going to be struck off will be a very delicate duty, and I think that in that case, just as in the case of the granting of new licences or in the case of a refusal of a certificate, there ought to be an appeal. The Courts of appeal in this matter were set up for the first time under the Act of 1903, and upon the whole they have worked extremely well. In the case of very small areas, like burghs of 4,000 or 5,000, it is a matter of great difficulty for those actually living in the district and amongst people whose licences they have to take away to select the quarter in which the licences are to be reduced, and from my knowledge of the circumstances I think it would be a great advantage to everybody concerned and likely to lessen friction if there was some system of appeal to a larger body. The Amendments in my name and in the name of Lord Dunmore are the same in effect. They cannot both be carried, and so far as I am concerned it is a matter of practical indifference to me which of the two is put in. With that statement perhaps the noble Earl will say what is the position of the Government with regard to it.

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03138"><member>EARL. BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I am glad to respond to the invitation addressed to me by the noble Lord. Your Lordships will see that under the Bill the reduction is left to the Court most intimately acquainted with the locality&#x2014;that is to say, the Licensing Court which until now has had to deal with these questions. It might, of course, have been left to the Appeal Court to decide, but that is not the view that His Majesty's Government take. Our distinct and firm opinion is that in a matter of this kind a system which allows first one Court and then another to work its will on the same subject would be a tedious and expensive way of dealing with the matter. Supposing in the first Court
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0558"/>
<col>1107</col>
they decide that licences A, B, C, D, and E are to be withdrawn. If an appeal is granted they will all appeal. Then the Appeal Court may decide that A and B ought to be withdrawn, but not C, D, and E. In the case of a limiting resolution it is necessary under the law that a certain number of licences should be withdrawn, and therefore the Appeal Court, which has not the intimate local knowledge which the Licensing Court has, will have to say, Instead of withdrawing C, D, and E we would rather withdraw G, H, and I. The Appeal Court will either have to substitute other licences or else, since the reduction proposed must be equal in number to those sent up to them by the Licensing Court, the Appeal Court would have to refer the matter back again to the Licensing Court to suggest otherwise. The noble Lord proposes one method and the noble Earl proposes another, and there might be a very long system of seesaw. Under one of the proposed systems it is left to the Appeal Court to select licences for withdrawal in lieu of those which they decline to withdraw. The result might be that a very large number of licence-holders might claim to have a right to appear before the Court. We do not think, in view of the fact that there will be a distinct direction from the electorate, that there is any sufficient reason for conferring a power to reduce licences upon Courts which contain a considerable non-elected element. That is a separate point from the one of the practical inconvenience of having two Courts to settle the one subject. It is really a point of practical importance upon which His Majesty's Government lay stress. I would venture to ask the noble Lord whether he would consider as an alternative the question of giving the Appeal Court sole responsibility in this matter, because we think that that would very largely diminish the objections we feel to the suggestion made. If that commends itself to the noble Lord I would venture to suggest that he should bring up an Amendment to that effect on Report.</membercontribution></p>

I have taken an active part in the licensing committee of my county. There you have the authority which selects the licences that are to be got rid of. Then
<col>1108</col>
all those licences come before the licensing committee of the county, who finally decide which licences shall he got rid of and which shall not. I can assure the noble Earl it is of the greatest importance that there should be that kind of double hearing, or at any rate that the licensing authority of a small district should not be able to settle anything itself. It constantly happens in my own county, which I may call the noble Earl's county also, that the licensing committee, having heard a case in Court, sitting as a judicial tribunal, have found it necessary to reverse the decision of the primary committee; and judging from that analogy I would hope that some better tribunal might be obtained for Scotland than the mere licensing committee of the local area.</membercontribution></p>

In my Amendment I propose to follow the ordinary procedure of the law as it stands at present, which always admits of appeal in all cases of the refusal of a licence. Lord Balfour proposes to give the Court of appeal not only the right to re-hear a case and if necessary reverse the decision previously arrived at by the licensing authorities, but he goes further and proposes to give the Court of appeal the right to substitute some other victim for that which was originally selected by the Licensing Court. I should have thought on the score of administration it would have been better to have left the duties of the Appeal Court simply those of appeal&#x2014;that is, to re-hear a case and, if necessary, reverse the decision. That is why I would prefer to follow the present law as it stands in England, and if a decision is reversed by the Appeal Court then let it rest with the Licensing Court to, if they think fit, find another substitute for refusal of a licence. But the main

<col>1109</col>
point that I adhere to is that there certainly ought to be a re-hearing of each case where necessary. It is a very invidious duty which is thrown upon the Licensing Court, and I would be by no means satisfied with the suggestion thrown out by the noble Earl opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03142"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: The inconsistency between the Amendments arises in this way. The point which impresses the noble Earl behind me, whose Amendment is on the Paper and has received support from the noble Viscount, is the idea of a first hearing and of an appeal. The point which was uppermost in my mind was the invidious nature of the duty which in a small burgh would be cast upon those who had to choose between two or three people with all of whom they were probably personally acquainted. I wanted to remove it to the area of the licensing authority of the larger district&#x2014;what we call an Appeal Court, but which is also in some of its capacities a Court of first instance. It has this advantage, that t hose who sit upon it are drawn from a, wider area and would be more likely to take a dispassionate view of the case before them, unprejudiced by personal predilections. But rather than have nothing I frankly say I would accept the offer of the noble Earl if I was sure it would be adhered to in another place. If, however, I did not receive that assurance I should certainly support the Amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Dunmore.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03191"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I move to leave out subsection (1) of this clause and to insert the new subsection standing in my name. I should like to call your Lordships' attention in the first instance to the words which now stand in the Bill. Under the clause, when any elector demands from the clerk to the local authority a requisition paper it has to be given to him, and then the requisition is to be lodged during the month of September and the clerk is to insert in not less than two newspapers a notice of the receipt of such requisition, and after that he is to allow inspection of the requisition by any elector, but the requisition having been so lodged no signatures thereto may be withdrawn. The first objection I have to the subsection as it now stands is this, that any one elector or any number of separate electors may call upon the clerk to issue a paper, and the clerk is bound apparently to issue a paper to any and all of them. Armed with these papers any electors may then sally forth and walk up and clown the street canvassing to an unlimited extent. It seems to me that canvassing ought as far as possible to be prohibited or at all events to be made difficult in this case, because, as we know, on this liquor question the persons who hold extreme opinions are very much given to canvassing. Then these persons come back with the papers, on one of which, perhaps, there may be a few names; on another a good many; and on a third some more. Those papers are to be handed to the clerk, who has no means whatever of knowing by what solicitations the signatures were obtained, nor, indeed, does he even know whether they are genuine. He has no means himself of testing the genuineness of any of the
<col>1116</col>
papers. Then it is proposed to be enacted that at the end of September he is to allow the inspection of these requisition papers by any elector. He must keep a large number of these papers because he cannot copy them. An elector who wishes to inspect them can only ascertain whether the signatures are genuine or not by seeing the originals, and as the original signatures may be on a number of papers it is quite clear that this is an inconvenient mode of proceeding. So much for the subsection as it stands.<lb/>
I propose to substitute a subsection providing that on the demand of ten electors made on certain dates a requisition paper shall be prepared by the clerk to the local authority, who shall forthwith insert in the newspapers a notice that such paper is being publicly exhibited at his office, or at such fit and convenient place within the area to which the requisition applies as he shall in such notice specify, for signature and inspection, and that it will be removed on the 30th day of the month of September. Then it goes to the local authority, and if the local authority find that it has been signed by not less than one-tenth of the electors in the area the clerk to the local authority is thereupon to insert in not less than two newspapers circulating in the area a notice that such requisition has been duly made. These proposals of mine are, I think, reasonable and very moderate&#x2014;at least I intend them to be so. With regard to the requirement that the demand should be made by ten electors, I would point out that it is not usual to provide that machinery such as this should be set in motion at the instance of one elector. Ten is a moderate number, because if there is any chance of the requisition being ultimately signed by one-tenth of the electors it stands to reason that it must be quite easy to get ten electors who will sign the paper in the fist instance. There seems to me another advantage, which is this. There will be only one requisition paper, and all the names will appear on the one paper. It will be in the office and any one can inspect it or sign the paper while it is hanging up. I have provided that this paper is to be exhibited in the office or in some such convenient place as the clerk shall specify.<lb/>
The only objection it seems to me that there can be to my proposal is that under it an elector is made to walk to the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0563"/>
<col>1117</col>
convenient place and write down his name, and, of course, subsequently if a poll takes place he will also have to go to the poll to vote. I must say I think it is very much better that every one should be obliged to go to a place and write down his name, because there are a great many persons who, if a friend comes in with a paper and says "Will you sign this?" or, in the case of a shopkeeper, if some large customer comes in awl says "I wish you would sign this paper," would very likely sign it without taking any great interest in the matter. I think that a poll of this sort ought only to proceed on a requisition by persons who are really in, earnest about it. If any person really is in earnest&#x2014;and I believe those who hold strong opinions in this matter are almost all in earnest&#x2014;I do not think he will consider it a great hardship to be obliged to go and enter his name in an office instead of putting it on a paper brought round by somebody else. But if it be a hardship to these people to have to walk to this place to write down their names, think how much more trouble they are giving to all the persons who do not take any interest in the matter and whom they are going to put to the trouble of having a poll. Think what expense they are going to put the local authority to in holding this poll. For these reasons I think the subsection which I propose is better than the one now in the clause, and I hope that His Majesty's Government will give it favourable consideration.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03194"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: As your Lordships will have realised from the explanation which the noble Earl gave of his Amendment, there are really two questions involved in it. One is whether the local authority shall be given the power of supervision, and the other is the question of the requisition. I think from what happened on Monday night when we first went into Committee on this Bill the noble Earl realises that we are quite willing to give way to him in regard to the local authority. We provide in Clause 5 that the Secretary for Scotland shall make rules for regulating the procedure with regard to requisitions and the taking of polls, but we are quite willing to meet the noble Earl on that point. Therefore we are prepared to agree to that part of this Amendment which deals with the local authority having supervision. We cannot, however, meet him on the other point. I agree that when it comes to a poll it is not unfair to ask electors to go to the polling place and there give their vote. What the noble Earl wishes is that a similar procedure should be gone through with regard to the requisition. That is not the view of His. Hajesty's Government. We think that the requisition might be brought to the electors and that it is unnecessary to force the electors to go to the requisition. That really is the point of difference between the noble Earl and ourselves. When the requisition has been signed, if it is signed by the right number, there is every opportunity for the voters who object to any of the schemes set forward to vote against it. If the promoters of the requisition are misguided in thinking there is a desire for a limiting resolution, then at the polling place the electors of the area will have an opportunity of expressing their opinion. In those circumstances, considering what full opportunity there is for them and what a large majority is necessary, I do not think it is an unfair thing to give those who are anxious for a reduction of licences this small favour, that the requisition should be taken to them rather than that they should be obliged to go to the place mentioned by the noble Earl.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03196"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl referred to the question of canvassing, and this question was also referred to in another place. I have more respect for the electors of Scotland than to think that they would be willing, as the noble Earl imagines, to place their names to a requisition with which they did not agree. The noble Earl seems to think that the people of Scotland would willingly sign a requisition with which they did not agree. There I join issue with him. I think we may fairly trust the electors to put their names to the requisition if they think it desirable, but, if not, to refuse to do so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03197"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I did not say that they would sign a paper with which they did not agree. What I said was that they might sign a paper in which they took no particular interest.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03198"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: It is satisfactory to observe that with regard to this Amendment the noble Earl in charge of the Bill has been able to meet my noble friend at any rate half way, but I would ask him to consider whether in regard to the other half of my noble friend's proposal there is any cause for the refusal which he has just given. The machinery provided by this clause really does seem to be contrived in the interest of a small number of busybodies and extremists who might desire to press this question of total prohibition upon the electorate. Under the clause one single elector can go to the clerk to the local authority, and, as I understand the Bill, the clerk has no right to refuse him a paper. He is obliged on request to issue these papers. Thereupon the single elector or the single elector and a few of his friends may go the round of the area, they may have a sort of house-to-house visitation, a sort of visitation which might very easily fade into something like persecution; and in time end they obtain a collection of signatures which nobody is able to verify at the moment, a number of which may be bogus signatures, and armed with these papers thus signed they are able to set the whole of the machinery of the Bill in motion. That seems to me a very untenable proposal. Take the counter proposal of my noble friend. Is there any hardship in asking people who feel strongly on this matter to go to the clerk's office and sign the papers there in circumstances which render it perfectly clear that the signature is a genuine one?

I do not wish to add anything to what has been already said, but it is obvious what would happen. A person taking a paper through a village or town would very easily get signatures from people who would not think what they were signing. To oblige a friend they would put their names down, and the whole thing would be clone without any thought. It is much better that, as suggested in the Amendment, the signing of the requisition should be done in the town clerk's office. I therefore hope my noble friend will press his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Marquess opposite has stated that the procedure proposed in the Bill would give opportunities to a small number of busybodies to go round and either cajole or force the sufficient number of electors to join in a requisition for a poll. If that were so, those busybodies would entirely defeat their own object. The poll would take place, and <i>ex hypothesi</i> not sufficient interest would be taken by the voters to carry probably even a limiting resolution far less a no-licence resolution, and the only result of the busybodies' action would be that things would remain as they were until such period as a poll could be again taken&#x2014;from their point of view a long interval. On the other hand, it undoubtedly will be held by a great number of people that the object of this Amendment being inserted in the Pill is to put a spoke in the wheel of taking a local option resolution at all. The idea will undoubtedly be held by many friends of temperance in Scotland that the object of the Amendment is to hamper the working of the Act by obliging people at some personal inconvenience to go in some cases possibly a considerable distance in order to make this preliminary inquiry whether they may not be allowed to exercise their local option right. I feel convinced that that would be taken by many to be the object of the noble Earl's Amendment, and for that reason it is impossible for His Majesty's Government to consent to it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03206">Clause 5, as amended, agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03207"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I ask your Lordships to insert, after Clause 5, a new clause establishing a Scottish Licence Holders Central Insurance Board and also</membercontribution></p>
<col>1122</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03208">favour of this proposal. I do not think the noble Marquess could have produced an instance which could tell more against himself than the one he has just produced. I shall venture to ask your Lordships to divide.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03209">On Question, whether the words proposed to be left out shall stand part of the clause?</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03210">Their Lordships divided: Contents, 26; Not-Contents, 44.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03211">a mutual insurance association or associations. In explaining this clause it will be necessary for me to refer to Schedule III which stands in my name on the Order Paper, and if your Lordships will give me permission to do that you will be saved the trouble of a second speech from me. I wish, in the first place, to explain that this is a proposal for insurance and not one for compensation. Compensation, as we know, is frequent in the English Act, but the word "compensation" with reference to Scotland has been very much objected to, and I wish your Lordships to keep in mind that this is a clause absolutely for the purpose of insurance by the licence-holders for their own interests and in some degree to meet the loss which they may very probably incur under this Bill. This clause does not interfere in any way with the working of the Bill or the options
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0566"/>
<col>1123</col>
given under it. In fact, it really may be almost said to be next to outside the Bill. That is common ground. It was admitted by the Government in another place, and I have no doubt the noble Earl in charge of the Bill will also admit it here.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03212">This scheme, I may explain, is no proposal of mine. It is the joint product of the Scottish Licence Holders Mutual Insurance Association (the large mutual insurance association of the licensing trade and a voluntary association), and of the Scottish Licensing Trade Defence Association. I wish also to remind your Lordships that in this clause the Government are asked for no guarantee. Indeed, the Government are only once mentioned in the proposal, and that is when it is provided that the regulations made by tile central board are to be approved and confirmed by the Secretary for Scotland. The only thing that this clause does is to ask Parliament to place compulsion behind an insurance which is set up by the licence-holders themselves to meet the possible losses under the Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03213">I may go at once, I think, to my proposed Schedule III, which contains the proposal of the clause. If your Lordships will look at Clause 1 of the schedule you will see that it provides that before May 28 after the passing of the Bill every holder of a certificate shall become a member of a mutual insurance association, and one of the objects of the association is to be the insuring of every member of the association against loss arising from the withdrawal of his certificate by reason of a resolution under this Bill. Then follows the numbers of the association according as the association consists of "on" or "off" licensees or the two combined. Then Clause 2 of the schedule provides that the application to become insured shall contain a declaration of the value (hereinafter called the "declared value") of the certificate to be insured and such further particulars as the association may require. I wish to say a word to your Lordships presently about declared value. The next point is the amount of the premium which is to be payable to the association by each of its members. The schedule standing in my name provides that the premium payable to an association in respect of the insurance of a certificate shall be an annual premium payable in advance and not exceeding &#x00BD; per centum
<col>1124</col>
of the declared value as the central board established under this schedule may determine. I call attention to these words because you will see that after the central board are called upon it will be their duty to lay down the principles upon which this declared value is to be based.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03214">Clause 4 of the schedule establishes the central board, which is to consist of nine members, to be increased ultimately to a number not exceeding twenty-one. The first board is to hold office for not more than two years, and they are to be elected by certain trades and in a certain way. Then within three months of the passing of the Act the secretary of the Licensed Trade Defence Association shall receive nominations for membership and proceed to the election of a central board, and the way in which they are to be elected is set forth. Then we come to the duties of the central board. Clause 5 of the schedule provides that within twelve months of the passing of this Bill the central board are to make rules prescribing, among other things, (1) the principles on which the declared value of certificates is to be ascertained, and (2) the manner of subsequent election and the number of members of the board. That gives you the constitution of the central board and their duties. They are to make these rules, and every such rule is subject to the approval of the Secretary for Scotland. It is on this occasion, and on this occasion only, on which there is any mention of the Government in the scheme.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03215">Then what is to be the income of the central board? Your Lordships will find that in Clause 6 of the schedule. It is there provided that on or before June 30 in each year every association shall pay to the central board 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per centum. That is 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> out of the 10<i>s.</i> which is the &#x00BD; per cent. they are allowed to levy for that purpose, and all this 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> is to be paid by the association to the central board. Your Lordships will see, in subsection (2) of Clause 6 of the schedule, that the amounts received in respect of premiums paid by holders of certificates shall be carried by the central board to two separate accounts to be called respectively "The On-Licence Holders' Insurance Fund" and "The Off-Licence Holders' Insurance Fund." The central board will have the management of these funds and the investment thereof, and the whole of
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0567"/>
<col>1125</col>
the said funds are to be applied to the payment of claims as provided by the Bill; and it is further provided that these two funds are to be kept separate, no portion of the on-licence holders' fund is to be applied to claims under the off-licence holders' fund, and <i>vice versa.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03216">Next comes the question of claims, and that is to be found in Clause 7 of the schedule, which provides that the claims payable by the central board to an association shall in no case exceed the declared values of certificates insured with such association; and then in the following subsection it is provided that if the available funds of the central board are insufficient the claims of the members of each association against each fund shall be proportionately abated. In Clause 8 you will find that where in any year the respective amounts paid over by the central board are insufficient, to enable an association to pay in full the respective claims of its "off" and "on" members, the directors of an association shall impose upon the on-licence holders or off-licence holders, as the case may require, a levy not exceeding 1&#x00BD; per centum of the declared value in respect of which each member is insured; and if the proceeds of that levy are insufficient to pay in full the claims in respect of which it was made, the unpaid balance of the claims shall be carried forward for the two following years, and in each of those years, if necessary, the like levy shall be made. Then it is provided in Clause 8, subsection (3), that after the distribution in the third year all claims shall be deemed to have been discharged, so that a claim cannot run on for longer than three years. Those are the main features of the scheme, and that is all I think I need trouble your Lordships with on that subject at the present moment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03217">Your Lordships will see, first of all, that in this scheme compulsion is made universal, for a licence-holder must belong to an association. He must be liable in the first instance to a payment of &#x00BD; per cent., and he will be compulsorily liable. In order to justify compulsion I may mention to your Lordships that one of the two associations which is putting this scheme forward is a voluntary association which really conducts at the present time the whole voluntary insurance of the licensed trade in Scotland. When this scheme was first devised the Mutual was opposed
<col>1126</col>
to the scheme, but it has since come to see that it was impossible to work on any other than a compulsory system. The Mutual has therefore changed its mind and is now supporting this scheme, and is, in fact, the joint author of it, because it has been altered in several particulars to meet their wishes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03218">I now come to the question of declared value, about which said I would say a few words. In the first place, your Lordships must remember that this declared value&#x2014;to which it is not at all unlikely that some persons may take exception because they may think that it may give rise to future claims&#x2014;is only <i>ad hoc.</i> It is for the purpose of insurance, and is simply applied by the insured persons for their own benefit and for their own purposes only; it will have no force outside this insurance scheme, and also the principles upon which this declared value is to be fixed are to be settled by the central board subject to the approval of the Secretary for Scotland. It may reasonably be said that persons might be likely to put in a very high declared value for reasons of their own, but on the other hand your Lordships must remember that in the first instance they will have to pay on a high value their &#x00BD; per cent., and if subsequently further money is required they will be liable to a levy of a further 1&#x00BD; per cent. by their own association. I am not going to trouble your Lordships with any detailed figures with regard to this scheme because I cannot give any, and, besides, I know your Lordships are not fond of having estimates as to probable results. But for the sake of argument let us suppose that the declared value of all the licences in Scotland is &#x00A3;10,000,000. A &#x00BD; per cent. on that will be &#x00A3;50,000, and that sum will be increased by the number of years of time limit which is inserted in this Bill. The time limit, of course, will not apply to the 1&#x00BD; per cent. levy of the association. That is a matter entirely by itself. No doubt the noble Earl will tell me if I have omitted anything, but so far as I have been able to I think I have explained the scheme fairly fully to your Lordships.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03219">Now what is the Government attitude with regard to this question of compulsory insurance? I have been at a loss to discover it. Hitherto they have behaved very much with regard to this question of compulsory insurance as the noble Earl
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0568"/>
<col>1127</col>
in charge of the Bill did yesterday with regard to the case of disinterested management. They highly approve in words of compulsory insurance, but as soon as it comes to inserting it into the Bill they object to it altogether. Just let us see how the Lord Advocate treated this matter in the first instance. On the Second Reading of the Bill in the other House he said&#x2014;
<quote>"The question of compulsory insurance has always presented itself to me in two aspects&#x2014;first, as an indispensable act of justice to a dispossessed publican; and, secondly, as a method of smoothing the path to the passing of a no-licence resolution."</quote>
He could not speak more favourably than that. Yet afterwards in Committee he threw obstacles in the way of every proposal that was made. The Secretary for Scotland also opposed every scheme which was submitted, but on the Third Reading he stoutly maintained that he was not an enemy to compulsory insurance. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"If the trade can prove to Parliament that compulsion is necessary, and that, if not the whole trade, a large majority are in favour of compulsory insurance, I not only would not view it with hostility but with a benevolent eye. It must not be said, therefore, that I am hostile to the trade insuring itself."</quote>
The trade is asking your Lordships to insert in the Bill this schedule which enables the trade to insure itself.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03220">What have the Government's objections been in the other House to compulsory insurance? In the first place, it was said that this is not a complete or substantial indemnity. Those who have put forward this scheme have not pretended for a moment that it would furnish a complete indemnity; they do not even say that it will give a substantial indemnity; but what they do say is that whatever it amounts to, whether the amount of insurance be large or small, whatever the amount may be, to that extent it is an alleviation of the loss which the publicans will sustain if they are not insured. Then, in the next place, it has been said that if the Government allow this schedule to go into the Bill it will imply that the Government in some way or another guarantee the soundness or the solvency of the scheme. There is not one word said about the Government from beginning to end, and I venture to think that if the Government wish that it should be expressly stated that they have nothing to do with this, though I
<col>1128</col>
should think any such words entirely superfluous, I do not know that I should offer any objection to their insertion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03221">The third objection&#x2014;and this really is the important one&#x2014;was taken by the Lord Advocate. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Have we any figures to show that there really is a substantial majority of the trade in favour of this scheme?"</quote>
The two associations have done their best to ascertain what the feeling of the trade was. In the month of October, while the Bill was in the other House, they sent round a circular to the individuals in the trade. I may say that in Scotland there are 5,000 odd publicans, 1,600 odd hotel-keepers, and 3,600 odd grocers&#x2014;in all there are 10,475 licensed persons in Scotland. A sort of <i>plebiscite</i> was addressed to the individual traders, and this was the circular&#x2014;
<quote>"I am [or am not] in favour of a compulsory insurance scheme for the Scottish trade whereby licensees pay on their declared annual licence value a yearly premium for compensation, secured wholly or partly, as the fund will permit, to licensees losing their licences under the operation of this Bill."</quote>
In response to that <i>plebiscite</i> 3,778 publicans, hotel-keepers, and grocers&#x2014;I can give your Lordships the relative numbers if you like&#x2014;answered that they were in favour of such a scheme, and 436 said that they were not in favour. That was while the Bill was in the House of Commons. But after your Lordships had read the Bill a second time, on November 9 they issued another circular. This time they issued the circular to the associations, of which there are eighty-nine, and up to yesterday eighty-four replies had been received. The five associations from whom no reply was received have 140 members. Replies in favour of this scheme were received from seventy-nine associations with a membership of 7,575, and five associations with a membership of 535 replied that they were against it. Therefore these two bodies who are promoting this scheme have done their best to furnish to Parliament the information which Parliament desired. I must say it seems to me that so far as figures go, though we all know that figures are not always reliable, they have at all events proved this, that there really is a substantial majority of the trade in favour of this scheme. I beg to move.</p>

But there was one point on which I am disappointed he did not dilate. I had hoped to hear why in his opinion it was necessary that this insurance scheme should be a compulsory scheme, and why it should not have been a voluntary scheme. That was the point upon which His Majesty's Government laid very great stress, and upon which certainly, speaking for myself and I think for other members of your Lordships' House, we should have been glad to hear from the noble Earl a good deal more. That is really the point at issue between us.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1130</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03230"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I think I did say that the Mutual association, which is a voluntary association and was in the first instance opposed to the scheme, had found that it was impossible to proceed otherwise than by compulsion, and had conic round and was now actually promoting the scheme.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03231"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: That is the point. The noble Earl tells us they found it necessary, but he has not told us why they found it necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03232"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I will tell you presently.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03233"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I do think that on this occasion, when the point at issue between us is just that point&#x2014;whether or not this should be placed in the Bill as a compulsory insurance scheme&#x2014;we should have been glad to hear more from the noble Earl on that particular point. In connection with this scheme I shall follow the example, which has been set on several occasions in discussing this Bill, of discussing at the same time the other Amendments connected with this Amendment and touch upon the schedule standing in the name of Lord Camperdown, which is an essential part of the noble Earl's scheme. There is an important point in that scheme to which I should like to draw attention in the first place, and that is that in Clause 9 the noble Earl proposes that the licence-hollers of new premises or those who get new certificates shall in future pay a capital sum equivalent to the capital value of the licence&#x2014;that is to say, the monopoly value of the new licence. It is interesting to notice to whom the noble Earl says that this sum shall be paid. Under his scheme it is to be paid into the compensation fund, but in England the monopoly value of a new licence is payable to the Exchequer. The noble Earl, therefore, is asking your Lordships to agree to a step which I think is somewhat extreme so far as it goes and beyond anything which temperance reformers in England would agree to. He suggests that this monopoly value should go to the trade rather than to the Exchequer, as it does in England at the present time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03234"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: No, no.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1131</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03235"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl in Clause 9 of his proposed schedule says that the value of the new certificate is to be paid into the central assurance fund.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03236"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I omitted any reference to Clause 9 purposely, because that refers only to a particular case. The scheme itself is exclusive of Clause 9. And might I point out that owing to the change which your Lordships made yesterday this particular clause will have to be reconsidered, or rather there must be something put into the Bill to make Clause 9 harmonise with the rest of the Bill. Clause 9 of the schedule, to which the noble Earl is alluding, refers to a particular case&#x2014;"the holder of a new certificate for premises not certified at the time of the application." It has nothing to do with the insurance fund, which is the real object of this scheme.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03237"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: There is no point of difference, as I understand, between us. It is perfectly clear that under Clause 9 this sum of money is to be paid into the insurance fund. That is all I was urging, and I was drawing the distinction between what he proposes should be done in Scotland and what is dome at the present moment in England. If the noble Earl thinks that some further Amendment is necessary in view of what was done in Committee last night, he will no doubt withdraw this particular clause when we come to the schedule and bring it up in a new form on Report.<lb/>
There is a still more important point to which I should like to draw the attention of your Lordships. The insured person, as the noble Earl told us, may demand the declared value of the certificate insured by him, and the noble Earl explained that that was an <i>ad hoc</i> term which had no force outside this insurance scheme. I agree with the noble Earl, and I rather doubt whether it will have much force inside the insurance scheme either, because there is no provision that the insured person will receive either the declared value itself or anything like it. The noble Earl has himself recognised that, because at the end of Clause 3 he uses another term. He says there that the licence-holder may, subject to the provisions of the scheme, recover, not the declared value, but the moneys payable to him thereunder. Not only in the Bill itself but also in the <i>plebiscite</i> which was
<col>1132</col>
submitted to the licence-holders in Scotland it might have been made rather clearer that although they were to insure for the declared value there was no certainty of any sort or kind that they would receive anything like it under the noble Earl's scheme. I confess that after the last Amendment on which we voted I was rather shocked to hear of the <i>plebiscite</i> to which the noble Earl referred. He sent postcards round to the licence-holders. I should have expected after what he said on the last Amendment that he would have&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03239"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I should have thought, after what the noble Earl said on the last Amendment, that he would not have approved but would have disapproved of postcards being sent round to the individuals concerned, and would have expected that they should have been required to go and sign the <i>plebiscite</i> in some almost inaccessible place perhaps several miles away from their residence. But circumstances alter cases. What is good enough for licence-holders and convenient for them is not to be the system applied when it is a case of reducing licences under the Bill. Then we come to the quotation which the noble Earl has made from what was said by my right hon. friend on this question of insurance. His Majesty's Government have no objection to a scheme of voluntary insurance, and in view of the large numbers who, as the noble Earl tells us, are in favour of the scheme I cannot see any difficulty in getting a Private Bill which would secure the institution of such a fund as the noble Earl desires. If a Bill of that kind were promoted there would be every opportunity for those who objected to come forward, but as we understand from the noble Earl there would be exceedingly few, if any, objectors. I fail to see in these circumstances why the voluntary system should not be of equal value, at any rate, to the compulsory one. I would suggest to the noble Earl that it would then become more obvious that what they would be likely to receive under the insurance scheme would be nothing like the declared value of which he has already told us.<lb/>
It is perfectly true, as the noble Earl himself said, that insurance is not compensation nor anything like compensation,
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0571"/>
<col>1133</col>
and it would have been of very much greater service to all those concerned if, in suggesting a scheme of compulsory insurance, the association to which the noble Earl referred had also allowed the licence-holders to have some idea of the amount which they were likely to receive. His Majesty's Government cannot deny that if a compulsory scheme of this kind is put into the Act there would be at any rate a moral expectation on the part of those who insured under it that they would receive something like the full value of their licences. We do not believe that it is possible for them to get anything like it under the figures which have been suggested at various times, and in those circumstances His Majesty's Government feel that there would be, rightly or wrongly, an expectation on the part of the licence-holders that His Majesty's Government would come to their rescue and out of the funds at their disposal make up the difference between the two sums. That, of course, is a position which it is quite impossible for His Majesty's Government to accept.<lb/>
There is another danger that I referred to yesterday, though the noble Marquess opposite, Lord Salisbury, did not seem to think it a serious matter&#x2014;that is with reference to reduction. It is that reduction is to become conditional on there being an adequate amount of compensation in the funds. That was the point yesterday. I think it is not unfair to say that there would be a general unwillingness to further this scheme of reduction if expectations had been held out of a considerable sum being given under this insurance scheme, and that there was no prospect of a reasonable sum being received under the scheme itself. In those circumstances the mere fact that there was not enough money in the insurance fund to compensate might easily act as a deterrent to this matter of reduction. Then there is the influence of the scheme upon disinterested management, upon which, I hope, we may hear something from noble Lords who are well qualified to speak of the burden it would place on their funds. But so far as His Majesty's Government, are concerned, with their readiness to support the voluntary scheme they are unable to agree to this, because, in their opinion, it would not give such a real and substantial compensation as would be necessary if His Majesty's Government were concerned in the scheme at all.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1134</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03240"><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: There is one question that I would like to ask my noble friend Lord Camperdown. It arises out of the speech we have heard from the noble Earl who has just spoken. He repeatedly stated that under this scheme the declared value of the licence would not be obtained by the licence-holder who resorted to this fund. I am not sure that I quite understand the noble Earl's Amendment. If your Lordships will turn to subsection (3) of Lord Camperdown's Amendment you will see it there stated&#x2014;
<quote>"A person from whom a certificate is withdrawn in pursuance of a resolution under this Act may demand the declared value of the certificate."</quote>
Then if you turn s to the proposed Schedule III further on you will see in subsection (2) (if Clause 7&#x2014;
<quote>"If the available fun is of the central board are insufficient, the claims of the members of each association against each fund shall be proportionately abated."</quote>
That bears out what was said by the noble Earl in charge of the Bill just now, that though the licence-holder may demand the full declared value of the licence, if the funds are insufficient he shall not receive the full amount. Then we pass on to Clause 8 of Lord Camperdown's proposed schedule, where provision is made for a special <i>ad hoc</i> levy in those cases where the main fund is not sufficient to supply the whole amount, and at the bottom of the page&#x2014;subsection (2)&#x2014;we are told, "If the proceeds of the levy"&#x2014;I suppose this refers to the special <i>ad hoc</i> levy?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03241"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Yes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03242"><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: The subsection runs&#x2014;
<quote>"If the proceeds of the levy are insufficient to pay in full the claims in respect of which it was made, the unpaid balance of the claims shall be carried forward for the two following years, and in each of these years, if necessary, the like levy shall be made and the proceeds thereof shall be applied to the payment of all outstanding claims."</quote>
I am afraid that under this arrangement you will be placing upon the funds in each year a lien in respect of unpaid funds of one or two years' standing in the past. It seems to me that this subsection of the noble Earl's schedule is designed to enable the holder of the certificate who loses his certificate under a reduction resolution to obtain his declared value, if not by the insurance fund, at any rate by the <i>ad hoc</i> fund which will be raised under Clause 8.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1135</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03243"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: So far as the special levy of the three years will do it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03244"><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: What I am afraid of is this, that if you place this burden, if I may call it so, upon the insurance fund in respect of claims of past years you will be approaching to the position we are in in England with regard to the Compensation Act&#x2014;you will only be able to carry out the payments if the funds are forthcoming. As I understood the main object of the insurance scheme proposed by my noble friend, if the funds are not there the claim would have to be abated and the holder of the certificate would only receive what money was available. Therefore I should like some explanation of the meaning of this unpaid balance which is to run for two years, and which will apparently become rather a severe burden on the general insurance fund set up by the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03245"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I do not know whether your Lordships wish me to answer the question of the noble Earl now or postpone it. Of course this is a question with regard to a matter of detail in the scheme and does not refer to the scheme as a whole. I think it would work in this way. The central fund, in the first place, would be possessed of 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.,</i> which is divided among the on-licence holders' fund and the off-licence holders' fund, and, of course, the respective amount due to the associations under each. To that extent they would be able to call on their individual fund. Supposing the central fund to be insufficient to pay the whole, then there would be a special levy by the particular association of 1&#x00BD; per cent. on its members. If that was not sufficient to pay the whole in the first year a similar levy would be made in the second, and if the same thing continued a similar assessment would be made in the third year. If by the third assessment the matter were not completely paid off then all liability would cease. But your Lordships will remember it had never been contended by the persons who put forward this scheme&#x2014;speaking of the scheme as a whole&#x2014;that it was a complete relief. All that they said was that so far as the money went it would be a relief. It is a matter, of course, affecting the whole trade, and the trade who put this forward are content with
<col>1136</col>
it, and if they are content with it I do not see that the fact that it is not sufficient to pay twenty shillings in the pound is any reason why your Lordships should not allow them to have that which they say they wish to have.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03246"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I think the confusion into which one or two members of your Lordships' House seem for a moment to have fallen has arisen through the mistake of drawing any analogy whatever between the scheme which has been submitted by my noble friend and the scheme in the English Act. They proceed from a totally different basis. I noticed that even the noble Earl in charge of the Bill, who is a master of this subject, fell into that very mistake. The system under the English Act is this. You have a certain sum of money, and you are only allowed to take away licences so far as that money goes. The amount of the money limits the number of licences that you can take away. That is the provision of the Act of Parliament with which those of us who sit on licensing committees are very familiar. Here it is directly the contrary. The authorities take away what licences they like up to any figure, and the insurance is made to go as far as the insurance will go. If there are a great many licences taken away then there will be less money paid by way of insurance. That necessarily must be so. If there are fewer licences taken away then there will be more money available.<lb/>
But in any case those who take away the licences&#x2014;that is the electors under the Bill we are discussing&#x2014;will not be limited in any degree. They may take away under that very absurd limiting resolution, which is fixed at 25 per cent., the 25 per cent., or they may take away all the licences under a no-licence resolution, or under the decision of your Lordships yesterday they may hand over a certain number of licences to disinterested management. They may do anything they like. They have an absolutely free hand, and are not limited or hampered in the least degree by the amount of money there may be in the insurance fund. After that has been decided you say to the insurance fund, "To what extent can you pay the declared value of these particular licences?" and as far as that money will go so it will be used. That is the scheme
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0573"/>
<col>1137</col>
of my noble friend. There is a provision that if the central fund is not sufficient then the claim must be abated. Then when you go to the local fund, if you find that the levy of 1&#x00BD; per cent. in three successive years is not sufficient, in that case the unfortunate dispossessed licensee must do without the balance of his insurance. That is the provision. Of course it is an unfortunate and unjust position, but beggars cannot be choosers. Those whom my noble friend represents have not got the money for the full value of the licences, and therefore they have to go short.<lb/>
I should have thought that the pitiful position in which the rejected licensees are placed would have moved the pity of the noble Earl. On the contrary, he did not seem to think that it mattered in the least whether they got any money or not. The noble Earl opposite used the word "compensation," but the insurance money imposed by my noble friend is not sufficient for these licensees. Therefore, say the Government, sitting comfortably on their Benches and enjoying their salaries, "These people shall have nothing at all, they can go without; or perhaps a Private Bill can be brought in a little later, and that may get through." That is, I think, a very ungenerous way of treating this matter. These licensees are really deserving of pity. It may be in the public interest in Scotland for the licences to be reduced, but I certainly think it is a great pity that these men who have been earning an honest living up till now should be rejected without any means of compensation. My noble friend comes forward and produces a scheme which provides perhaps half of what they might be expected to get, and yet the Government will not meet us. They have, on every Amendment proposed to meet this, found what they consider to be excellent reasons for doing nothing at all. I am sure that what the noble Earl has said does not represent his real sentiments; he has only been putting forward official sentiments. I hope that when he comes to consider this important point he will see that this is a matter that deserves consideration, and I trust that the Government may be able to find some scheme which will help these unfortunate people. It appears from my noble friend's statement that this scheme has the consent of the vast majority of the persons concerned. Therefore as regards the details as affecting them we
<col>1138</col>
have not a very grave responsibility as to their particular form. The persons interested have considered them and have come to a conclusion by a vast majority&#x2014;70 per cent., I think, of the whole of the licence-holders in Scotland&#x2014;that they are satisfied with this scheme; and as to the balance of 30 per cent., I think I am accurate in saying that a large number of them have not voted against the scheme but have merely refrained from voting at all. Therefore I think we are absolved from looking at the details too closely. As long as the interested persons are satisfied surely that ought to be sufficient.<lb/>
I have only one word more to say, and that is about disinterested management. Undoubtedly if your Lordships think well to assent to this particular provision the Amendment concerning disinterested management to which we agreed last night will have to be to some extent modified, and I undertake myself to propose to your Lordships at a future stage as to how it should be modified. I do not think that it will want much, but it will want certain modification in order to bring it into line with this scheme, and if your Lordships will allow me I will produce that at the next stage of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03247"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: The noble Marquess has made an appeal to the Government to consider this Amendment more favourably than they have done up to this point, and has based that appeal upon the suggestion that we are hard and flinty hearted and have not considered the position of the unfortunate licence-holder who would be benefited by this scheme. The ground upon which we object to this scheme is a totally different one from that which the noble Marquess has put. We object to it because we think it is a thoroughly unworkable proposition, and as wholly unprecedented a thing to introduce into a Bill of this kind as has ever come within our experience. In the course of this discussion nearly every speaker has stumbled from the expression "insurance" into "compensation." It is quite natural and proper that the stumble should have been made, because this is really an attempt, and a very inadequate attempt, at compensation. What is the position of the licence-holder if this Bill passes? He runs a risk which it is not possible to estimate on an ordinary insurance footing. There is and there can
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0574"/>
<col>1139</col>
be no experience which will tell what the value of the risk he is running will be, and consequently there is no basis on which any premium can be calculated.<lb/>
The noble Earl who introduced the scheme told us almost pathetically of the difficulties there were in getting any scheme from the licence-holders. At first the vast majority said nothing. That is what I would expect. Of those who did say anything a large majority were for the scheme. There were also a small number of dissentients. But the vast majority said nothing, and I gather that still a very large proportion have said nothing. And how could they say anything? How can any man tell whether it is or is not worth while from a business point of view going into this matter? There is one thing I can tell with great certainty, and it is a thing which weighs very much in the mind of the Government. When you have what has been called an insurance proposal, but what is not insurance at all, brought forward and put in the schedule of an Act of Parliament and made compulsory, then as surely as we are here to-night so surely will the unfortunate person who applies for it&#x2014;and he will be unfortunate because we are told that there will very likely be no money available&#x2014;reproach the Government for having put in an Act of Parliament guarantees which have not been fulfilled. The licence-holder is apt to say, "I never had time to look into your legal quibbles; all I know is that the Government thought fit to put a provision in this Act of Parliament giving compensation to me, and I am here expecting to have the guarantee of the State made good." It is no use saying, "If you look at the terms of the guarantee you will find on the face of them, although they are so confusing, that you could not expect you would be compensated." You will never get out of being told that you have taken upon yourselves the principle of compensating these unfortunate people, and if the fund is insufficient they will say, "That is not the fault of the insurers; they were compelled to come in, and if it was not a businesslike scheme you, the Government, ought to make it good, having passed it." That is why we object to it. I believe that it is thoroughly unworkable. I have never seen anything like it in any Act of Parliament of which I have had any experience, and so surely as you embark on this plan so surely in the days to come will you rue it. Speaking for
<col>1140</col>
myself and my colleagues we should be glad to see these licence-holders insuring themselves in some voluntary society, but we feel that the responsibility is too great, and too uncertain, to admit of our putting compulsory provisions into a Bill of this kind.</membercontribution></p>

It seems to me that there are associations in the schedule which might amount possibly to ten for all Scotland, taking it roughly. It might be fewer; but so far as I can make out from the schedule these associations do not really control the expenditure of the money.

<col>1141</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03258"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: But if a particular district or association had heavier calls because its houses were closed more than others the association would levy the 30<i>s.</i> among its own members to meet the liabilities of its own group. I understand that now perfectly well. Really this scheme is not an insurance; it is a tax. It is not a voluntary association of people who come in of their own accord to make provision against risk. It is a statutory obligation imposed not only on people in the trade but on any one who may hereafter go into the trade. I say nothing about subsection (9) as to intercepting all the monopoly value of the new licence. It was dropped that would not affect the scheme, but possibly deprive the association of paying a large perquisite. I am speaking of the scheme excluding subsection (9). It seems to me reasonable that persons should associate themselves together to make provision against risk, but it is quite another thing for a group of existing holders who are the people most interested to ask Parliament that every one who hereafter comes into the trade shall be compelled to contribute. It is important to consider the case of disinterested management, which many of us are most anxious to see a success. Obviously the disinterested management managers are bound to make a very small dividend&#x2014;4 per cent.&#x2014;and if these houses are set up in accordance with a popular vote they probably would be popular in the district, and a district satisfied with disinterested management would not be likely to abolish it. But you are going to levy a tax which will fall unequally. It will fall on people who are running no risk in order to indemnify people who run a heavy risk. There are districts in Scotland where landowners hold large estates, some of them whole parishes and some even a whole county, where the conditions are totally different. Yet you are proposing to impose a compulsory tax on those places and on those public-houses which run no risk in order to guarantee towns like Glasgow and other towns such as Lord Balfour of Burleigh mentioned, where great risks are run. You are going to tax the well-conducted districts in order to compensate the badly-conducted districts. I can see no justification for this House imposing a tax not only on present holders but all future holders merely to enable people who have pushed their trade in a reckless way to compensate themselves

against the risks they will run when the community can manage their own affairs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03259"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: The noble Marquess opposite made a rather careful legal case at the beginning of his speech as to what this insurance scheme covered, but is he sure that he did not rather discount his case by the sentimental appeal with which he followed it? He said he wondered why the Government were not willing to assent to the scheme, and that they had no sympathy for the poor licence-holders who would be deprived of their living. That is exactly what the noble Earl in charge of the Bill informed the House that the Government feared might happen under these provisions. They were afraid, if once you put an insurance scheme in the Bill, that when you came to an election you would have the representatives of the trade up and down the country saying, "You are not going to take away our licences because there is not a sufficient insurance fund to meet the reduction." The noble Marquess put that very case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03260"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Does not the noble Earl feel it too?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03261"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: No, I say frankly I do not in the case of Scotland. I understand that in Scotland they merely have a yearly licence and therefore this five years notice is ample for them. The noble Marquess said at the beginning of his speech that this scheme does not profess to give full compensation. But I think he had to admit that there might be a sentimental feeling when you come to an election. Of course, the fund available will be known. People will be told that it is a compulsory insurance scheme imposed by an Act passed by His Majesty's Government. These men will say that a Government Act of Parliament has imposed upon them this compulsory levy and yet the Government do not guarantee the benefits under it. I should like to know what the noble Marquess will say about that. I think I am right in saying that it is perfectly true that under the Insurance Act the Government do not guarantee the benefits. I should like to hear something from the Benches opposite as to what in their view would happen if when that Act were to come into operation the Government were to repudiate all those benefits. Here you have a scheme under which a tax is levied upon everybody. How can any
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0576"/>
<col>1143</col>
responsible Government take the responsibility of that scheme when it is admitted by its author that it is actuarily unsound? It seems to me if you were to put in the Act in capital letters, "This scheme does not give compensation and it will not pay 20<i>s.</i> in the &#x00A3;," you would be stating what is the actual fact. You could not do that. I do not think the noble Marquess himself would like to issue a circular to the electors saying, "This is an insurance scheme but we cannot hold out any hope and you must not expect it to be realised."</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03263"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: I dare say the noble Marquess knows what has happened in the case of the Insurance Act about telling the people the truth, and I have no reason for thinking that the same thing would not occur in this case. There is one other point to which I should like to call the attention of the House, with regard to the flat rate, as it is called, in insurance. Everybody in this case has to pay 10<i>s.</i> per cent., but it must be remembered that there are houses so conducted that they would be more likely to lose their licence than others. There are houses situated in certain quarters of the town which almost necessarily from their surroundings must be frequented by more or less undesirable people and their licences are consequently in greater danger than is the case in regard to houses situated in more favourable districts. I doubt, therefore, whether a voluntary insurance company would take in all public-houses at a flat rate, and if they refused to do that you would be inflicting a burden upon the better houses by imposing a flat rate and not taxing more heavily the houses that run a greater risk of losing their licence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03264"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The speech of the noble and learned Viscount, who I notice has now left the House, served, if I may say so, to unmask the position of His Majesty's Government with regard to this important question. He objected to the proposal of my noble friend Lord Camperdown, and, so far as I was able to follow him, entirely on the ground that it would be difficult to work. No hint fell from him or from any of those who sit beside him that they would
<col>1144</col>
endeavour to make it workable. Why does the noble and learned Viscount tell us that the scheme is an unworkable scheme? Because he anticipates that if this insurance should prove to be insufficient to fully indemnify the licence-holder for his licence there will arise a general feeling of dissatisfaction and His Majesty's Government will be criticised for having touched the question of insurance at all and having failed to provide an adequate insurance. That, I think, was the argument of the noble and learned Viscount. It comes then to this, that sooner than attempt to make my noble friend's scheme a workable scheme His Majesty's Government are content to leave these dispossessed licence-holders face to face with the cruel injustice which we believe will be done to them under this Bill. That is a point on which we differ fundamentally from noble Lords opposite. They refuse to admit, because that is really what it comes to, the extent of the wrong which is done to these people who will lose their licences.<lb/>
The noble Earl on the Back Bench repeated again just now the statement that all that these licence-holders possessed was a yearly licence. I am not going to labour that point again. It has been dealt with repeatedly. Every one with the slightest justice and fairness in his character must know that these men own something more than a mere yearly licence. I could quote to the House the sayings of Ministers and learned Judges in confirmation of that view. I will content myself by quoting a single sentence from a speech lately delivered by the Lord Advocate. The Lord Advocate, speaking of this question of insurance, said that it was in his view "an indispensable act of justice to the dispossessed publican." Does not that answer the suggestion that a voluntary scheme of insurance would be sufficient? If this amount of satisfaction is "indispensable," it will not do, surely, to leave the matter to chance. He went on to say that it was "a method of smoothing the path for a no-licence resolution." Therefore it comes to this, that in the view of the Lord Advocate justice required it and expediency required it. With regard to the criticism that the insurance will be an incomplete insurance, is it seriously contended that these dispossessed licensees who will really under this Bill lose almost everything they have in the world, will not prefer compensation&#x2014;I call it that for
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0577"/>
<col>1145</col>
want of a better word&#x2014;to some extent rather than have no compensation at all when they lose their licences? As to the statement that the licensees will expect to receive the full value of their interest, surely we are justified in saying that these people are not so absolutely foolish and ill-informed as to the circumstances under which this legislation is taking place as to be led to believe that by the introduction of a scheme of this kind they are to receive 20<i>s.</i> in the &#x00A3;.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Camperdown mentioned the fact that a kind of <i>plebiscite</i> had been had and a circular had been addressed to all the associations in Scotland. In that circular the position was fully explained. I will read the words again. The recipient of the paper which was sent out was asked to sign this document&#x2014;
<quote>"I am in favour of a compulsory insurance scheme for the Scottish trade whereby licensees pay on their declared licence value a yearly premium for compensation secured wholly or partly as the fund will permit."</quote>
There is an explicit explanation to these associations that the amount of the insurance might not be sufficient to indemnify them fully. To my mind it is a remarkable thing that the representatives of the trade having been fully seized of the question and with this circular before them should, as your Lordships have been told this evening, by this immense majority have declared in favour of a scheme of compulsory insurance. I think we should greatly fail in our duty to those who will be affected by this Bill if we did not attempt at any rate to mitigate the great hardship that will be done to them by inserting in the Bill a clause of this kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03265"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I hope the House will allow me to say a word or two before a Division is taken with regard to this matter. I rise with very great diffidence because I cannot profess to have such information or knowledge as justifies me in expressing a very decided opinion on the matters in the schedule, which, of course, we are discussing along with this particular Amendment. In my opinion it would be extremely desirable that there should be an insurance scheme, but the difficulty I have in the matter is how it will work out under compulsion. I will endeavour in a word or two to explain my difficulty,
<col>1146</col>
and perhaps the noble Earl who has made himself responsible for the scheme will do what he can to answer the point which I shall endeavour to put to him. Everybody who knows anything about licences in Scotland knows that they are of very varying value. There are some of them high-class country houses which I do not believe even under a popular vote would be interfered with. There are others, mostly, I think, in the urban districts but also in some country districts, which are not so well managed and which do run a certain amount of risk of their licences being arbitrarily taken away in any circumstances. This is to be a compulsory scheme; everybody is to come into it, and, as far as I understand, the only test of the value which is to be put for any particular house is what the holder of the licence declares to be the value. As I understand, there is no check upon his declaration at all. The only check is the fear of having to pay too high a premium.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03266"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The central board is to lay down the principles on which the declared value is to be estimated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03267"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: That may be so, but can they enforce those principles? The difficulty I have about it is that it is to be compulsory insurance, and the prime thing certainly is declared value. I have only been able to study it myself; I have not been able to take any advice on the subject; but as far as I read the schedule the only real test is the declaration of value by the holder of the licence. I do not see any provision for any authority to tell the holder of the licence that he has declared too high a value. I suggest to the House-and to the promoters of this scheme that that is not a sufficient test for the lowest class of house. I believe that the temptation of the owner of the worst class of house will be to declare a high value, and he will not mind paying a biggish premium for a year or two. Even though he will probably not cover the whole value of his licence he will stand to lose much less than the other man, because he will put on a very high value, and if the thing goes he will get either that value or a large proportion of it out of the insurance fund or out of the compulsory levy. If that
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0578"/>
<col>1147</col>
is so, you are going to put by trade organisation a compulsory levy on the well-managed house for the benefit of the fellow who has brought the whole trade into disrepute. It is on that ground that I dislike the idea of compulsion. I should like to see an insurance scheme, but I am afraid it will have to be voluntary, and possibly that may, to a large extent, create greater difficulties in getting a sufficient area to pay an insurance fund. The idea, to my mind, of insurance is that the person who pays the premium should pay a sufficient premium to cover the risk which is run. My fear under this schedule as I read it is that the man who will run the risk of having his licence taken away will not be the man who will find the insurance which will have to he paid to him, and therefore as at present advised I should gravely doubt the wisdom of putting the scheme exactly as it stands in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03268"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I ought to say a few words in reply to what has been said on the other side of the House. The noble Earl in charge of the Bill said he rather expected me to have said more about the voluntary principle. In the first place I did say that the only voluntary association which there is, and which insures a considerable portion of the trade at the present time, had found that the voluntary system did not succeed, and that it had changed its mind and so far from upholding the voluntary principle had become part author of this scheme. All through this debate the main subject has been lost sight of, which is this&#x2014;that this insurance scheme is an insurance by a trade for itself. It is not to receive any money from the public. It is simply a question of insuring members of the trade by themselves, and for their own benefit. As for saying it will not pay 20s. in the &#x00A3;, nobody has ever said that it would.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03269">All that they ever said is that they, who are the only persons interested, are satisfied with the scheme to this extent, that they believe it will do them good. The Lord Chancellor said that the Government might be expected to make this scheme good. Of course, persons may expect, but when nothing is said in the scheme and no mention whatsoever of the Government is made is it likely that the Government could be expected to, or that they would, guarantee the scheme? The trade is only asking you to enable them to apply compulsion, and the reason for applying compulsion is surely tolerably obvious. I am certain if any of your Lordships said, "Here is a splendid principle," many would say, "Oh yes, the principle is all right"; but when you went round to collect subscriptions you would find that a great many persons who were particularly in favour of the principle were not very liberal with their subscriptions. That is the reason why compulsion is proposed in this case. With regard to what Lord Balfour said as to the levy, it is stated in the scheme that the central board is to make rules providing the principles on which the declared value of the certificates is to be ascertained. Those rules will be subject to the approval of the Secretary for Scotland. I imagine that in considering the declared values which are put in the association will, of course, require that those declared values are made in accordance with the principles which the central board lay down. I do not wish to occupy your Lordships' time further. I do not think that anything else has been said to which a reply is necessary.</p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03273"><member>EARL GREY</member><membercontribution>: I hope the noble Earl in charge of the Bill may be able to accept the Amendment that stands in my name. The object of my new clause is to compel the Licensing Court to give any new licence which it may think desirable should be created to an authorised society under conditions approved by the Secretary for Scotland. In other words, what this Amendment means is that where a Licensing Court think a new licence should be created it should, wherever possible, be given to a disinterested management company so that the licence may he managed in the interests of the public and not of the publican, or brewer, or distiller. I do not think I need occupy any time of the House in giving reasons for this Amendment. If you go to Scandinavia, Norway or Sweden, you will find that the people there regard with absolute horror the idea of any licence being handed over to a private owner to be rim for his own benefit. The objection that the advocates of disinterested management have to the present system is that these monopoly houses are allowed under the present licensing law to be conducted in the interests of the publican, the brewer, and the distiller, while the interests of the public are not sufficiently safeguarded or considered. This Amendment which I venture to submit to the attention of your Lordships would make it impossible for a Licensing Court, when it thinks a new licence should be granted in the interests of the public, to grant the new licence except upon the condition that it shall be managed not in the interests of the trade but in the interests of the people. I therefore hope that the noble Earl, as it does not interfere with the option part of his Bill at all, may be disposed to accept this Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03277"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: Although His Majesty's Government cannot accept this proposed new clause we shall certainly not put your Lordships to the trouble of dividing on the subject in view of the decision which was come to yesterday on the general question of disinterested management. I shall content myself, therefore, with pointing out sonic of the difficulties into which the noble Earl will place the authors of the disinterested management resolution by the adoption of this Amendment. The proposed clause, as your Lordships will see, is to operate in every case except where a no-licence or a limiting resolution is in force. It will therefore operate in an area which may have expressly refused to have disinterested management within its area. So far as the wording goes, the proposal will also operate in districts where a disinterested management resolution has been carried, and if so it is in our opinion inconsistent with the provisions of the clause of the noble Marquess opposite which was carried yesterday, to the effect that in that case no new licence can be granted except to an authorised public company. We are of opinion that even if your Lordships accept this Amendment to-night it will probably be necessary to make some revisions on Report.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03281"><b>6.</b> As from the passing of this Act, and until the first day of June nineteen hundred and seventeen, it shall not be competent for a licensing court to order any structural alterations of licensed premises under section forty-two, subsection (3), of the Licensing (Scotland) Act, 1903.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03282"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I think that my Amendment to this clause is consequential on what was done last night. As the words stand, it is from June 1, 1917. That was five years from June 1, 1912; but as the period has been altered from five to fourteen years I think the words which I propose become necessary.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>Page 6, lines 18 and 19, leave out ("day of June nineteen hundred and seventeen") and insert ("earliest date when resolutions under the provisions of this Act Can come into operation").&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Camperdown.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03284"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: May I ask for some explanation of this clause? I do not understand the reason for the limiting words, "and until the first day of June nineteen hundred and seventeen," or the words proposed by the noble Earl below the Gangway. If I am right in supposing that the intention of the clause is to take away the power of a Licensing Court to order structural alterations during the five years because at the end of those five years the licence may be taken away from the licensed premises and therefore it would be unfair on the licence-holder that he should be required to make such alterations at perhaps considerable expense, why does not the same rule apply to similar orders after the five years have expired? Of course at any time after the five years are over it is possible for a no-licence resolution to be carried and for the licence to be taken away, and therefore the position would be still the same after the five years as during the five years. The licence-holder would be compelled by the Licensing Court to expend money in making alterations which would really be valueless. Why should there be any limitation of time?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03285"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount has quite accurately stated the object of the clause in this Bill. Surely the position would be this. If we did not allow the Licensing Court to order these structural alterations at the expiration of
<col>1152</col>
the five years they would not be able to do it at all, and then no structural alterations would ever be possible in any of these public-houses. That seems to me to place the Licensing Court in a position of difficulty such as obviously your Lordships would not wish them to be in. The Licensing Court should not, we think, have power to order structural alterations during the five years in which, under the scheme of the Bill, it was impossible for these resolutions to be put to local vote. It was thought fair that the trade should not be asked to make structural alterations during that period. Whether further alterations should not be made in the clause through postponing the operation of the Act for fourteen years is, I think, a matter for further consideration. But I would venture to say to the noble Earl that the phrase "earliest date" seems a very vague description, because it might mean the 28th day of May in the first year after the expiry of the postponed period. It might, on the other hand, mean the date on which the resolution in a particular area should come into operation, and if no resolution were ever passed the power to order structural alterations would in that case be indefinitely postponed, so you would once more have the Licensing Court in the position of being unable to order the alterations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03286"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: I do not think the noble Earl has met my case. There would be an injustice in the Licensing Court ordering expensive alterations if at the end of, say, five years the licence was taken away. That he admits by the clause. The injustice would be greater after thirteen years had expired because then the licence might be taken away the very next year after the Licensing Court had ordered expensive alterations. Surely the same rule of justice ought to apply to all time. I grant that it takes away the power from the Licensing Court of ordering alterations, but that seems to me necessary in a Bill which enables a licensing authority to take away the licence altogether.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03287"><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: Does not the law still keep alive the power of the present licensing authority to refuse a licence irrespective of the general body of the people every three years? I suppose if that is so it is more a matter of form than of substance, because if the justices or
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0581"/>
<col>1153</col>
whoever the people are who sit in licensing Session find premises very bad they can say, "We recommend you to alter these premises," and if that is not done they can withhold the licence at the end of the year. You take away a paper power but they preserve an effective power. Just as the county council may say, "We do not like a particular performance in a music-hall," and if it is persisted in refuse the licence, so the licensing authority could refuse the licence in this case if the alterations were not carried out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03288"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble Lord who has just spoken is quite right. There is no doubt the Licensing Court in Scotland can and does take away licences very frequently, and what the noble Lord pointed out is, as a matter of fact, what does actually occur. The Licensing Court would maintain their authority over the licensees quite irrespective of ordering alterations to be made. With regard to the words which I propose to omit, I think the words as they stand in the clause cannot remain&#x2014;at least, they may remain but they are no longer applicable. Originally they were put in because it was five years from Arne 1, 1912. Your Lordships have now altered that by enlarging the period from five years to fourteen. Therefore these words "day of June nineteen hundred and seventeen" become no longer applicable. I do not want to press the Amendment, particularly at this moment, but I would point out to the noble Earl that he must make some change.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1154</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03294"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>:I move to leave out "the hour of" and to insert "an opening hour not being earlier than eight o'clock in the morning or later than." I think that if the hour of ten o'clock is made a hard-and-fast rule for the opening of public-houses it will be very hard both on the public and on the licensee, and the object of my Amendment is to give the Licensing Court discrimination in the various centres in which they work. They would surely know the conditions which surrounded each district, and they would be perfectly able to arrange the most convenient hours. I must trouble your Lordships for a few minutes because I want to show you what a really great hardship the opening hour now in the Bill would be to a very large portion of the public. Take the City of Glasgow. There is an enormous number of great industries all over that large city. There are markets in the east end and in the centre of the town and along the docks, which go all the way down the Clyde, to which hundreds of thousands of workmen go to their work. There are mechanics, labourers, artisans, firemen, and different classes of labourers who are at work all night as well as all day on different ships. The work time is not by any means confined to day hours. A man working all night finishes his work at or before eight o'clock in the morning, and it is only natural that he should require some refreshment before he goes away, probably a very long journey, to his home. Of course, in the residential part of Glasgow a later hour might suit. At the same time, I am very firmly of opinion that if a later hour of opening is given a later hour of closing should also be given as a compensation to the publican, because there is a great deal of business after concerts, theatres, and so forth. People who come back from such places require some refreshment before they go home, and I believe the last hour before closing is generally the most important one for the licensee. I think in that case some compensation should be given in the direction I indicate. That might easily be seen to by the Licensing Court.<lb/>
If you turn to Edinburgh, or to Leith, exactly the same conditions apply there. There are the great docks at Leith where men are employed loading and unloading all through the night as well as the day, and they also have to go great distances in order to get home. After working all
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0582"/>
<col>1155</col>
night they require refreshment before they start on their journey. Many of your Lordships, no doubt, have travelled to Edinburgh by a late train, and you know you arrive there at about seven o'clock or half-past seven in the morning. It will be very inconvenient for all the passengers if they find that the hotels and licensed places are not open until ten o'clock.<lb/>
Then let us go to Aberdeen, another large city. There, I think, there are about a dozen public-houses all grouped together along the quay. I know myself that these public-houses are in great requisition at the time the steamers are coming in and going away, and the workmen who have been working on these ships require refreshment just the same before they go home. I have myself seen the way in which these public-houses are conducted. In fact, I have been in one of them and had refreshment there on an occasion when I went to the quay at an early hour to a steamer to see a motor car off. It was at eight o'clock in the morning, and I may say that I had an excellent breakfast there. In Aberdeen I believe women also are engaged working throughout the night. They go home in the early hours of the morning and require refreshment after their work just as much as do the men. I have been given figures&#x2014;of course, I cannot vouch for them&#x2014;by a licensee who has made a calculation that in Aberdeen the proposed hour of opening, ten o'clock, which takes off two hours in the morning, would cost the publicans nearly &#x00A3;1,000 a week. There are 125 licensees in the eleven wards in Aberdeen, and the change would, I am told, cost the licensees over &#x00A3;44,000 a year. I will not vouch for that, but I believe it is approximately what the loss would be.<lb/>
Now let us go to the West of Scotland, and look at the town of Clydebank, a new town that has sprung up quite recently and has a population of 37,500 inhabitants. There are great works there; workmen come all the way from Glasgow, and the hour of breakfast is at nine o'clock. If the opening is kept over until ten o'clock some alteration will have to be made, and a great deal of discomfort will probably ensue. If the opening hour were as I suggest it would be perfectly easy to manage. Before the Act of 1862 the opening was at seven o'clock; it was afterwards changed to eight o'clock, and
<col>1156</col>
now it is proposed to make it ten o'clock. I think that is a long way to go. I believe if it were left in the hands of the Licensing Court to say at what hour the opening should be it would be perfectly safe, and there would be no abuse.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03296"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: I would make an earnest appeal to my noble friend behind me not to press his Amendment. I believe if this Amendment is carried it will do more to disappoint sensible moderate opinion in Scotland than anything your Lordships could do to the Bill. The noble Lord has mentioned Glasgow, Clydebank, and Aberdeen. My knowledge of Aberdeen is not so great as that of the noble Lord, but I know Clydebank because I happen to be trustee of the estate on which Clydebank is built. I know, therefore, every yard of it. So far as this Amendment is concerned, I would like to tell your Lordships that when I was Secretary for Scotland in 1903 I wanted to put this very Amendment into the Bill which consolidated the whole of the licensing law of Scotland. Circumstances were then too strong for me, and I was not able to do it. I went very fully into it at the time, and I went to see the place. All down the banks of the Clyde, especially in Partick and on the north bank., there are shipbuilding yards, immense centres of employment, and the pay in those yards is generally on Friday evening, hut sometimes on Saturday morning. I am sorry to say that many of those who are paid at that time spend part of their time on Saturday night and Sunday in consuming a considerable portion of their wages in intoxicating liquors. They are perfectly within their right and within their freedom in doing so if they wish to do so, but I am bound to say that it was represented to me as being carried to excess.<lb/>
The case for this alteration of the law is this. Supposing men have done that on Saturday afternoon and on Sunday, and go back to their work on Monday morning. They go back without haying had breakfast and work for two or three hours in the morning, and when they come out at about eight o'clock and start to
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0583"/>
<col>1157</col>
go home to breakfast they find outside the public-houses along the highway rows of tankards of ale and stout and whisky, and so on, ready for their consumption, and many of them have not the strength of mind to pass. They stop and have some, perhaps not too much, but taken on an empty stomach the result is that they are, as was represented to me, too often incapacitated for further work on the Monday, and their time of unwork is thereby prolonged over Monday arid in some cases on Tuesday as well, to the loss of themselves and their families and to the enormous inconvenience of their employers. I am speaking from representations made to me by employers and by agents of the workmen, and I do not think I can speak too strongly&#x2014;at any rate for that area. I hope, therefore, that this Amendment will not be accepted. It is tempting to suggest that the Licensing Court should have an option over the country for hours between eight and ten o'clock in the morning. I am not prepared to say if the Bill passes as it stands there will not be in some country districts a certain amount of inconvenience, but I believe the advantage of having this later hour of opening will be so overwhelming in its nature that any disadvantages will be gladly submitted to. In my humble opinion if every clause of this Bill were deleted except this one I believe you would do as much as it is possible to do by legislation for the cause of temperance in Scotland. People have not been backward in writing to me in regard to this Bill since it came to this House, and although I have had hundreds of letters I do not think I have had one single protest against the particular provision now under discussion.

The point is that the Bill proposes that only members of the Court of appeal shall be available for signing certificates for clubs, and there is something to be said against the present practice which is in the Act of 1903. I venture to suggest that the provision proposed to be substituted would be a little too strict in some districts, because members of the Court of appeal are very limited in number and might not be easily accessible. I am convinced that is so, but it is not a matter of much importance, and if the noble Earl has any objection to the Amendment I will not press it.</p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03316"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: I should like to make some suggestions to your Lordships with reference to subsection (4) of Clause 8 in order to stiffen up the new legislation with regard to clubs. But I have not been able to put my suggestions on the Paper, and I only wish to say that I propose to raise the subject on Report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03317">Clause 8, as amended, agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03318"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF KINTORE</member> moved to add after Clause 8 a new clause providing that in any area where a no-licence resolution is in force excisable liquors shall not be supplied or sold in any club except to persons lodging or residing in the club, or to persons taking a meal on the premises of the club for consumption with such meal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03319">The noble Earl said: I present this new clause to your Lordships certainly not front a wish to cast any reflection on the management of existing Scottish clubs, for indeed as far as my experience goes they might be taken as a model by some other clubs elsewhere that I have heard of. I submit it less from any settled intention of asking your Lordships to divide upon it than from a desire to point out a very noticeable omission in the Bill, which amounts, I think, to an anomaly, and to inquire the reason for it. This clause applies to clubs in no-licence areas only. Clubs in other areas are in no way affected by it. Although I bring this clause forward for the reasons I have stated, I am one who has little belief in the possibility of enforcing sobriety on a nation by any Act of Parliament, certainly in Scotland. I think that little permanent good
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0585"/>
<col>1161</col>
will ever accrue to any cause from fanatical legislation. If temperance legislation is seriously demanded I believe that happier results might be looked for from enactments aimed at the improvement of the standard and quality of liquors retailed and the comfort and convenience of the places where they are consumed than from any other enactments however drastic.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03320">But I recognise that this Bill is before us in response to a somewhat noisily voiced demand. It is true that that demand comes front a small section of the levelheaded people of Scotland, and I must say that the statement on Second Reading of the noble Earl in charge of the Bill, that the Bill as it stood had the general support of the people of Scotland, was a statement characterised by such exaggeration that did it not come from the apologist of a Government who are seldom if ever their own masters I confess it would have taken my breath away. But still the Bill is here, and as it is in my poor country in which it is to operate I am anxious that your Lordships should do all you can to make it a workable and just measure. Your Lordships will have noticed that in Grand Committee of the House of Commons a clause was inserted&#x2014;a very much more stringent one than my proposed clause&#x2014;restricting the hours of the sale of liquor in clubs to those hours during which public-houses might be open. I was glad to see that on Third Reading the Government resisted that proposal and that it was struck out of the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03321">It is a novel experience&#x2014;not an unpleasant one&#x2014;for me to find myself in agreement with the Parliamentary representative of Scottish Labour. I see that Mr. Barnes, the Member for the Blackfriars division of Glasgow, whose colleague in the St. Rollox division is Secretary for Scotland, said in regard to this matter, "After the Bill becomes operative"&#x2014;and then he added, "Of that I am very doubtful. I think it will be a dead letter. Clubs will take the place of public-houses everywhere." Of course, my Lords, in no-licence areas they will; they will spring up and flourish independent of the law and untrammelled by it. I have endeavoured to ascertain on what grounds the Government hesitated to deal with clubs in this Bill, but the answers I have obtained are not very satisfactory. One answer was that they are reluctant to interfere with private liberty. As I think private liberty is
<col>1162</col>
interfered with in almost every line of this Bill and in many other Bills of His Majesty's Government I do not think that answer will do. But this, at any rate, I think, is clear, that if the common Radical contention that opportunity makes intemperance is correct, then this Bill, though it may be successful in catching votes, must fail to secure temperance, seeing that it leaves the question of the sale of drink in clubs absolutely unrestricted. That seems to me an illogical position and one with regard to which the House deserves some explanation, and it is in the hope of receiving an explanation that I move the insertion of the first subsection set out in my Amendment on the Paper.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03322">Amendment moved&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03323">After Clause 8 insert the following new clause:
<quote>"<b>9.</b>&#x2014;(1) In any area where a no-licence resolution is in force excisable liquors shall not be supplied or sold in any club except to persons lodging or residing in the club, or to persons taking a meal on the promises of the club for consumption with such meal."&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Kintore.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03324"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: In view of the consistent hostility with which His Majesty's Government have regarded clauses of this nature proposed in another place you will not expect me to say that we can accept the Amendment which lots just been moved by the noble Earl. The noble Earl's proposed new clause is of a very far-reaching character, and I may say that I have received, as I dare say many of your Lordships have, deputations from a number of clubs against its being passed. The noble Earl's clause provides that no liquor shall be supplied in any club except to persons residing in the club or taking a meal on the club premises. We had some little discussion about what constituted a meal last night, and here again we have the same difficulty. As regards residents, they are only a small fraction of the membership of clubs, while many very good clubs have no residential qualification at all&#x2014;that is to say, they have no bedrooms. As regards members taking meals, these again form only a very small proportion of the membership of clubs, and we should undoubtedly have those disputes arising concerning meals to which I have already referred. This Amendment is directly contrary to the theory of legislation in regard to clubs. In theory the position is that a club approaches as nearly as possible to the <i>status</i> of a private house. It was upon that theory that Clause 8 was proposed,
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0586"/>
<col>1163</col>
and in our opinion it is preferable to try that method before attempting to put into force the drastic proposal of the noble Earl. If experience proves that our suggestion as embodied in Clause 8 is insufficient it might be necessary to proceed with further restrictions. As your Lordships know there are already certain provisions in this Bill which will have some effect upon clubs. Under the Licensing Act of 1903 we found that though clubs generally were not mismanaged there was room for amendment. Those amendments are embodied in the Bill, and in our opinion they are sufficient to deal with the difficulties which have arisen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03325"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am sure the House cannot have been surprised that some member on this side should call attention to the manner in which the subject of clubs is treated in the Bill of His Majesty's Government. It seems to me beyond question that the Bill does discriminate, and in a very unfair manner, in favour of clubs as against licensed premises. That is particularly the case, of course, in a no-licence area where all licensed premises will disappear, and where consequently a great stimulus will be given to the consumption of liquor in clubs. The same result will no doubt follow, though not to the same extent, in areas where a limiting resolution has been adopted. It is, as my noble friend said a moment ago, an established axiom that restrictions upon the sale of liquor on licensed premises are always accompanied by a great increase in the consumption of liquor in clubs. It is quite clear that the mind of His Majesty's Government has undergone some change upon this point, because we know that at one moment they accepted a clause very much more drastic than that of my noble friend, under which not only in no-licence areas but universally clubs should be made subject to the same regulations as public-houses.<lb/>
My noble friend deals, of course, only with no-licence areas. But I am afraid that even under his comparatively limited proposal a great amount of hardship and injustice might be occasioned. You would have under my noble friend's proposal, the case of a perfectly well-conducted club with, perhaps, no residential accommodation, and consequently not frequented by residents and a club in which there was really no demand for meals. A club of
<col>1164</col>
that kind would find itself under my noble friend's proposal placed under all the disabilities of this Bill, and its members would be denied the right of obtaining harmless refreshments when they required them. There is also the additional feature in the case, that I am informed&#x2014;as I dare say most of your Lordships have been&#x2014;that in a great mans- cases the frequenters of these high class and well-conducted clubs reside outside the area, and consequently are liable to have their clubs closed upon them by a vote in which they have no right to take part. I am bound also to say that I think there is some force in the argument suggested by the noble Earl in charge of the Bill when he told us that the adoption of this proposal would put a considerable premium upon evasion. There is the difficulty of the supply of liquor in connection with a meal. The noble Earl suggested that there would be great difficulty in obtaining a definition of a meal, and I own I am quite unable to supply one. I can conceive many ingenious forms of evasion: the same mutton chop might, for example, be served repeatedly each time accompanied by a different drink. You may have things of that kind which we would rather not give opportunities for.<lb/>
Our position is this. His Majesty's Government place us in a dilemma. We have to accept this Bill with what I for one regard as unfair discrimination in favour of clubs as against public-houses. That is one horn of the dilemma. The other horn of the dilemma is a further invasion of personal liberty by imposing wholly unjustifiable restrictions upon well-conducted clubs. Having to choose between those alternatives I prefer the anomaly to the further invasion of personal liberty and I was rather glad when I heard my noble friend behind me, Lord St. Aldwyn, say a few moments ago that it was his intention with regard to the club clause in this Bill&#x2014;which I am bound to say I regard as a substantial clause and one entitled to sonic consideration&#x2014;to stiffen the provisions of that clause. In these circumstances I rather hope that my noble friend will be content with the discussion which he has originated and that he will not ask us to divide on his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

Since 1903, which was the first time that provision was made, serious difficulties have arisen. So far as the Court of appeal is concerned, they have power to make their own regulations, but so far as the Licensing Court is concerned they cannot make regulations and must go to Quarter Sessions if a quorum does not turn up on the day appointed. I am advised by the Association of Clerks of the Peace of Scotland that five or six times difficulties have occurred &#x2014;once at Argyll, twice at Fife, and in one or two other cases.

As the Bill stands the limitation is 10,000, and that is thought far too small. The Convention of Royal Burghs, I believe, proposed 40,000.

<image src="S5LV0012P0I0590"/>
<col>1171</col>
insert a new paragraph&#x2014;undoubtedly makes a somewhat drastic change in the areas proposed for the administration under this Bill. This I regard as one of the most important features of the Bill and absolutely vital to the success of the measure from whatever point of view you regard it. But, on the other hand, I venture to say it would not be in its nature so controversial either as the question of the time limit or as the question of compensation or of disinterested management or any of the other kindred subjects which we have been discussing. I am sure we will all agree, whether we regard this Bill with friendly eyes or not, that if it is to pass at all it ought to pass in a workable form. Now, my Lords, I venture to say that the areas suggested in this Bill are absolutely and supremely ridiculous. What you want is self-contained autonomous areas which will have one interest and one interest alone common over the whole area. I think that the areas suggested in this Bill offend against every canon and proper hope of success.<lb/>
As I understand the Bill, you are dividing comparatively speaking small burghs of under 12,000 into wards. On the Second Reading I gave an instance of the case of Alloa near my own home, in which there are 12,000 inhabitants, which will be divided into four wards and each of those wards will have power to vote differently. I have had a good many complaints of a similar kind from Perth, from Lanark, and from a score of other places. It is obvious when you are making a change of this kind in regard to licences that you cannot proceed on the same principles as if you were dealing with things like education or public health or local government generally. If you are going to have a different law regarding licensed houses in two contiguous areas it is very desirable that the division between the areas should not be in the centre of the population. But in this Bill they have gone out of their way to make it certain that the division between the areas will always be in the most congested parts of the population with which they are concerned. I am told by the representatives of the Convention of Royal Burghs that what I pointed out in the case of Alloa is absolutely the same in almost all the other burghs concerned. The division of the wards proceeds from the centre of the burghs outwards, so that if there is different voting in two different
<col>1172</col>
wards you will have different regulations regarding public-houses on the opposite sides of the main streets in those burghs. Can anything be more senseless than to suppose that any individual will be prevented from getting drink if lie has only to walk across a narrow street for the purpose of entering an open door on the other side? and can there be anything more unfair upon owners of public-houses than to find them shut on one side of the main street and open on the other side?<lb/>
I admit that the difficulties of getting a proper area are very great. Opinions differ not only as to the size but as to the kind of division which should be made. Some people have gone so far as to propose that the area should be as high as 40.000 of population. I do not go so far as that or nearly so far. But we have in Scotland, as in England, to deal with three different kinds of local authorities. We have the county, the burgh, and the parish. You have counties both large and small, you have parishes large and small, and you have burghs also varying very greatly in size. Speaking generally, there are three kinds of burghs in Scotland&#x2014;the Royal burgh, the Parliamentary burgh, and the police burgh. For licensing purposes the different parts are regulated by the early clauses of the Licensing Act, 1903, and the proposal in the Amendment which I am moving now is that the licensing authority, whether a county or burgh, should be asked to put a scheme, either alone or in conjunction with the neighbouring area, before the Secretary for Scotland for the making of an area for the purposes of this Bill which will as far as possible get over the undoubted difficulties which exist. If you have an autonomous body, an urban area, surely common-sense suggests that it should be one for the purpose of licensing. We have to take care that we do not offend against the sentiment of the burghs which prize very greatly their separate existence from the counties. But even their interest in the matter seems to me to be less than the interest of the community at large. You should take care not to have more dividing areas than necessary, frontier lines as it were, in a matter of this kind, and certainly not frontier lines in the centre of population. If this Bill passes practically as it stands, as I read it, you might have a different area in every one of the 970 parishes in Scotland and in all of the 175 burghs. If you have a country
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0591"/>
<col>1173</col>
district intervening between, what is the condition of licensing on one side and the other? You probably do less harm than if You have merely a stream or street boundary, but you are going out of your way in this Bill to make it absolutely certain that the immense majority of your frontier lines will not be in country districts but between different parts of the same town, or the same city, or the same police butgh.<lb/>
The proposal which I have ventured to make is made a good deal as it now stands on the suggestion of the Convention of Royal Burghs. When I first drafted the Amendment it is quite possible that in my desire to have as few frontier lines as possible I put the limit of population rather too high. The Convention of Royal Burghs, which is as entitled to speak on this matter as any body I know&#x2014;it is thoroughly representative of all the burghs of Scotland&#x2014;paid me the compliment of sending a deputation of their number to see me last week, and it is largely in consequence of the representations then made to me that the Amendment I am now moving appears in the form in which it does upon the Paper of your Lordships' House. It preserves as far as we can the autonomy of the burgh, and yet enables the burgh authorities and the county authorities, with full knowledge of the necessities of their different localities, to propose a scheme for the acceptance of the Secretary for Scotland and of Parliament for the delimitation of different areas. I have provided in the Amendment that there shall not be a division between two parts of the same electoral area. That is a point on which there is a difference of opinion, I believe, between the representatives of the Convention of Royal Burghs and the Amendment which I have put on the Paper. They would desire to go further than I am proposing to do and for the sake of having good frontier lines would even divide electoral divisions to provide a good roll of electors. I look with the most undisguised alarm at the prospect of what will happen in Scotland if this Bill passes in anything like the form, so far as areas go, in which it has been brought to this House. I have given the outline of my case for my Amendment, and I shall best consult the convenience of the House if I wait to see what line is taken in answer to it before I say any more in its support. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03387">Page 10, lines 13 to 24, leave out paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) and insert the following new paragraph:
<quote>"It shall be the duty of the county council or of the town council, as the case may be, within two years from the passing of this Act, and from time to time thereafter as may be necessary, to frame a scheme delimiting the provisional area of areas which, taking into account the electoral divisions of such county or die wards of such burgh, constitute the most suitable area or areas for the purposes of this Act, but in every case with these provisos:(1) It shall he competent in any such scheme by agreement between the local authorities concerned to include one or more wards in such burgh or burghs within an area or areas of a county or counties, or to include one or more electoral divisions of a county or counties within an area or areas of a burgh or burghs; (2) In no case shall the number of electors in such provisional area, except when such provisional area is a county, he less than two thousand; (3) In no case shall an electoral division in a county or a ward in a burgh be subdivided so as to form the whole or part of a provisional area. Such scheme when framed shall be submit tad to the Secretary for Scotland who, after making such inquiry as lie may deem necessary, shall have power to approve thereof or to alter or vary the same. Thereafter the Secretary for Scotland shall cause the scheme as finally approved by him to be laid before both Houses of Parliament, and after it has lain two months before Parliament, then, unless within such two months an address has been presented by one or other of the said Houses, preying His Majesty to withhold his consent from such scheme or any part thereof, it shall be lawful for His Majesty, by Order in Council, to declare his approbation of such scheme or any part thereof to which such address does not relate. A scheme, when approved by His Majesty in Council, shall have full operation and effect front the date of such Order in Council in the same manner as if it had been enacted in this Act; and thereupon, every Act of Parliament, letters patent, statute, deed, instrument, trust, or direction relating to the subject matter of the scheme, so far as inconsistent with the provisions thereof, Shall be repealed and abrogated."&#x2014; (<i>Lord Balfour of Burleigh.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03388"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>:I confess it was with a great deal of regret that, in spite of the concession made by His Majesty's Government on paragraph (<i>a</i>), I find that the noble Lord who has just spoken insists on putting his scheme for dealing with burghs before your Lordships' House. The increase we have made by the Amendment which we have accepted&#x2014;namely, from 10,000 to 25,000&#x2014;is so large that with regard to the burghs at any rate I had hoped that the noble Lord would have been satisfied and would not have asked us to adopt the suggestion which he has made. Of course, the acceptance of this Amendment now before us would sweep away the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0592"/>
<col>1175</col>
concession I have spoken of with regard to burghs, because the whole of paragraph (<i>a</i>) would go as well as paragraph (<i>b</i>), and we should substitute for the scheme to which this House has just agreed the new scheme of the noble Lord. I confess that that would be a matter of very considerable disappointment although it is technically possible.<lb/>
The special point, in view of the fact that we have agreed to so large an amendment in the case of burghs, is really the question of counties. I think we are all agreed that country districts should be treated in a different way from towns. We all realise the difficulty mentioned by the noble Lord of having the public-houses shut up on one side of a street and open on the other, but it will be very difficult to avoid that in whatever scheme you adopt. It must happen in some places, and it really is inevitable. In the case of the counties, to which I specially wish to draw your Lordships' attention, I would say that it is with very real regret that we do not see our way to make any suggestions which would really meet the wishes of the noble Lord. The scheme suggested in his Amendment departs so entirely from the proposal of the Bill that we are unable to suggest any compromise which he is likely to accept. It is quite true that in some instances parishes have very small populations. It is thought, however, that the average population of the units under the Bill in the country districts to which I specially referred will be about 2,000, and it is to be borne in mind that although populations may be small the area of a great many parishes in Scotland is very large indeed, and the element of personal acquaintance with the needs of the district would be absent if many of them were combined together in the way the noble Lord suggests.<lb/>
The suggestion that the noble Lord makes that the scheme should be first of all suggested by the council and then submitted by them to the Secretary for Scotland is not one that we think Secretaries for Scotland will be very grateful for when they are asked to agree to the suggestions as they reach them. It is dealing with very contentious and very delicate matters, and the present Secretary for Scotland, at any rate, would be most unwilling to accept the duty. But we are, perhaps, under some little disadvantage in discussing this somewhat big question at this hour of the evening, and I content
<col>1176</col>
myself with saying that if the noble Lord's Amendment is carried it will sweep away the conclusion at which your Lordships' House has arrived in the case of burghs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03389"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I confess that it was with regret that I heard the noble Earl say just now that he looked upon it as inevitable under the Bill that on one side of a street you might have a nolicence area and a different state of things on the other side of the same street. That is so prodigiously absurd that I cannot believe that the Government will insist on it. The obvious fallacy of such a scheme to secure sobriety is quite evident. Instead of securing sobriety it will secure disorder, because there will be a flocking of all the drinking population of the no-licence area across the street to satisfy their wants, and it will produce, if not disorderliness, at any rate a certain amount of congestion. I am not sure that my noble friend has realised that we have already inserted an Amendment in paragraph (<i>a</i>) which I do not think reads with his Amendment. We have already prescribed that in burghs the limit is to be 25,000, and my noble friend goes on to say that the limit is to be prescribed by means of a scheme which is to be suggested by certain authorities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03390"><member>LORD BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Amendment, if it were carried, would clear away both paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), and make a new scheme.</membercontribution></p>

We have not really swept away paragraph (<i>a</i>), but have put something in its place, and the noble Lord would have to redraft his Amendment in order to make it fit in with the decision the House has already arrived at. We have settled that the limit of the burgh is to be 25,000, but the noble Lord does not want that; he wants a limit which is to vary according to a scheme. His may be the better plan of the two, but unfortunately it is inconsistent, as I read it, with what your Lordships have already decided. In those circumstances I am afraid your Lordships cannot proceed with an Amendment which does not read with what is already inserted in the Bill. I speak subject to correction, but I think that is so; and in the circumstances I do not know whether my noble friend desires to go on with his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

I imagine that if the town councils were to deal with the matter they would do it in such a way that the two sides of a street should not be in different areas. But as we are not able to put in the words at this stage I suggest that I should put down Lord Clinton's Amendment for Report, and that Lord Balfour should withdraw his at the present time and decide, after he has the new print, what he proposes to do.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0012P0-03440">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03441"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Bill the Second Reading of which I now rise to move presents unusual features. The measure is not the work of any Party caucus or political organisation. It represents the views of no single political Party. It is a Bill brought forward with the general assent of all right-minded persons, because it stands for the heightened sense which the community has of a great evil which obtains among its people. The traffic in young girls is a traffic attended with the most disastrous consequences to the State. The girl who enters on a career of vice can look forward in four cases out of five, in nine cases out of ten only to an end to which an early death were preferable; and when that disastrous result is brought about by organised means, it is the high interest of the community to take such steps as may make those organised means cease to exist.<lb/>
This Bill has, I think, special interest for this House, because the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885, which it seeks to amend, is an Act which owed its genesis and much of its vitality to what took place in this House. In the year 1882 a remarkable Select Committee sat to inquire into this very subject. It was presided over by Lord Cairns. There sat upon it Lord Salisbury, Lord Shaftesbury, Lord Penzance, Lord Bramwell, the Bishop of London, and other distinguished men, and a Report was made which presented a strong case for the amendment of the law. The subject was in those days regarded as even a more difficult one than it would be regarded now. Into all such questions considerations of personal liberty and the possibility of mistake in the application of justice must inevitably come; and these
<col>1182</col>
considerations weighed with the public, I think, even more in those days than they do now, when we have more confidence in our methods and in the unlikelihood of error. At all events for three years the Report of that Select Committee was not acted on, and then in 1885 there was introduced into this House by Lord Dalhousie a Bill which afterwards became the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885. That Bill was begun by a Liberal Government, but the Government went out of office in the summer, and it illustrates what I was saying before, how this subject has become wholly dissociated from political controversy, that the Bill was at once taken up by the Conservative Government which afterwards came into office and passed into law.<lb/>
This Bill seeks to amend the Act of 1885, and it would probably be for your Lordships' convenience that I should first of all call attention to what the general provisions of the Act of 1885 are, because without some conception of them it is impossible to follow the amendments which the new Bill proposes to effect. This Bill, which received a great impetus from the agitation carried on in the country by the late Mr. Stead&#x2014;a man to whom, whatever one may say of some of his energetic methods, it is true that the public owes a great deal for what he did in giving an impetus to good causes&#x2014;may be said in general to do this. It is a Bill directed against procuration, and it contains clauses making procuration a much inure serious and defined offence than it was before and imposing a heavy penalty upon it. A person so convicted is made guilty of a misdemeanour and is liable to imprisonment not exceeding two years with or without hard labour. There are other provisions in the Bill relating to cognate topics, but that is the one with which I am concerned at the present moment. The remarkable feature is that notwithstanding the increased stringency of the law the offence of procuration has become more serious than it ever was before. I think that is partly due to the fact that it is recognised among that section of the criminal class which is of a calculating disposition and takes pains to see what may be made out of a system of this kind that the system is a very lucrative one to those who pursue it successfully. There is no doubt that a great deal of money is made by procuration, and that, if the criminal
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0596"/>
<col>1183</col>
can escape, it is for a tune at all events a lucrative trade for him to pursue. The result has been that a number of men and women have pursued this trade and taken the risk of conviction, with the knowledge that, after all, the sentence would probably be something considerably less than the two years mentioned in the Bill, and that afterwards they could resume their work.<lb/>
What is the class of person with whom you have to deal? These are not crimes committed from impulses of passion. They are the work of cold, deliberate, and callous natures, and it is only by sanctions which can be applied to persons of those natures with effect that you can put down the crimes which they commit. Consequently in the foreground of the Bill now before the House there is an attempt to strengthen materially and to sharpen the instrument of punishment. That is done in two ways. The first is by enabling in the case of male prisoners corporal punishment to be administered, and the second by giving a power of summary arrest, which does not now exist&#x2014;at all events it is very doubtful whether or not it exists at the present time. Those are the two great features of the change in the law which it is sought to make. There are other features in the Bill to which I will come presently. But I wish to point out, in the first place, the relation of this Bill to the Act of 1885. The offence of procurement is defined by the Act of 1885. The present Bill is a police measure dealing with the punishment of that offence, with power to arrest persons suspected of committing it. There are other provisions in the Bill on which I shall have a word to say presently. There are provisions for the suppression of brothels, and there are provisions for dealing with people who commit offences which are cognate to the main offences with which the Bill deals, notably the offence of those who live on the wages of prostitution, and who vary from the violent bully to the woman who practically commits an offence just as bad because she sends the girl out on to the street and lives by her earnings.<lb/>
Having sketched the Bill, the clauses of which I will come to presently, I wish to say a word on the two great controversial points which arise. I will deal first with
<col>1184</col>
corporal punishment. Of course, it is not suggested in this Bill that corporal punishment should be applied to women. We have sought to strengthen the law as regards women in other respects; but it would, I think, be repugnant to the sense of the community if we tried to apply corporal punishment to women. But we see no reason why corporal punishment should not be applied to male offenders. I have read in the newspapers a great deal of almost passionate invective against the proposal in this Bill to resort to corporal punishment at all. It is said that it is a retrograde step, and that we ought not in the year of grace 1912 to be talking of it. I am as much against corporal punishment as most people. When I was Secretary of State for War I was instrumental in abolishing it from the Army, and I think the Army is a much better Army because there is not the stigma of that possibility hanging over the heads of those who join. It has now been abolished in the Navy, and we are eliminating it for every offence of an ordinary kind. But for some offences it is necessary to keep it. Occasionally in our prisons a brutal assault is committed upon a warder by a brute who can be constrained by no other means than fear. No amount of kind treatment has any effect upon a man with the record which most possess who commit those assaults. Under very carefully defined conditions and under the supervision of the justices these convicts are flogged, and without the power of flogging the lives of the warders in many cases would be in a position of great danger. It is a power which we must use sparingly, but which we ought to keep. Then there are cases of robbery with violence. There is a great controversy as to how far corporal punishment is effective in putting down garrotting, but I do not find any large party who say that the offence of garrotting is not one which is properly met by corporal punishment as a deterrent. There are at the present time other cases in which whipping is recognised as part of the law. It is applied, as we know, in the case of male procurers who are taken up as incorrigible rogues and convicted as such and sentenced to be whipped. I mention this for the purpose of pointing out that corporal punishment is no new thing in our low, and though it has been reduced with<ob/> very narrow compass, still there remains a general sense that corporal punishment is not a thing of which we ought to get rid.<lb/>
***<image src="S5LV0012P0I0597"/>
<col>1185</col>
If that be so, then the question is whether the offence with which we are dealing, that of the male procurer, ought to be brought within its scope. The male procurer is a callous, cool, deliberate person. His crime is not a crime of passion, it is not a crime from which you can deter a man who is prepared to take the risk of imprisonment because of the large gain which he thinks he is making. He is a man so lost in moral sense that he does not mind condemning the girls who are his victims to a life worse than death in order to make money out of them. We think that in the case of a man of that kind, who is not bold, who is not brave, who is probably extremely sensitive to the fear of personal indignity and of suffering, the punishment is one which is calculated to act as a deterrent, and we think that it is a punishment which may be properly inflicted upon a rascal so bad that there is no hope, or almost no hope, of reclaiming him. Therefore we consider that the punishment which is administered with the birch and the cat is a punishment which is as much justified in such a case as in the case of a convict who commits a brutal assault on a prison warder. That was the general view taken in the other House.<lb/>
But there has arisen in connection with this a point about which there is more difficulty. It has been said that corporal punishment ought only to be administered for a second offence, and the main reason for saying that is the fear lest somebody should be improperly convicted a first time and unjustly punished in this fashion. On the other hand, the contrary view is that unless you preserve corporal punishment for a first offence you will not get that deterrent against the business of procuration which you desire to secure. Some Members in the other House took one view and some the other, and the result was that by a very narrow majority, the infliction of this punishment in a first offence having been stopped, was put back. By an Amendment carried only by four votes the House of Commons decided that corporal punishment might be inflicted for a first offence. Obviously in that state of things there is a great balance of opinion; and just because this is not a Party Bill but a Bill in which <ob/>lament and all its members are co-operating, to whatever Party they belong, the Government took the line&#x2014;I think one which will commend itself to your
<col>1186</col>
Lordships&#x2014;of leaving a certain number of these questions open questions. No Party Whips were used in respect of them. As regards corporal punishment for a first offence some of my colleagues took one view and some the other. We propose to leave that and other questions open questions here for your Lordships as a whole to decide, and all that it is necessary for anybody speaking on the subject to do is, I think, to indicate his own view, carefully prefacing what he says with the statement that he speaks only for himself.<lb/>
In this matter you have to balance the advantages and disadvantages judged from the public interest, and I think from the point of view of the public interest it is to the advantage of the State that corporal punishment should be capable of being administered for a first offence. I am speaking for myself individually and not for my colleagues. But we have thought it right to put down an Amendment which stands in my name&#x2014;I am not bound to that Amendment individually&#x2014;which raises the point so that your Lordships can express your opinion upon it. Of course, it may be said that there is a risk in the case of a first offence of a mistake being made, but when you come to look into the matter I do not think that is a real risk. To begin with, the defendant cannot be tried and sentenced by a magistrate to this punishment. It must be after conviction by a jury or by a Court of Quarter Sessions, and my noble and learned friend the Lord Chief Justice, who has had great experience in this matter, assures me that under the provisions of the Bill there is no risk of the punishment being inflicted by an incompetent tribunal. In the second place, no Court will administer the punishment of whipping or flogging except upon a very clear case, and I do not think the risk of the first offender suffering is one with which we need trouble ourselves. On the other hand, the police inform me that in a case of this kind second convictions are very rare, and therefore if you want to prevent the great mass of cases which arise in connection with this subject it is the first offence you have to deter. With a punishment of this kind it is believed that there will be very little of this trade left to go on in the future.<lb/>
So much for the first controversial point in the Bill. I now come to the second&#x2014;namely, the power of summary arrest.
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0598"/>
<col>1187</col>
I am informed of cases in which a man, seen and suspected on board a steamer at a port whence he was sailing for foreign parts accompanied by one or more of these girls of whom he was taking charge, has been believed with excellent reason by the police authorities to be about to take these girls to foreign parts as a procurer, and yet there was no power to arrest him summarily, for before the proper information could be sworn and a warrant obtained the man is off with his victims. It is undesirable that the law should remain in that position. There are many of these cases which you can only get at effectively if you possess the power of summary arrest, and therefore there is a strong feeling that the power of summary arrest should be in the Bill. The power of summary arrest is not as uncommon a power as people suppose. The Metropolitan Police possess it under the Metropolitan Police Act for a considerable list of offences, and it is also possessed by the rest of the Police Force of this country for many offences, and I see no reason why it should not exist for this particular class of offence with which we are now concerned.<lb/>
Then it is said that this power of summary arrest ought to be exercised only by specially detailed Police officers of the rank of sergeant. That sounds very well, but when an Amendment was temporarily accepted in the other House to that effect, what was overlooked was that in the provinces it is not possible to detail constables of the rank of sergeant who are capable of being effectively at work. What you could do in London you could not do there. The result was that by very general assent the power of summary arrest was given to the Police. After all our Police generally are a pretty careful body, and, although miscarriages do at times occur, a mistaken arrest occasionally cannot weigh for a moment against the enormous advantage which it will be if the person who is practising this crime can be taken in the very act and prevented from proceeding further and brought to summary justice. I have spoken of these two controversial points, and now I wish to call your Lordships' attention, very briefly, to what is in the Bill. There are six effective clauses. The first clause is that giving power to arrest without warrant persons offending against the Act of 1885, which deals with the offence of procuration.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1188</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03442"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: Section 2 of that Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03443"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Yes, Section 2, which deals with the offence of procuration. Procuration is defined in Section 2 of the Act of 1885 thus&#x2014;
<quote>"Any person who&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>"(1) procures or attempts to procure any girl or woman under 21 years of age, not being a common prostitute or of known immoral character, to have unlawful carnal connexion, either within or without the Queen's Dominions, with any other person or persons; or</li>
<li>"(2) procures or attempts to procure any woman or girl to become, either within or without the Queen's Dominions, a common prostitute; or</li>
<li>"(3) procures or attempts to procure any woman or girl to leave the United Kingdom with intent that she may become an inmate of a brothel elsewhere; or</li>
<li>"(4) procures or attempts to procure any woman or girl to leave her usual place of abode in the United Kingdom (such place not being a brothel) with intent that she may for the purpose of prostitution become an inmate of a brothel within or without the Queen's Dominions</li></ol>
shall be guilty of a misdemeanour, and being convicted thereof shall be liable at the discretion of the Court to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years with or without hard labour."</quote>
That section, which on the whole has worked well, is not altogether free from defects. The Bill, dealing with it, first of all gives power to take into custody without warrant any person whom the constable shall have good cause to suspect is committing or attempting to commit an offence of this kind. The second clause enables the Court, in addition to any term of imprisonment awarded, to sentence the prisoner to be once privately whipped, and the number of strokes and the instrument with which they shall be inflicted shall be specified by the Court in the sentence. The third clause amends the other section of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1885, which relates to brothels, by inserting after the word "occupier" the words "person in charge." The reason for that is that the occupier is often a person very difficult to get at, and the words "person in charge" are inserted with a view to getting at the person&#x2014;it may be the manager, it may be the head waiter&#x2014;who is in practical control of the establishment, whatever it may be, and who is the real person who is supervising the conduct of the brothel. Then there is in that clause a provision as to penalties, with which I need not trouble your Lordships at this stage.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0599"/>
<col>1189</col>
The fourth clause is an important one. There is no doubt, I am afraid, that there are a certain number of owners of property in great cities, and London is by no means an exception, who let their houses carelessly, to put it lightly, knowing that they will get an increased rent if they do not inquire too closely how the premises will be used. Of course, we do not want to put anybody who tries to get proper tenants and to do his duty in an unpleasant and false position. What we want to get at is the landlord who lets his premises with a knowledge, or under circumstances which ought to give him that knowledge, that the premises will be used as a brothel. Consequently it is said that on the conviction of the occupier the landlord should be entitled to determine the lease. If he does not put an end to the lease but allows the lease to go on without taking steps to prevent the offence being continued, and it goes on, he is to be taken to have abetted the commission of the offence and is to be liable to penalties accordingly. I think that is a necessary provision having regard to what the Police inform us goes on in London and large cities, and I do not think it is a provision which puts in jeopardy anybody who takes even the most ordinary care of his property. It applies only after there has been a conviction for using the place as a brothel, and the landlord is given the power of putting an end to the tenancy, and if he does not do so and allows things to go on and knowingly permits the old state of things to continue I think it is quite reasonable that he should be taken to be cognisant of the offence that is going on there and made responsible accordingly.<lb/>
The only other clause to which I need call attention is Clause 6, which deals with the Vagrancy Act, 1898, and the Immoral Traffic (Scotland) Act, 1902. Those are Acts which deal with persons who knowingly live wholly on the earnings by prostitution of some other persons. The words are defective because they do not cover the case of persons who live in part on the earnings of prostitution, and they are still more defective because they apply only to male persons. The purpose of this clause is to make sure that, first of all, everybody who lives wholly or in part on the earnings of the prostitution of another person shall be deemed to commit an offence; and, secondly, to make sure that women, who are just as bad offenders as men, should come within the meshes of the law just as much
<col>1190</col>
as men. I repeat that there is no question of administering, flogging to women. To get these things right involves an Amendment in the Bill as it comes to this House, and that Amendment we propose to make. The effect of it would be that the law will be strengthened not only as regards those persons but as regards those who frequent the streets inciting to the commission of unnatural vice, of whom I am sorry to say there are a great many still in great towns. It is proposed to strengthen the law and the punishment with regard to these persons.<lb/>
I have told your Lordships the scheme of the Bill and its contents, and the reasons why it has been drafted in its present form. This Bill owes its origin not to any one Party. It was brought in this year by Mr. Arthur Lee, a member of the Opposition, and it was only when it was felt that it needed a helping hand that the Government came upon the scene and put Government time and Government machinery at his disposal. His Bill was the same as the Bill introduced in a previous session by another Unionist Member, and it is a Bill which represents the views of Members on the other side who have introduced measures for the same purpose. The Bill is the outcome of negotiations which have taken place between the societies for the suppression of these evils and the Home Office, and the laudable efforts of Mr. Lee and those who are working with him meet with the complete approval of the Government, who have taken up the Bill and propose to give it every assistance they can. That is why we have assumed direct and immediate responsibility for it in this House. But the fact remains that it is not a Party measure, and therefore we do not propose to treat the Amendments as Party Amendments. We propose to ask the House to decide on what is a matter for the House as a whole and not for any particular Party in it. I therefore propose to put down the Amendments not before Monday so as to allow time for those who have views on the subject of what the Amendments ought to be or how far they ought to go to state those views.<lb/>
We want as little controversy as possible if this Bill should be fortunate enough to pass your Lordships' House and go back to another place. Still, Amendments will be necessary in Clause 6&#x2014;otherwise women will escape altogether; and there are certain pledges which were given in the
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0600"/>
<col>1191</col>
House of Commons to put the drafting into better shape which ought to be, if possible, carried out. I am not afraid of putting this Bill into proper shape. I do not believe when its provisions are understood that it will give rise anywhere to much controversy. The Amendments will be put down and your Lordships will have adequate time to consider them, and then I hope that if this Bill is so fortunate as to secure a Second Reading we shall be in a position to part with it after having made it as good and effective a measure as the magnitude of the evil which it is designed to redress requires. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03444">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>The Lord Chancellor.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03445"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, your Lordships have listened to a speech from the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack, a speech of characteristic weight and lucidity, upon a very grave subject. I have satisfaction, and I am sure your Lordships have satisfaction, in knowing that there is no indication of any attempt in this House to deny a Second Reading to this measure. Had it been otherwise I am quite sure that an effort would have been made on every side to render the defeat of the Bill impossible. I can speak at all events for those who sit ordinarily on the Episcopal Bench. Bishops, in the matter of Parliamentary procedure, are at a grave disadvantage as compared with many of your Lordships. Their daily duties far away from London are so onerous, and engagements have to be made so long beforehand that on this occasion, for example, Bishop after Bishop has told me that he had arranged to be here last night when this Bill was down for Second Reading but that it was simply impossible to alter his arrangements at a few hours' notice to be here to-day. That explains the absence this evening of many Bishops, though there would certainly have been more present if there had been any risk of opposition to the Second Reading of this Bill.<lb/>
The Lord Chancellor has given reasons why this Bill is necessary and has touched upon the horrors of a great wrong. It is a strange, I think a terrible thing, that in the year 1912 such a Bill as this should be needed at all. I sometimes wonder what those looking at the history of our time fifty years hence, or 100 years hence, will say
<col>1192</col>
or think about the records which have sprung to light as to the evils which we are now endeavouring by this Bill in some measure to counteract or prevent. I hope that by that time such things will have come to seem almost unbelievable. I believe that if we now were reading the records of these matters and found that what we were learning about was what had happened, say, in the days of Charles II, we should have said that it was an additional example of how moral bonds and the bonds of even decency had been relaxed at that time in a way which seemed almost incredible now. Yet these are the facts about what is happening in England to-day. Whatever else can be urged on this matter, I am quite certain that no man who has honestly and carefully studied the subject will deny the existence of the wrongs which this Bill sets itself to mend. It is quite possible that there may have been exaggeration on the part of individual speakers as regards either the extent of the evil or some particular instance connected with it. Is it any wonder that it should be so when we think of the spirit that is aroused in those who take this matter in hand? There is aroused an indignation against the wrong itself and against our impotence in dealing with it.<lb/>
But after you have made any allowance you will for occasional exaggeration in this matter, I say deliberately, as one who has steadily studied this subject, that no man who will give that attention to it, if he looks at the matter quietly, impartially, and thoroughly, can deny the facts which have been brought to light, not on the evidence of enthusiastic workers only, but on the calmer evidence of Police authorities, of the Consuls at the ports abroad and at home, of the managers and leaders of railway and steamboat communication, and of other people who have no enthusiasms on the subject, but whose blood has been stirred by the sights they have seen or the records which they have been obliged to investigate. It is absolutely beyond doubt that at this present time there exists in England as well as elsewhere a systematic and organised system of abducting or procuring girls, not necessarily by force&#x2014;though sometimes I am not prepared to deny that there is even that&#x2014;but by lying representations and false inducements, to enter in some great city a life to which, as the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack said,
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0601"/>
<col>1193</col>
an early death would be ten times preferable. I believe that every member of this House agrees that scoundrels of that sort are so intolerable a pest on society that no effort should be spared, no weapon should be lacking, no machinery should be idle which is capable of punishing them, of thwarting their villainy, and, as a detriment to others, of punishing them as they deserve. If we can in any way bring it about by what we are now doing, this thing, for which "devilish" is not too strong a word, has got to be stopped. Therefore we want this Bill.<lb/>
The Bill has had a not altogether peaceful or easy course in another place. I confess that I listened to-night with a certain tremor of apprehension to what the Lord Chancellor told us as to the Amendments which it might be necessary for him to move in the matter. Roughly drafted, ineffective in some portion of some of its clauses the words may be, but I would sooner have the Bill as it is with all its faults than run any risk of losing it. Therefore if there be the smallest peril of that, I would rather that we did not pass any Amendments but take the Bill as it is. However, if Amendments proceed from the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack I presume we may take it to mean this, that if such Amendments are introduced into the Bill in this House the Government will hold themselves enduringly responsible for seeing that it passes through the other House not weakened in any measure or degree by discussions which may be caused by any of those Amendments.<lb/>
I think some confusion in this matter has arisen from a notion that those who promote this measure are trying somehow or other to, if we may use the phrase, cover the whole ground and deal with or redress the vice of immorality generally. As the Lord Chancellor has shown, there is no such idea or purpose in this Bill. Some of us are day by day engaged in that campaign, but it is by other methods than Acts of Parliament. We are fighting that hideous wrong by endeavouring to raise the standard of honour, by appealing to the chivalry of manhood, by denouncing the cowardly cruelty of this vice in all its forms, and in another way&#x2014;and the point is of real importance&#x2014;by seeking so to raise the standard of women's wage as to check one portion of this evil at its source. We
<col>1194</col>
apply to these efforts the highest and the most sacred sanctions that be know. Our efforts are miserably ineffective, and the fault is doubtless in large measure our own; but those efforts, my Lords, are quite different from these. We are here trying to deal by legisiative enactment with a specific crime which we endeavour to meet by specific means. These means, as I understand, and as I think the Lord Chancellor has pointed out, are two-fold. In the first place, it is certain that the Police and well-disposed officers of our travelling agencies to whom I have referred, sometimes even magistrates themselves, have to look on almost helplessly, perhaps quite helplessly, at this organised wrong because of the limited means we at present possess of investigation or of arrest, and this in a matter where the very nature of the crime renders prompt action the only possible means of stopping it.<lb/>
It would be quite easy to harrow your Lordships with details of indisputable facts such as those to which the Lord Chancellor just alluded, but I deliberately abstain. It is not needed. I believe your Lordships will be unanimously of opinion that the Police must have increased powers of speedy arrest in these matters. Then, my Lords, some parts of the wrong in its initial stage are undoubtedly facilitated by encumbrances and difficulties which surround questions of the control and ownership of the premises which are used. That is a question of supreme difficulty if we are to make sure, as we ought to try to make sure, that the penalty shall fall on the right and not on the wrong shoulders. But this Bill does make some such endeavour, and we hope it may have the result we desire.<lb/>
Then the second object of the Bill is to increase the punishment of those who have been found thus vilely guilty. A fine is inoperative. The Lord Chancellor has told your Lordships that the gain is too great, the risk is one easily worth running, and the fine is a comparatively small matter. Even short imprisonment is, from the point of view of these wretched men and women, well worth risking considering the profits that are to be made; and so we want power to increase the punishment, to increase the imprisonment, and in extreme cases to use on these degraded and degrading villains the only
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0602"/>
<col>1195</col>
argument which will really tell with them&#x2014;the lash. We want to do that, my Lords, not as an act of vindictive kind but as a deterrent to others who may be tempted to a like offence. The thing is not to work automatically, and a man is not <i>ipso facto</i> on conviction to be condemned to the lash. We leave the power with the Judge, and we believe that the power would only be exercised in cases where the wrong was of so terrible a sort that there could be no question as to that being the right mode of deterring other offenders from the like.<lb/>
There are, I venture to believe&#x2014;I speak in the presence of noble and learned Lords, or one at least familiar with this subject&#x2014;cases which, if your Lordships had the painful experience of going through them in detail, you would find to be so horrible in their character that you would not shrink for a moment in feeling that this is the only mode with which they can be properly dealt. I certainly am no supporter of extreme punishments as a part of our ordinary system in the prevention of crime and the remedy of wrong doing. I have rejoiced to take part in measures of prison and other reform which are all tending in the opposite direction. I want our punishments to be ameliorative as well as punitive. But we have here a specific form of the vilest kind of evil, not the evil to which a poor man may be tempted for lack of means, sheer poverty, which drives him into crime, not a thing which is done in a moment of passion for which a man may be sorry the moment it is over, but something which is deliberate and cunning and absolutely heartless, and I at least feel, without the least hesitation, that a man who enters through callous greed into a cursed villainy of this kind ought to be treated in a manner which alone we feel quite certain will have the sort of deterrent effect that we desire.<lb/>
I have heard in the discussions that have taken place about this a good deal of doubt thrown in some quarters upon the actual deterrent effect of the use of the lash. I should like to read to your Lordships&#x2014;I could give many examples&#x2014;a portion of a letter from a man of wide knowledge both as a parish priest and as a prison chaplain. He happens at present to combine the two functions in a large town. You will notice that his letter refers to the deterrent effect, not as regards the white
<col>1196</col>
slave traffic, but the kindred form of evil which is more common in some of our great cities. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"We have had some experience of the value of flogging. There is little of the white slave traffic, but there are many brothels. Three years ago many of these were kept in the lower parts of the town by bullies. There were fifteen men in prison at the same time for living on the proceeds of the earnings of prostitutes; imprisonment had no effect. About three years ago the Recorder used the power he had under the Vagrancy Act and ordered three men to be birched as incorrigible rogues. The sensation this caused was very great; many of the bullies left the town at once, others broke up their brothels and looked for work. Consternation is hardly a strong enough word to describe the effect this sentence had among the men engaged in this trade. Some tell me that there are now practically no bullies in the town. I think that this is an over-statement, but there is no doubt that the improvement is very great. Two cases of the effect of the mere threat of whipping came directly under my notice through visiting the prison as chaplain. In one case the man was remanded for living on the proceeds. He was a hardened scoundrel, and told me he didn't care what his imprisonment was. I was thoroughly angry with the man, and told him he might be birched. I have rarely seen a man change his behaviour so suddenly. He turned white and said, 'My God, you don't think they will do that to me?' It reads rather dramatic, but the incident is quite true. The other instance was of a man at the end of a term of imprisonment for the same offence. He told me he was going to give up the old life and leave the town&#x2014;'It isn't worth it now they have started flogging,' or some such words. These men are, of course, of a rougher type than the ordinary white slave trafficker, but probably not so devilish."</quote>
I could easily multiply that kind of evidence but I do not think it is wanted, because I venture to believe your Lordships will think that the use of that form of punishment is justifiable and more than justifiable if we are to deter men from evils of this coarse and brutal kind. The purpose of our Bill is to catch these scoundrels and to give power so to punish them as to act as a deterrent to others.<lb/>
What are the objections that have been raised to it either in Parliament or outside? Some of you have heard the expression used that this is sentimental legislation. I can only believe, I rather say I only hope, that the man or woman who uses that phrase has not closely studied the facts, so utterly inapplicable is it to what we are endeavouring to do by a practical measure for dealing specifically with a specific wrong. What is much more common is to hear it said, with regard to flogging at all events, Do take care; an innocent man might be convicted. I speak in the presence of those who are far better able
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0603"/>
<col>1197</col>
to judge as to the degree of probability of such a thing. I should imagine with regard to this kind of offence that it was improbable in the very highest degree; but about that others know more than I. But grant that it is conceivable that Once in a generation some man who was innocent might be mistakenly accused, might be mistakenly arrested, might be mistakenly convicted, what are you to argue? How does it run on? For fear that that might happen let this cursed thing go on? Is that the argument? Is it, Give no increased power, let these innocent girls run that awful risk, if need be, but preserve us men at any rate from a conceivable danger that some innocent man might some day be arrested. I am prepared to go without hesitation as far as to say that even if the risk were greater than I believe it to be&#x2014;for I imagine it is quite infinitesimal&#x2014;that kind of argument is unworthy of our manhood, and that if there be a conceivable risk, In Heaven's name let us run it. I trust we shall hear no more of the argument that because such a thing is just conceivable therefore we are helpless to move in the direction that we want. The evil is there, it is certain, it is specific. We know now how, in some measure at least&#x2014;we know it by the testimony of all those who understand the subject best&#x2014;we could meet it, and it is our clear duty, I venture to say it is our solemn and sacred duty, to use that power to the uttermost.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03446"><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Bill which we are discussing this afternoon is one on which I hope we are all agreed, and therefore it is not necessary to say very much about it. I do, however, want in a very few words to express my deep gratitude to His Majesty's Government for having at last taken up this question. The changes in the law which the Bill will bring about have been urgently demanded for a great many years by those who are concerned in trying to remove the blackest stain from the history of civilisation. Of all the evils which attach to civilised society the most detestable in its character and the most pitiable in its consequences is that which is known as the white slave traffic, and I agree with the most rev. Primate who has just spoken that it is almost inconceivable that this particular trade should be as prevalent as we know it to be at the present time&#x2014;inconceivable, too, because, in regard to its worst features at all events, it is pre-
<col>1198</col>
ventable, is removable, if only sufficient powers existed in the hands of those who are engaged in suppressing it. Hitherto those powers have been insufficient, and this Bill is required in order to place increased power in the hands of the Police who have to deal with the evil. It has been demanded a great many times. On a number of occasions this Bill has been brought up in the House of Commons and failed to get beyond the First Reading stage, and it is only because the agitation in the country this year became so strong that the Government at last felt it their duty to take up the question, and in doing so they have earned the gratitude of all those who realise the gravity of the evil with which they are seeking to deal.<lb/>
I said just now that the worst features of this particular traffic were removable. Lest there should be any misapprehension on the subject may I say one word as to what this Bill does and what it does not do. Immorality is not a crime in the eyes of the law, prostitution is not a crime in the eyes of the law, and this Bill does not seek to suppress either the one or the other. It makes no new offences, it establishes no new principle of law. It merely seeks to amend in certain respects the law as it exists to-day. There are three things which are crimes at Jaw with which the law to-day endeavours to deal, and it is only in respect of those three things that this Bill deals. The first of these is the procuring by deceit and false pretences and against their will of innocent girls for the purpose of immorality. The second is the crime of living on the earnings of prostitution. With the immoral man and the immoral woman the law is not concerned. But with the procurer, the kidnapper, the <i>souteneur,</i> the trafficker in human life, the person, man or woman, who fattens on the proceeds and earnings of another's degradation&#x2014;with those persons the law fortunately is concerned. Those persons are the lowest, meanest, the most cold-blooded class amongst the criminals in any country. They ought to be exterminated, and it is with the object of exterminating them that this Bill has been introduced, and if any one says such persons and such crimes are necessary to society or cannot be suppressed by law I say the person who will say that does not deserve to exercise the rights of citizenship in a Christian civilised State.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0604"/>
<col>1199</col>
Clauses 1 and 6 are the clauses of this Bill which deal with these two classes, and it is not necessary to add anything to what has been said about them. Hitherto the law has been inadequate in this respect, that although the nature of these offences is known to the Police, although pitiable stories and hundreds of pitiable cases of kidnapping are brought to their knowledge, and although men and women who are permanently engaged in this odious trade are known to them personally, they are at the present moment powerless to deal effectively with the evil. As has already been pointed out they cannot arrest without a warrant, and by the time the warrant is obtained it is already too late; the traffickers with their victims have passed out of the country, and the former are already beyond the reach of punishment, the latter beyond the reach of redemption. Clause 1 of this Bill gives this power of summary arrest on suspicion that an offence is about to be committed.<lb/>
The noble and learned Viscount who introduced the Bill spoke of this power of summary arrest as a matter of controversy. It is strange that it should be so. But as it is a matter of controversy it is necessary to repeat again that this power already exists with regard to a number of offences which, in comparison with what we are dealing with under this Bill, are comparatively trivial and insignificant. It exists, for instance, in cases of pocket-picking, petty larceny, and poaching. I ask if it be right to arrest a person who is suspected to be about to steal a purse or pick a pocket, how can it be denied that it is right to arrest a person who is suspected to be about to steal a woman? If it is right in such trivial cases as those of persons loitering about a wood in search of game it should surely apply to persons loitering about a railway station, or a quay, or a harbour, in search of their human quarry. Inasmuch as these powers exist to-day in respect of quite trivial matters it is strange that it should be a subject of controversy that they should be extended to deal with this appalling evil.<lb/>
The third offence with which the law deals to-day and which this Bill seeks to amend is the crime of keeping brothels or disorderly houses. This particular offence is one which arouses very different feelings from those as to which I have
<col>1200</col>
hitherto spoken; but since it is a crime at law, since the law does seek to deal with it, I claim that the law should be made effective, because if the law is not effective for the purpose for which it is passed it ought to be amended or removed from the Statute-book. In this particular case the law is not effective to-day, and I would quote to your Lordships one instance of the insufficiency of the law in its application to this particular offence. A man was arrested, tried, convicted, and imprisoned for the offence of keeping a brothel. The trade was a lucrative trade to him; he could not afford to forego the proceeds of it even while he was in prison, and he therefore employed another person to take charge of this lucrative business of his while he was in prison. The man so employed carried it on for his friend who was serving a term of imprisonment for this particular offence, and when that man came out of prison he said to the Police, "You have taught me something I did not know before"; and as a result of this experience he immediately opened two other large establishments in the neighbourhood and placed two persons in charge of them to carry them on just as his old business had been carried on while he was in prison. Therefore I say the law is not effective to-day for dealing with this particular offence, and it is the object of Clause 3 of this Bill to make the provision in the Act of 1885 effective by adding the words "or person in charge" to those already recognised by the law&#x2014;namely, the proprietors, lessees, and managers.<lb/>
In conclusion I want to say a word about Clause 2, which deals with the penalties for procurers. I say it not because I want to add anything to what has been said by the two previous speakers, but because on this question I disagree with them. But even if I thought myself in a minority of one in this House I still feel bound to say that I regret the introduction of the penalty of flogging into this Bill. I say so not&#x2014;I am sure it will be believed&#x2014;out of any sympathy for the offenders to whom it is to be applied, because if flogging is a legitimate and desirable form of punishment then there is no class to whom it could be more properly applied and no class which is more richly deserving of the punishment than the cruel and mean wretches who drive women into a life of prostitution and live upon their earnings. I deplore it
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0605"/>
<col>1201</col>
because I do not think it is in itself a desirable form of punishment, and in defence of my view I will only use one argument. The noble and learned Viscount who introduced the Bill said, and said rightly, that the public sense of the community would not stand the application of this punishment to women. Well, my Lords, if it is justified on the ground of the enormity of the offence or on the ground of its effectiveness as a deterrent, every argument so justifying it would justify its infliction in the case of women. I myself feel that a woman who procures another of her sex and brings her into this life is even more detestable than a man who does a similar thing, because she, at least, ought to have some knowledge of the consequences upon her sex. Therefore I say that every argument which would justify flogging in the case of a man would justify it in the case of a woman, and, equally so, every argument which would justify it on the grounds of its deterrent effect m the case of a man would justify it in the case of a woman. I hold that every reason which has been brought forward to forbid its application in the case of a woman ought also to forbid its application in the case of a man. I am quite aware that in saying this I may be accused of maudling sentimentality&#x2014;not in this House, because none of your Lordships would apply those particular words, but these have been the epithets applied to those who hold the views which I hold. But in my case it is not a matter of sentiment at all. I believe that the punishment of flogging is not a punishment which ought to form part of our Penal Code for any offence.<lb/>
As I say, I have no pity for these particular people, and I would apply, if I had my way, quite a different treatment and a treatment which, in my opinion, would be much more deterrent in its effect and much more consistent with the principles of a sound Penal Code, and, moreover, applicable both to women and to men; but unfortunately it is a proposal which would probably shock much more greatly the public opinion of the country than the penalty of flogging. The treatment I would mete out, my Lords, would be this&#x2014;to place upon those persons an indelible mark which they would bear as a symbol of the calling they have undertaken. I would say to them, "You have deliberately chosen this odious trade; then you shall bear upon yourselves the mark of that
<col>1202</col>
trade, a mark which, when you approach your victims, shall scream out a word of warning to them as to the intentions which are in your mind." But I say no more upon that particular point because I agree with the most rev. Primate that this Bill is so valuable even as it stands that I would not risk endangering its passage into law by proposing any change which might risk its passing. We have waited a long time for this Bill. It represents an irreducible minimum, and I sincerely trust your Lordships will pass it substantially as it stands. I feel that in its present form, even with certain shortcomings, it will place in the hands of the Police a weapon which will make this calling so hazardous that even those who are most careless of the consequences and of the miseries which it entails, and even those who are most greedy for the large profits which undoubtedly are to be made out of it, will hesitate before they embark upon it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03447"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships will probably expect that I should say something upon the Second Reading of this Bill, not only because I have considerable experience as a Judge with reference to some of its provisions and the provisions which it amends, but also on personal grounds, because I had the honour of conducting the Act of 1885 through the House of Commons. It was the first Bill that I had to deal with as Attorney-General, and I have, of course, watched carefully its working and the working of kindred measures which have been passed since. I think it right to utter one word of warning. This debate has rather proceeded upon the lines that nothing whatever has been done since the year 1885. I quite agree that from the point of strengthening the particular provisions of the Act of 1885 nothing has been done, but it is quite unnecessary for me to remind your Lordships that in the Acts for the prevention of cruelty to children and other Acts that have been passed at various times&#x2014;in the year 1889, and the year 1904, and the year 1908&#x2014;there are a number of clauses touching kindred offences which have materially strengthened the law; and therefore it is right that this Bill should come forward as dealing with particular crimes of that character which have not formed the subject of consideration as much as other offences against women and children.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0606"/>
<col>1203</col>
The noble Earl who has just spoken was quite right in saying that many attempts have been made before to deal with this particular evil, though not so strenuously to deal with it as it has been dealt with on this occasion. It is quite unnecessary for me to occupy your Lordships' time at any length because the speech of my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor and the speech of the most rev. Primate have covered the ground, and except upon one point, as to which I will say a word in a moment, there has not been any expression of dissentient opinion. The object of the first clause of this Bill is not for the punishment but for the prevention of crime. It is a clause which is to save the victims from becoming the subject of the cruelty, the abominable wickedness, to which they are subjected by those who procure them for this vile traffic. It is quite right to say that where an offence is committed in the particular case of a felony or misdemeanour the Police have a right to arrest. That is not the effect of the clause. The effect of the first clause is to stop the attempt&#x2014;that is to say, to prevent the evil while at the same time you may be able to punish the offender.<lb/>
I no more than the most rev. Primate wish to harrow your Lordships with details of crimes which have come within my personal knowledge or that I have read of in the literature dealing with this matter, but it is the fact that in the case of the most successful of the offenders it is practically impossible to stop the trade unless you have the power to arrest. Take the case which is most common&#x2014;of girls being induced to come up to London on a statement that they are going to get employment, to be met at a railway station by a woman who will take them off to some place, and, not infrequently, within twelve hours those girls are on a steamer and out of this country. Therefore it is quite impossible to suggest that the power to go and get a warrant is effective for the purpose of preventing that class of traffic. Clause 1 of this Bill will be most valuable, because offenders who carry on this trade are known to the Police, and disappear only from time to time for a period of weeks or months when they have taken their victims abroad, and not infrequently they come back and are traced and are seen to be at the old game again. That is what has been noted by the Police. Therefore what is absolutely necessary to make the
<col>1204</col>
Police protection for these poor girls effective is to give the Police the power of arrest at once when they see the man about the haunts where he has been before. It is very often not difficult to obtain evidence if there is the power of immediate action when they are again at their old haunts and trade. All I say is that I believe this clause which will give a constable power to arrest without a warrant a person whom he has good reason to suspect is committing or is attempting to commit an offence of this kind would be found most valuable.<lb/>
I now come to the matter which forms the subject of the second clause. The noble Earl who has just spoken most eloquently and with great feeling desires to take us back some four or five centuries. He desires that we should restore the law of branding, and that in addition to punishing the man by great physical pain there should remain upon him for ever&#x2014;I suppose upon his forehead, because I cannot imagine where else it would be visible to the intended victim&#x2014;the letter "P," I suppose it would be. The noble Earl does not hesitate to recommend it. I am afraid I could not go into the Lobby with the noble Earl in support of such a punishment as that. I do hope that even for these wretched beings there is some chance of amending their lives, and I do not see why they should carry the brand upon their foreheads when they have amended their ways. That is a little practical difficulty in the just application of such punishment.<lb/>
But, my Lords, I do want to say a word or two on this question of whipping. I have been a Judge now for twelve years and have tried a great many criminal eases, and during that time I have never myself inflicted the punishment of flogging. I therefore do not speak on this matter as one who is at all given to deal with this punishment. I have had representations, I should think dozens of representations, from Grand Juries who have had before them cases of this and a kindred kind&#x2014;that is to say, crimes against women and children&#x2014;suggesting to me that there ought to be an increase of punishment, and that for these offences against women and little children flogging ought to be a part of our Criminal law. This is not in any way a new subject or a new idea. With reference to the deterrent effect, not
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0607"/>
<col>1205</col>
only could I endorse exactly what the most rev. Primate said with regard to the effect of it on prisoners&#x2014;I happen to have had experience of it myself in visiting prisons&#x2014;but I have heard of criminals who howled even at the sentence being inflicted upon them weeks before it was actually carried out. I have also spoken to many prison officials and warders and people of that kind, and with regard to its being a deterrent nobody who has any experience of it can have any doubt. With great respect to the noble Earl, if he had had any experience of the working of it I think he would agree with what I have said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03448"><member>THE EARL OF LYTTON</member><membercontribution>: I never denied its deterrent effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03449"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: Quite so; but still it would not have as deterrent an effect as the "P" upon the forehead. I have served a great many times in the Court of Criminal Appeal and the sentence that is most appealed against is the sentence of flogging, and I do not think if it had not terrors for the criminal we should hear so much about it. But there is one problem in this case that has not been touched upon by the Lord Chancellor or the most rev. Primate or by my noble friend Lord Lytton behind me, and that is this&#x2014;that in many of these cases, speaking from knowledge of cases I have tried and heard on appeal, great cruelty is inflicted on these poor girls. I have known instances proved in evidence of their being beaten and injured and cruelly treated because they attempted to resist the carrying on of this life; and I do say, all sentiment apart, it does seem to me that there ought to be some sympathy for those who suffer physically as well as for those who inflict these crimes and sufferings. I do not know why, when the criminal who has been brutally cruel to some poor girl, when he has beaten her to force her to go out and earn these earnings or sometimes when she has returned wounded and half starved has beaten her again because she has not brought back enough&#x2014;I do not know why we should have so much sympathy for the man who has done this and so little for the poor person who has been the sufferer at his hands. I assure your Lordships I would not in this House tell of the horrible evidence which has been given before me, and which I have had to read in trials before other Judges, as to cruelties inflicted
<col>1206</col>
upon girls who get into the hands of these procurers. I only say that because, averse as I am to extending the punishment of whipping, if there is an offence for which it ought to be inflicted it is upon such brutes as the men who are carrying on this traffic. If we are going to amend the Bill, I would point out that for some reason or another the Bill with regard to these offences deprives the Court of the power given tinder the Vagrancy Act of punishing the offender as an incorrigible rogue, which is the greatest distinction that can be acquired in the criminal world. But this Bill proposes that the persons offending should not be punished as incorrigible rogues. I think there must be some mistake, and if we me going to amend the Bill that is a matter which, in my opinion, should be put right.<lb/>
Now with regard to the amendment of the law applying to brothels. This Bill will do more to stop brothels than all the Acts that have been passed. It is the fact that this lucrative trade is generally carried on by managers, women as well as men, who are not the occupiers in law of the house but who are merely put in to manage. They are not the tenants and they are not the owners, and though it seems a very small amendment to treat the person in charge as a person who can be punished, it is an amendment which will strengthen the hands of the Police very materially. Therefore I welcome the amendment of the law which will cover the person in charge as well as the occupier. In the same way the increased punishments for keeping brothels are most desirable amendments of the law. That leads me to endorse what was said by my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack with reference to punishment by fine. A fine is no deterrent to these people bearing in mind the enormous amount of money they derive from the trade. It is very much the same as what happens in the case of betting prosecutions. They pay the fine readily, and go out of Court and start offending in the same way again immediately. Therefore I am in favour of making the person in charge amenable to the law, and also that there should be severe punishment.<lb/>
The clause with regard to the landlord taking more care about the house will be very useful, but I am a little doubtful whether the Bill in this respect does not, perhaps, go a little too far, because it will
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0608"/>
<col>1207</col>
be so difficult to prove that the landlord has allowed it to go on, or has not turned out the tenant, or has not taken steps to prevent the brothel being kept. I do not know that we can do much at the present stage, but I think the point must be considered. There is a matter to be considered also in the last clause of the Bill. I will not call it a slip, but, curiously enough, this is a slip which I made in the House of Commons some fourteen years ago. This Bill repeats in terms the clause about a wife being called as a witness and not compellable to give evidence. This House decided&#x2014;I must not say wrongly, of course&#x2014;that the view we had all taken with regard to the law was erroneous and that a wife was not compellable to give evidence. I desire to say, with regard to these offences of procuration of girls and of keeping brothels, it is very important that the evidence of a wife should be compellable, because if a man is carrying on these practices there ought to be no cutting off the sources from which evidence could be obtained, and I would suggest to the Lord Chancellor that that simple Amendment might be made when we come to deal with that matter.<lb/>
I thank your Lordships for listening to me, and I hope that I have not merely gone over ground which has been travelled by other noble Lords. I have received many representations begging me to do what I can to get this Bill passed without Amendments, in order that there may be no question about its becoming law. I am sure His Majesty's Government will be as determined as the promoters of the Bill are to see that anything which is done to improve this Bill does not delay its passing, and I gather from the attitude taken up by my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack that His Majesty's Government practically tell us that they will see that if this Bill is only improved&#x2014;if I may use the expression&#x2014;it will be passed in the House of Commons with the Government behind it. It is, in my opinion, most important that the clause as to the power of arrest and possibly the power of punishment should be passed as soon as possible, because we want to do all we can to drive these procurers out of the country. But I for one would rather have this Bill as it stands, with, of course, the power of amending it in future sessions, than do anything that would imperil its passing by a single day.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1208</col>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03450"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is nobody who cannot realise that humanity, justice, civilisation, and every reason which prompts us to pass an Act of Parliament of this kind demands that this Bill should be passed without delay. I fully appreciate the reticence shown by noble Lords who have spoken this afternoon in disclosing the painful details of this terrible crime which we are trying to repress. It is quite easy to understand that in an Assembly of this kind it is not necessary to adduce details of that sort. But I do suggest to you, with great respect, that this debate will be read with the greatest interest by every procurer in the country, and I hope that it will have some kind of educative influence on the public opinion of this country as well. Public opinion has at last awakened to this evil in England, but it is exceedingly doubtful whether a great many people who ought to know do know the appalling things which are taking place. I have had&#x2014;I was going to say the advantage, but it is such a terrible document that I can hardly call it an advantage&#x2014;but I have had the opportunity of seeing an exceedingly rare book called the Report of the Vice Commission of Chicago. It is a very difficult document to get hold of because, as you will not be surprised to hear, every single available copy of it was bought up at once by those interested in this horrible traffic. Some extracts from that Report have been published in a small book which I hope will be in your Lordships' hands, not officially but privately, in a very few days, and I believe it will be read by the general public with the greatest interest. If the general public only knew the number of men who frequent these establishments in Chicago and have access to one girl in a single night I believe that even the most ardent promoter of this Bill would be astonished and appalled even more than he is at the present moment. But although the immorality and degradation and hideous part of this crime must appeal to everybody, the real thing that seems to me to be at the bottom of it is the greed for money. It is only another phase of that tendency of the money-grubbing classes in pursuit of the lust for gold. I was very glad to hear the most rev. Primate say that this question was connected with the low wages paid to women in this country. Without making the slightest suggestion&#x2014;Heaven forbid that anybody should do such a thing&#x0021;&#x2014;it must set us
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0609"/>
<col>1209</col>
thinking that any employer of labour in England who is responsible for and countenances giving his girl employees anything like a wage which might drive them to this terrible life is incurring an indirect responsibility of a very serious kind.<lb/>
That there is money to be made out of this trade is unfortunately only too true. In this same Report that I have seen it is also stated&#x2014;this is not idle hearsay which the man in the street tells you or that you hear at a London dinner party, but evidence from the Chicago Report&#x2014;that the profits from this trade during one single year in Chicago amounted to something like &#x00A3;3,000,000 sterling. There is no doubt at all that for England to assist, either directly or indirectly, in a traffic of this kind is a national disgrace. Public opinion in this country and every other consideration demands that it should be put a stop to forthwith, and I was delighted to hear that every speaker brought into hold relief the urgent necessity that this Bill, in spite of its being defective in some ways and perhaps not entirely exhaustive, should pass into law at the earliest possible opportunity. My information is&#x2014;and it tallies with what you would expect the wretches engaged in this traffic would do&#x2014;that pending the passing of this Bill the procurers are making a special effort to draw London, so to speak, in order that they may obtain during the short time which is going to elapse between now and the passing of this Bill as many victims as they possibly can.<lb/>
It is not an exaggeration to say that almost every hour, almost every day certainly, is of importance before this Bill passes into law. A special effort, as I have said, is being made by these dreadful people to recruit as many victims as they possibly can before this Bill is put upon the Statute-book. There are other reasons why it would be dangerous to insert into this Bill Amendments likely to jeopardise its passage in the House of Commons. I am not going to attempt to make any Party points on an important measure of this kind, but we cannot get rid of the knowledge that we have no power of insisting on our Amendments in the Lower House. But I shall oppose any Amendment&#x2014;because after the speech of the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack I do not think any one will say he has not already defeated his proposed Amendment&#x2014;I shall certainly oppose ally Amendment
<col>1210</col>
to make flogging the penalty for the second offence only. I hope that that part of the Bill will stand, and that we shall carry in this House by a large majority the defeat of any Amendment to postpone this punishment of the procurer until he has committed a second offence. I was glad to hear from the noble and learned Viscount exceedingly cogent reasons why this Amendment which is to be placed on the Paper in his name formally and technically for the consideration of this House should be defeated. I do not wish to speak in terms of contempt of these people, but I cannot imagine that there is any strong body of opinion in this country who thinks that a procurer ought to be allowed to commit his vile offence at least once before he is flogged. It is a frame of mind which is difficult to approach or to penetrate, and it is a frame of mind which I am absolutely certain is not in consonance with British instinct or with British taste or opinion. I ask any one of you to go out into the street and ask the first man you meet, having explained this properly to him, whether he thinks a man ought to commit this offence at least once without being flogged, and I have no doubt whatever what answer you will receive.<lb/>
We must recollect that we are now placing in the hands of the Police increased powers to arrest and get hold of the procurer. If the Police are fortunate enough under this Bill to get hold of any of the people who are plying this horrible trade it may be the first time that the man is unlucky enough to be caught but it will probably be about the five-hundredth time that he has done the thing for which he has been arrested. Therefore there will be no question at all in these cases of its being the first offence; and I say here and now that as an ordinary citizen I am perfectly ready in my own person to run the risk of being arrested as an innocent man&#x2014;and I believe that any of my friends will say the same&#x2014;sooner than that there should be the slightest chance of one of these miscreants getting a loophole for escaping from the punishment which they so richly deserve. I cannot understand how the idea that you will be running the risk of punishing an innocent person&#x2014;which is a terrible thing&#x2014;fits in with the idea that a criminal under this Bill should be branded. If you do happen to have the misfortune to flog an innocent person for a crime under this Bill he will not bear the mark
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0610"/>
<col>1211</col>
of it in a place which is conspicuous to his fellow-countrymen; but, on the other hand, if he is branded you then absolutely stamp him for life, or if you do not brand him so that he is absolutely stamped for life then you must brand him in a way that the punishment would not have the effect desired.<lb/>
I am grateful to your Lordships for permitting me to make these few remarks about this Bill with regard to which we all feel so deeply, and I sincerely hope that the Bill will pass substantially in the form in which it has been submitted to your Lordships. But because we pass this Bill do not let anybody think that we have washed our hands of the whole question of the white slave traffic. There is a great deal more that requires to be done, and that in a direction which is exceedingly important for British authority and British prestige in other parts of the Empire and in parts which come under the indirect as well as the direct influence of the British flag. Therefore it is my intention, if your Lordships will give me an opportunity at some future time, to introduce a Bill indicating a method by which it is proposed to further strengthen the law against those who are interested in the white slave traffic. I am not going to make a Second Reading speech about another Bill which is going to be introduced at some future date. I will only indicate one or two points which are not dealt with in this Bill and which I think we ought to deal with. One of the ways in which it is highly necessary to strengthen the law with regard to this is to put increased powers as well as increased responsibilities upon the owners of our shipping companies with regard to girls carried out of this country to other ports. It does not seem too much to ask that special police should be detailed for this purpose, and that if the owner of any steamship or other owner carries a girl to another port knowing that she is being taken there for the purpose of plying this traffic on her arrival he ought to be required to repatriate her at his own expense. Those are some of the points which it will be necessary to deal with in the future.<lb/>
But one of the most important points seems to me to deal with eases which happen, shall we say? in the Asiatic Dependencies of this country&#x2014;for example, in India. It is quite true that if an Englishwoman plies the occupation of a prostitute in India she is in some cases deported from the country. There is power to do
<col>1212</col>
that. But we have not got power, as I understand it, to deport other European women, and to a great many natives one white woman is just the same as another. For instance, they draw no distinction between&#x2014;I do not want to single out any nationality, but for the purpose of my illustration I will say a German woman&#x2014;between an English woman and a German woman who can speak a little English, and it is most damaging to the prestige of this country in India that any black man should be able to have access to any white woman of that description who is plying this trade under the British flag. So far as the white slave traffic is concerned I think special representatives might be appointed abroad to deal with this matter. I have not had time to verify the quotations and therefore will not read them to your Lordships, but there are some exceedingly interesting passages in one of the Reports of the late Sir Edwin Gorst dealing with the question of the white slave traffic in Egypt. I have indicated briefly one or two ways in which a further extension of the law will be necessary in the interests of humanity and of justice, and I do hope that our country will endeavour to make this an international matter and combine with other countries in putting this horrible trade down, or at any rate make it quite impossible that anything of this kind shall take place in spheres which are influenced, directly or indirectly, by British authority.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03451"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD BRAYE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe I am the only survivor of the Committee which was appointed thirty-one years ago to deal with this matter and to which allusion was made in the opening of this debate by the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack. I therefore cannot refrain from congratulating the Government with all my heart on introducing this Bill, apparently with every reasonable hope of its successfully passing into law. Thirty-one years ago the country suddenly woke up to the enormity and stupendous nature of the traffic with which this Bill is concerned, and a Committee was appointed to examine witnesses on the subject. The Blue-book containing the proceedings of that Committee is, no doubt, in the archives of this House and may be compared with the Blue-book of the Vice Commission in Chicago to which the noble Lord who has just sat down alluded. In a debate in a House of Parliament on a subject of this kind to
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0611"/>
<col>1213</col>
expatiate upon, and go into details upon, a matter of this kind is altogether out of the question; but the Blue-book to which I have alluded contains details, and those who care to look into it can investigate for themselves the proceedings before that Committee in 1882.<lb/>
But although that Committee sent in a full Report to Parliament very little was done at the time, and there was a great danger of the whole agitation getting shipwrecked as year after year went by without anything being done, and those who wished for legislation to be introduced were disappointed at the silence of the Government. I recollect myself asking more than once in this House whether there was any prospect of the Government of the day having leisure to deal with the matter; and on one occasion I remember the late Lord Beauchamp said that the responsibility for the delay rested with the House of Commons &#x2014; the House of Lords had long been prepared to deal with it. Thirty-one years have elapsed since the Committee reported, and those who recollect that time and who took part in that movement are only too glad to see this Bill before your Lordships' House materially strengthening the existing law, although they regret that it could not be sanctioned before. The difficulty of passing such a Bill as this at that time was very great. The country was more slow then than it is now to take an interest in these things, or at least an intelligent and active interest in them with a view to legislation being brought forward; and there was not only the opposition to it at the time that had to be overcome, but the popular indifference which then existed. Therefore it is with all the greater pleasure that we who took an interest in these matters so many years ago see these clauses in the Bill now before us, which so materially strengthen the operation of the law.<lb/>
Summary arrest is an admirable introduction into the measure; it was one that we could not carry at that time. The provision for the arrest of those in the occupation of premises formerly designated as brothels but better known now as flats, and premises of that kind, is also an admirable addition to the law. Allusion has been made to the possibility of introducing legislation to enable the Police to arrest the culprits against whom this Bill is directed on steamers as they carry away their freight to a foreign
<col>1214</col>
country. I hope will be carried, and at no very distance<ob/> it date. If there was any Amendment that it I could suggest to this Bill before us it would be that the 1st of January should be altered to the 15th of December, if that were possible, in order that the law might take effect at the earliest moment. With regard to corporal punishment which has been the only point, I think, this evening that has given rise to any serious debate. I am heartily on the side of the Bill. I believe that corporal punishment acts as a deterrent Where every other punishment,even prisonment with hard labour, would quite fail, and it acts as a sudden deterrent, a deterrent which is powerful enough to strike terror into the culprit to whom it is adjudged. One word more, my Lords, of congratulation to the Government on having introduced this measure into Parliament. I hope it may very speedily become law. I trust that any Amendments of the nature foreshadowed by the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack will not militate in any way against the abject of this Bill. If they are brought forward and they do so, it will then be the duty of this House to consider them seriously and vote against them. But I hope and trust that nothing of that kind will be in store.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03452"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are, I take it, three points on which everybody in this House is agreed and on which there has been no difference of any sort or kind between us. The first is that this traffic exists, the second that it is an infamous traffic, and the third that we ought to do what we can to stop it. That being so, there is no occasion to dilate on what we are agreed upon, and I propose to turn at once to the Bill that is before us. With regard to the first clause, I must frankly say that I have been rather surprised at the great opposition that has been raised to giving power to a constable to take a suspected person into custody without a warrant. Such a power is common in the case of exceedingly trivial offences. Of course, one of the difficulties felt may have been that the power here is given where the constable suspects that the person is attempting to commit an offence. May I point out that he has the same power where he suspects a person who is loitering about of attempting to commit a felony. I am prepared to associate myself with the observation of Lord Willoughby de
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0612"/>
<col>1215</col>
Broke, and say that<ob/> willingly suffer the inconvenience <ob/> being arrested by mistake, and so, I think would be any of your Lordships, rather than that one of these guilty persons should go free through the delay occasion <ob/> by having to apply for a warrant for arrest.<lb/>
I feel very strongly what has been said about the danger of amending this Bill. We are late in the session. Parliamentary time is short. The Bill has been constructed at odds and ends of time and not in a very perfect way, and there are no doubt, many ways in which it might be amended and improved, but I think all of us feel that if by attempting to amend it we were running the risk of losing the Bill we would rather pass it, however imperfectly it may be drawn, than run that risk. But in case Amendments should be passed I would call attention to one or two points which have struck me&#x2014;passing over for the moment Clause 2. In Clause 4 it is provided that in certain circumstances the landlord shall be entitled to require the person so convicted to assign the lease, and then there is a proviso that if he does not assign it the landlord may determine it. If the landlord does not determine it, and a second offence happens the landlord is to be deemed to have connived at that offence. That is a very difficult way of doing it. I should have thought that the conviction should forfeit the lease to the landlord, and that there should be an end of it. I do not quite see why a person convicted of such an offence as this should be allowed to make money out of the assignment of his lease, and it seems to me it would be perfectly simple if you provided straight away that that conduct should forfeit the lease. It would then be the landlord's business to inquire into the character of the person to whom he let the premises again.<lb/>
I now come to the question upon which the only difference has arisen&#x2014;the question of corporal punishment. In the first place, there is a difference between the occasions on which it is to be inflicted. I think that has already been pointed out. In Clause 2 it is to be inflicted for either the first or the second offence. In subsection (4), Clause 6 it is to be inflicted only for a second or subsequent offence. That is not a very reasonable proposition, and if corporal punishment is to be inflicted at all I am bound to say that I agree with
<col>1216</col>
those speakers who say that it ought to be inflicted for the first offence. If corporal punishment is a deterrent there can be no reason, I think, for not inflicting it for the first offence. We heard something about the danger of an innocent person being convicted. Honestly, I think most of us would believe that danger to be very small in a case of this sort and not a very likely thing to happen. But I think there are objections, which were perfectly put by the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, to the infliction of corporal punishment at all, and personally I regard that as the one blot on an otherwise excellent Bill. I regret very much that we should be re-enacting and putting into a new measure corporal punishment, which we had been rapidly getting rid of in our Penal Code.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chief Justice, said that he could not conceive any one having sympathy with offenders of this class. I am sure the noble and learned Lord knows that none of us have any sympathy with offenders of this class, and I am sure that any one of us who saw an offence of this kind being committed would then and there take upon himself the duty of inflicting severe corporal punishment upon the offender, and I do not think he would be sorry for what he had done afterwards. But there are other considerations besides the feelings of the natural man and what we should like to do in a moment of heat or in a moment of anger, and while realising the enormity of the offence with which we are dealing we must realise the advance of civilisation itself and the class of punishment which civilisation is to sanction. There are cases as bad as this of cruelty to children, for example. There is a case lately reported in the papers from Ireland which is as bad almost as anything of this kind can be, and where I am sure if corporal punishment is a proper punishment it ought to be inflicted. But our policy has been for many years to give up corporal punishment as an essential part of our punitive law, and I regret that it should have been reintroduced, no doubt as the result of a most natural wave of indignation and horror at the offence with which the Bill deals and in the hope that it will act as an effective deterrent. But, my Lords, if it acts as a deterrent in this case why should it not act as a deterrent in other cases, and why should you not restore it to the Statute-book in other
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0613"/>
<col>1217</col>
cases as well? Moreover, there is the point put so strongly by the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, that if corporal punishment is a deterrent why should it be inflicted on the male procurer only when we know that the female is quite as bad, and, in addition to that, is a traitress to her own sex for bringing her own sex into this horrible life. Yet she is to go free. I would also point out that that gives an opportunity for evading the Act by the putting forward of females to carry on this trade.<lb/>
There is this other point. I think most, people who have at all considered Penal Codes are now satisfied that the certainty of punishment is more important than the quantum of punishment, and has, on the whole, a more deterrent effect than the actual punishment itself. It has been pointed out that the people who live on the immoral earnings of women have hitherto escaped on account of the wording of the existing Act, which makes it necessary that they should have no other means of subsistence. They have escaped punishment, we are told, although they are known to the Police, because of those words. But I think it would have been wise to have left those words in, and tried the effect of bringing them within the net of the law and so enlarging the certainty of punishment rather than adding corporal punishment. The question of corporal punishment is a very difficult one. Occasions sometimes arise when one feels strongly inclined to inflict corporal punishment oneself, but most careful people, when they think about its being applied to the criminal, have come to the conclusion that corporal punishment is not an advantage to the criminal himself and does not result in making him a better member of society. I think all your Lordships must feel that it is not an advantage to the community either to make itself a party to a punishment of that sort. My sympathy is not with the criminal. My sympathy is with the community that inflicts the punishment, and in my opinion the inclusion of corporal punishment in this Bill is a blot upon it and I wish it could be removed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03453"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not desire to stand for a moment between the House and the Second Reading of this Bill, but it would be unfortunate if it were to be inferred from our silence
<col>1218</col>
that we were hostile or even indifferent to the measure which we are discussing this evening. We feel every whit as strongly as the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack that the time has come when the law dealing with these offences should be materially strengthened, and in our view it should be strengthened upon the lines of this Bill. Having said that I have really said all that I greatly desire to say. I will only make one, or perhaps two, observations upon the clauses of the Bill. In the first place, with regard to Clause 1, I have been convinced by the arguments to which we have listened this evening that power of arrest without warrant is indispensable if this Bill is really to be effectual for the purpose for which it has been prepared. That, I think, was made clear to the House by the speech of t he Lord Chief Justice. Then with regard to flogging, my instinct is entirely against the resort to corporal punishment. As the noble Earl who spoke just now told us, this is a punishment which, as an ordinary rule, is neither beneficial to the person on whom it is inflicted nor desirable in the interests of the community. But in this case we are not dealing with ordinary criminals, and it seems to me that a punishment which may not unfairly be described as a brutalising punishment is a proper punishment when you are dealing with men who are brutes already. There is one other observation with regard to the punishment of flogging which I wish to make. I own that for my part I greatly hope that if this Bill becomes law the punishment of flogging will be very rarely inflicted, and for this reason. I feel little doubt that the passing of this Bill will have the effect of driving away from our shores these obscene creatures who, among their other despicable qualities, possess a large share of the quality of cowardice.<lb/>
One word with regard to the question of Amendments. I listened with attention to the earnest appeal made to the House by the most rev. Primate at the beginning of this debate, and with much sympathy. We cannot, of course, at this moment announce that we intend to forego our right of examining this Bill and amending it if any serious blots are revealed in it. On the other hand, I should greatly deprecate any attempts to amend it merely with the object of making it a more symmetrical piece of legislation and in that way improving it. The measure has been
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0614"/>
<col>1219</col>
navigated with infinite skill and patience through the shoals and quicksands of the House of Commons, and it would be a great misfortune if, owing to any counsels of perfection here, we were to increase the risks which the Bill will run when it returns again to that House. I hope in any case that if Amendments, indispensable Amendments, are inserted in this House we may have an assurance from His Majesty's Government that, having supported the Bill up to this point, they will make it their business to support it throughout its career and see that it becomes law during the present session. I sum up what I have to say by observing that I believe it to be the opinion of all right-thinking men that it is a scandal that this country should have become the headquarters of this despicable traffic, and that we are determined that, so far as our efforts can avail, it shall be driven from our shores.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0012P0-03454"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA (THE MARQUESS OF CREWE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that those who are in favour of this great measure of social reform&#x2014;and they certainly include all who are now in the House and all who have been present during the course of the debate&#x2014;must be satisfied with the course that the debate has taken. But with regard to what has just fallen from the noble Marquess on the question of Amendments it is quite true that there are certain points upon which it will be desirable to amend the Bill. One point was mentioned by my noble friend behind me, Lord Russell. He called attention to the fact that the penalties under Clause 2 aimed at the procurer and those under subsection (4) of Clause 6 aimed at the <i>souteneur</i> are of a different kind&#x2014;that in the first case flogging may be inflicted for the first offence and in the other only for the second offence; and there does not appear to be any precise or logical reason for that difference. The two clauses, of course, could be assimilated by one of two courses, and if it is proposed to bring them into harmony, as I understand it is, the proposal may, of course, lead to some discussion, but I have no doubt that the House will arrive at a fair solution of that difficulty. In response to what fell from the noble Marquess, I am able to assure him that the Home Office and His Majesty's Government will make it their business,
<col>1220</col>
so far as lies in their power, to see the Bill into a safe haven in another place. We shall consider it our duty, after the pains which have been taken with the details of the Bill and being fully convinced of the vast importance of the subject, to give the Bill every facility that lies in our power.<lb/>
I confess to have observed with some relief the general assent which was expressed just now by the noble Marquess opposite to the provisions of Clause 1. I was not without some fear that an argument might be used, as, indeed, was used in the course of the discussion in another place, that it was dangerous to give the power of summary arrest to any constable; that there were serious possibilities of error; that people might be complained of, perhaps, with a view to blackmailing them, and that an inexperienced or stupid constable might bring about a serious insult or injury to innocent persons by arresting them. But I entirely appreciate what fell from the noble Marquess opposite that he was convinced, and I am sure he was right, that the possession of this power, having regard to the special character of this infamous traffic, is absolutely necessary if a real stop or deterrent is to be applied to it.<lb/>
When we come to the question of the penalty, I do not find myself altogether in close agreement with my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack. The view which I hold on the subject of the flogging penalty approaches more nearly to that which has been expressed by my noble friend behind me, Lord Russell. That, of course, is a purely personal view. It has been generally agreed in both Houses that this particular question of the character of the penalty cannot, and ought not, to be treated as in any sense a Party question, and, while holding my own view, I quite expect to find myself a member of a very small minority in your Lordships' House in holding it. The noble Earl opposite, Lord Lytton, was so desirous of clearing himself from any charge of mawkish sentimentality that he proposed to substitute for flogging the antique and long-dropped penalty of branding. I cannot follow him in his desire to see that particular penalty introduced. At the same time, I equally desire to be cleared of any charge of
<image src="S5LV0012P0I0615"/>
<col>1221</col>
excessive or sentimental humanitarianism. On the contrary, I confess I do not very much care what physical or what mental suffering may be inflicted upon convicted persons of this kind, and it is not from that point of view that I regret that the penalty of flogging is introduced into this measure.<lb/>
We all know that on the question both of punishments and of deterrents humane people hold singularly diverse views. I noticed in a newspaper the other day a letter from a well-known gentleman who, I suppose, would be considered to belong to the extreme humanitarian school&#x2014;Sir William Byles. Sir William Byles objected to the introduction of the punishment of Hogging in these cases, and in the course of that letter went so far as to say that he very much doubted the right of society, or, at any rate, of the individuals who composed society, to punish anybody. "Who are we," he asked, "that we should judge other people and inflict punishment upon them?" Well, I suppose there is nobody who has ever sat in the humblest capacity on any form of tribunal who has nor at one time or another appreciated the force of the famous saying of the sixteenth century divine&#x2014;who was himself, by the way, finally burnt&#x2014;who, on seeing a man going to execution, said "But for the grace of God there goes John Bradford." I have no doubt that every Judge and every magistrate has felt something of the same kind in the course of his experience. But the extreme form of that view as expressed by Sir William Byles hardly seems consonant with the holding together of society at all. It is a curious point, and that is why I mention the honourable gentleman's letter. He is in favour of keeping people altogether out of mischief by imposing upon them what is known as an indeterminate sentence. A great many other people, equally humane, are simply horrified at the notion of the indeterminate sentence and regard it as one of the most brutal forms of punishment that can be inflicted. I do not mind saying that I myself rather approve of the indeterminate sentence. I believe it is, like all other punishments, capable of abuse, but I cannot help thinking that it would prove almost more of a real deterrent to a certain class of criminal than any other form of punishment, not absolutely brutal, which could be devised.<lb/>
<col>1222</col>
But as regards the particular penalty imposed by this Bill I confess I share the view of the noble Earl behind me that the punishment of flogging is a punishment belonging rather to barbarous times than to the particular state of society in which we live. Punishments of that kind must not be confused, as unobservant or ignorant people are apt to confuse them, with the cruel forms of torture which in former days were used to extort evidence or to extort confessions. But besides those cruel inflictions there were also cruel punishments such as the one advocated by the noble Earl below the Gangway, or cruel forms of death such as those of burning or breaking on the wheel, and it may be argued, and is argued no doubt, that society in some of its strata, in some of its manifestations, is still so barbarous that it is necessary to retain certain relies of those barbarous punishments, of which flogging is practically the only one left. It may be so. There is no doubt that the Police think so. They have expressed a view in relation to this particular Bill that a punishment of this kind is necessary, and it is a serious matter to set one's opinion upon such a subject against that of the Police, to say nothing of the opinion of an experienced Judge like the noble and learned Lord opposite. But however that may be, I confess that I cannot myself regard with approval any addition to the list of crimes for which this particular penalty is to be imposed. I therefore regret its appearance in this measure at all. As I have hinted, I would gladly see the indeterminate sentence substituted for it, but that, I know, is a difficult question, and although I myself cannot support the proposition in this Bill, which in all other respects I most heartily approve of, I have no doubt from the signs of assent that were given to the expressions of opinion by the most rev. Primate and others on this subject that the House of Lords will agree with the House of Commons in maintaining this penalty. It only remains for me to express, on behalf of the Government as a whole, my warm satisfaction at the reception which has been given to this measure at your Lordships' hands.</membercontribution></p>
