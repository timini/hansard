<p id="S5LV0009P0-00133">Consideration of Clause 2 resumed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00134"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AVEBURY</member> moved an Amendment to insert after the words "Money Bill" in the first line, the words "or a Bill containing any provision to extend the maximum duration of Parliament beyond five years."</p>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0008"/>
<col>7</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00135">The noble Lord said: My Lords, in the debate on the Second Reading of this Bill the most rev. Primate made an impressive appeal to His Majesty's Government to receive in a conciliatory spirit Amendments which might be moved. I cannot say that that appeal was received with very great cordiality, but we were led to hope that fair consideration would be given to the Amendments which we might bring forward. I was, therefore, both surprised and disappointed that the noble Viscount the Leader of the House should have gone out of his way the other evening to condemn this particular Amendment before he had heard what I have to say in support of it. This Amendment, it appears to me, stands on a different footing from any one of the other Amendments moved up to the present time, and I shall use no arguments of my own, but base my case on statements made by members of His Majesty's Government in support of it. Indeed, I really do not understand how His Majesty's Government can logically oppose this Amendment. They have over and over again referred to the five years limit as an essential part of their plan, and a necessary safeguard. That was Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman's view. The present Prime Minister stated that there were two main safeguards. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"The first is the provision that after the second session of a new Parliament you cannot, under this Bill, take advantage of its machinery for overriding the veto of the House of Lords without a fresh election. The second is the shortening of the duration of Parliament from seven years to five, which in practice no doubt will be four years."</quote>
Moreover, this was no mere isolated utterance. In another speech on a previous occasion he said&#x2014;
<quote>"The House of Commons may, through the crush of business or through hasty procedure, pass a measure in an imperfect, incomplete, and even misleading form. But these are risks we admit&#x2014;I for one certainly admit&#x2014;ought to be guarded against, and we have guarded against them. In the first place we propose to shorten the legal duration of Parliament from seven to five years, which will probably amount in practice to an actual legislative working term of four years. That will secure that your House of Commons for the time being is always either fresh from the polls which gave it authority, or&#x2014;and this is an equally effective check upon acting in defiance of the popular will&#x2014;it is looking forward to the polls at which it will have to render an account of its stewardship."</quote>
The Home Secretary, again, said on April 13&#x2014;
<quote>"We have put a definite Resolution on the Paper, and we shall have a definite clause in the Bill making five years Parliaments necessary and inseparable from our Constitutional system."</quote>
<col>8</col>
But they have not done so, and this Amendment is necessary to secure what the right hon. gentleman himself described as a "necessary and inseparable" part of their proposal. It is true that on a subsequent occasion he argued that the prolongation of the House of Commons was a danger which the country was always exposed to when the Unionists were in power. But the Unionists have never taken such a step. Moreover, they could only do so with the consent of both Houses, whereas under this Bill the House of Commons itself could prolong its own existence.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00136">This Amendment was moved in the other House and only rejected by a number of votes much below the Government's normal majority. The Prime Minister described it as a "modest Amendment," and showed that he could find little to say against it by passing it over very lightly and passing on to other subjects. Such answer as he did give was far from convincing. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"It is not the character of the House of Lords, but the character of the House of Commons, and it is the commonsense of the people of this country which is the only real and adequate safeguard against any such outrage as that. Provided these two Assemblies are self-respecting Assemblies, and, far more, so long as this House depends upon the respect of the country, it is a perfectly illusory danger, and there is no reason for making any safeguard."</quote>
Again he urged that&#x2014;
<quote>"the moment you except from the omnipotence of Parliament certain categories of legislation, that moment you are introducing of necessity an outside authority to determine whether or not any particular Act of Parliament is valid."</quote>
We cannot forget that on tile previous occasion when the House of Commons, with the help of the Army, destroyed the House of Lords, the next thing they did was to prolong their own existence indefinitely, until at last they were themselves driven out by Cromwell and perished under the just contempt of the nation. I do not doubt that the Government honestly intend to adhere to the five years, but I gravely doubt whether they will be able to resist the pressure which will inevitably be brought upon them. In these circumstances I beg to move the Amendment which stands in my name, and which is, as it seems to me&#x2014;in the words of the Home Secretary&#x2014;a "necessary and inseparable" part of the Government proposal.</p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00138"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure the Committee will not suspect me of wishing for a moment to limit or shorten or stint discussion either upon the Amendments or upon the Bill; but I rather thought we agreed on Thursday night, in connection with the Amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Ancaster, that where Amendments affected the reservation of alterations in this Bill from the operation of Clause 2 we were to await the Amendment to be moved by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, and I thought that the noble Marquess himself took that view. It will be seen that three or four of the Amendments that come next on the Paper overlap the substance of the noble Marquess's Amendment. I do not, however, complain of the noble Lord for moving this Amendment, but I do quarrel with him for introducing the precedent of the Long Parliament. How on earth can the doings of the Long Parliament&#x2014;a body that existed in times of tremendous civil and military confusion&#x2014;be any precedent? You might as well quote the Barebones Parliament as a reason why there should be no House of Commons at all. A noble Lord on the other side of the House quoted the other day something in connection with Cromwell. All that is wide of the mark.<lb/>
What does the noble Lord's Amendment come to? It comes to this&#x2014;that he supposes a House of Commons so indifferent to self-respect, so indifferent to, what is equally important, the opinion of the people, the opinion of its own constituents, as to pass a Bill to prolong its own existence. It was said in another place that such a procedure would be an outrage, and undoubtedly it would be if the House of Commons, after this Bill becomes law, were to pass a new Bill prolonging its existence. This Amendment shows what many other Amendments on the Paper show&#x2014;and I am afraid I must notably include the great and far-reaching Amendment standing in the name of the noble Marquess&#x2014;a complete distrust of the House of Commons. You have assented without a Division to the Second Reading of a Bill the principle of which is, not distrust of
<col>10</col>
the House of Commons, but a desire not to disturb the supremacy of the House of Commons. The principle of this Bill is that the will of the House of Commons should prevail, and if deprecate and regret Amendments like this, which imply that the House of Commons is going to be the Barebones over again. I am afraid, therefore, we cannot accept the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00139"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount who has just sat down has alluded to this Amendment as showing distrust of the House of Commons. I would point out that the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War showed great distrust of the House of Commons the other day when he refused to pledge the Government that the House of Commons would not curtail the period of two years' delay which now appears in the Bill. I therefore think that distrust of the House of Commons is greater on the Front Bench opposite than on the Benches behind me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00140"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount suggested a moment ago that there had been something in the nature of an agreement that Amendments dealing with the question of exemptions should be discussed on an Amendment which stands in my name, and which we may reach before long. I am personally quite unconscious of the existence of any such agreement. I remember it being suggested that a particular proposal could be more conveniently discussed when we came to the Amendment standing in my name, but I certainly am very far indeed from either claiming on my own part, or admitting that any one else has a right to claim, that noble Lords who have put down Amendments of their own dealing with this important question of exemptions are in any way precluded by anything that has happened from moving them. I go further, and say that I think the discussion of these individual proposals cannot but be advantageous to the House, because it affords a means of focussing our attention on particular questions of exemptions as opposed to general exemptions on principle.<lb/>
The Amendment of my noble friend seems to be one which I can scarcely conceive His Majesty's Government objecting to. That during the interval which is to elapse between the present time and the reconstitution of the House of Lords His Majesty's Government are to be free to vary
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0010"/>
<col>11</col>
at their own will the terms embodied in the clauses of this Bill seems to me to be a monstrous pretension. The noble Viscount said that it would be an outrage if such a thing were done, and he complained of us for the mistrust of the House of Commons which we evinced by proposals of this sort. I would entreat the noble Viscount to remember that His Majesty's Government are not always quite free agents in the House of Commons. They have been told very plainly that there are occasions when they are expected to toe the line, and they have toed it upon some of these occasions, and is the noble Viscount quite convinced that a critical moment might not arise when, not of their own free will but under the coercion of their supporters, they might be induced to adopt a proposal of this kind. At any rate, if the noble Viscount thinks the thing so inconceivable there would surely be no very great harm in accepting this Amendment without further to do.<lb/>
My noble friend, in moving the Amendment, very properly reminded your Lordships that this particular plan of quinquennial Parliaments is one which has been recommended by no less a person than the Home Secretary as a "necessary and inseparable part" of the new Constitutional system. That surely puts the thing upon a pedestal of its own, and entitles it to special treatment. Would the noble Viscount also remember how completely any extension of the duration of Parliaments would modify the conditions of this Bill? The Prime Minister has explained more than once that under the quinquennial system it would be only during the first two or three years of the new House of Commons&#x2014;which would then, to use his own words, be in the plenitude of its powers&#x2014;that it would be able to take full advantage of the provisions of this clause. But if the period of five years became six years or seven years, that period of plenitude and vigour would, of course, be proportionately prolonged, and the whole basis of the settlement would be fundamentally altered. I think my noble friend has a very strong case for his Amendment, but I am bound to say to him that, while I entirely agree with him in believing that this question should be exempted from ordinary treatment, it seems to me better that it should be exempted from ordinary treatment under the terms of the Amendment
<col>12</col>
which I am about to move, and naturally preferring my own mode of dealing with the matter I would ask him to consider whether it is desirable to put the House to the trouble of a Division.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00141"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I confess that the discussion has raised in my mind a somewhat different consideration from that which my noble friend behind me has just suggested. I do not suppose that in the Amendments that stand upon the Paper it would be easy to find another Amendment which has been over and over again recommended by His Majesty's Government as a real and proper security to be given; and if the Government refuse to accept this Amendment&#x2014;which I repeat has been recommended by themselves&#x2014;what is the use of discussing any further Amendments? It will make a considerable difference to a good many of us what attitude we shall assume towards this Bill when it comes back from the other House if this is the mode in which Amendments suggested by the Government themselves are rejected.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00142"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: This Amendment seems to me to stand in a totally different category from any of those to be proposed by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, because this is an Amendment which the Government have themselves said is a necessary part of their plan. I hoped, therefore, that I would have had the general support of the House in this Amendment, which I must leave in the hands of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00143">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00144"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COLCHESTER</member> moved an Amendment with the object of providing that any Bill other than a Money Bill might be presented to His Majesty and become an Act of Parliament if it had been passed by the House of Commons in three sessions "in the course of two successive Parliaments," instead of, as provided in the clause as it stood, in "three successive Sessions."</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00145">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I venture to submit this Amendment because it raises, I think, a most important point in this Bill. I may be told that it goes against the principle which I have already sanctioned. The principle of this Bill
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0011"/>
<col>13</col>
is that there must be a change in the relations between the two Houses of Parliament, and that the Veto of this House should not continue, as it has been, unlimited in time. But I have always considered that what may be called the virus of this Bill lay in the words that the will of the House of Commons was to prevail within the limit of one Parliament, thereby putting in the place of the convinced will of the country the decision in one Parliament of a single House of the Legislature&#x2014;a decision which may not represent the view of the country in the long run. The change in the present state of things that would be made even under my Amendment is, I contend, a considerable one, because the period in which this House could exercise its Veto would be a limited period. It does away with the theory that this House has full power to reject any Bill sent up by the House of Commons, but it does give some security that the decision of that House should not be a hasty one, and that a Bill passed by the house of Commons and persisted in should not pass over the head of this House unless there had been an appeal to the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00146">The powers left to this House by Clause 2 as it stands are too small to be useful and large enough to be obstructive and vexatious. Allusion has been made to the possibility of the majority in the House of Commons proposing in future to restrict even the limited powers now proposed to be left to this House. I confess I think it would be very natural that they should do so, because as left by Clause 2 the powers are of a kind which cannot possibly be maintained. I can understand that members of a Second Chamber might not think it worth while to exercise these powers at all. They might possibly consider that it was no use going on debating matters session after session and rejecting Bills which must eventually pass over their heads. The power of amending a Bill is taken away as much as that of rejecting it, because I cannot consider that Amendments which must be abandoned if they are not accepted in the other House would be Amendments which would have any force behind them. I think, therefore, that these powers will be of very little use. There is no doubt that in the first three sessions of a Parliament a Bill first passed by the House of Commons would be passed again. There might be an exception
<col>14</col>
in the case of private Members' Bills, which might slip through the first time possibly because there was no organised opposition, but which, if they came up in another year, might excite more attention and not be carried. But surely a Bill carried by a Government majority in one year would not be abandoned in the next on account of opposition in the Upper House. Therefore in the first three years of a Parliament the country will be under Single-Chamber Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00147">It would be easy for the Government to bring forward, in the first years of a Parliament, its most contentious measures, and reserve to later sessions either those to which there is not so much opposition or those for which they think they would gain popularity at the General Election. I therefore do not consider that there would be any serious check on the powers of the House of Commons if this Bill passed in its present unamended state. But if for "one Parliament" we substituted "two successive Parliaments," it would be possible to have something of a fair settlement, and the real powers of this House might be preserved much as they are in ordinary practice, because it is very seldom that a Bill is rejected again after it has been approved at a General Election. In the case of the Budget of 1909 this House gave the country an opportunity of expressing its opinion, and when the opinion of the country appeared to have been expressed upon it that Bill was passed by your Lordships without opposition. I know I have no hope of this Amendment being accepted by His Majesty's Government, but I think the same may be said, without exception, of any Amendment that may be proposed. From the first the Government have taken up an attitude which made a semblance of a settlement impossible. Therefore if I meet with any support from your Lordships I shall press this Amendment to a Division. I think we ought to make this protest against the idea that the vote of a Single Chamber can be taken as an adequate embodiment of the final opinion of the country. I beg to move the first of the two Amendments standing in my name.</p>

The object is to insist upon the intervention and interposition of a General Election between the stages in which a Bill finds its way to this House and is afterwards rejected by this House. I did not mean for a moment to imply in what I said just now that the noble Marquess had come to anything like an agreement. It was simply my own interpretation of the language which the noble Marquess used on Thursday in respect of Lord Ancaster's proposal.

I ask those who least like this Bill, who most dislike it, whether it is at all a reasonable proposal that every measure should be taken out of the scope and operation of the Bill we are now discussing and subjected to all the ordinary procedure.

I do not wish to lay too much stress upon that at this stage. By and by we may have more to say about it. Every Bill is to be subject, under this Amendment, to a General Election. Before this clause can operate there must be a General Election. The Amendment standing in the name of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition does not go nearly so far as that. What the noble Lord has now moved is an Amendment far wider than that of the Leader of his own Party. I am sorry to say, therefore, that we cannot assent to the Amendment, and the noble Lord, as he said, did not expect that we would.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00154"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I have on the Paper an Amendment very similar to the one now before us, perhaps I may be allowed to say what I have to say upon this Amendment. It does not seem to me
<col>16</col>
that the Amendment of my noble friend, any more than the one which I moved before, is covered by the Amendment standing in the name of the noble Marquess. Under the noble Marquess's proposal there are certain Bills which could not be passed unless they were referred to the Referendum. That is quite a different thing from postponing them until after another General Election. It may be said that this Amendment would leave things very much as they are, but that is only because your Lordships never yet have opposed the will of the people after it had been expressed at a General Election.<lb/>
His Majesty's Government have gone to the country and stated repeatedly that this House has opposed almost every Liberal measure that has been introduced. Of the very large number of Bills introduced by this Government, only four have been thrown out, or at any rate postponed by your Lordships' House. The number of Bills thrown out is admitted to be very small, but it is said that you must measure the evil, not by the number of Bills, but by the importance of the Bills. I quite admit that that is a fair argument. Let us then see what has happened to these four Bills. The Budget was postponed by your Lordships in 1909 but passed in 1910. In this case, then, it is clear that your Lordships did not exercise your veto. The second of the four Bills, which practically ruined so many of the brewers, was introduced into the Budget, and therefore the Government also carried that. As to the other two Bills, the Government apparently felt that the country was not with them, and we have heard nothing more of them since the House of Lords postponed them. That shows, I think, that they did not meet with the support of the country. I submit, then, that it is an extreme exaggeration to say that your Lordships' House has opposed all Liberal legislation, and I ask His Majesty's Government to give us a single instance of the House of Lords insisting on its Veto after the country had declared in favour of any particular measure. The Government went to the country and said they wanted to take away the Veto of the House of Lords, but practically the House of Lords is always ready to waive its Veto when the country has expressed its opinion, and I ask His Majesty's Government to give us a single case in which your Lordships have pressed your Veto.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0013"/>
<col>17</col>
The Government have gone to the country and stated that they want to do away with the Veto of the House of Lords, but what they are doing away with in this Bill is the Veto of the country. In moving this Amendment we are not maintaining the Veto of your Lordships' House, but the right of the country to be consulted on these great occasions. The worst that could happen from the Govermnent point of view if this Amendment were passed is that a measure would be postponed for two or three years. That is a short time in the history of a country, and I maintain that so long as there is a doubt as to what the opinion of the country is the postponing of a measure for two or three years is an unimportant matter. What is important is that when you do take a step it should be a step in the right direction. It is much easier to do than to undo. It is very difficult to repeal an Act, and the mischief may be almost irreparable. I maintain, therefore, that the small delay, if there be a delay, which would be involved in the proposal of my noble friend is an unimportant matter indeed compared with the danger of legislation in a hurry. I feel confident that when the people understand, as they will sooner or later, that the real question before us is not the Veto of the House of Lords but the Veto of the country, we shall carry the approval and the commonsense of our countrymen with us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00155"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord opposite, with an assurance which I think did great credit to his courage, said, at the beginning of his speech, that this House never opposed the will of the country after a General Election. I would ask your Lordships what you are doing now, and what you were doing last week. I understand there has been a General Election on the very question of this Bill. Noble Lords say "No." I was under the impression that this Bill had been introduced into this House, that the Bill had been printed, and that at the last General Election the Bill was before the electors line by line and word by word, and that the electors were asked to pronounce upon it. The electors have pronounced upon it, and your Lordships are now engaged, not in rejecting the Bill on Second Reading, but in doing what would be equally fatal to the Bill&#x2014;that is, inserting wrecking Amendments. Your Lordships are inserting wrecking Amendments in defiance
<col>18</col>
of the expressed declaration of the Government, which commands the confidence of the country, that they will not accept these Amendments. If that is not a. clear defiance of the will of the country expressed after a General Election, I fail to understand what can be plainer. This Bill has been submitted to the country, and your Lordships are by this series of Amendments taking out of the Bill everything for which it was commended to the Liberal Party and the country. Your Lordships are, I venture to say, directly and distinctly defying the expression of the popular will at the last General Election.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00156"><member>THE EARL OF MALMESBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. the noble Viscount the Leader of the House alluded to Lord Avebury's Amendment just now as being one of a series of Amendments dealing with the same subject. I venture to think that, although the noble Viscount has indicated that His Majesty's Government have no intention of accepting these Amendments, your Lordships are only doing your duty in giving the proposed Amendments the fullest and most complete discussion. It is not the duty of your Lordships' House to-day to consider your own privileges or the powers we possess. It is clearly your duty to see that the will of the people, not the will of the House of Commons, shall prevail. I go further and say that the only means by which that can be secured is by now, almost at the eleventh hour, inserting in this Bill an Amendment which shall enact that an election shall intervene between the discussion of a Bill in your Lordships' House and its becoming law. I do not mean the will of the people as expressed, hysterically perhaps, at the polls under the pressure of great Party excitement. We want to have the considered judgment of the country, and I ask your Lordships very respectfully, Can you have the considered judgment of the people by any other way than by inserting in this Bill an Amendment of the nature I have described?<lb/>
The noble Viscount, when he introduced this Bill into your Lordships' House, based his authority for it upon the result of the recent election; but I venture to think that a measure so uncouth in its intention, so utterly relentless in its operation, so retrograde in its principles, can hardly be taken to represent the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0014"/>
<col>19</col>
considered judgment of the people to-day. In moving the Second Reading of this Bill the noble Viscount quoted the immortal words of Macbeth, and asked whether in our view a General Election was&#x2014;
<quote>"A tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing."</quote>
As far as the Radical Party was concerned, the election was full of sound and fury, but I wish I could say that I thought it signified nothing. Every vote given in this hasty unconsidered way for the measure which is now before your Lordships' House was undoubtedly a "tale told by an idiot," and the country will sooner or later know that only too truly. I ask the noble Viscount whether he considers that the mandate which His Majesty's Government received justifies them in breaking up the model Constitution of the civilised world and reducing to impotent inaction your Lordships' House, which has always been the upholder of the liberties of this country.<lb/>
It is not the voice of the people we are listening to. It was not the voice of the people which was expressed at the last election. We had a series of issues. Policies were introduced at the last moment under strong external pressure. I venture to think that the result of the last two elections has not been by the voice of the people. It is a clever fake, a gigantic hoax. The voice of the people as expressed at the last two elections has been nothing more than the very clever effect of a company of political ventriloquists under the directorship of Mr. John Redmond. Perhaps your Lordships may remember that in days of old there were three sisters&#x2014;they were commonly called the Grai&#x00E6; or the Gray Sisters; and according to mythological tradition they lived upon a log of drift wood in a frozen sea, and had only one eye and one tooth between them. If noble Lords opposite will forgive the simile, it seems to me that the Radical Party to-day is somewhat like those three sisters. They are composed of three sections and have only one eye and one tooth between them, and. while I admit that His Majesty's Government, or that section which immediately represents the views of the Prime Minister, are generally permitted to have the use of the tooth, they are certainly never permitted to have the use of the eye. With regard to this Amendment, I should like to say, in
<col>20</col>
conclusion, that I hope your Lordships will consider very seriously the advisability of inserting it in the Bill, because there is no Second Chamber in the whole of the civilised world so powerless, so entirely deprived of powers of revision and delay, as your Lordships' House will be should this Bill become law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00157"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl, Lord Russell, made a remarkable statement just now which I must question. He stated that we were opposing the will of the people because before the last General Election the Parliament Bill had been sent up here and was discussed on every platform throughout the country. But, my Lords, how was the Parliament Bill discussed in in the Houses of Parliament. There is such a thing as the guillotine, which has been, not made use of, but grossly abused since 1906. I would like to ask Lord Russell how many days were allotted to the discussion of the Parliament Bill before the last General Election. Is there a single controversial Bill which has been introduced by the present Government on which free discussion has been allowed? I think the only Bill which had anything like an adequate amount of time allowed for its discussion was the Finance Bill of 1909, and that Bill, as the result of that discussion, emerged from the House of Commons almost an entirely new Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00158"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount opposite seemed to think that this Amendment was not of a reasonable character in the present condition of the Bill, but I cannot help hoping that the tribute which he paid, perhaps unintentionally, to my noble friend behind me (Lord Lansdowne) by showing the moderation of the noble Marquess's Amendment, will convince him that Lord Lansdowne has certainly exercised very great self-denial, to say the least, in the course which, by the Amendments he has placed on the Paper, he suggests for meeting difficulties between the two Houses. The noble Viscount will also probably appreciate that, but for the Amendments so standing, it might have been very difficult for noble Lords on this side to avoid adopting a more drastic course; and I am sure the noble Viscount will have noticed that among those who have spoken most strongly on the necessity of establishing some appeal to the people on this
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0015"/>
<col>21</col>
question is the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, who has a record of a lifetime of Liberalism behind him, and who when in the House of Commons voted for almost every measure of first-class Liberal importance.<lb/>
I think the noble Viscount must see, if we look back to the time before this Bill was introduced, that this Amendment is not an unreasonable one. Because, granted the Resolutions adopted by your Lordships last November, granted the introduction or the carrying of such a Bill as Lord Lansdowne has introduced giving substantially a fair division between the two Parties in this House, and granted also the abnegation on the part of this House of the particular powers with regard to Money Bills which were most deprecated on the other side, there really remains very little of the case as the Government originally made it out for establishing a Veto as against this House on ordinary Bills. And if that case was small before it becomes smaller still if such Bills were to be submitted to the people at a General Election. But events have moved on. Your Lordships gave a Second Reading to this Bill. We know that the one thing which in the course of these discussions has been most deprecated by the Government has been the power of this House to force a General Election, and we have throughout endeavoured to find a substitute by giving an appeal to the people in grave issues which would not create a General Election. One objection which occurs to us with regard to this Amendment is the fact that it touches all Bills without any distinction whatever. It is quite true, as Lord Avebury has well pointed out, that the number of Liberals Bills rejected by this House is not large, but this Amendment, if we adopt one of the forms of it which has been suggested, does leave every Bill, however small and however large, in the position of requiring to wait for a General Election. I venture to think that from the point of view of this House we may not be well advised to hang up Bills continually until after a General Election.<lb/>
What the Government are trying to impose upon us by this Bill is delay in carrying out any measure which they may declare to be demanded by the people&#x2014;a delay which will unquestionably become the subject of suspicion and attack
<col>22</col>
upon your Lordships' House. What we ask is not for delay but for decision. We ask for decision by the people, and as promptly as possible, on the question which had arisen between the two Houses. That we can obtain if the Amendment of the noble Marquess is adopted, but we cannot attain it under the Amendment now before us. I cannot help feeling that there is much to be said for, if possible, avoiding the system of hanging up a Bill for two or three years to be intermingled with a number of other measures in the minds of the electors when it is submitted for final judgment.<lb/>
I would ask the noble Earl who spoke from the opposite side of the House, who was so interested to prove that every line of this Bill had been before the people, that every line had been confirmed by the electors, whether he does not remember that a couple of months after the beginning of the session the Prime Minister told us that the electorate had given a direct verdict on Home Rule, and that a few days later the Chancellor of the Exchequer claimed that as the Government had expressed their intention of paying Members of Parliament and as they had not been defeated at the election, that that also had obtained the sanction of the electors. Where are we going to stop? I should like the noble Earl to go down to some constituencies and examine the electors with regard to this Bill, not on every line but even on the effect of the chief clauses, and make sure that amidst all the jumble of measures that were discussed at the election on Liberal platforms this Measure stands out clearly in their minds. It. is of first-class importance that so far as we can we should, in measures on which we may differ in future from the House of Commons, have a clear cut difference and as rapid a decision as can possibly be obtained. I do not think that any of your Lordships will much envy our position, sitting here with a Ministry willing to change this Bill to our detriment again if we should halt the Bills which they should see fit, to send up.<lb/>
So far, in the Amendments which have been put into this Bill we have been working within very narrow limits. We have only endeavoured to secure that a Money Bill shall be a Money Bill, and that there shall be a proper tribunal to declare it a Money Bill. We also propose
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0016"/>
<col>23</col>
later on, in questions of grave importance, to bring in a procedure which will alter the conditions laid down by the Government. But I apprehend that if, after accepting the Second Reading of the Bill, we were to apply that procedure to all measures and under the conditions which are laid down in the Amendment, reasonable as it is, which has been put before your Lordships in the last half hour, we should be considered by the Government to have gone back on the position taken up on the Second Reading, and we may also prove to have adopted a procedure which is far less calculated to secure for really important measures that consideration by the people which is essential for our public business.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00159"><member>LORD MARCHAMLEY</member><membercontribution>: Lords, I am not sure that noble Lords opposite ought not to walk warily with regard to this Amendment, which is a blunt sword with a sharp handle. I should say that it was an Amendment for keeping the Liberal Party permanently and perpetually in office. Under this Bill the duration of a Parliament is reduced to five years. What would take place under this Amendment I venture to suggest would be this, that in the first three years of a Liberal Government harmless and innocuous measures would be introduced into the House of Commons and passed through both Houses, but in the last year but one before the election the Government would come up with what the noble Lords opposite would call a blazing programme of democratic, popular, and progressive measures. They would pass those measures twice through the House of Commons in two successive sessions, and would then appeal to the country for a second term of office in which those measures might be fully harvested and garnered. This Amendment, therefore, would tell more against noble Lords on the other side of the House than against us, and I would suggest that very much more careful consideration should be given to it before it is incorporated in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00160"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COLCHESTER</member><membercontribution>: I think after the remarks of the noble Lord who has just spoken I ought to be able to claim his vote for the Amendment, as he considers that it would be so valuable to his Party. But, with regard to the speech of the noble Viscount, I would say that this Amendment was never intended as a substitute for that of the noble Marquess. What I protest against is that any Bill should be passed
<col>24</col>
within one Parliament simply because it has received the support two or three times of the same House of Commons which really gives it no greater weight than if it had received support only in one session. I feel so strongly on this Amendment that if I obtain any support I shall certainly divide the Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00161"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has proposed this Amendment and those who agree with him will not accuse me, I am sure, of any want of sympathy with their opposition to the policy of the Government to the uttermost, or with their opinion as to the peril in which it puts this country. But I would point out to my noble friend that when he says that his Amendment is not a substitute for that of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition he is in error. If the Committee adopt this Amendment they cannot possibly add Lord Lansdowne's Amendment. The two are perfectly incompatible methods of dealing with the difficulty, and I would venture to point out to my noble friend what seem to me unanswerable arguments in favour of Lord Lansdowne's course rather than his. We must remember, in the first place, that the policy which we as a Party have adopted on this Bill is adopted on the supposition and belief that it is only a temporary and transitory interruption in our Constitution. So far as we have any opportunity of influencing the history of this country in the future, we shall not rest till we have restored stability to the Constitution by giving our Second Chamber those powers which are regarded in every civilised country in the world as necessary for a Second Chamber. Therefore the Amendments we are proposing in respect to this Bill are not Amendments with a view of establishing a permanent Constitution, but Amendments with a view of preventing as far as possible this Bill, while it lasts, from depriving the electors of their sovereign birthright to have the final word in drastic legislation.<lb/>
What is the difference between the two policies? If the noble Lord's Amendment is carried, as I say, Lord Lansdowne's Amendment cannot be carried. If Lord Colchester's Amendment is agreed to and assuming it to become law, then every measure in connection with which there was a difference between the two Houses would automatically be decided at a
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0017"/>
<col>25</col>
General Election at the end of four or five years. I say, in the first place, that the effect of that provision would be to prevent compromise. Lord Lansdowne's proposal, in my opinion, will operate very largely to compromise and reasonable agreement between the two Parties. The proposal of the noble Lord would be no road, in any circumstances, to compromise. On the contrary, I think the noble Lord who spoke from the Benches below the Gangway on the other side (Lord Marchamley) was perfectly right when he said that his Party would endeavour to load up the latter years of a Parliament with the greatest possible number of contentious measures in order to take them to a General Election, and then when they went to the General Election every reason we have urged against a General Election settling these questions would come in in a greater degree.<lb/>
We have urged the Referendum because by that means, and by that means only, can one great question be separated from a mass of other questions great and small. By that means alone can the electors give a distinct and final verdict on one great issue. By the plan of my noble friend behind me all the confusions that have ever taken place at any General Election would be perpetuated in the settlement of differences between the two Houses, and instead of getting a clear cut issue on specific questions, however grave, the electors would be entirely bewildered. They would have a general sense that this House was doing nothing but throw out legislation. The whole of our opponents would direct their case to showing how many measures this House refused to pass, and on how many measures the electors were called upon to decide. All the differences between the two Houses would be accentuated, and the electors would not get what we desire them to have&#x2014;the opportunity of giving their final opinion on each grave issue when it occurs between the two Houses. I submit that not only is Lord Colchester's Amendment incompatible with that of the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition, but it is not even a substitute for it. It does not do what we on this side of the House wish to have done, and, on the other hand, it opens out a vista of further strife and further difficulty for the electors.</membercontribution></p>

The other night my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke quoted a sentence from a speech by the Prime Minister which clearly illustrates the view we hold with regard to this Amendment. The Prime Minister said&#x2014;
<quote>"The House of Commons does not necessarily and perhaps does not even presumptively express that opinion (the opinion of the people). You might have a case, a conceivable case, of what is called a scratch majority combined together under the coercion of Party exigencies for a particular and transient purpose.</quote>
If those words apply under ordinary conditions, how much more do they apply to operations under the closure? While under this Bill your Lordships will be entirely deprived of all power, you should at all events have an opportunity, more than one opportunity, of knowing the opinion expressed by the nation through its representatives in another place, and my object is to secure adequate discussion and possible amendment in the other House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00166">The noble Viscount, the Leader of the House, in referring to some Amendment moved by myself the other night, was good enough to take the trouble to find out that I had never been a member of the House of Commons. The noble Viscount is quite right; but I venture to think that that is not my fault but my misfortune. I do not, however, believe that that fact will for a moment prejudice me moving this Amendment in your Lordships' House, where we have never attempted to stifle or closure discussion in any form. In fact, we have always, even in the longest
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0018"/>
<col>27</col>
and most wearisome hours, welcomed discussion, and have always urged noble Lords on the Benches opposite to take part in our debates, and it is to us a matter of regret that new members sent up to this House from another place with great Parliamentary reputations take very little or no part in our discussions. I only make this remark, in passing, to say that in this House we welcome discussion and dislike the idea that it should be closured in another place.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00167">Opinions change and vary from time to time, and opinions which are held with regard to a Bill to-day may be different six months hence. The object of my Amendment is that Bills which come up to your Lordships' House under the provisions of the Parliament Bill shall have been fully, adequately, and properly discussed in the other House on each occasion before they come up here for consideration. Under the present Government, which professes to believe in the doctrine of free speech and liberty of debate, the limitation of the rights of discussion has been carried further than under any other Government which has ever existed. The other day I took the opportunity of ascertaining exactly what the history of the closure had been and how it had been applied during the last two years. I believe I am right in saying that the guillotine was first introduced in the House of Commons in the year 1887. At first its use was very carefully applied, and no one had any cause to complain. It was used only as an instrument for business purposes and to closure a debate when it bad gone on too long, and when the congestion of business demanded that it should go on no longer. To-day the guillotine is used in another place not as an instrument to clear away congestion of business, but to prevent discussion, to prevent minorities in the House of Commons from discussing the Bill before them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00168">I will not trouble your Lordships with the history of the guillotine because, as the noble Viscount has told you, I have never been in the House of Commons, but I will ask the noble Viscount to give me his attention for a moment while I quote the following figures. In 1893 the closure was moved on the Home Rule Bill after it had been twenty-eight days in Committee, and in 1902, in the case of the Education
<col>28</col>
Bill, after it had been thirty-eight days in Committee. Before 1906 the guillotine was used, in all, only seven times. Since 1906 its application has become a practice, not after a Bill has been a long time in the House, but almost as soon as it is introduced. In the three years 1906, 1907 and 1908, during which time His Majesty's present Government presided over the affairs of the country, the guillotine was used no fewer than eleven times. Perhaps I might give an example of the working of the guillotine in the case of the Housing Bill which was introduced in 1908. In 1909 it was reintroduced under the guillotine Resolution. In the Committee stage on the first day Clauses 1 and 2 were adopted; then the guillotine fell, and Clauses 3 to 29 were put without debate. That is very significant. If the House of Commons has an opportunity of fully and fairly discussing the particular Bill which is before it, the result may be very different; but whole sets of clauses are passed under pressure of the guillotine in order to avoid discussion. Clause 30 was debated and deleted. Clause 53 was debated, but Clauses 54 and 56 were not debated, and so on.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00169">I venture to think that if in the future measures are to be dealt with in this way in the House of Commons, it will become very serious, not for your Lordships' House or for any Second Chamber, but for the people of this country, who are not only losing the advantage and the security of a Second Chamber, which every great civilised country has, but also the right of freedom of discussion and freedom of debate in another place. I hope the noble Viscount opposite, even if he does not like the words of my Amendment, will see his way to give us an undertaking, either now or at some future stage of this Bill, that Bills brought no to this House under the Parliament. Bill shall have been fully discussed on every occasion when they have been before the House of Commons.</p>

<col>29</col>
Amendment. No Chamber with any self-respect could allow even a co-ordinate Chamber, which this is not, to interfere with its own way of carrying on its own business. I will be very brief, because, really, the Amendment of the noble Earl is thoroughly unpractical. Mark this in the Amendment. It is not a case of certain forms of Resolutions for limiting debate; it is not merely the guillotine, or the modern form of closure. There are various forms of limiting debate. The noble Earl proscribes them all, and he refers, not very tactfully, I think, to the history of these large and exceptional forms of closure. Its first introduction was by Mr. Speaker Brand at 9 o'clock one morning, when&#x2014;shall I say&#x2014;Irish obstruction had gone on to such an extent that he intervened to suppress it out of hand. The necessity has constantly arisen, although not so severe and critical as that, for its application by the leaders of both Parties.<lb/>
The noble Earl referred to the Education Bill of 1902. What is the history of that? Was that Bill carried without a Resolution limiting debate? On the contrary. I think after thirty days of criticism&#x2014;which was called, rightly or wrongly, obstruction&#x2014;it was only by resort to a Resolution for limiting debate that that Bill was advanced a stage. Nobody who takes any interest at all in watching the day-to-day procedure of the House of Commons, whether the Conservatives are in or the Liberals are in, can conceal from himself that the business of the House, imperfectly transacted as it is, could not be transacted at all if this power of limiting debate&#x2014;it may or may not be from time to time abused&#x2014;did not exist. I can understand better the application of the noble Earl's Amendment to a Money Bill. Why? Because a Money Bill is discussed and settled in one year. But here, where you have three years for public opinion to operate on the ordinary give-and-take of Parliamentary discussion, such an Amendment as this, apart from other reasons, is wholly out of place, and I really do not believe that those of your Lordships who most object to giving way to the House of Commons will think for a moment that the House of Commons could stand a proscription of this kind. They would insist, and rightly insist, on conducting their business in their own way.

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00172"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount hits informed your Lordships that this Amendment is a direct interference with the procedure of the House of Commons. I might point out that this Parliament Bill is a direct interference with the procedure of your Lordships' House. I may be wrong, but I read the Amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Malmesbury in a different way from that in which the noble Viscount has read it. He says that this is an attempt to limit the closure. All of us on this side are well aware that under modern conditions a Government must retain the right to limit the discussion of particular points of a Bill, provided that the main essentials and the chief arguments with regard to the Bill have been put forward and adequate time given for their discussion. But this Amendment, as I read it, does not interfere in any way with a motion to closure any particular discussion, which, under the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, has, in order to be carried, to be supported by at least 100 Members. All that this Amendment does do is to try and prevent any general Resolution being passed the object of which is to limit at the will of the Government the whole discussion of a Bill, however important that Bill may be. Noble Lords opposite say that a Bill after it has been passed through the House of Commons three times is to become law, whether we like it or not, or whether the electors like it or not. Is it too much to ask, therefore, that we should try and secure adequate discussion for a Bill in one of those successive sessions?<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Malmesbury, gave an excellent instance of the use of the guillotine when he mentioned the Housing Bill. But, as I said just now in answer to Lord Russell, every controversial Bill which has been introduced by the present Government has had its discussion drastically curtailed. Your Lordships will remember how the Government treated the Old Age Pensions Bill, a very important Bill which one would have thought required a great deal of discussion and very careful amendment. If I remember aright, the last five clauses of that Bill were passed without any discussion at all. I think the clause setting up the local pension committees for the administration of that Act and other clauses relating to the same matter were never discussed. The result
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0020"/>
<col>31</col>
would be, if this Amendment is not passed, that we should have a Bill, like the Parliament Bill, which had never been discussed in the House of Commons at all, put before the country, and then we should be told that we were holding out against the people's wishes because we tried to discuss and amend a Bill which had never had any time given to its discussion. I did not share my noble friend's hope that this Amendment would be accepted by the Government. I do not think that any Amendments moved from this side are going to be received. But this is a reasonable Amendment, in my opinion, as much in the interests of the supporters of the Party which the noble Viscount represents as in the interests of the electors at large, and I trust, therefore that your Lordships will insert it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00173"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a remarkable circumstance that the noble Viscount opposite does not seem to have any feeling of humiliation at the fact that the Government are advocating this Bill which is to destroy the power of your Lordships' House at a time when from year to year and from month to month they are diminishing the opportunities which the House of Commons itself has of really discussing legislation. It is extraordinary that at a time when the procedure of the House of Commons is breaking down by the confession of everybody&#x2014;of noble Lords opposite just as much as on our part&#x2014;you should seek to deprive the House of Lords of full opportunity of controlling legislation. The noble Viscount does not appear to be at all sensible of the difficulty which the Government are now creating. It is quite clear that every year the discussions in the House of Commons become more and more unreal in a sense which I am going to explain in a moment. No doubt certain large issues are discussed there, but anything like a detailed examination of a Bill is becoming increasingly difficult. I do not suppose the noble Viscount will deny that. We see the spectacle year after year of Bills coming up to your Lordships' House the greater part of which have never been discussed in the House of Commons at all, and some never having a single line discussed.<lb/>
The whole theory of representative government turns, not upon the mere fact of representation, but upon the fact that
<col>32</col>
the representatives should discuss and have matters threshed out between different minds representing different shades of thought in politics, and that it should gradually appear from the discussion how far the principle, not merely in the large but in detail, is workable. More than that, it often appears in the course of discussion that a proposition, which at first appears to be mere detail, when threshed out turns out to go really to the root of the Bill; and when it is shown, after full and open discussion, that such details are not workable, it is then very often shown that the Bill itself is not workable and it has to be thrown aside. I will quote a leading case&#x2014;the case of the Home Rule Bill of 1886. It was in my very early days, but I had the honour of sitting in the House of Commons at that time. I am not sure whether there were any closure rules in force then. I think there were a few, but they were on a very much smaller and humbler scale than the kind of thing we see now. That Bill was really destroyed in discussion, although at the beginning it commanded a majority in the House of Commons. Discussion proved that Mr. Gladstone's Home Rule Bill of 1886 was unworkable, and it was therefore destroyed. If that was true of the Bill of 1886 it was still more true of the Bill of 1893. That Bill got through the House of Commons, but it was shattered in discussion. The noble Viscount does not agree with me. My recollection is that it was absolutely hammered to death in the House of Commons, and when it came up to your Lordships' House your Lordships rejected it, and, as is well-known, the decision of this House was received by the country with acclamation.<lb/>
The people of the country have a right to know that every Bill will be thoroughly discussed, so that they may have an opportunity of judging whether a Bill is good or bad; but the Government do not want Bills to be thoroughly discussed. The Lord Chancellor laughs at that observation. I do not know whether he is aware that even at this moment one of his colleagues has given notice&#x2014;I do not know how far it has been withdrawn this afternoon in deference to public opinion&#x2014;of the most drastic form of restrictive rules ever seen in the House of Commons. Even before a Bill is discussed at all it is to be guillotined&#x2014;a Bill which is non-controversial. [Several NOBLE LORDS: It has
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0021"/>
<col>33</col>
been withdrawn.] I understand that even the wishes of this tyrannical Government have not prevailed, and that in deference to public opinion the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been obliged to withdraw his notice of motion. It is only a sample of what is to come. Anybody who has watched will see that these restrictive rules are creeping further and further forward, and gradually destroying the independent powers of the House of Commons. The noble Viscount does not seem to have realised the position in which that puts the Government. They say, "We propose that legislation in the future shall be forced through your Lordships' House, and we will not give you any engagement that Bills which are subject to this drastic treatment shall be fully discussed in the House of Commons."<lb/>
Let me suggest what is likely to happen. What quite obviously will happen is that in the first two years of the Parliament every Bill which the Radical Party has at heart will be crammed into the King's Speech, and they will all be rushed through anyhow by the most drastic rules in the first two years. It must be so in order to carry out the full policy of the Parliament Bill. The Chancellor of the Exchequer will come down and propose a guillotine Resolution on every important Bill, even before it is discussed in the House of Commons. He will do that because it is necessary, in order that the Parliament Bill should have its full effect, that these Bills should all be passed in the first two years. Therefore they must be crammed through with the guillotine, the closure, and the "kangaroo" over the bodies of the Opposition, and then they will be sent up to your Lordships' House. That will be considered to be the free discussion of a representative institution. That is the kind of thing which is supposed to be an improvement upon our ancient Constitution.<lb/>
I earnestly recommend to the Government a contemplation of the absurdity of the position in which they are really placed. Let them say that at any rate on one of the three occasions on which a Bill is driven through the House of Commons that House shall have full opportunity of discussing it. It is not only that Bills will be crammed through in the first two years, but probably they will all be put through the second or third time by a single Resolution. I do not think that what I am saying
<col>34</col>
is the least extravagant. It is very likely to happen, and yet the noble Viscount seriously talks of what he calls the give-and-take of political discussion. There will be no opportunity of give-and-take; there will be no discussion to speak of, and Bills will be sent up here and driven through your Lordships' House by the procedure of the Parliament Bill. Although I have said this much, I must honestly say that I cannot recommend my noble friend to press his Amendment. So far I agree with the Government that changes of procedure in the House of Commons ought to be carried out by the House of Commons. That must be so. But that does not relieve the Government of the absurdity of their position in proposing a Bill such as this is in the face of the guillotine and the "kangaroo" in another place. Still, I cannot think that my noble friend will be well advised in trying to improve the House of Commons against its will. Let them be content with the humiliation of their own position.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00174">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00175"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member> moved an Amendment that a Public Bill "may" after it has been rejected for the third time by the House of Lords "and after it has been submitted to the judgment of the electors and approved by them, if the House of Commons so determine" be presented to His Majesty and become an Act of Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00176">The noble Lord said: There are three kinds of Amendments which we have been trying to discuss this afternoon. One is a form of Amendment which postulates such a preposterous state of things that no Government, much less a Radical Government, would ever dream of agreeing to it. Then there is a form of Amendment which strikes so much at the principle of the Bill that noble Lords opposite cannot agree to it; and there is another peculiar kind of Amendment which militates so much in favour of the Radical Party that they cannot even agree to that. But there is not the slightest disposition to concede anything with regard to any of them. I do not find fault with that attitude in the slightest degree. I must admit I have great sympathy with the frame of mind that noble Lords opposite have displayed in being uncompromising on this matter. I cannot conceive the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0022"/>
<col>35</col>
use of altering your policy in order to try and suit the views of people who do not agree with you.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00177">This Amendment which I now move is, no doubt, a root Amendment to this Bill, and we have been told that we ought not, having agreed to the Second Reading of the Parliament Bill, to propose root Amendments to this measure. I do not ask noble Lords to take the trouble to read what I said, because it is very likely not worth reading; but if noble Lords opposite will look at the few remarks I was privileged to make on the Second Reading of this Bill, they will see that I doubted the wisdom of reading the Bill a second time, and I told the noble Marquess on the Front Opposition Bench that if he saw fit to move the rejection of the Second Reading he would have no more willing follower into the Lobby than myself. I fully admit that my Amendment is a root Amendment to this Bill. I am not very well versed in the practice of amending Bills, but I am not sure it is not something of a new doctrine to say that once you have agreed to a Second Reading you should be precluded from moving anything like a root Amendment to the Bill afterwards.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00178">I will read the way in which I ventured to propose that Clause 2 should run in the very unlikely event of my Amendment being adopted. It will read in this way&#x2014;
<quote>"&#x2026; that Bill may, after its rejection for the third time by the House of Lords, and after it has been submitted to the judgment of the electors and approved by them, if the House of Commons so determine, be presented to His Majesty and become an Act of Parliament," and so on.</quote>
Then a little lower down I have a definition of what I mean by any Bill being submitted to the judgment of the electors. If your Lordships will look at page 4 of the Amendments you will see that I propose to insert a new subsection to the effect that&#x2014;
<quote>"A Bill shall be deemed to have been submitted to the judgment of the electors and approved by them if after it has been passed by the House of Commons and rejected by the House of Lords three times
<ol>
<li>(1) a general election has taken place and the Bill is again passed by the House of Commons; or</li>
<li>(2) the Bill has been directly referred to the electors in manner to be hereafter provided by Act of Parliament and has been approved by a majority of the electors voting."</li></ol></quote></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00180"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: Yes. I do not understand the eventuality the noble Viscount alludes to. We will suppose that a Government has sent a Bill up to the House of Lords, and that it has been rejected by them three times. It is then submitted to the electors at a General Election, or by means hereafter to be provided by Parliament, meaning the Referendum; and, assuming it has been passed by the required majority of the electors, then if the House of Commons, not necessarily the new House of Commons, so determine, that Bill may forthwith be presented to His Majesty and become an Act of Parliament. This right of reference to the people is, in my humble judgment, the absolute minimum of what is consistent with any respectable system of double-Chamber government, and unless you have in this House the right of referring back to the electors of this country, you are assenting to a state of things which is nothing more or less than single-Chamber government pure and simple, disguise it how you may in Bills like the Bill which is before us at the present moment. I say that no legislator, whether he is hereditary or whether he is elected, will care to have a seat in a Second Chamber which has not got this right, and it will reduce the House of Lords to an Assembly in which men will sit who do not command the confidence of the electors of this country. Of course, I know quite well that this matter of reference to the people touches the whole root of the controversy between the two parties. There are two ways in which the right that I wish to see retained can be preserved, either by the people being consulted by means of a General Election, or else by the Referendum which I have foreshadowed in the new subsection which I propose should be inserted. The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, made an interesting speech just now in which he rather criticised the method of referring Bills to the electors at a General Election.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00181"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: As the only method. I was not dealing with the noble Lord's Amendment. I was dealing with the particular one before us at that moment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00182"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: I quite understand. The noble Earl was rather finding fault with the hurly-burly of a General Election as not being the best method of ascertaining the true judgment and opinion of the people. I agree there is a great deal to be said for that argument, but, after all, I do believe that when the two Houses disagree and when there is a doubt about whether the country is in favour of this or that policy a Dissolution of Parliament is the best means of obtaining the judgment of the people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00183"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00184"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: I can quite understand Lord Russell being very much amused at that statement.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00186"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: I shall therefore take the opportunity, which I bad not intended doing, of traversing the remark the noble Earl made about this Bill having been before the people at a General Election. I absolutely and entirely deny the doctrine that a Bill can be said to be before the electors at a General Election unless the Bill has been thoroughly discussed and thrashed out in both Houses of Parliament. We are only just now discussing the Parliament Bill in its most important stage in the House of Lords. In fact, the discussion of the last few days is the first unclosured discussion of the Parliament Bill that has taken place in Parliament since the Bill was introduced, and that cheer that was just given with regard to a General Election being the proper means of testing the judgment of the people fits in with a good deal of what has been said with regard to the Referendum. I agree with a great deal of what has been said as to the electors not being able to form an opinion about a Bill at a Referendum; but if they cannot form a judgment about a Bill which has been discussed in Parliament and printed, how on earth can they form a judgment about a Bill which has not been discussed in Parliament and printed? I desire, above all things, to see some strong body in the shape of a Second Chamber which shall say whether or not
<col>38</col>
a Bill shall pass into law before it has been referred to the people.<lb/>
We are quite convinced that the people of this country will never put up with single-Chamber government, and that sooner or later they will demand that some authority or other shall be set up for the purpose of appealing from Philip drunk to Philip sober. If they cannot find that authority in a Second Chamber strong enough to refer certain measures to the people, they will have to go to the Sovereign and get him to decide between themselves and their representatives. That will be placing the Sovereign in a position in which he never ought to be placed, and, if we have anything to do with the settlement of this controversy, a position in which he never will be placed. This argument was brought out quite ably, if I may be allowed to say so, in the extremely weighty speech which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ashbourne, delivered on the Second Reading of this Bill, and it is an aspect of the subject that I do not think has been sufficiently brought to the front. Suppose a Bill has been passed by the House of Commons three times and rejected three times by the House of Lords&#x2014;that Bill is to be placed on the Statute Book at once. There has been, we will say, a great deal of agitation in the country about it, and it is obvious that one half, or probably more, of the electors of the country are dead against the particular Bill. The Cabinet of the day are very fond of their own Bills and do not like them criticised, and they will very likely stand firm, and that portion of the people who do not desire the Bill will have no alternative but to go to the Sovereign and ask him to exercise his prerogative of rejecting the Bill, and he will either have to agree to that demand and so go against the whole of his Ministers, or take the opposite course and know that he is going against the wishes of a very large number&#x2014;perhaps the majority&#x2014;of his own subjects. That is the reason why I shall press this Amendment to a Division, and get as many noble Lords as I can to follow me into the Lobby.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, suggested the other day that with the growth of democracy the Constitution would have to undergo some modification
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0024"/>
<col>39</col>
&#x2014;I believe I am not unfairly paraphrasing what he said. But I would ask him, Does he mean the democracy that votes with the Conservative Party, or the democracy that votes with the Radical Party, or the democracy of England?&#x2014;because the democracy of England is against you on this Bill by a considerable majority of electors. Does he mean the democracy of Scotland, or the democracy of Ireland, or the democracy over the water that finds the sinews of war which finances those people who have the Government under their thumb in the matter of passing Home Rule for Ireland? If this Bill is to become law without the power of reference being reserved to a strong Second Chamber to be set up in the future, it seems on your own showing that we shall have nothing more or less than single-Chamber government. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, speaking on the Resolutions about a year ago&#x2014;I can send him the quotation&#x2014;said that for all the great and real and effective purposes of government you have single-Chamber government already. Surely he is content with that. Why do noble Lords opposite wish to whittle down the powers of this House, which are already smaller than the powers of any Second Chamber in any other responsible Government in any part of the world?<lb/>
I will say no more about this matter, because I fear that I have already been speaking far too long. It is tempting to go into this controversy all over again, but as I have no doubt that I shall have an opportunity of doing so on some future occasion I will content myself at present with protesting against the principle contained in this Bill, and stating that I shall press my Amendment to a Division. And if it is not accepted by noble Lords opposite, and I feel that I have behind me a good measure of support in your Lordships' House, there will be no alternative for me but to move the rejection of the Bill on Third Reading or vote on the same side as any other noble Lord who moves the rejection of the Bill. I beg to move the first of the Amendments standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00188"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I always listen with interest to what falls from the noble Lord, and I certainly did so with more than usual interest on this occasion because the noble Lord has told us frankly that if he could have done it without parting company with his Leader he would have voted against the Second Reading of the Bill. Since the Amendment of the noble Marquess was put on the Paper I have always thought that that was the more intelligible course&#x2014;I am not sure I could not use a stronger adjective, but I do not want to cause a difference of temper. The noble Lord said boldly what a great many of your Lordships, I have no doubt, thought&#x2014;perhaps the majority. But then he said he knew quite well that he would look in vain for any concession from His Majesty's Government in respect of this Amendment. The noble Lord made about the most extraordinary demand I ever heard of in the whole course of my Parliamentary life. He says in one sentence: "This Government will not make any concession, will not listen to a compromise, and yet they will not support an Amendment which strikes at the very root of the Bill!" What a glorious field for concession and compromise!<lb/>
I do not know whether your Lordships have mastered the effect of the noble Lord's Amendment. It is insisting upon either a General Election or a Referendum, and on a Fourth Reading. The procedure, if the noble Lord's Amendment were carried, would be this. There would be the three sessions spread over two years; then there would be the Referendum, and then the House of Commons would have to determine, which would mean practically a Fourth Reading, what action they would think fit to take as the result of that Referendum. You may well say that strikes at the root of the Bill. The Amendment is an impracticable one. I will not say any one in his senses, but any one who thinks carefully about these things, would never think for a moment of adding to the three sessions a Referendum or a General Election and a fourth decision on the part of the House of Commons. It is impracticable. As to the general ground which the noble Lord traversed in moving this Amendment&#x2014;whether we had a majority for the Bill, whether the Bill was before the country, and so forth&#x2014;I
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0025"/>
<col>41</col>
think I should be wasting the time of the House if I were again to enter into that wrangle and discuss whether we had a mandate or not. But there is the Bill which your Lordships have to consider, and you will, I hope, having allowed the Second Reading to pass without a Division, reject an Amendment which, as the noble Lord says, goes to the root of the Bill and cuts it up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00189"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, anticipated that the interesting and important proposal of my noble friend would give rise to a prolonged discussion. His suggestion is an ingenious one. I understand him to propose that after a Bill has been three times rejected by this House it should not be taken, as we propose in regard to certain cases, to a Referendum, but that there should be an alternative of sending it either to a Referendum or laying the Bill aside until such time as another Election has taken place, after which another decision of the House of Commons would be taken upon the measure such decision to be final and conclusive. If we had been at the beginning of our discussions, and particularly if there was any prospect of coming to an agreement with noble Lords opposite in regard to these matters, this proposal of my noble friend might, I think, well have formed the basis for an exchange of ideas. But we receive no encouragement from the Front Bench opposite in that direction. That being so, it seems to me desirable that we should limit our suggestions&#x2014;suggestions, I mean which proceed from the Bench behind me&#x2014;to those which are already upon the Paper, which differ upon fundamental points, I am sorry to say, from the scheme of my noble friend.<lb/>
The proposal of my noble friend, in the first place, has reference, not to a particular class of Bills which he desires to reserve for special treatment, but to all Bills of whatever description. That certainly is a very much wider proposal than anything we have ventured to suggest. Our proposal is limited. Noble Lords may not think it sufficiently limited, but it is limited both as to the procedure to be adopted and as to the measures and the circumstances to which it is to be applied. Apart from this there is, I think, undoubtedly some inconvenience in the plan of holding up a considerable number of Bills passed
<col>42</col>
from time to time through the House of Commons during the earlier years of its Parliamentary existence, and submitting the whole of those Bills <i>in globo</i> to the electorate. The reason why many of us prefer to resort to a Referendum rather than to a General Election is that in our view by means of a Referendum it is possible to focus the decision of the voters, and to disentangle an important issue from a number of other issues which may at the time be more or less present to the mind of the country.<lb/>
Under the plan of my noble friend this is what would happen. His Majesty's Government would pass measure after measure; force them through the House of Commons; and then when the time came they would go to the country, not upon one particular issue, but upon the whole collection of issues carefully accumulated for the purpose of influencing different sections of the electorate. I have before now had occasion to welcome the intervention of the noble Lord on the Back Bench opposite, Lord Marchamley. I welcomed it to-night again, because he, speaking with exceptional knowledge of the manner in which these things are managed by the Party Whips, gave us a friendly warning. He told us exactly what would happen, and I must say think my noble friend Lord Willoughby must have been a little impressed by the statement of the noble Lord. We have passed the Second Reading of this Bill, and although we do not conceive that by so passing it we are precluded from suggesting important changes in its provision, we desire to avoid supporting any changes which can be fairly described as going to the root of the Bill; and I noticed that my noble friend, with that candour which distinguishes him, told us at the outset of his remarks that this was in his own opinion a root Amendment. For that reason, my Lords, and as we have a proposal of our own upon the Paper for dealing with those measures which we desire to exempt from the extremely drastic treatment of the second clause of this Bill, I am afraid that I cannot go into the Lobby with my noble friend if he presses this Amendment to a Division.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00192">Resolved in the <i>affirmative</i>, and Amendment disagreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00193"><member>LORD SALTOUN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the object of the Amendment which I rise to move is to add to the procedure proposed in Clause 2 a submission to the Parliamentary electors of a Bill which has been three times passed by the House of Commons and three times rejected by the House of Lords. As the clause stands, the Bill would pass into law without ever having been before the electors of the country. I think that has already been pointed out by my noble friend Lord Willoughby. I should like to call attention to the fact that an instance in point would be the Home Rule for Ireland Bill. Mr. Asquith, in the House of Commons on April 20, said that he would use the machinery of this Parliament Bill for the purpose of passing the Home Rule Bill through the
<col>44</col>
House of Commons. I will not read you the quotation, but that is what he said. Whenever a Home Rule Bill has been before the country it has been rejected by the electors. I know it is claimed by Mr. Asquith that during the last election he got a vote on the subject, but that view cannot be maintained, and I repeat that every time such a Bill has been before the electors of the country it has been refused by them. Yet Mr. Asquith proposes to use the machinery of this Bill when it is passed for the purpose of carrying a Home Rule Bill, a Welsh Disestablishment Bill, or any other Bill which has never been before the country at all.<lb/>
The other day Lord Balfour of Burleigh, in his speech on the Second Reading of the Referendum Bill, pointed out that the constituent parts of the Government of the country were three in number&#x2014;the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0027"/>
<col>45</col>
King, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the House of Commons. This Bill proposes to do away entirely with the second of those constituent parts, or, at all events, to do away with it excepting as a drag on what may be passed by the Government of the day in the House of Commons. That is the utmost that will remain to this House. Let me quote from Lord Balfour again. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"The modern theory is that the Sovereign acts on the advice of his Ministers."</quote>
The result is that when this Bill becomes law the House of Commons will remain the only authority in the country for the purpose of government. It will become entirely a one-Chamber Government, and your Lordship's House, as I have pointed out, will be rendered useless except as a drag on legislation. I think that for these reasons it is absolutely necessary that we should have some sort of restraint on the Government, who might otherwise carry anything into law without consultation with the country, and without any, or very little, obstruction or hindrance from any other of the three constituent parts of the Realm.<lb/>
I suggest very diffidently that the Referendum should be adopted. It has sometimes been said by Radical leaders that this policy of the Referendum is an entirely new policy in the mouths of the Unionist Party. I should like to point out&#x2014;I dare say many of your Lordships will remember it&#x2014;that so long ago as July 7, 1893, when the last Home Rule Bill was before the House of Commons, Lord Salisbury, in a speech which he made at the Junior Constitutional Club, said&#x2014;
<quote>"I am a strong believer in the necessity of a Second Chamber, and yet I doubt whether the whole of the stress of resisting the great Constitutional attack ought to be thrown upon such a Chamber. I think we ought to have some power of appealing to a far mightier tribunal&#x2014;namely, to the opinion of the nation itself. That power exists in almost every other Constitutional Government in the world. It exists in Switzerland, France, America, Sweden, Norway, Holland, Belgium, and Greece. Whenever the foundations of the country itself are to be dealt with and attack is intended upon them by one form of machinery or another the nation are called into council upon this issue, and this issue only, and asked whether it will have it so. I confess I think the nations who are in that condition are in a safer position than ourselves, and I earnestly hope that the attention of the lovers of the Constitution in this country may be drawn to the question whether under the changed circumstances&#x2014;whether considering that the House of Commons now works without the faintest regard to the considerate and honourable traditions by
<col>46</col>
which it was formerly influenced&#x2014;we do not now require some more definite technical and absolute safeguard that the Constitution, by which the nation lives, shall not be changed without the nation's will."</quote>
I think that is a very clear indication of what was in the late, Lord Salisbury's mind. That occurred nearly eighteen years ago, and I do not think the subject has been really dropped since then. It is always being spoken about. But, my Lords, Mr. Asquith himself said in the House of Commons that he had been coquetting with the Referendum. These are his words&#x2014;
<quote>"I admit that, speaking on Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Resolution three year's ago, I have coquetted with the Referendum, and I say quite distinctly that I reserve the question of the appropriateness and the practicability of what is called the Referendum as possibly the least objectionable means of untying the knot in some extreme and exceptional Constitutional entanglements. But I am now speaking of the Referendum as a mode of escape from what I call the ordinary or everyday deadlocks of our present Parliamentary System, and as an expedient for dealing with that situation I confess I think it altogether inadequate."</quote>

Balfour of Burleigh, and that on that occasion the Leader of the Opposition spoke guardedly of the merits of the Referendum as embodied in Lord Balfour's Bill, but concluded by saying that he could not himself go into the Lobby in support of it. I am not mentioning that as any reason for debarring the noble Marquess from saying what he chooses upon his own responsibility with regard to the Referendum. Of course, that is perfectly open to him; but it was the universal feeling, I think, in the House that Lord Balfour of Burleigh took a wise course when he assented to the suspension of his Bill. We had two debates upon it and it was pretty fully discussed, and the end of it was that the House, it was evident, did not like it and would not assent to it. The noble Lord introduces this Amendment I think rather inconveniently, if he will allow me to say so, at this stage of the Bill. The question will be raised in a more immediate and practical form, with fuller knowledge and recognition of all its bearings when the noble Marquess comes to move his Amendment, and therefore I hope the noble Lord will not think me wanting in respect to him if I say I would rather not discuss the Referendum at large in connection with his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00196"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount referred to the reception given in this House to the Bill introduced earlier in the session by my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh dealing with the question of the Referendum. Upon that occasion most of us on this side of the House expressed our favourable opinion of the Bill so far as the use of the Referendum was concerned, and we remain of that opinion. But my noble friend's Bill dealt, of course, with two aspects of the case. There was the question of the machinery of the Referendum, and the question of the occasions on which the Referendum might be resorted to. It was with regard to the latter point particularly that some of us felt that we were not, at any rate without further consideration, prepared to support Lord Balfour of Burleigh. For that reason, and for that reason only, not because we were in any sense indifferent to the Referendum in principle, we counselled him to adjourn the discussion of his Bill. I merely say that because we should be sorry if our action upon that occasion were to be misinterpreted.<lb/>

I am in strong sympathy with my noble friend Lord Saltoun upon this matter, and I venture to agree with the noble Viscount when he says that my noble friend deserves credit for having had the courage to address himself to this important matter and to put a carefully thought-out Amendment upon the Paper. I have supported the Referendum in my place here, and I shall be ready to support it again, for I am indeed convinced that the Referendum is destined to occupy an important place in the Constitutional machinery of this country, more especially in regard to legislation dealing with the Constitution itself. But, my Lords, I have ventured myself to put upon the Paper an Amendment dealing with this subject, and my noble friend has, I have no doubt, observed that what we who are in favour of my Amendment contemplate is a limited use of the Referendum. My noble friend, as I understand his Amendment, proposes a universal resort to the Referendum upon all occasions of persistent difference and without any limitation. Obviously, having committed ourselves to the view that the Referendum should be used only on limited occasions, we are unable to vote with my noble friend to-night when he proposes that it should be used upon all occasions. For that reason, and for that reason only, I venture to express my hope that my noble friend will not ask us to divide.</membercontribution></p>

<col>49</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00200">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Amendment of which I have given notice touches such an important matter that I most heartily wish it had fallen to the lot of some one to propose it to your Lordships who had more weight in the House than I can claim, and a power of pleasing you which I do not possess. The object of this Amendment is, as your Lordships are aware, to exclude from the operation of this clause Bills on a certain small number of specified objects, except on the conditions which are stated in the last few lines of the Amendment. We have been told by the Lord Chancellor and others that all exemptions of this nature are objectionable, and as a general rule under normal circumstances I am not indisposed to agree with him. But there is an obvious propriety in putting some check upon great Constitutional questions being irrevocably dealt with under a stop-gap and temporary arrangement, and that the Parliament Bill does propose what is merely a stop-gap and temporary arrangement is, I think, admitted on both sides of the House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00201">As regards the subjects of the Bills to which this Amendment refers I need say but very few words. Substantially they are, with one important addition, all but identical with those mentioned, in different language, in the Amendment of my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition, and it will be sufficient to debate them when that comes before us. When that Amendment comes on there will be an opportunity of debating what Bills shall or shall not be made the subject of exemption. I would only say, in passing, that if any subjects at all are to be reserved for special treatment under the Act, that which I have added to those enumerated by the noble Marquess seems to me to deserve a place. I believe that in some respects there is no measure which would effect a greater revolution in the social and domestic and in some respects the political conditions of English life than the disestablishment and spoliation of the Church. But as that forms the subject of a separate Amendment which is to be moved by my noble friend Lord Halifax, it may be reserved for discussion on his Amendment. I will not, therefore, enter into that subject now, but will come at once to the last four lines of my Amendment&#x2014;that is to say, to the machinery which I propose in substitution for the Referendum as
<col>50</col>
proposed in the Amendment of the noble Marquess. I suggest a different treatment from his of the measures in question. I do so with the greatest deference to his position, his knowledge, and his practical skill in affairs and in the management of Parliament, but I do so, though with deference, with some confidence after a diligent, though it may be unprofitable, study of Constitutional history and Constitutional practice, to which I have devoted no little time during the last half century. I propose that, instead of these exceptional laws being submitted to what is still nothing but an indefinite and shadowy Referendum, they should not be passed into the category of those to be dealt with under the second clause unless they pass the House of Commons by a majority of two-thirds on each occasion that they are brought forward.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00202">In proposing this Amendment I do not wish to be understood as being in any way opposed to the Referendum. On the contrary, I believe that if carefully thought out and strictly limited to really great measures the Referendum may prove to be a salutary and useful instrument of government. But I am opposed to its introduction in this discussion at the present moment when it is doubtful what exact form it will take, and when it can only be dealt with and spoken of vaguely. It is so spoken of in the Amendment of my noble friend. He merely speaks of a scheme to be hereafter enacted by Parliament. What is to be in that scheme? He does not tell us, and the public at large will not know. Every opportunity is afforded for that scheme being misrepresented. Prejudice will be brought against it as it is brought against anything which is new; all manner of plausible arguments will be brought against it by the Government, and I believe that the cause of the opposition to this Parliament Bill will be a good deal weakened by the prejudice that may thereby be raised. Therefore if it were only for the purposes of this occasion I should say that the mode which I propose is safer and better than one which gives every facility for puzzling and perplexing the electors as to the real issue, because it is more intelligible. I think the course I propose is more suitable to an admittedly provisional state of things, but it has, moreover, some real advantages of its own.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00203">In the first place, I think the course I
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0030"/>
<col>51</col>
propose is likely to be less distasteful than the Referendum to the House of Commons, and more respectful to it. That House may well feel some jealousy of its decisions being subjected to an authority outside of Parliament, but it should feel none against a provision which only secures that its decisions are not, in matters of the gravest import, those of a bare majority of the Members present on any particular day, but of a substantial majority of the whole House. In the next place, it would be much more in consonance with the general practice of those States which, having written Constitutions, make provision for their amendment, which they usually though not universally do by providing that such changes can only be effected by a majority of something over half the whole number of the electors. Nor is it at variance with the practice of the House of Commons itself. The House of Commons, though it may object now to statutory provisions with regard to legislation, does not always do so. The requirement of a statutory majority in representative bodies, I am informed by a high authority on Constitutional law and Parliamentary practice, is not novel in English Law. For instance, local authorities are not allowed to incur any expense in relation to promoting or opposing any Bill in Parliament unless in pursuance of a resolution of an absolute majority of the whole number of the local authority, together with a local poll and other safeguards. Again, under what are known as the Wharncliffe Standing Orders of the House of Commons, and also of the House of Lords, when a company already constituted wishes to promote a Bill to alter its constitution or powers, the consent of three-quarters in number, and in some cases in value, of the shareholders must be shown to have been given. We all know in our ordinary dealings as directors of companies, or clubs, or other associations, that when any great change of the rules and regulations is proposed it is only by a majority of three-fourths, or at all events, by a majority exceeding a bare majority, that those alterations can be effected.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00204">Again, I think the scheme which I propose though I say so with great deference, has in one respect a real advantage over a Referendum. A Referendum must necessarily take place at once and immediately after the passage or rejection of the measure with regard to which the Referendum is
<col>52</col>
brought into operation, and while the country is still under the influence of the passions and prejudices excited by the discussion of the subject, and a decision may thus be arrived at very different from that which would result from a deliberate vote repeated three times in the course of two years by a substantial majority. This is not an imaginary danger. I will give one illustration, and one only, of my meaning The Ecclesiastical Titles Act of 1851 is now generally admitted by every one to have been an unwise and injudicious measure. It was never put in force, and it was repealed a few years later without a voice being raised in its favour. That Act could never have passed the ordeal which I now propose of three years consideration, and have gained every year a two-thirds majority in its favour; but if a Referendum had been taken on it in the Autumn of the same year in which it was passed, I have no doubt that that Referendum would have been entirely in favour of the Bill. It would have been pronounced upon under the influence of the passions, the delusions, and the madness which prevailed in the country at the time, and that risk, although I admit it would not always exist, is, I think, completely avoided by substituting the provision of a substantial majority three times repeated. A decision given by such a majority of the House of Commons on three separate occasions may, I think, really be accepted as the voice of the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00205">I object to this Bill. I altogether dislike it. But so far as the clause on which we are at present engaged is concerned, I should, with the qualification which I am now proposing, be content to accept it fully and practically. I believe that the House of Commons would never, even if it be in the same Parliament, in three consecutive sessions by a majority of two-thirds pronounce the same opinion unless it represented really the opinion of a majority of the people of England. A mere bare majority may be quite a different thing, and not represent a majority of the electors, but such a majority of the whole House as I propose would be in my humble opinion, and I think in the opinion of many others, a fair representation, and might fairly be taken to be an expression of the wishes of the electors and the people of England. I make a point, and a strong point, of its being
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0031"/>
<col>53</col>
two-thirds, or whatever number is determined, of the whole House and not merely of those who may happen to be present on a particular day. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, tells us not to quote the Long Parliament. I confess I have no particular wish to quote the Long Parliament, but I must say I was surprised to hear the noble Viscount make that remark. There are members of the Government from whom it would not have surprised me, but that Lord Morley, of all men, should tell us to treat history as an old almanac is the very last thing I expected to hear in this House. I thought no one was more penetrated than he with the value of the lessons that are to be drawn from the past for the guidance of the future; and notwithstanding his warning to keep clear of the Long Parliament I must say, with all deference to the noble Viscount, that I have not forgotten that when the House of Lords was, in 1649, abolished by a vote of the House of Commons, that vote was given in a House attended by seventy-six Members only. I do not say that those times are coming again. I trust they are not coining again; but, at the same time, what has happened once may happen again. When the noble Viscount says, "These are very different days, these are not times when you are to look for any violence or any such state of things as existed in the seventeenth Century," I trust he may be right, but I do not feel sure that he is not wrong. In 1639 or 1640 nobody would have said that that was coining which did come shortly after, and so a very short time before the French Revolution, though there were keen observers who saw what was coming, the outward surface of things looked as calm and as quiet as it does at this day. That is one of the lessons I have learnt&#x2014;that you never can tell from the immediate aspect that public affairs may wear what the aspect of those affairs may be three or four years later.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00206">Then there is another, and I think the most urgent, reason that can be put forward in support of the Amendment I have put down. It is this, that the scheme which I propose is much more intelligible to the mass of electors than the Referendum as at present presented to them would be. A Referendum comes to them objected to on many grounds, and on many plausible, grounds. The electors are told by His Majesty's Government that the Referendum
<col>54</col>
is an utter destruction of representative institutions and of the standing and privileges of the House of Commons. They are told by others that they should wait and see what is the plan which the noble Lord and his friends are going to propose to them. They will not be able until then to have a clear idea of it. How is it to be taken? What is it a Referendum of? There will be a great deal of doubt and obscurity, and it will be very easy for those who wish to keep the Parliament Bill untouched to suggest plausible causes for objecting to the Referendum. But if once you fairly and squarely put before the electors the simple question, "Do you wish that a bare majority of those members of the House of Commons present on any one day shall have the power, and the uncontrolled power, to pass measures which may affect the prerogatives and the existence of the Crown, the establishment of the Church, the establishment of the subordinate Legislatures, without any control, or do you wish that there should be some moderate check placed upon the passing of such Bills?" I have very little doubt what the answer of the country will be. I am sure, at any rate, that if the position was put thus squarely before them it would be the most advantageous step as far as the Opposition is concerned that could be taken, because then the question really at issue would admit of no doubt.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00207">It would then be evident to the meanest capacity that what His Majesty s Government insist on is that the House of Commons should have uncontrolled power except so far as our mere little temporary check for a couple of years stands against it&#x2014;that they should have uncontrolled power to deal with the succession to the Crown, with the Crown itself, with all other great Constitutional institutions by a mere majority. All that they are now asked is whether they will not ensure that there shall be a reasonably large and solid majority in favour of those propositions if they are to be carried at all. I do not say that the House of Commons will exercise to the full extent the power it is proposed to confer on it. I do not suppose it will&#x2014;at all events not for the present&#x2014;but yet we know strange things do happen. If this morning's newspapers are to be trusted, one noisy and conspicuous member of the House of Commons, though, perhaps, not a very wise one, told an admiring audience at Wigan, amid their delighted
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0032"/>
<col>55</col>
cheers, that the existence of a hereditary king was an insult to the intelligence of the people of England. There may be other Members of the House of Commons who follow him in that opinion&#x2014;though at present they are few. Is it the wish of your Lordships that there should be this uncontrolled power in the House of Commons? Certainly not. Is it the wish even of those who will vote for it? I do not believe it is. Is it the wish of His Majesty's Government itself? I hardly believe it is. I think really they must wish to have some moderate check other than the frail and futile and delusive barrier of the muzzled House of Lords against hasty legislation in the House of Commons with regard to these great subjects and these great interests. It is against the grant of such a power that I have argued, and I believe that this idea of a two-thirds majority would be much better understood in the country and would appeal to the country as a much more effective weapon at the present moment, and for the present emergency, than the Referendum.</p>

If this kind of Amendment is going to be persisted in, it seems to me that we might just as well have thrown the Bill out on Second Reading and have done with it.

I ventured to say, in the last few sentences with which I closed the debate on the Second Reading, that I did not believe&#x2014;and I believe it now less than ever&#x2014;that a course of whittling away all that is really vital in the Bill, by Amendments such as this, or that promised by the noble Marquess, would be regarded as treating the Government with even ordinary justice. Of that the noble Marquess may think further in connection with his own Amendment, which goes much nearer to cutting away the roots of the Bill&#x2014;the phrase used by Lord Willoughby de Broke&#x2014;than any of the Amendments that we are discussing this afternoon. The House knows what the purport of the Amendment of my noble friend on the Cross Benches is. It is to apply to a certain set of proposals the requirement of a two-thirds majority. I will not got into the list of measures to which he proposes to apply his Amendment. I need not say I do not get up for the purpose of defending the Referendum against the noble Lord. Quite the contrary. I think he has driven some holes, as far as he went, into the policy and action of the Referendum. I am not going into any one of the five individual measures to which he proposes to apply these restrictions. I may have something to say about them later, because
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0033"/>
<col>57</col>
some of them appear in the Amendment of the noble Marquess, but I do wish to point out to my noble friend and to anybody in the House who is inclined to agree with him what an impossible demand he makes upon Parliamentary conditions. What is that demand? There must be, he says, a two-thirds majority&#x2014;that is to say, a majority of two to one of the whole number of the members of the House of Commons, not of the members voting. On those figures nearly 450 members must vote. If every other member of the House outside of the 450 voted, there would be 220 left to vote against the proposal. What does that mean? You have 450 on one side and 220 on the other&#x2014;that means a majority of 230. That, I think, is sound arithmetic. But that is not all. Putting aside those who were ill, those who could not come, and, those who were indisposed to come for one reason or another, I think you might fairly conclude that this means that the working majority including persons absent from accidental reasons would have to be 300. Everyone must see that that is perfectly unreasonable, and could not be worked for a week in the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>

As to the topics to which he would apply that particularly exceptional procedure, I only wonder that my noble friend has put so few in his list. In the House of Commons there were, I think, between 20 and 25 withdrawals and exemptions from the operation of the Bill. To take out in this manner the whole contents, the whole of the living organs, of a Bill of this kind seems to me to be going rather far, and I am surprised that my noble friend has fallen into what I consider the rather mischievous delusion that that is a right way of dealing with a Bill to which you have agreed to give a Second. Reading. In no case can we accept my noble friend's Amendment. On another occasion I will

I think it does not lie at all in the mouth of the noble Viscount to reprove us. It is not as if the Government were willing to meet us on what may be called the lesser Amendments. On the contrary, they have exhibited nothing but a stone wall attitude to any Amendments we have proposed of any sort or description. We have heard of this Constitutional discussion fo many years, but one thing we thought the other side did give us credit for was that we were a Chamber of Revision. What kind of powers of revision have they granted us this last few days? One would think that we had no right to put Amendments of any sort into any Bill, and because this particular Amendment of my noble friend goes rather deeply into the Bill it is said that therefore it ought to be considered as being inconsistent with our having given a Second Reading to the Bill. I entirely protest. The object of debate is to concentrate the attention of the country on particular topics and on great subjects, and where the House thinks fit to bring forward Amendments it is useful and proper that it should do so in order that discussion should be concentrated upon them instead of ranging at large over the whole subject. That is, in my humble experience, what has always happened both in the House of Commons and here, and I do most respectfully protest against the assumption of my noble friend behind me and the noble Viscount opposite, that we ought not to be allowed to discuss fully the most important Bill that has ever been submitted to your Lordships in our lifetime.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00219"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, just before your Lordships adjourned for the dinner hour we had listened to a protest&#x2014;a timely, and, as I think, necessary protest&#x2014;from my noble friend Lord Salisbury against the doctrine which had just been enunciated by the noble Lord, Lord Montagu, sitting behind me, and which had been rather unexpectedly, and, I shall venture to argue, somewhat unfairly, echoed by the noble Viscount the Leader of the House. The noble Lord, Lord Montagu, told us that in his view it was a waste of time on the part of your Lordships' House to discuss such an Amendment as this. I venture wholly to disagree from that proposition and that attitude. Are we really to pass the whole of this
<col>60</col>
Bill <i>sub silentio</i>, without any right even to discuss serious and sober Amendments that are placed before us? The noble Lord appeared to argue that we were precluded by our vote upon the Second Reading of this Bill even from giving attention to such an Amendment as that proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Stanmore. Surely that is a most untenable and unwarrantable doctrine. I could understand the noble Lord arguing&#x2014;I do not think I myself would agree with him&#x2014;that by our vote on the Second Reading we were precluded from passing such an Amendment. That is a question of opinion which he is entitled to hold, but that we are to be precluded from discussing it in the serious spirit advocated by Lord Stanmore, who is speaking with knowledge and experience, is to my mind, a monstrous proposition. If there is an Amendment to this Bill to which this doctrine surely does not apply, it is this. Again, I could understand the noble Lord saying, "There are certain Amendments which have been proposed, or are going to be proposed, which in my view cut at the root of the Bill. You ought not even to consider them, because your vote on the Second Reading precludes you from doing so." But surely that view cannot in fairness apply to an Amendment like this.<lb/>
After all, what is it that the noble Lord proposes? He does not propose to take altogether out of the Bill a particular class of measure. On the contrary, lie proceeded with every moderation to argue that he only excepted measures not carried by a large and substantial majority as they passed through their final stage in the House of Commons. We are not responsible for this Amendment. The noble Lord occupies a position of independence upon the Cross Benches. He put down this Amendment without consulting us and argued it in a serious vein, and I submit it is only respectful to your Lordships that we who sit on this Bench should seriously consider it and give our reasons to the House for agreeing with it or the reverse. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley&#x2014;I thought rather hastily, and perhaps even rather unworthily&#x2014;snatched at this poniard with which we had just been scratched on the surface by Lord Montagu and endeavoured, with his accustomed ingenuity, to drive it home into our bosom. The noble Viscount is a very fair-minded man. Does he really contend
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0035"/>
<col>61</col>
that we are not entitled&#x2014;I speak for this Bench for a moment&#x2014;to discuss this proposal? After all, all that we are doing is to state our views upon the Amendment, to indicate its seriousness to the House, and, in reply to the rather perfunctory manner in which it was treated by the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, to suggest to your Lordships that there is, perhaps, something to be said for it.<lb/>
This little storm in a teacup which has arisen raises the whole question of the right and the wisdom of your Lordships in dealing in the manner you are dealing with the Bill at this stage. I have certainly been under the impression until an hour and a-half ago, not only that we were entitled seriously to discuss this measure, but that we had been invited and expected to do so by His Majesty's Government. I recall that more than once in our discussions they have said that they would consider Amendments to this Bill, that they would answer them with a consciousness of the gravity of the situation, and I did not know that any circumstance had arisen such as would justify us in supposing that the Government were indisposed to accept anything in the nature of an Amendment at all.<lb/>
May I recall, in connection with this, that as far back as November last&#x2014;because with me this has always been a <i>locus classicus</i> on this question&#x2014;in the debate on the First Reading of this Bill in your Lordships' House, the noble Earl, Lord Crewe, who was then the Leader of the House, stated most distinctly that although our opportunity at that time of discussing the measure was necessarily curtailed, yet the Government, if returned to power at the General Election then pending, would have the Bill reintroduced, it would pass through the ordinary procedure in both Houses, and an opportunity would be afforded in both Houses of proposing Amendments to the Bill. So strongly was I impressed by that pronouncement by Lord Crewe that, if I may venture to quote myself, in a speech which I made almost immediately following the noble Earl, I used the following words&#x2014;
<quote>"Yesterday I took note of one admission which fell from the noble Earl the Leader of the House. It was the passage in which he said that if his Party were returned to Power there would be opportunities given by which the Parliament Bill would be discussed freely over an ample space of time, with abundant opportunities for amendment in both Houses of Parliament."</quote>
<col>62</col>
Those were my words, and to those words the noble Earl, Lord Crewe, said "Hear, hear," which is the accepted method in either House of signifying your assent, not necessarily your enthusiastic assent but still your assent, to the proposition that is put forward; and I submit that on that occasion, Lord Crewe, as Leader of the House, did bind the Party opposite to listen to what we have to say upon this Bill, to consider our Amendments, and they did not preclude themselves, if we carried conviction to their minds, even from accepting Amendments to their Bill.<lb/>
So much in the way of prelude. The Amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Stanmore, is one of a class of Amendments put forward by various noble Lords in order to provide some sort of security against the danger by which we conceive the country to be threatened if this Bill passes into law. What is that danger? It is the risk that under Clause 2 of this Bill measures may, in the space of two years, be placed upon the Statute Book for which no mandate has been given by the country, of which the country may in reality disapprove, which this House of Parliament will be precluded under the altered Constitution from referring to the people, and which, once they have been placed upon the Statute Book, it may be very difficult at any later elate to erase therefrom. That is the central, pivotal, and dominating feature of this Bill. That is what we on this side of the House conceive to be not merely an innovation in our Parliamentary procedure, but a Constitutional revolution greater than has ever been accomplished&#x2014;I will not say attempted, but greater than has ever been accomplished&#x2014;in any considerable civilised State. If that be your Lordships' view of the case&#x2014;and there is a great deal to be said for it&#x2014;surely we are entitled to discuss in a reasonable spirit any solutions that may be put forward by responsible persons. And the noble Lord, Lord Stanmore, is a responsible person. He has been the Governor of considerable Dominions of the Crown. Surely we are entitled to consider in a serious spirit any suggestions that are put forward for remedying a situation which appears to us to be so grave.<lb/>
Under our existing Constitution the case of considering any such remedy does not, of course, arise, because however
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0036"/>
<col>63</col>
a majority in the House of Commons might in our opinion abuse its powers, there has always hitherto remained the security existing in the Constitutional powers and prerogatives of your Lordships' House. Hitherto, even had the Government in the House of Commons been disposed to behave in the manner which we think not impossible under this Bill, we have always had it in our power to reject a Bill, and, in the last resort, if the Government persisted in it, to force the matter to the decision of the people. That has been the great Constitutional safeguard in your Lordships' House of the liberties of the people of this country. Very well. For good or for evil&#x2014;I do not at the moment discuss that&#x2014;that security is going, if this Bill passes, to be taken away. Is it therefore an unreasonable thing that your Lordships should, on this one occasion when it is open to you to do so, consider the various remedies proposed to deal with that situation? That at any rate is the spirit in which I, and I think every one of the noble Lords who sit round me, have approached this question, and I deprecate most emphatically the attempt to shut our mouths when we are trying only to do two things&#x2014;firstly, to show the country, as it is our duty to do, the dangers which lie before us; and, secondly, to consider the methods, the only methods, by which in our view this Bill can be improved and some of its most dangerous features removed.<lb/>
In the discussions which we have so far had two methods have been either proposed or foreshadowed in Amendments to this Bill by which noble Lords think it might be deprived of some of its worst features. Some noble Lords have favoured the idea of exempting altogether from the operation of the Bill certain measures introducing fundamental or Constitutional change, and they have proposed with regard to those measures that the existing procedure of Parliament should be observed. That is a perfectly intelligible attitude. It is one which I understand will be taken up by the noble Viscount, Lord Halifax, who follows me a little later in the evening, when he proposes his Amendment with regard to the exclusion of the Established Church.<lb/>
There is another set of proposals designed to obtain the same ends by different means&#x2014;the proposals of the noble Marquess the
<col>64</col>
Leader of the Opposition. His idea is that measures of this grave character should not pass into law until they have been submitted to an appeal to the people. That is the second method. The noble Lord, Lord Stanmore, appears on the scene with his Amendment this evening, and he proposes a third method. As I understood him, he does not approve of either of the other methods of which I have spoken. He is not altogether in favour of the Referendum, and does not advocate a large number of exemptions from the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00220"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD STANMORE</member><membercontribution>: I am not in favour of the Referendum at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00221"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I am interested to know that the noble Lord is still open to conviction on that point. Anyhow, his idea is that if a measure of a grave character raising large Constitutional issues is to be passed into law under this Bill, it should only be so passed if it has behind it a majority, at crucial stages in the House of Commons, sufficient to make it certain that there is in the back-ground a substantial desire on the part of a large majority of the electors of this country for such legislation. That is his proposition, and although I do not personally favour his method of dealing with the question there is a great deal to be said in favour of it. Not only is it theoretically defensible, but it is supported, as your Lordships know, by the existing practice in other countries. It embodies a plan which is familiar in the Constitution of many of the great countries of the world not less democratic than ourselves, and a feature which is equally familiar in countries even more democratic than ourselves. I speak, of course, of our own Overseas Dominions, many of whom. borrowing their Constitutions from us and in some cases having had them suggested from Downing-street, have put into the instrument of their government provisions requiring that any measures of Constitutional change shall not be carried unless supported by majorities of two-thirds, or of a very considerable total. Therefore there is nothing unfamiliar, unconstitutional or dangerous in this proposal. The noble Lord, in his speech this evening, pointed out that a very important precedent might be found in the conduct of public companies in this country, many, of whom provide that
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0037"/>
<col>65</col>
the constitution of the company and the articles of association shall not be interfered with unless there is a majority of at least two-thirds in favour of such a step. Therefore, as I say, the idea of proceeding in this way is not an unfamiliar, but a familiar one.<lb/>
The question may be asked, Is this a genuine danger which we are trying to meet by this method, good or bad? Are your Lordships battling with windmills, or is there a substantial danger which you are endeavouring to combat? I will endeavour to answer that question, if it be put, by a concrete illustration. I will take the case of the Liberal Government, of which the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, was a member, that was in office between the years 1892 and 1895. He and I were both members of the House of Commons at that time. It was the Government that came into power under Mr. Gladstone, and continued in office under Lord Rosebery. I think I am right in saying that when that Government entered office it had a majority of about 40&#x2014;something between 30 and 40&#x2014;and that that majority dwindled year by, year from 30 to 20, from 20 to 15, and even to 10; and I recall as one of my happiest memories an occasion when I had the pleasure of assisting in a debate which for the first time reduced that majority to 9. But, such was the arrogance of the Government at that time, such was their confidence that they were the real representatives of the opinion of the people, that I remember one member of the Government&#x2014;I believe it was a noble Lord, afterwards in this House, whose death we all most sincerely deplore, I mean the late Lord Wolverhampton&#x2014;who, when the majority of the Government was fading away almost to nothing, went down to the country and said that the Government would be willing to carry on even with a majority of one. Perhaps the noble Viscount the Leader of the House remembers that astonishing statement.<lb/>
Now I come to my illustration. That was the Government which introduced the second Home Rule Bill in 1893. As your Lordships know, that Bill passed the House of Commons by the normal Government majority, and was then rejected by your Lordships&#x2014;a rejection which it is a matter of common consent met with the general approval of the country. Let us suppose this Bill had been in operation, and that Clause 2 of the Bill had existed.
<col>66</col>
The Home Rule Bill would have been carried, as it was carried, in the first session in which it was introduced by the Government, by a majority of between 30 and 40. It would then have come up to your Lordships' House and have been rejected. But, under the operation of this Bill, in the next session it would have been reintroduced into the House of Commons, and, so far as I can see, there would have been nothing to prevent its being carried again by a majority, perhaps less, but a majority that might have amounted to 20 or 15. Again it might have been rejected by your Lordships, and then in the third session it might have been brought forward again in the House of Commons. Indeed, the Irish party would have seen that it was so brought forward, and it might in the third session have been carried by a majority of ten or even nine. Had this Parliament Bill been law with this clause in it, that Home Rule Bill would have become the law of the land. Surely an illustration of that sort gives us material for thought. Surely it is a very serious consideration that a Hill of that momentous importance might conceivably, under the operation of such a law as this, have been carried into law, when we know perfectly well that the country was against it, and would have repudiated it with scorn. That such a state of things should be possible under any Constitutional system is, I venture to submit to your Lordships, something in the nature of a scandal; and it is to meet a scandal of this description that Lord Stanmore makes a serious proposal which is intended to secure that if the House of Commons in the future is to over-ride the House of Lords in the manner I have described, at least it shall only do so if the majority which carries a Bill through the House of Commons is not, to use the phrase of the Prime Minister himself, "a casual, transient, insignificant, precarious" majority, but is, to use the adjective which was employed by Lord Stanmore himself, "a solid and substantial" majority, fairly representing what would be regarded as the voice of the people at large. I appear to be making a case for a proposition with which I do not agree, but at the same time the House will excuse me for pointing out that the Amendment is not, as Lord Montagu says, a flippant or an improper Amendment. It is a serious Amendment which we are bound to consider on its merits.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00222"><member>LORD MONTAGU OF BEAULIEU</member><membercontribution>: I did not say it was a flippant Amendment and not serious. I said it was very serious indeed, and that if it was carried we might as well not have passed the Second Reading of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00223"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I am not going to advise that the Amendment should be carried. My recollection is that this Amendment was proposed in the House of Commons. It was there regarded as an Amendment of substance; it was argued by the great speakers on both sides; it received serious consideration by the Prime Minister, and although defeated on a Division it was certainly not looked upon as an improper Amendment to move. But what did the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, say this evening? He treated it in the most cavalier fashion. He said that it could not be worked in the House of Commons; that if the conditions proposed by Lord Stanmore in his Amendment were adopted, the number of those voting on behalf of a Bill would require to be 450, and that any Government which did not command a colossal majority would be paralysed. I think that is a very pertinent criticism. I think it is quite likely that the numbers proposed by the noble Lord may be wrong, but I understood him to say that he was not at all wedded to two-thirds. He merely put them forward as an illustration of the principle, and if the matter was going further&#x2014;I do not suppose it will&#x2014;I imagine the noble Lord would be ready to introduce such numbers as would be more acceptable and more fair. All that Lord Stanmore meant was that there should be required in the House of Commons a sufficient majority in order to make it reasonably certain that the people, who, after all, are those whom we have to consider, were behind a particular measure and supported its passage through the House of Commons. That it should be impossible to prescribe and define numbers and proportions in a Bill I am most reluctant to believe. After all, it has been done. It is the law in many other foreign countries, and I respectfully decline to subscribe to the doctrine, of which we hear too much in these debates, that plans and methods which are habitual and successful in other Parliaments are wholly unsuited to our own Parliament in this country. We may not have tried them because the occasion has not arisen, but we might try them in a modified way.
<col>68</col>
To rule them out as entirely unsuited to our own system is not, I think, an argument that ought to prevail in your Lordships' House. If there were any desire on the part of any Constitution-mongers to introduce such a method into our own system, I am quite convinced that it could without difficulty be done.<lb/>
I do not advocate the introduction of Lord Stanmore's method into the Bill because I do not myself agree with it, and because I think a better plan has been foreshadowed by the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne. The difference between the two is this. Lord Stanmore looks for his security to the judgment of the House of Commons. The noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, looks for his security to the power which is behind the House of Commons&#x2014;namely, the electors. He proposes to go to the higher tribunal and not to the lower, and to ask the people to decide. I hope, therefore, that the noble Lord on the Cross Benches will be content with the discussion that he has raised, which I think has not been an unfruitful discussion. I hope he will be content with the excellent speech that he made in favour of his Amendment. And if he does not persist in dividing upon it, an opportunity will be afforded him at a later stage&#x2014;and the noble Lord said he was still open to conviction&#x2014;of voting for the Amendment of the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, which will really meet his case, and which will be much more consonant with sound democratic principle.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00224"><member>THE EARL OF CLANWILLIAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, Lord Curzon has spoken of the protest which was made by Lord Montagu of Beaulieu. That protest has also been raised from the Front Bench. May I, as a Back Bencher, enter my protest against the sentiment expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Montagu, who rather questioned the honesty of your Lordships in introducing Amendments into this Bill after the Second Reading had been passed. I cannot agree with Lord Montagu. I think the expressions he used might have come more fitly from the Benches opposite, but certainly not from this side. There is no question that when the Second Reading of this Bill was before your Lordships' House we on the Back Benches, at any rate, understood that we should be given every opportunity of proposing or opposing Amendments&#x2014;not Amendments
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0039"/>
<col>69</col>
which would have been what I may call finicking, but Amendments which would cut at the root and branch of this Bill, and which Lord Montagu so strongly objects to. I cannot see the advantage of introducing Amendments which would not cut at the root and branch of this Bill. Therefore I think that the protest of Lord Montagu is certainly misplaced so far as many of us who sit on the Back Benches are concerned. If we had not been given to understand that this Bill could have been amended, we would never have thought of giving it a Second Reading. I only rise to say this in, case the Front Opposition Bench might have thought that all of us who sit on the Back Benches were of the same opinion as the noble Lord, Lord Montagu. I certainly am not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00225"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD STANMORE</member><membercontribution>: It is not my intention to press this Amendment to a Division. As regards the subjects to be excluded from the operation of the clause, we shall have them brought before us fully by my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition; and upon the one subject which I wished to add to those in his list we shall have a debate immediately on the Amendment of the noble Viscount, Lord Halifax. Therefore on that I have nothing more to say. My object in bringing forward this Amendment is, I think, answered. My object was to bring to the serious notice of the members of the Opposition and of the Government, but specially of the members of the Opposition, the difficulties which attend any appeal to the people at this moment and in recommending to them any adoption of the Referendum which has not yet been established or even proposed, except by my noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh, in any concrete form. I have to correct my noble relative Lord Curzon on that point. I never said I was opposed to the Referendum. Quite the reverse. I am in favour of it as a subsequent feature of our reformed Constitution, but I say that at present the time is not opportune, and that if your Lordships insist on that as the only remedy for the evils we all wish to prevent, the voters will be perplexed and puzzled, and will be much more unlikely to understand the matter than if you were to apply the method of the two-thirds majority.<lb/>
My noble friend the Leader of the House dwelt chiefly in his speech upon statistics, and sought to show that this method of the
<col>70</col>
two-thirds majority was unworkable. I should like to ask him, if it is unworkable here, how is it that it is found to work, and does work, in the Constitutions of many other countries? If it can work there, it can work here. Moreover, it seemed to me that the noble Viscount rather confounded the majority of two-thirds which would have been necessary to give force to a Bill of this description with the majority which would be actually and habitually at the beck and call of the Government. It is exactly because it would be a majority largely not at the beck and call of a Government, but a majority of the whole House, that I made my proposal. That is something quite apart from the ordinary Party majority. I quite admit you could not expect to have a Party majority of 400, but you may have that majority in the whole. House if the nation outside agrees on the desirability of the thing. As I said, I do not wish to press this Amendment to a Division, but I hope I have expressed the strong feeling I entertain as to the relative intelligibility of the two schemes that could be put before the electorate.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00228">The noble Viscount said: My Lords, I think no one can have followed the course of this debate without being convinced that it would be quite possible, under cover of what could not be denied to be a Money Bill, very largely to disestablish the Church of England without any possibility of interference on the part of your Lordships' House. I also think that under the remaining provisions of the Bill it will be perfectly possible completely to disestablish and disendow the Established Church of Scotland and the Church of England without any reference of such grave and important matters to the opinion of the country. It appears to me to be idle to say that these dangers are imaginary and
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0040"/>
<col>71</col>
not substantial ones. We have been told quite distinctly that when the Parliament Bill becomes law, if it becomes law, and when Mr. Redmond's requirements have been satisfied, a Bill for the disestablishment and disendowment of an integral part of the Church of England is to be forced through this House. I therefore think that the dangers which my Amendment has in view are real dangers, and dangers which it is the duty of this House to guard against. In saying this, I cannot forget our experience in regard to what has indirectly been attempted, and indeed accomplished, to secure objects which could not be carried by direct legislation. It has already been alluded to in the course of the debate this evening. We know very well that what could not be carried by the Licensing Bill was effected by the Budget.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00229">We have all been assisting at the ceremony of the King's Coronation. At that Coronation, which the King himself has told us was the "most solemn day of his life," the King entered into engagements to his subjects, and his subjects entered into solemn engagements with the King. Among them were engagements to protect the rights and position of the Church of England. I am not pretending to say that those engagements are not susceptible of alteration, but I do say confidently and without the fear of any serious contradiction that before those engagements are altered, before a Bill is presented to the King to ask his assent to an alteration of those engagements, the definite desire and will of the country ought formally and distinctly to be ascertained. I cannot conceive any one denying that proposition. I beg your Lordships to remember that it is not a slight change that is covered in the Amendment I am bringing before the House to-night. It is a change which goes to the very root of all the relations which have existed in this country since this nation was a nation. It is a change which, if carried into effect, will affect every single parish in Great Britain, and before such a change is carried into operation the people of this country should be consulted upon it. That is the scope of my Amendment. I think it is a small thing to ask that the people of this country should be directly and definitely consulted upon a matter of such vital importance, one which affects the whole interests of the country, and that such a matter should not be left to a majority in the House of Commons
<col>72</col>
when there is no kind of security that it really represents the considered mind of the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00230">Let me remind your Lordships of the history of the Education Bill, because it is extremely apposite to this point. The Government came into power with, I suppose, one of the largest majorities on record. The first thing it did was to introduce an Education Bill. We were told that the Education Bill represented the will of the country. The reverse proved to be the fact. The Government were responsible for three or four educational proposals. They were all different one from the other, and therefore it is quite impossible that they can all have represented the mind of the country. All those educational proposals proved to be proposals which the country did not wish to see carried into effect, and they were therefore abandoned. So far as the educational proposals of the Government have been concerned, they have been wiped off the slate. Had the Parliament Bill been law, the reverse would have happened. The Education Bill would have been passed in the House of Commons, it would have been carried over the heads of your Lordships' House, and the country would have found itself involved in changes which it did not really desire. I think it is the duty of this House, not in its own interests, not in the interests of the position, however important that position may be, which this House has hitherto occupied, but in the interests of the nation, to see that proposals which so vitally affect the interests of the whole of the population of this country as would be proposals to disestablish and disendow the Church of Scotland and the Church of England, should not be passed until they have been referred to the reason and settled convictions of the country, and until the country has shown that it really and honestly desires that legislation on those lines should proceed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00231">This House has great traditions behind it. There have been moments in the history of this country&#x2014;critical moments&#x2014;when this House has stood forward as defenders and guardians of the rights of the whole of this country as against a party or a class. My Lords, I think such an occasion has occurred to-day. I believe the Government would be well advised in their own interests if they accepted my Amendment. I make an earnest appeal

<col>73</col>
to the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition in this House that he will include the substantial words of my Amendment in the Amendment which he himself is shortly to propose. It is adding but one to the subjects which are already included in his Amendment, and that subject is one which is dear to the hearts of many of the inhabitants of this country. I do not know what the result of our present troubles is likely to be, but if those troubles lead to an election I assure&#x2014;and I speak with some knowledge of the facts&#x2014;that the fact that Lord Lansdowne should have definitely included among the subjects which are mentioned in his Amendment the substance of my Amendment will be gratefully remembered by hundreds and thousands of people throughout the length and breadth of this country. This House should show itself at such a moment and at such a crisis prepared to defend such interests as are the subject of this Amendment. It is a duty which all the friends of the House of Lords in the country expect from it, and it will not decline that duty without grievous loss to itself.</p>

I will take three cases by which to test the argument of the noble Viscount. The first I will take is the case of Scotland. He
<col>74</col>
includes the relations of Church and State in Scotland in the scope of his Amendment, and proposes that no measure should pass without being subjected to the Referendum, which will include, of course, the people of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Now, at this moment there are going on in Scotland negotiations between two great Churches&#x2014;the Church of Scotland (the Established Church of the country) and the United Free Church&#x2014;and the two bodies have come much nearer each other than ever before. Nobody can predict whether a final agreement will be arrived at or not. The matter is working itself out, and it has created deep interest on the part of the public. Supposing they get to an agreement, it may be upon the basis that very considerable modifications will be made in the relations of Church and State as they exist to-day in the case of the Established Church, and that, on the other hand, very considerable modifications will be reciprocally conceded by the United Free Church in the attitude which a large number of its members have hitherto preserved towards the whole question.<lb/>
The result may be a proposition for placing the relations of the Church and State on a footing that gives more freedom. That question comes in the shape of a measure to this country. What happens? There is a large party which says that there is danger in these relations, and that it is not right to allow a latitude which, by analogy, will encourage those who wish complete freedom in religion in its connection with the State, to put forward every kind of doctrine in England. There will be others who will say it is not right to make any compromise with the principle of the relations of the Church and the State, and there will be still others who will take different shades of view about it. No question could be submitted to the electors on which there is likely to be more prejudice and more difficulty, considering that the electors in England and in Ireland know very little about the controversy in Scotland which has been going on for many years, and which profoundly interests the people. I can conceive no subject less suited to be taken and placed in a category by itself than this question of the relation of Church and State in Scotland if, as is at any rate possible, the parties in Scotland should come to an agreement. It will require the good sense of Parliament, good sense which, I think, will not
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0042"/>
<col>75</col>
be wanting, to give effect to the measure upon a statesmanlike footing.<lb/>
I take another case bearing upon the past. In 1868 Mr. Gladstone brought forward his proposals for the Disestablishment of the Irish Church, proposals which admittedly had been before the country and which had received the verdict of the country after the most searching argument. Would it be right, would it be tolerable, that after that measure had been specifically before the people of this country and had been examined and searched out, that it should be again submitted in a much less considered fashion to people who had much less opportunity of considering it than was the case during the discussions in that great General Election? Surely there, again, you have an illustration of a case in which the very best machinery for deciding the question was the machinery of Parliament.<lb/>
I come to the third case, this time not of the past but of the future. I take the question which I suspect really underlies this proposal&#x2014;the question of Welsh Disestablishment. About that there will be a great deal of controversy, and a great deal of dispute. No one can deny that the Welsh, who, after all, are the people chiefly concerned, by a large majority desire that the relations between the Church and State within their own Principality should be put on a different basis from that of the rent of the country. Is it right to submit a question like that, essentially to be discussed by people who know the circumstances, who appreciate the feeling, who are acquainted with the traditions which have given rise to it&#x2014;is it right. I ask, to submit that to the very rough and imperfect tribunal of the Referendum? Why should these things be taken out of the general scope of this Bill? As for the question of the relations of Church and State in England, I do not myself regard that as a question that is likely to arise in an acute fashion for some time to come. One may be wrong, but at all events I see no reason why that question should be separated from other great questions which come within the purview of the method by which it is proposed to regulate the relations of the two Houses of Parliament in the future.<lb/>
The Amendment proposed by the noble Viscount suffers from one defect. He picks out one question in which he is
<col>76</col>
passionately interested, and one sympathises with that interest, and he puts it on a footing by itself. He seems to treat the relations between the Church and the State as being of the privileged class, and I presume he means that this should be cumulatively added to the Amendment of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition. But there are other questions of vast importance which might well have a claim to be treated in the same fashion. How can you justify treating the question of the relations of Church and State in a category by itself in the fashion proposed by the noble Viscount? Surely all this argument rests on a fallacy. The fallacy is this, that the desire of those who framed this Bill was to establish some harsh rule to which there ought to be a number of exceptions. We believe, those of us who are responsible for this Bill, that we have reached a period in which the country has pronounced that the relations between the two Houses of Parliament should be on a different footing from that on which they have been hitherto. I have already said that I regret that that situation should have arisen. It will be very difficult to replace the old state of things; but that does not affect the fact that it is necessary, and the country has pronounced it to be necessary, that there should be a new code of relations between the two Houses of Parliament; and if this Bill be no more than the crystallisation of what we believe to be the unwritten tradition of the relations between the two Houses, then surely there can be no justification for exceptions of this kind, and least of all for exceptions which would work out with the unfortunate consequences which I have attempted to describe in at least one or two instances which come within the scope of the Amendment proposed by the noble Viscount. For these reasons it is impossible for the Government even to entertain this Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

Halifax, into the Division Lobby, it is because we feel that in the Amendment to be proposed later on by the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, we find a sufficient security. I agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, that there are other large questions, and that it is a mistake to make certain exceptions. If you begin to make exceptions, you either leave out something, or You include too much, but if you take it that under this Bill certain subjects will be referred to a Committee to decide whether they are of sufficient importance, or whether they have been before the electorate, then I think we can safely rely, in the case of the Church in Wales, on the fact that it has not been before the electorate for the last twenty years. I hope the noble Viscount will not go to a Division on this point. I think it would be far wiser to include this matter in the Amendment that is to come.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00235"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF ST. DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to thank the noble Viscount opposite most cordially for his exceedingly impressive address, and, if I may venture to say so, I would thank also the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, for his instructive speech. Lord Haldane rather differs, think, from the President of the Board of Education as to the nearness of the time when the question of the Disestablishment of the Church of England would be before the country. The President of the Board of Education said rather gaily, not long ago at Nottingham, that&#x2014;
<quote>"Disestablishment would be a practical question in England at no distant date."</quote>
And Lord Haldane will remember that four years ago in another place a Resolution was passed, the majority running to three figures, in favour of the Disestablishment of the Church of England.<lb/>
I was exceedingly interested in the references which the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, made to those most exemplary negotiations which are going on in Scotland. I attribute that happy state of things there to the influence of Dr. Chalmers, who, however, would not have taken the view that Lord Haldane seems disposed to take upon this question. I venture to think that what is going on in Scotland, so far from being urged as an argument against the Amendment of Lord Halifax, is a strong reason why His Majesty's Government should not be in such a desperate hurry on these very important and delicate questions affecting the foundations of national life.
<col>78</col>
Then I must take exception to the noble Viscount's reference to the Disestablishment of that part of the Church of England which is situated in the Principality of Wales. I should have thought that Lord Haldane would have recognised that, as Mr. Gladstone said, you might as well speak of the Church of Wales in England as of the Church of England in Wales. Lord Haldane said that, after all, the people of Wales are chiefly concerned. They may be; but they are not solely concerned. As Viscount Halifax reminded us, the Prime Minister said a few months ago that it is the intention of the Government, in case the Parliament Bill is carried, to give the Welsh Disestablishment Bill such a position as would enable it to be passed in the present Parliament. I do not know whether Lord Haldane admits that one of the objects of passing this Bill is the desire of His Majesty's Government to pass Welsh Disestablishment and Home Rule for Ireland behind the backs of the people of this country. It is for Lord Haldane to say&#x2014;he is one of the members of the Government&#x2014;and then your Lordships will be able to consider whether his authority or that of the Prime Minister is the most weighty in this connection.<lb/>
I was very much interested in another reference which Lord Haldane made. He referred to the Irish Disestablishment Act of 1868, and so did the noble Viscount the Leader of the House. I think in the instructive speech which one would have expected from so distinguished a master of thought, not the least instructive part was his reference to "that most active and most fertile administration which came into power in 1868 and remained in power for six years." The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, reminded your Lordships that that "most active and fertile administration" passed seven measures of great magnitude, and that one alone had been submitted by the great Statesman who came into power in 1868 to the verdict of the country. I think the words he used were&#x2014;
<quote>"Irish Disestablishment, and that alone, was in the forefront of the election in 1868."</quote>
Now, it did surprise me that it did not occur to so great a master of thought that that was hardly a precedent for carrying out the Prime Minister's intention of passing Welsh Disestablishment into law without consulting the people about it. I was so interested in that reference that I turned
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0044"/>
<col>79</col>
up the debates upon Irish Disestablishment, and I think Mr. Gladstone said of Irish Disestablishment that it was a question whether it was not&#x2014;
<quote>"The most grave and arduous work of legislation that had ever been laid before the Legislature."</quote>
Although Wales is smaller than Ireland, I think that in certain respects Welsh Disestablishment is even more grave and arduous than was Irish Disestablishment. A previous Home Secretary said that "Welsh Disestablishment raises the whole question," and it is a question on which Lord Halifax has a perfect right to say that hundreds and thousands of the people of this country do feel acutely. They feel acutely that His Majesty's Government should propose with such a light heart to dismember the Church of England without consulting the people of this country about it.<lb/>
Now I come back to the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane. He said rather cautiously that the Welsh people are most chiefly concerned, but certainly he will admit that the English people are also concerned. May I say that no Act of Parliament created the relations between the Welsh Church and the State, and there has never been an Act of Parliament modifying in the slightest degree those relations; so that the Home Secretary was quite right in saying in another place, upon a discussion of an Amendment corresponding to this, that this was an "organic or Constitutional question." Let me call your attention to the contrast between the procedure of 1868, to which the noble Viscount, Lord Morley referred, and the procedure of His Majesty's Government at the present time. At that time, as Lord Haldane acknowledged, the question of Irish Disestablishment was discussed in every constituency in the country. What about the present time? May I ask whether Lord Haldane maintains that this question was before the country at the last election? Does Lord Haldane say that? [VISCOUNT HALDANE was understood to assent.] Very well. In what sense can that be said? The Prime Minister is a most distinguished member of a learned profession, a great lawyer. How did he put the matter before the country? He mentioned it once in one speech, just as if he was serving a subp&#x0153;na to appear in a County Court.<lb/>
Take the Home Secretary. His style is
<col>80</col>
not so dry nor so legal. He accomplished the brilliant feat of packing three statements which he would be proud to call "terminological inexactitudes" into one sentence of his first epistle to Dundee. And then three days afterwards he replaced two of those statements with further "terminological inexactitudes" of an airy character. I think I am right in saying that only twenty Liberal candidates in England and Wales mentioned this matter in any shape or form in their election addresses&#x2014;shall we say ten in Wales and ten in England? Is that bringing the matter before the country? Then, His Majesty's Government appointed a Royal Commission to enter into this question. One of the most powerful members, if not the most powerful member, of the present Government explained that you always must have a Commission to settle the facts. That, your Lordships may remember, was stated in the country and also in the House of Commons. Now, it is a very curious thing, if the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, is going to maintain that this was before the country, that for some reason or other which ordinary people have never yet been able to understand, but which, of course, the Government knows something about, the Report of the Welsh Church Commission only came out just at the election time. That means either one of two things&#x2014;either that the distinguished member of the Government to whom I have referred was quite wrong in explaining why the Commission was appointed, or Lord Haldane did not remember the speech of his colleague when he said this matter was before the country.<lb/>
I am not here to appeal to His Majesty's Government. I am of opinion that, though it is an unreasonable thing, they have made up their minds to have Welsh Disestablishment at any price before the people of the country have an opportunity&#x2014;in England as well as Wales&#x2014;to declare their minds about it. I do not quite go so far as another authority, much more competent to speak than myself, in saying that the conduct of His Majesty's Government will actually assist us in resisting their intention to Disestablish the Church in Wales, but I will say this, that it is not a straightforward way of dealing with the most ancient institution in this country. It is not right or fair to the people of the country. In the last resort, even under this Bill, we have two years in which to tell the people the truth, and I think His
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0045"/>
<col>81</col>
Majesty's Government will rue the day in which they declined to accept the reasonable Amendment of the noble Viscount, Lord Halifax.<lb/>
I hope, however, that the appeal which Lord Halifax has made to the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition will not be in vain in this sense. I understand that Disestablishment is one of the matters of great gravity included in Lord Lansdowne's Amendment, and if we are told definitely from the Front Opposition Bench that they do look upon this matter as a question of great gravity, I hope Lord Halifax will be content to support, as I am content myself to support, the Amendment Of the noble Marquess. But I shall never forget personally the debt of gratitude which all Churchmen owe to the noble Viscount, not for the first time&#x2014;those who agree with him in theology and those who do not&#x2014;for his speech on this occasion, as also for his services in connection with the Education Bill. As I said before, I think this Amendment moved by Viscount Halifax is reasonable. But with regard to the members of the Government in this House, there are reasons connected with the other House, why they, though I am sure they desire to personally do what is reasonable and just and honourable, are not able to do so on this occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00236"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, interesting as was the speech to which we have just listened, and full as it was of local Welsh colour, I think it would be a mistake if we were diverted from the main substance of the Amendment of the noble Viscount into considering the various points raised. They are not strictly germane to this Amendment, because this Amendment does not deal with the question whether a Bill shall not be allowed to be carried under the operation of this Bill unless it has been fully before the country. This Amendment, as does the Amendment of the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, deals with a certain class of legislation which is thought so important that it must be withdrawn from the general category, and that is the point we have to deal with to-day. I think it would be a pity to drift into a discussion of the merits or demerits of Welsh Disestablishment, and the exact proportion of sentiment there, and how far that question has been before the country either now or for a considerable number of years past. I cannot help thinking that this Amendment in substance
<col>82</col>
is not of very great importance. Subsection (<i>c</i>) of the Amendment of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition covers the case of a Bill&#x2014;
<quote>"which has been referred to the Joint Committee, and which in their opinion raises an issue of great gravity upon which the judgment of the country has not been sufficiently ascertained."</quote>
I maintain that if a Bill for what is popularly understood as Disestablishment were introduced, and if the Amendment proposed should take effect, the House of Lords, which would have the power of initiating a reference to the Joint Committee, would no doubt consider that Disestablishment Bill of sufficient importance to be so referred.<lb/>
I ask the House to consider for a moment the extreme width of the words in the Amendment of the noble Viscount, Lord Halifax. He deals with "any Bill" which affects the Established Church. A Bill may affect it to a very slight extent. I have running through my mind certain Bills which have become Acts, and which in a small way affect the Established Church of England. I will not trouble with Scotland or Ireland. They are out of the way for the moment. I will deal with the Church with which this House is most familiar&#x2014;the Church of England. Take the Test and Corporation Act, which had the effect of throwing open municipal corporations to dissenters. That was distinctly a Bill dealing with the Establishment of the Church of England. Would noble Lords say that such a measure was of such gravity that it ought to be taken out of the ordinary category of what is contemplated shall be the ordinary law of Parliament for the passing of Bills in the future? It is quite clear it is not. Take the throwing open of Parliament to Jews. We know that Dr. Arnold felt so strongly the idea of the identity of the English citizen with the English Christian that although he was a strong Liberal he was opposed to it. Undoubtedly the admission of Jews to Parliament, like the admission of Nonconformists to municipal corporations, was affecting the Church of England, because when we talk of the Establishment of the Church of England we are dealing, not with something written in any one Statute, but with that which pervades the Statutes running through the history of this country even before and after the Reformation. Whenever you pass any Act which affects the relation of the Church
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0046"/>
<col>83</col>
of England with the State of England you are affecting the Established Church.<lb/>
Take two or three other instances. There is the repeal of Church rates, not only affecting the Establishment of the Church of England but also affecting its endowment. I am happy to say that when the time came for repealing Church rates this House assented and gave way, because your Lordships saw it was not a case of such enormity and so vital that you ought to call in special machinery to deal with it. Take burial grounds. Your Lordships know how strenuously the clergy of the Church of England opposed the granting of permission to Nonconformists to bury, with their own services, in the churchyards of England. That affected distinctly the Established Church of England, and it was said at the time that Nonconformists were intruding into the sacred ground belonging to the Church of England. Take, again, a measure which I have no doubt the Chancellor of Oxford heartily approves of. I mean the throwing open of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge to Nonconformists. The Universities were part of the possessions of the Church of England, part of its Establishment, strictly limited, but they were thrown open, and I do not know whether the noble Viscount, Lord Halifax, would say that he would like to take a <i>pl&#x00E9;biscite</i> of the whole country as to whether people who are admitted to fellowships or professorships should not be so admitted without subjecting themselves to signing the Thirty-Nine Articles.<lb/>
There are cases much nearer our own time upon which I know the noble Viscount, Lord Halifax, feels very strongly&#x2014;matters which have become law recently, and which distinctly affect the relations of the Church of England as an Establishment and the law of the State of England. First, the Divorce Act; and, secondly, the Deceased Wife's Sister Act. Down to the passing of both these measures the law of the Church was identical with the law of the State. Of course, in the case of the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill it happened that it was the law of the State and the law of the Church, because the forbidden degrees rested upon a Statute of Henry VIII, which, while adopting some of the Canon law, put aside some of the other provisions. But when Parliament enacted that it should be lawful to marry a deceased wife's sister, it broke down that canon law which was a
<col>84</col>
part of the Establishment of the Church of England. There are many other cases. The Divorce Act is very galling to a certain section of the Church of England, who fume against it and would like to see it repealed. The Deceased Wife's Sister Act is more recent, and I do not know whether it affects them as seriously as a matter of sentiment, but no doubt some of them feel it very strongly. But are we going to say that all these things, which certainly affect the question of the Establishment, are to be taken out of the ordinary class of legislation and put into a category by themselves?<lb/>
Ordinary persons, when they read this Amendment, think off-hand of a comprehensive Bill, like the Irish Disestablishment Bill, which made a clean sweep and absolutely severed the connection of Church and State. But we are spending all our lives in severing one by one the various strands which knit the Church and the State together. We are not riding at a single anchor with a single cable. This connection rides with many anchors and many cables, and if we sever one after the other we diminish the connection of the Establishment. I agree that the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, would, no doubt, be anxious to be as friendly as possible with that great organisation, the Established Church of England. If a question affecting its interests in a vital way came up, I have no doubt he would use his influence to refer it to the Joint Committee if that Committee be established; but supposing this Act had been in force, and supposing the Amendment by Lord Halifax had been added to it, I very much doubt whether he would have said that it would have been, proper to have referred such a Bill as the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill to the Referendum. That is only a criticism of a particular Amendment. When we come to the Amendment of the noble Marquess we shall, of course, criticise it on its own merits. I only wish to say at this moment, with regard to the Amendment of Lord Halifax, that I think he has not paid sufficient heed to the substantial securities that the important interests of the Church would secure under Lord Lansdowne's Amendment. I do not know whether he has considered all these things in detail. If he has not, he ought to have done. Any one who looks at these things in a commonsense way will see that the words of the noble Viscount's Amendment are far too wide to be entertained.</membercontribution></p>

DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, one or two noble Lords opposite have complained that those sitting on this side of the House do not speak as often as we ought to do. I hear several noble Lords say "Hear, hear" Evidently that is a sentiment which is generally entertained. On this Amendment I only want to say a very few words. We have heard a great deal during these debates from noble Lords opposite about log-rolling. Noble Lord after noble Lord has got up and called attention to the fact that the Scotsman wants one thing, the Irishman wants something else, the Welshman wants Disestablishment, and the Socialist in England wants heavier taxation of rich men&#x2014;but they all join together. Noble Lord after noble Lord has described that as log-rolling. It is an interesting fact that hitherto in all these debates not a single noble Lord on this side of the House has got up to point out that this thing is mutual. I am going to do it, and I think I shall convince your Lordships on the point.<lb/>
Here is an Amendment moved by the noble Viscount, Lord Halifax, the well-known champion of the rights and interests of the Church of England, and it is supported by the right rev. Prelate on my left, the Bishop of St. Davids. Nobody will deny in this House that the noble Viscount and the right rev. Prelate, whatever else they do, do not specially represent the interests and wishes of anybody excepting the Church of England or the Church of England in Wales. Well, we have the noble Viscount and the right rev. Prelate, in order to get as much support as possible, for the object of their defence, which, no doubt, is the Church in Wales, moving an Amendment which enables them to deal with the interests of the Church of England and the temporalities of the Church in Scotland. Could log-rolling go further than that? I think noble Lords must agree that there is quite as much log-rolling among the Party opposite as there is on this side of the House. It is log-rolling that wants to maintain specially the interests of the Episcopalian Church in Wales and the Presbyterian Church in Scotland&#x2014;the maintenance of the interests of two different religions in two different countries. [Several NOBLE LORDS: No.] What else do you mean? You mean to maintain Presbyterianism in Scotland and the Episcopal Church in
<col>86</col>
Wales, and I say that noble Lords opposite could give no stronger illustration of log-rolling than that.<lb/>
But I do not wish to make a speech about Welsh Disestablishment at this hour of the night. As the Bishop of St. Davids has said, we shall have an opportunity of discussing Welsh Disestablishment before many years are over in this House; but I want to say two things about this as it affects Wales. In Wales and Monmouthshire there are 34 constituencies. Wales and Monmouthshire are the places where the Conservative Party gained certain successes at the last two General Elections. They won seats, and they hold now three seats out of 31 in the Principality, largely, no doubt, on this question. I will say this, which everybody in Wales knows to be true&#x2014;I speak as a Churchman in Wales&#x2014;that the Church in Wales will be in a far stronger position than she is to-day when her affairs are no longer treated as though they were not Welsh affairs, but as though they were the affairs of four dioceses of the Church of England. That may be an argument which weighs with Englishmen in this House and in another place, but it is an argument which does very great damage and prejudice to the Church in Wales.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00238"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF ST. ASAPH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not understand the speech of the last speaker, Lord St. Davids. I really do not quite see his point. I should have imagined that the object of the noble Viscount, Lord Halifax, and others who support him was to Maintain the Christian religion. It appears to be rather a curious process to begin to strengthen the Church by throttling it. I do not think myself that the Nonconformists, with whom I live on terms of the greatest friendship, are at all inclined to begin a reformation, or take a step in advance to distribute those endowments which have been gradually accumulating for so many years. The noble Viscount made a remark that this was a question which was difficult to submit to the country. I hope I am not misstating his argument, but I understood him to say that when you have different classes of thought in a Church you cannot put a clear and specific issue before them on the question of Disestablishment. I am not going to argue that.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0048"/>
<col>87</col>
But there is one aspect of this question on which the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, was extraordinarily silent, but not more silent than all his friends in the Principality and in England. There are two sides to this question&#x2014;Disestablishment and Disendowment. Now, the question of Disendowment is merely a matter of simple honesty, and it is one on which you can ask the people of this country to decide. A marked change of opinion has been taking place in Wales with regard to the question of Disendowment. I have recently been reading something by Mr. Henry Lewis, a supporter of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, a Nonconformist of the highest character and a man of great ability. He wrote a letter, which required a great deal of courage to write, in which he declared that Nonconformists were strongly against Disendowment. That feeling is growing steadily in the Principality. I do not wish to give your Lordships a rose-coloured picture of what is happening, but if the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, will come into Wales and talk on Disendowment I will promise him a very hearty meeting. The Liberation Society sent one of their ablest lecturers into Wales on one occasion, and I was rather anxious to hear what happened. He went to large centres of population, to towns represented by Members of the same political colour as the noble Lord, Lord St. Davids, but the meetings were a complete failure. In the first two towns not a word was said about Disendowment, and very little about Disestablishment, and the real burden of the lecturer's speches in those towns was. "We are only doing it for the good of the Church" You know what that means. This gentleman then went to a rather larger town. His reputation was growing, and the hall was very full. The chairman, before going on to the platform, peeped through the curtain to see what the character of the audience was, and when the gentleman who was responsible for the meeting came on to the platform, the chairman announced that that was "not a political meeting;" they were going to have "a prayer meeting instead" The point of the whole thing is the steady change of feeling which is taking place in Wales. Your Lordships will remember that there was a very strong agitation at one time in Scotland for Disestablishment and Disendowment. I do not know much about Scotland, but I imagine that
<col>88</col>
that agitation has broken down, and I believe the same thing is going to take place in Wales. But you must give us time. For that reason, in the name of justice and fair play, I hope this question will be covered, as I am quite satisfied it will be, by the Amendment of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00239"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think we may congratulate ourselves that our arguments about log-rolling have sunk so deeply in Lord St. Davids' mind, and if we have heard to-night the only <i>tu quoque</i> which occurs to him I think we may be well satisfied. But I think the House owes a debt of gratitude to the noble Lords, Lord Sheffield and Lord St. Davids, for taking part, as they constantly have, in these debates. We see constantly in the Radical Press that Liberal opinion is inadequately represented and finds so meagre an utterance in this House. But whose fault is it? Liberal Prime Ministers are never weary of recommending His Majesty to make Liberal Peers, but when we get them they do not attend even on these great occasions. And when they do attend, with the exceptions I have named and one or two other noble Lords whom I see opposite, they do not speak. Therefore I think we have a real grievance that on this critical occasion, the gravity of which is recognised just as much by noble Lords opposite as it is by us, practically the whole of this debate, so far as the Liberals are concerned, is confined to the Front Bench. Therefore I very respectfully thank the noble Lords who have spoken to-night from the other side for the assistance they have given us.<lb/>
I should like to say a word or two about the speech of the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane. It was a very characteristic speech. He discoursed with great knowledge about the Free Church of Scotland and the Church of Scotland, and the very interesting <i>rapprochement</i> that is said to be taking place between them. He reminded us of the history of the passing of the Act for Disestablishment and Disendowment in Ireland, and he said a little about Wales. That part of the speech has been dealt with so well by the right rev. Prelate the Bishop of St. Davids that I can only commiserate with the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, on having thought that an argument taken from the Irish Church would pass muster in this House.
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0049"/>
<col>89</col>
Mr. Gladstone passed Disestablishment and Disendowment in Ireland after the subject had been threshed out on every platform in the country and pronounced upon at every General Election. And the <i>sequitur</i> from that is that the Church of England may be reasonably disestablished and disendowed when the subject had not been mentioned by one-tenth of the Liberal candidates at the last General Election!<lb/>
What Lord Haldane entirely omitted to tell us was this, why it could be just, why it could be consistent with the homage which their lips are always paying to democracy, to disestablish or disendow any part of the Church of England without giving the people an opportunity off having a word to say on the subject. I will refer to that point presently, but I will remind your Lordships that the noble Viscount wound up his speech by saying he could not accept the Amendment because it was inconsistent with the principle of this Bill, and that principle was to embody in a written Statute Law what ought to be the unwritten traditions between the two Houses, Now, there is a fine judicial flavour about the words, "the unwritten traditions between the two Houses" But strip the phrase, and what do you find? They claim that the House of Commons, however small and precarious the majority may be, whether it does or does not represent the electors of this country, whether the electors have or have not been consulted, shall be able to do exactly what they like within two years with any institution of the country. That is an exercise of the traditions between the two Houses which we on this side of the House repudiate lock, stock and barrel, and we tell the noble Viscount for the hundredth time that the question is not a question between the Lords and the Commons, but a question of the real and comparative rights of the final authority between the electors and the House of Commons.<lb/>
I do, however, thank the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, for one thing. He did not repeat to us again what we have heard so often, that we are precluded from discussing these matters because we allowed the Second Reading of this Bill to pass without a Division. I hope your Lordships will not forget that that is being thrown in our teeth on every possible occasion. Your Lordships are saddled by the Front Bench opposite with the responsibility
<col>90</col>
for this Bill because you allowed it to pass the Second Reading <i>sub silentio.</i> Why did we do that? Because we did not want to slain the door in the face of a possible compromise even at the last moment, and because we did not want to slam the door in the face of the possibility of a national as against a Party settlement of this question. But I entirely deny that because we did that we are precluded to any degree whatever from discussing such Amendments as have been before the House to-day and yesterday.<lb/>
Now, as regards this Amendment. This is not the occasion on which to make a speech on Disestablishment and Disendowment, but I think the noble Viscount, Lord Halifax, was abundantly justified in bringing this particular question in this special form before your Lordships' House. I said I was not going to make a speech about Disestablishment or Disendowment, and the case of Wales is only an illustration, because that is the aspect of this question that is likely to be first brought to the attention of Parliament. But it is not out of place in this solemn week of the existence of the House of Lords that I should remind your Lordships that the Church of England existed before England existed; that the organic connection of the dioceses of England dates back, as we have already been reminded to-night, for more than eight centuries; and that the endowments of the Church of England, whether in the dioceses of Wales or of England itself, are the gifts of deceased Churchmen which have been devoted for centuries to only one purpose&#x2014;the service of religion and of God. The time may have come&#x2014;I do not think the people of England any more than the people of Wales think it has come&#x2014;when those endowments shall be wrested from the service of religion and used in some purely secular connection. What right can any temporary majority in any House of Commons have to deal with those endowments without consulting the people of England and Wales, for whose service they have been given and who enjoy the religious ministrations which are supported by them? The time may have come, in the opinion of the people of England or of Wales, when the Church as it exists at present in its connection with the State may have served its purpose, but what right have any majority in the House of Commons to say that that hour has struck unless the people of England
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0050"/>
<col>91</col>
themselves, in the clearest possible manner, have told them that that is their opinion?<lb/>
As this Bill stands, every single penny might be taken from the Church of England, whether in England or in Wales. The whole organic connection between the Church and State could be severed in two years by a vote in the House of Commons without any consultation with the country. That is only an illustration of what the Parliament Bill is. It is a proposal really to put every great interest in this country, however noble, however ancient, however devoted to the service of the country, absolutely under the heel of a temporary partisan majority. The noble Viscount, Lord Halifax, in his proposed Amendment, meets this case, but in my opinion, speaking for myself, I think the case is better met by the Amendment, of my noble friend Lord Lansdowne. It is better met because the method is more flexible. There are measures dealing with the Church both in Scotland and in England that need not necessarily be sent to the Referendum.<lb/>
I, who am such a convinced champion of the Referendum as one of the means of adjusting our Constitutional differences, quite recognise that one of the most formidable arguments against the Referendum is the inconvenience that would be caused by its too frequent use. Therefore I prefer the Amendment of the noble Marquess Lord Lansdowne, because I cannot imagine that any such Committee as it is proposed to set up could take any other view than that a proposal for the Disestablishment or Disendowment of any part of the Church, which had not been before the electors at a General Election and pronounced specifically upon by them, was a matter of grave importance which had not been adequately considered by the electors. Therefore I believe that the grave case which the noble Viscount, Lord Halifax, and I and those who agree with him wish to meet is covered by the Amendment of the noble Marquess Lord Lansdowne. On the other hand, I believe that the particular form of his Amendment meets the criticism that has been levelled against the Amendment of Lord Halifax to-night, and safeguards the Constitution against the danger of having to go to a Referendum on some comparatively unimportant and possibly mainly agreed change in the relations, we will say, between the Church of Scotland and the State.
<col>92</col>
Therefore I would venture to suggest to my noble friend not to press the Amendment to a Division, having, I hope, assured him as to the view that I and my noble friends take of the relations between this subject and Lord Lansdowne's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00240"><member>THE EARL OF POWIS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I cannot sit down under the insult which has been hurled at Welsh Churchmen by a man bearing the name of the Patron Saint of Wales. What we stand for in this Amendment is Christianity. Why the Churchmen of Wales should object to the Churchmen of Scotland having their particular form of Christianity passes my comprehension. I cannot understand any one corning from Wales and sitting on the Liberal Benches objecting to anybody holding different forms of Christianity. There are many forms of Christianity, and I am sure no Conservative in Wales desires to prevent anybody holding his particular form of Christianity and worshipping his God in the way he chooses. We Conservatives in Wales stood up against the Education Bills of the Liberal Government on the ground that every man might worship God and see that his child should be brought up in the Christianity which he preferred. The noble Lord, Lord St. Davids, who made this gross accusation of log-rolling against the Churchmen of Wales, stated that he was an adherent of the Church in Wales, and be advocated that we should consent to disestablish and disendow the Church in Wales so that we might be stronger in the advancement of Christianity. I remember the story of the spider and the fly. "Will you walk into my parlour said the spider to the fly?" I have no desire to see the Church in Wales walking into the web of the Government and into the wide mesh of Disestablishment and Disendowment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00243"><member>LORD ST. DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: I do not want to interrupt the noble Earl again, but what I said was that Churchmanship in Wales would be stronger if it was not treated in England or in Wales as if Wales was a question of the four dioceses of the Church of England. I have in my mind an excellent history of Wales by Mr. Lloyd Which has just come out, and in which the question of the independence of the whole diocese was considered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00244"><member>THE EARL OF POWIS</member><membercontribution>: I was not going into the question of dioceses, but I think the noble Lord has verified what I said, and that I was perfectly correct in my statement of what he said. There is one other point I wish to refer to, and that is the references of the noble Lord, Lord Sheffield, to the various Acts admitting Nonconformists to the Universities, and other Acts which have been passed through both Houses of Parliament. All I can say is, it is rather strange that he should make those suggestions as being reasons for Disestablishment, for severing part of the strands&#x2014;I think that was the expression he used&#x2014;and disestablishing the Church of England.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00245"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: I did not say that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00246"><member>THE EARL OF POWIS</member><membercontribution>: "Strands," I think, was the word the noble Lord used. All I can say is that it seems strange to me that because the Church of England has seen fit to be generous to other religions and to other sects of the Christian community, therefore it should be said that she has been dissecting herself in those Acts. It is with very great regret that I cannot support the noble Viscount, Lord Halifax, to whom I am deeply indebted for having moved this Amendment. Nobody is a stauncher supporter than I am of the principle of his Amendment, but I think it would be unwise to press this Amendment to a Division, and I feel confident that the case is covered by the Amendment of our Leader, Lord Lansdowne.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00247"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALIFAX</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish first of all to congratulate my noble friend Lord Sheffield upon his extraordinary ingenuity in having associated the Divorce Act and the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill with this subject. I confess I do not quite see what they have to do with it. With regard to the other matters which Lord Sheffield enumerated, the Test and Corporation Act and a variety
<col>94</col>
of others, I would point out to him that there is the greatest possible difference between a number of Acts of that sort which could be referred to the country and an Act which <i>ex hypothesi</i> could not be referred to the country. The whole difference lies there. Lord St. Davids accuses me of being an advocate of log-rolling because in this Amendment I have included the endowment and position of the Established Church of Scotland. I have yet to learn that because you object to being disestablished and disendowed yourself, you are therefore precluded from explaining that you dislike seeing your neighbour disestablished and disendowed also. There is no sort of reason, because I protest against an injustice to the Church of England, why I should not protest also against an injustice to the Church of Scotland. I consider that a complete answer to Lord St. Davids' remarks.<lb/>
I consider it the duty of your Lordships' House to see that a matter of such grave importance as the Disestablishment and Disendowment of any portion of the Church of England shall not be left to the decision of an accidental majority in the House of Commons, but shall be referred to the opinion of the country before it is passed into law. It is a matter of small importance how that object is attained. If the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, represents the opinions of the Front Opposition Bench and correctly expresses the reason why this matter is not included specifically in the matters mentioned in Lord Lansdowne's Amendment, and if the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, accepts what has fallen from the noble Earl, I am content to withdraw my Amendment on that assurance. But I am not content to withdraw my Amendment unless it is distinctly understood that on this side of the House we do not draw a distinction between this and the matters enumerated in the noble Marquess's Amendment, but consider that such a subject as Disestablishment and Disendowment is too serious to be left to a majority of the House of Commons and not referred to the serious and considered opinion of the electors of this country. It is not an Amendment in favour of this House. As has been said over and over again, it is an Amendment in the interests of the representatives of the nation, and I am not prepared, standing in my place in this House, to sacrifice this principle to please anybody.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00306">The noble Marquess said: My Lords, the object of the Amendment which I have on the Paper is to provide that in certain cases to which I shall presently refer the procedure contemplated by Clause 2 of this Bill shall not apply, or at any rate shall not apply to the full extent. I can well understand that there should be a considerable difference of opinion as to the measures which might properly be exempted from the full operation of this Bill. I can understand that. there should be a difference as to the measures themselves and as to the manner in which they might be so exempted, but what I am quite unable to understand is that any one should have the courage to say that no measures whatever, no matter of what importance, are to be treated otherwise than in the ruthless manner provided for by the second clause of this Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00307">It is necessary while we arc discussing these points that we should bear in mind what Clause 2 treatment really involves. It is not necessary that I should elaborate this fully, because we are most of us familiar with the Bill. It is enough to say that under Clause 2 a majority of the House of Commons has only to insist for two years upon any measure for that measure to become law, not only over the heads of your Lordships' House, but over
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0055"/>
<col>101</col>
the heads of the country. And it is necessary to bear in mind that the majority which may bring this about may be a wholly insignificant majority in point of numbers. It may also be a majority having no relation whatever to the number of votes by which it is supported in the country. It may be a majority reflecting the gross anomalies of our electoral system as we know it to-day. In fact, it is not too much to say it may be a majority representing only a minority of the votes of the electors throughout the country. Then, my Lords, it may be a precarious and dwindling majority, a majority no longer in what the Prime Minister describes as the "plenitude of its powers." Again, it may be an ill-assorted majority, not representing some great concentrated body of public opinion, but a majority representing, as it were, a patchwork of causes and political creeds. And finally it may be a majority which has been returned not upon one issue, but upon half a dozen different issues. A majority so composed may have been secured by those methods of curtailing discussion, in the House of Commons with which we are becoming more and more familiar with every year that passes. From such a majority under this Bill literally nothing&#x2014;nothing whatever&#x2014;is safe. The most fundamental issues are at its mercy. It may insist upon the passage of measures inflicting irreparable injury upon our most cherished institutions. The Crown is not safe, the Constitution is not safe, the Union is not safe, the. Church is not safe, our political liberties are not safe&#x2014;literally no institution, however much revered and respected in this country, is beyond the reach of a majority of the kind which I described just now. If any noble Lords disagree with my account of the way in which the clause will operate, I trust that as this discussion continues they will be good enough to tell me at what point I have gone wrong in my estimate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00308">As a climax, even this Bill which we are now discussing, for which the Government claim to have received a definite mandate from the people of this country&#x2014;even this Bill may be fundamentally altered. It is revolutionary now, but it may be made much more revolutionary if it suits you to do so. There is no doubt about that, because some audacious Peers upon this side of the House put the noble Viscount opposite under a sort of cross-examination,
<col>102</col>
and we elicited from him&#x2014;he was rather a good witness from our point of view&#x2014;that if the sit nation altered in such a manner as to be inconvenient to his Majesty's Government, His Majesty's Government did not desire to be hampered by any pledges as to what they might do or might not do in regard to the further limitation of the powers of this House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00309">We are of opinion that this procedure is of a very violent description, and wholly and utterly unfair as between the two Houses of Parliament. And, my Lords, we say there is no decently governed country in the world in which you will find a counterpart of the kind of system which is going to be introduced by this Bill. It involves a complete overturning of our present Parliamentary system&#x2014;the system under which this House has hitherto claimed and exercised, although very rarely its undoubted right of reserving measures for the final arbitrament of the people of this country. And finally let me say that in our view the revolution is a wholly unnecessary one, because we on this side of the House fully admit that some readjustment of the relations of the two Houses is necessary and because it is notorious that we are ready to meet you in a reasonable spirit if you desire to take that task in hand. I have dwelt upon these considerations because when we plead that in certain cases and with regard to certain measures the procedure of this clause shall not apply, it is necessary to bear in mind how violent, how reckless, the procedure of this clause really is.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00310">But, my Lords, we have read the Bill a second time, and we therefore do not ask you to expunge that procedure from the Bill. We only desire to suggest that certain measures in certain circumstances should receive a somewhat less drastic treatment, and for all other measures we are, I will not say content, but we are ready, to make the best of the meagre opportunities which the Bill still leaves us until such time as the Constitutional question has been further and more completely dealt with.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00311">What, then, are the measures for which we claim an exceptional treatment? To most of our minds it will at once have occurred that, above all other measures, measures affecting the Constitution of this country are entitled to some protection of this kind. There is a difference between altering ordinary
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0056"/>
<col>103</col>
legislation and altering the machinery by which all legislation is made. And, my Lords, in claiming such treatment for Constitutional measures we should only be following the example of all properly-governed countries. I do not think I shall be contradicted by noble Lords opposite when I say that you may search in vain amongst the Constitutions of foreign countries, or indeed of our own Colonies, for a system under which Constitutional legislation is placed upon exactly the same footing as ordinary legislation. At any rate you will find that the distinction, if not universal, is almost universal, and that the safeguards against ill-considered change in regard to Constitutional legislation are so strict as to be in some cases almost prohibitory. That is notoriously the case in regard to the Constitution of the United States, and I think it is also true of the Constitution of Belgium. At any rate of this I am sure, that you will search in vain for a system under which Constitutional legislation is left entirely at the mercy of one House of Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00312">I say frankly I wish we could have suggested to your Lordships' House a formula under which Constitutional legislation would have been specially protected as such, but I am bound to say that the difficulty of devising such a formula seems to me insurmountable. In the first place, we in this country have no written Constitution to protect, and therein we differ entirely from other countries having a written Constitution. In the case of this country a great many of the rights which we regard as Constitutional rights are derived, not from a written Constitution, but from the common law, and it would therefore be, I am constrained to admit, impossible to devise any form of words which would protect, as such, Constitutional legislation from the kind of treatment which we so much apprehend. All, therefore, that we feel we can do is to enumerate certain cases in which we claim that special treatment should be provided for, and to specify certain contingencies in which such treatment should be insured.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00313">As to our reservations, if your Lordships will be good enough to look at the Amendment on the Paper you will see that our list is a short one. In our view a long list would be undesirable, and for this reason. If we specify a great number of subjects and then go on to say that any legislation
<col>104</col>
in any way affecting those subjects is to be taken out of the scope of this Bill, it is quite obvious that we open out a very large field indeed, and we encounter the kind of difficulties which in my belief we should have encountered if we had accepted the Amendment proposed last night from the Benches behind me by my noble friend Lord Halifax. Apart from this the result of a large enumeration of measures of that kind would, in our view, be not only to take too much out of the Bill, but it would also have another effect which we should deprecate&#x2014;I mean that it would certainly create suspicion and apprehension in the minds of all those who found that we had not made any special provision for the protection of their interests. Therefore, my Lords, so far as enumeration goes, our list is a very short one.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00314">We say, in the first place, that measures affecting the existence of the Crown or the Protestant succession thereto are to be exempted, and that measures establishing a National Parliament or Assembly or a National Council in Ireland, Scotland, Wales or England, with legislative powers, shall also be exempted, and we suggest that in those cases no Bill shall be presented to His Majesty or receive the Royal Assent until it has been put to and approved by the electors of this country. I do not think it is necessary to detain your Lordships by a statement of the reasons for w inch we desire that an exception should be made in favour of measures affecting the Crown. I can conceive no objection to our proposal unless it be a repetition of the objection which we have already heard to other proposals made on this side of the House&#x2014;namely, that it is preposterous to suppose that any legislation which any British Government was likely to make itself responsible for would be calculated to affect or to impair the position of the Sovereign of this country. I am far from suggesting that I regard such legislation as highly probable, but I do think it not irrelevant to say that many things are happening to-day which the Liberal Ministers who within my recollection used to sit upon the Benches opposite would have regarded as wholly inconceivable, and it does not seem to me altogether unreasonable to imagine that the progress which the Liberal Party has made might be continued with even accelerated speed. We, at any rate, attach great importance to the question of principle involved in this Amendment, and we hold
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0057"/>
<col>105</col>
strongly that the first exemption&#x2014;that having regard to the existence of the Crown and the Protestant. Succession&#x2014;should be introduced into the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00315">Now I pass to the second subject for which we demand special treatment. In that case, at any rate, we are certainly not dealing with an imaginary or a remote danger. Home Rule is at our doors. So far as we understand the intentions of His Majesty's Government, they hope by the year 1914 to have carried a Home Rule Bill without reference to the people of this country. Is our demand that a reservation should be made with regard to Home Rule so unreasonable? The country has twice pronounced clearly against Home Rule, and what is there that you can appeal to for the purpose of convincing us that the country has changed its mind? There have been three General Elections. The Parliament of 1906 was&#x2014;I am quoting the words of the Prime Minister&#x2014;"disabled" front dealing with the question of Home Rule. What of the Parliament formed after the election of January, 1910? You had in the meanwhile resumed your liberty to deal with Home Rule. You had to resume it. You would never have obtained the support of your Irish supporters if you had not formally resumed the right, to deal with Home Rule. But do not tell me that the election of January, 1910, turned upon the question of Home Rule. We all know what the election turned upon. It turned upon the rejection of the Budget by the House of Lords. It was admitted to turn upon that by noble Lords opposite, and we are constrained to admit that they were right. Well, what of the second election in 1910? I know quite well that the noble Viscount will cite the speeches of his colleagues to show that Home Rule was more or less present to their minds at the time of the election, and they will probably cite our speeches, which they are very fond of doing, in this connection. But, my Lords, the fact remains that at the time of the second election of 1910 the attention of the voters of this country was concentrated, not upon Home Rule, but upon what noble Lords opposite described as the conflict between the Peers and the people. That was the issue which they forced upon the country. I say then, so far as these three elections are concerned, that I can find no mandate for the reintroduction of the measures
<col>106</col>
on Home Rule which the country formally rejected, and still less can I find a mandate for the introduction of some entirely new sub-genus of Home Rule of the kind which we know occupies a great deal of space in the minds of noble Lords opposite, but which they have never been at pains to explain either to us or to the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00316">Only one word more about Home Rule. I know that what His Majesty's Government desire with all their hearts is a settlement of the Irish question. I am glad to see that the noble and learned Lord (the Lord Chancellor) nods assent. But is this the way to get a real settlement of the Irish question? Speaking for myself, I would say that if this issue were to be put fairly and squarely before the electors, if the electors were to decide against us, I should acknowledge that we had done all we could, and I would endeavour to make the best of the new order of things. But the case will be wholly different if Home Rule has been foisted upon the people of this country and especially upon the Irish Loyalists, not as the result of the deliberate judgment of the country, but foisted upon them as the outcome of a transaction in the Lobbies of the House of Commons. A measure of Home Rule so passed will, I am deeply convinced, be no settlement., and will never be accepted as such, either in this country or in Ireland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00317">For measures coming within these two categories we suggest that resort to the Referendum should be obligatory. I may be asked why we want the Referendum. This is not the occasion for a disquisition upon the merits of the Referendum, and all that I will say with regard to it is this, that, desiring as we do to find a way out of these great Constitutional deadlocks, the Referendum seems to us not only a way, but the only way, of ascertaining with any approach to accuracy whether the people of this country want or do not want a particular measure. It seems to us the only way of obtaining a decision focussed upon a particular point and disentangled from all the other different issues which may be in the minds of the people at the time&#x2014;it seems to us the only corrective of those anomalies of our representative system of which I spoke a moment ago&#x2014;a system under which, as we know, a vote in the House of Commons may represent anything between, say, 2,000 or 50,000 votes in the country. And lastly the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0058"/>
<col>107</col>
Referendum commends itself to us because it seems to us in accordance with common sense that when there is a persistent difference between the two Houses of Parliament the last word should be said by the people of this country. What is the attitude of noble Lords opposite towards the Referendum? As was truly said by a noble friend of mine on the Back Benches yesterday, they are by no means opposed in principle to the Referendum. The difference between us and them is a question of degree. They desire that if it be used it should be used in exceptional circumstances and upon, grave issues&#x2014;I think that is their usual formula. At any rate, in their eyes the Referendum is not a kind of unholy thing to be brushed on one side as inadmissible. It is a mere question of the extent to which it is legitimate and proper to introduce it into our Parliamentary system.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00318">Then I may be told&#x2014;I think I very likely shall be told&#x2014;that while we are contemplating recourse to the Referendum there is at this moment no machinery in existence for applying it. That is quite true. But my answer to that is that there is not the slightest difficulty in providing the machinery of the Referendum. There are serious difficulties and serious differences of opinion with regard to the occasions upon which it is proper that the Referendum should be used, but the machinery of the Referendum is a comparatively simple matter, and if noble Lords opposite will give us the slightest encouragement we are perfectly prepared to introduce a few days hence a Bill dealing with the machinery of the Referendum. My noble friend Lord Balfour of Burleigh has a Bill dealing with the machinery of the Referendum which is still before your Lordships' House, and my noble friend Lord Saltoun, who had an Amendment upon that subject, has also proposed a scheme of his own. Therefore I shall not be at all intimidated if I am told that we are out of order in introducing the Referendum because there is no Referendum Act upon the Statute Book.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00319">In these two cases we suggest that the Referendum should be obligatory, but there are many other cases in which we think that in certain circumstances and under certain conditions resort might be had to the Referendum with great advantage. What we suggest is this, that when a
<col>108</col>
Bill has been referred to the Joint Committee, of which I shall say a word presently, and when the Committee are of opinion that the Bill raises an issue of great gravity and one upon which the judgment of the country has not been sufficiently ascertained, then the Bill shall go to the Referendum. In our view this procedure is the most reasonable which can be suggested for deciding whether a particular measure is one which should go to a Referendum or not. I do not know whether the converse proposition is likely to be asserted. Shall we be told that although a measure is admittedly grave and although the electors of the country have never had it submitted to them, nevertheless such a measure ought to go through merely because it has been supported two years running by a bare and perhaps accidental majority of the House of Commons? In our view a carefully constituted Committee is the proper mode of deciding whether in these cases a Referendum should be had or not. We found, I will not say in existence, but at any rate in existence upon the Paper of Amendments, the Committee proposed by my noble friend Lord Cromer to deal with certain questions arising under the first clause of the Bill, and it seemed to us convenient and reasonable to adopt that Committee for the purpose which we have in view. My noble friend's Committee is designed to be an impartial Committee, an experienced Committee, carefully chosen and within Parliament, which I know is a condition to which noble Lords opposite attach importance. But, my Lords, we have not yet arrived at any final decision as to the manner in which this Committee should be constituted. We are not particular as to the constitution of the Committee provided it is impartial and independent and within Parliament. I see that my noble friend Lord St. Aldwyn has an Amendment on the Paper suggesting a Committee composed differently from the Committee of Lord Cromer. I do not think we care very much which Committee may be chosen. There is a great deal to be said for the Committee recommended by Lord St. Aldwyn. It, perhaps, meets the rather extraordinary objection that was raised the other evening to Lord Cromer's Committee by, I think, the noble Viscount, who told us that it was impossible to form a good Committee of the kind suggested by Lord Cromer because parliamentary politicians might be divided into
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0059"/>
<col>109</col>
the three categories&#x2014;cranks, nobodies, and partisans.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00320"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I did not say nobodies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00321"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My noble friends behind me think the noble Viscount did use the expression "cranks, nobodies and partisans." At any rate, Lord St. Aldwyn's Committee would be less open to that imputation, whatever it is worth, and we are quite ready to discuss it when we come to Lord Cromer's Amendment.<lb/>
Assuming then that we have a fairly constituted Committee, a strong and independent Committee, would the task which we are going to assign to it be one of such insuperable difficulty? Why should it be? They have to decide two points. First, Is the issue a grave issue? I think we could easily find two or three members of this House to whom we should all be quite content to entrust the decision on that point. The second thing they have to decide is, Has the issue been adequately submitted to the judgment of the country I dare say there would be differences of opinion as to that, but surely in all these questions the quality of common-sense which we rather pride ourselves upon possessing in this country would come into play, and you would get, certainly I should think in nine cases out of ten, a perfectly reasonable and satisfactory decision. I would ask noble Lords to remember this also. Supposing the Committee does not decide in your view or in ours quite wisely in a particular case what is the worst thing that can happen under our proposal? The worst thing that can happen under our proposal is that the measure goes to a Referendum and is pronounced upon by the people of this country. The thing does not end in the triumph of the House of Lords, it does not end in the triumph of the Committee, it ends in an appeal to the voters of this country, and that is the idea which, strangely enough, the Liberal gorges of noble Lords opposite seem to rise against with unvarying disgust. In our view a Committee of this kind, appointed, remember, at the beginning of each Parliament, not each session, set up at the beginning of each Parliament with the concurrence of both Houses, representing all that is best in the way of knowledge and experience and impartiality to be found in the two Houses, and empowered to decide, not the fate
<col>110</col>
of the Bill but whether the Bill should go to a Referendum or not&#x2014;a Committee of that kind would, in our view, be an extremely valuable addition to the Parliamentary machinery of this country.<lb/>
I am obliged to anticipate objections which may be raised to our scheme, and I am led by what has been said during the recent debates to anticipate another objection. I feel sure that we shall be told that a Committee of this kind is a very new and startling and reprehensible innovation. I think we shall be told that it is a dire thing to put the Houses of Parliament under the yoke of a Committee of this kind, that it will be a kind of super-Parliament&#x2014;something never dreamed of in the history of our political existence. I make one rejoinder, and one rejoinder only, to that objection should it be made. It is not for you to complain of us for introducing innovations. It is you who in this Bill are introducing the most tremendous innovation which has ever been proposed to the Parliament of this country. It is you who are going to get rid of the Constitutional check afforded by the existence of a Second Chamber with real powers. It is you who are going to allow a casual majority in one House of Parliament to deprive the people of this country of their Constitutional right. And if the remedy which we propose for this state of things seems to yon strange and distasteful, pray do not forget that it is you who are introducing the poison which that remedy is designed to counteract.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, there is one other objection which I am obliged to anticipate. I think we are likely to be told that this plan for a Joint Committee would work unfairly as between the two great political Parties. I have seen the objection put this way. While the Liberal Government is in power, we are told that there would be differences between the two Houses and that the Joint Committee would be constantly invoked. It is said on the other hand, that if the Conservative Party were in power and this House still contained an overwhelming Conservative majority, there would be no differences and therefore no appeals to the Joint Committee. That is an objection which is very likely to be made. But there is surely an answer to that. In the first place, not only with regard to this matter but with regard to all the questions which we have lately been debating, it seems to me
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0060"/>
<col>111</col>
that noble Lords opposite are never able to take more than the narrowest Party view of the issue. Surely what we have to think of is not merely whether this Party or that will score two or three points in the political game. What we have to think of are the interests of the country. And looked at from the point of view of the national interest, is it not quite clear that safeguards of the kind which we are suggesting will be much more necessary when you are in power than when we are in power? I do not know whether I need press that further, but I, for one, am deeply impressed with the truth of what I am saying.<lb/>
But if that answer does not seem sufficient, I suggest another. The objection which I am endeavouring to deal with is based upon the assumption that we still have our present overwhelming majority in this House, and that therefore the conditions must, always be unfair so far as this House is concerned. The remedy is in your hands. You have only to carry out your pledges and to proceed with the reform of this House, and if you do so, and do so, as the Prime Minister tells us you intend, within the compass of the present Parliament, you may have the question settled and this House constituted fairly as between the two Parties before a single case can arise under the clause which we are now discussing. For it must, not be forgotten that the finding of the Joint Committee could not take place until after the three rejections and the two years have passed&#x2014;that is to say, I suppose somewhere about the year 1914, by which time you will have had ample time to try your hand at the task of House of Lords reform.<lb/>
One other observation suggests itself to me. If you are afraid of our plan working unfairly as between the two Parties, are we not entitled to say that we provide a precaution against that in the shape of the Joint Committee? We postulate that the Joint Committee shall be fairly constituted as between the two Parties. That is a <i>sine qu&#x00E2; non.</i> and is clearly intended by my noble friend's Amendment, and by the Amendment of Lord St. Aldwyn, and if you have a perfectly fair Committee you may trust that Committee to see to it that the machinery of this clause is not unfairly used.<lb/>
Let me say one word more on this point. If you still think that our proposal really will work unfairly as between the two Parties,
<col>112</col>
we are quite ready to examine, with the utmost respect, any suggestion that may be made for the purpose of removing that unfairness. For myself I would go almost any length to meet that, charge of unfairness, and if noble Lords opposite&#x2014;I do Rot venture to assume that they will do so&#x2014;would entertain and discuss with us this proposed procedure we would do anything in our power to make it work with absolute equality between their Party and ours. Our point of view is, of course, not the same point of view as that of noble Lords opposite. We are thinking of the great danger which may arise during the interval when the House of Lords is as we see it to-day, but shorn of all its powers, and the time when that new House of which noble Lords hold out hopes has been constituted. And we desire to provide precautions that shall prevent the hasty passing of dangerous and ill-considered measures during that interval. I can understand that noble Lords opposite may have in view a different contingency. They are, perhaps, thinking of a time when both Houses might be of one mind&#x2014;a Conservative majority here, and a Conservative majority there, and when consequently it would be the minority which would need protection. Now it certainly would be a strong thing to suggest that when both Houses of Parliament are agreed the decision of the two Houses might be reopened on the motion of a minority. But if that is really the danger which noble Lords have in view, I think we should most of us be quite ready to say that, at any rate so long as this House remained unreformed, a reference to the Joint Committee might be demanded either by a minority&#x2014;of course, a substantial minority&#x2014;of the House of Commons or by the Speaker of the House of Commons on behalf of such a minority, in spite of the fact that there was a majority in both Houses in favour of the measure under discussion. And it seems to me that if some provision of that kind&#x2014;I dare say noble Lords might suggest a better one&#x2014;were to be introduced, not one word could be said against, the absolute fairness of the procedure which would take place under this clause as we propose to amend it. I see indeed that my noble friend Lord Cromer intends, in the Amendment which he will move hereafter, to propose that the Joint Committee might be set in motion in certain cases by the Speaker of the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>

I hope I have said enough to show that there is something, at any rate, to be said for the principle for which we are contending&#x2014;namely, that certain measures, and other measures in certain cases, should receive a treatment less violent and drastic than the treatment provided by this clause. We have made the proposal which seems to us best to meet the case, and we conceive that it is a proposal which does not involve the destruction of the Bill, and which does not involve the retention by this House of any rights in excess of those which it at present unquestionably possesses. But, as I have already said, if other proposals are made with the same object we are ready to discuss them with an open mind. I do very earnestly trust that we shall be met by helpful criticism, and not by that merely destructive criticism which is all that we have up to the present been able to elicit from the other side. I trust that we shall not be told. as we have been told two or three times, that the precautions which we suggest are uncalled for because this Bill merely stereotypes the existing relations of the two Houses of Parliament as interpreted by reasonable men. That is an argument which I hope noble Lords will forgive me for saying convinces no one, and I cannot bring myself to believe that they themselves are convinced by it. I hope that, at any rate in the discussion which commences this evening, that argument is not the one upon which His Majesty's Government will rely.</membercontribution></p>

But I think he is unreasonable in this. He asks us who have got our own plan-bad if you like, but the definite plan, the definite proposals in the Bill&#x2014;to transfer our energies to the construction of this new piece of machinery. I do not think he is justified in expecting that of us. The noble Marquess began by saying the Bill is a monstrous innovation. I believe the historian will say that the most gigantic of all the innovations of the last two years is the noble Marquess's own Bill for the reconstitution and reform of this House.<lb/>
This Amendment really may be divided into two sections. The first portion provides that any Bill affecting the existence of the Crown, or making a national Parliament and so forth, should be subject to particular treatment. But then in subsection (c) to which the noble Marquess has naturally and properly devoted the most operative portion of his speech, he raises the question of the Joint Committee. As for the first set of proposals the first concerns the succession to the Crown. Well. I cannot imagine a House of Commons passing a Bill impairing the existence of the Crown or the Protestant succession thereto. You cannot conceive a House of Commons which is not as devoted to the Monarchy as this House is to-day. I cannot speak, of course, of two or three centuries ahead; we never can be sure of what will happen. But if there ever came a period when the House of Commons passed a Bill affecting the Protestant succession or the existence of the Crown, the Sovereign would have nothing to do but to change his Ministers. If your Lordships opposed such a Bill the Sovereign would change his Ministers, and you would then find whether that House which had abused this Bill in a way which to us
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0062"/>
<col>115</col>
to-day seems so repulsive had or had not the opinion of the country behind it.<lb/>
Now let me pass on to the second subsection of the noble Marquess's Amendment&#x2014;any Bill which "establishes a National Parliament or Assembly or a National Council in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, or England, with legislative powers therein." He very naturally defended that exclusion from the operation of the Bill by saying that Constitutional changes in nearly all other countries&#x2014;perhaps he said all other countries&#x2014;are regarded exceptionally, and that exceptional provision is made for dealing with any Constitutional change that opinion may demand. The noble Marquess at once saw a difficulty&#x2014;I will use a stronger word, an impossibility&#x2014;when he said that you cannot define, you cannot discover, the draftsman cannot invent a formula to distinguish a Constitutional from an unconstitutional change in a. country like our own. If you have a written Constitution it is quite easy to know whether the proposed change is Constitutional or not. That does not apply to this country, which lives under an unwritten Constitution, and which has hitherto distinguished between the Constitutional and the unconstitutional by custom and not by formula.<lb/>
Then the noble Marquess dwelt, not at all at excessive length, on self-government for Ireland, and he assumed, wrongly, that I should open my observations by reading out extracts from speeches made by my colleagues, and perhaps from some by noble Lords opposite. His point is that we have no authority for thinking of a Home Rule Bill, and that the country has not been consulted upon it and did not dream of a Home Rule Bill, If that be so our electors must be really the most extraordinary dupes that could be found in any country. I am not going to quote a number of passages, but. I cannot resist quoting two passages from the noble Marquess himself. He said at Glasgow in November,1910&#x2014;
<quote>"What will happen supposing this new dispensation comes into force? Home rule will go through at once without limber ado. Next time, in 1913, it goes through."</quote>
I wonder whether the people of Glasgow believed the noble Marquess? Having explained this in the North he then went to the South, to Portsmouth, and what
<col>116</col>
did he say at Portsmouth? I will read it to you. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"If the Government are returned to power the Nationalists will be paid in full and will get Home Ride of the Parnellite type."</quote>
When a man of the noble Marquess's prominence and influence warns the electors fully in that way, are we to suppose that they paid no attention whatever to what he said? That is the only quotation with which I will venture to trouble the House upon that point.<lb/>
I must say a little more about Home Rule. I think I may say that no Member of this House, present at all events, knows as well as I do the difficulties of constructing a scheme of Home Rule. I have been in two Governments representing the Irish Administration and I was concerned in the manufacture of two such Bills. Therefore I am well acquainted with the enormous difficulties and complexities that have to be surmounted in the construction of a Home Rule Bill. The noble Marquess deprecated the constant measurement of things by Party calculations and computations, and for a moment I would ask you to suppose that a Home Rule Bill would be brought in, not because we are said to be dependent on the Irish vote, but because some of us are convinced and have been convinced for a great number of years that improved government in Ireland is absolutely essential. I will not now trespass on the patience of the House by going into a. discussion of Home Rule on its merits. That will be quite proper when the Home Rule Bill comes before this House. I think it has been said in this House, "We do not know what Home Rule Bill you are going to produce." Quite true. The noble Marquess, at all events, knows that Cabinets do not hatch a Bill a year before it is required by Parliamentary necessity, and I am glad he did not raise that point, which really is an absurd one. Whether Bills are Tory or Liberal Bills, they are constructed after Cabinet discussion and infinite discussion with draftsmen, and so forth, and to ask us how what sort of Bill we are going to bring in is unreasonable. The noble Marquess, however, told the electors at Portsmouth that it was going to be a Bill of the Parnellite type. We shall see.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, there is one point&#x2014;not a very palatable one&#x2014;I would like to make. Agreeing with the noble Marquess
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0063"/>
<col>117</col>
in desiring a pacific agreement, if it can be possibly obtained, I must point out that to insist on reserving for this House a deciding voice in reshaping the government of Ireland appears to me as maladroit. What has been the record of this House, and the record of its voice in Irish affairs during the hundred years since the Union? What has been the mainstay of all those prejudices and passions, religious and otherwise, in this country but the policy almost uniformly pursued in this House? The opinion of Ireland has been recklessly disregarded for the best part of that 100 years. There has not been a single representative of the great bulk of the Irish population in this House. There is not one to-day. How could Irish legislation be other than ignorant and mischievous and retrograde when you in this House and your fathers were so ignorant of and un-concerned with the opinion and sentiment of Ireland? It cannot be denied that the mischief of absentee Irish landlordism has been aggravated by the mischief of an absentee Parliament, because that is what it has come to.<lb/>
I turn now to the next subsection&#x2014;subsection (<i>c</i>)&#x2014;of the noble Marquess's Amendment. I have studiously considered this part of the noble Marquess's scheme, and I say that it is a direct and plain traverse of the Pill. The noble Earl, Lord Clanwilliam, said last night that he only abstained from voting against the Second Reading of the Bill because he looked to noble Lords opposite to make root and branch Amendments in it. This is indeed a root and branch Amendment. What is the foundation of it? It is not so much an Amendment as a great scheme, and it involves a complete distrust of the ultimate judgment of the House of Commons. It is a plain denial of the principle of the Bill, which is that after two years of discussion the ultimate judgment of the House of Commons does represent the real opinions of the electors. The noble Marquess said that he and his friends are not bound to the Amendment of my noble friend on the Cross Benches (Lord Cromer), and they are prepared to consider the Amendment put down since Lord Cromer's by Lord St. Aldwyn. The difference, as the House knows, is that according to Lord Cromer's Amendment the Joint Committee is to be composed of seven men chosen by the Speaker and seven chosen by the Lord Chancellor.</membercontribution></p>
<col>118</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00327"><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: Under my proposal the fourteen are to be chosen jointly by the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker. Lord Heneage has an Amendment to the effect mentioned by the noble Viscount, but my Amendment says jointly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00328"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY of BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: The Amendment has taken a modified form, quite rightly, in the hands of my noble friend. Lord St. Aldwyn's Amendment proposed a Joint Committee. I do not apologise for going into this detail, because my argument, although it does not turn upon that alone, affects that. He proposes a Joint, Committee consisting of the Lord Chancellor, the Speaker of the House of Commons, the Chairman of Committees of the House of Lords, the Chairman of Ways and Means of the House of Commons, a Lord of Appeal to be chosen by and from the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and other Peers of Parliament holding or having held high Judicial office, and an odd member to be appointed by the Speaker.<lb/>
Personally I am indifferent as to how this Committee is to be formed. However composed, let us see what it is to do. It is to decide, without appeal, as I understand, first, whether a general Bill raises an issue of great gravity; secondly, whether they think that the judgment of the country on that Bill has been sufficiently ascertained; and thirdly, whether it is in their view an occasion for a Referendum. Now, these 15 gentlemen, and they alone, are to be the judges. They oust&#x2014;and this is not a bit of exaggeration&#x2014;the responsible Ministers of the Crown; they override and supersede the House of Commons; they are clothed with a power which your Lordships have long ago ceased to maintain in its panoply&#x2014;namely, the power of compelling an operation which is in effect tantamount in its essential features and practical effects&#x2014;I mean the Referendum&#x2014;to a Dissolution. Does any noble Lord say that he is in favour of giving this House the right of compelling a Dissolution? You no doubt did it eighteen months ago, not with a very good effect; but here it is suggested that it does not matter what the House of Commons thinks, no matter what the Ministers think, this Committee are to decide upon any question which is referred to them and their decision shall be final and conclusive for all purposes,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0064"/>
<col>119</col>
and shall not be questioned in any Court of Law. Can we imagine a single Bill being rejected three times in this House which does not raise an issue of great gravity? Noble Lords will be disparaging this House very much if they look forward to a time when it will reject a Bill three times unless the issue is a grave one. Then I must remind the House that the procedure under the noble Marquess's Amendment will only arise when the Bill is ready for submission to the Sovereign.<lb/>
There is another point to be considered. There may be a General Election in the middle of the discussion of one of these disputable Bills. Many Amendments in this House and in the other House turn on the necessity of interposing a General Election in the course of the debate. Suppose that a Bill has been discussed and rejected twice, and there is a General Election for other reasons; and suppose that the Government are returned to power with a majority showing that they have the public confidence. According to the Amendment of the noble Marquess, however, the Joint Committee is, in spite of the fact that the majority of the House of Commons and the Government have the support and the confidence of the country, to be able to say that the opinion of the country on this Bill has not been ascertained. You are giving the Joint Committee an authority to override the verdict of a General Election, and you are erecting an impossible tribunal to decide two impossible questions&#x2014;what is a matter of gravity, and whether the opinion of the country has been ascertained.<lb/>
Does any noble Lord pretend that such a Committee, not appointed by nor responsible to the House of Commons, not responsible to anybody, is a democratic expedient? All political definitions are uncommonly hard, and I certainly do not mean to try my hand at a definition of Democracy, because we are not to-night dealing with definitions, but with things and actual facts. In all seriousness do you reasonably expect that the House of Commons, chosen only six months ago, after months and months of incessant public discussion, is going to part wholesale with its own supremacy&#x2014;it was a conspicuous issue at the election&#x2014;and then to entrust its proceedings under penalty of an appeal to the country to this Committee? I cannot think so. Can any one
<col>120</col>
seriously pretend that any single elector in any constituency was thinking, when he gave his vote, of this scheme? He had never heard of it. When you reprove us for confusing the issues there was not a single elector&#x2014;I am not sure that there were many of your Lordships who assented to the Second Reading of the Bill&#x2014;who thought for a moment that the end of it was to be a supersession of the House of Commons and the erection of the supremacy of this House through the medium of a Joint Committee. I am certain that prospect was in no one's mind, though I will not say it was not in the mind of the noble Marquess.<lb/>
I have been reproached during the last few days, not too severely, for being unwilling to compromise and concede. Compromise and concession are, of course, two jewels of Parliamentary statesmanship, although they do not involve the very highest and most ideal virtues. But will anybody say that I am showing an uncompromising and non-conciliatory spirit when I say that the Government cannot accept for an instant this Amendment? It is impossible to concede it without teasing sip the whole policy, purpose, and principle of our Bill. Therefore I say, at all risks and hazards and with sincere regret&#x2014;if the refusal by the Government of this Amendment precludes what the noble Marquess spoke of, consultation and discussion&#x2014;it is impossible to concede it, and I really believe that not one of your Lordships in candour can say that we could possibly accept any such scheme as this.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00329"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships will have noticed on the Paper an Amendment standing in my name following that which we are now discussing. As the Amendment of the noble Marquess covers the Amendment with regard to Ireland which I have put down, and as I am informed that my contemplated Amendment would not be in order, I think it right that I should rise at the present time, not only to give support generally to the Amendment of my noble friend, but to devote myself to that part of it in connection with Ireland which I and my friends from Ireland, and I think I may say the whole Unionist Party in Ireland, feel is the <i>crux</i> of the situation with regard to this measure. Mr. Balfour very truly stated, in the Albert Hall, that if there
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0065"/>
<col>121</col>
had been no question of Home Rule there, would have been no Parliament Bill, I believe that view is endorsed by every Unionist; indeed, I doubt very much if any member on the Government Bench will contradict me in that statement. Consequently we in Ireland regard this Parliament Bill as embracing a measure of Home Rule, to which we shall offer, not only now, but at every stage so far as possible in the future, our most strenuous and vigorous opposition.<lb/>
It has been said, especially last night in connection with the discussion on Disestablishment of the Church in Wales, that it is the object of His Majesty's Government, by means of this Bill, to carry through Parliament measures which have never been brought before the people of this country or their opinions asked upon them. That, I think, was the line taken by the right rev. Prelate and by other noble Lords who spoke in connection with Disestablishment. But, my Lords, if it is important that the question of the disestablishment of the Welsh Church should be brought forward prominently before the people before it is carried into law, how much more important, then, is it to insist on the question of Home Rule being brought, before the people of this country before it is passed, when we remember that on the two occasions during the past twenty-five years on which it has been put forward clearly the people have spoken in no uncertain terms with regard to it and decided that they will not have Home Rule? The noble Viscount, in the course of his remarks in relation to Ireland, twitted the noble Lord with regard to the charge of the Unionist Party that Home Rule had not been brought forward prominently by the Liberal Party at the last General Election, and he alluded to two speeches of my noble friend behind me. My noble friend was perfectly right in what he said. He was forecasting what would be the action of the Government if this Bill became law.<lb/>
May I ask the noble Viscount opposite, Why did the Prime Minister and his colleagues make no mention of Home Rule in their election addresses to their constituents? Mr. Asquith made no mention of it in his election address. On the contrary, he kept it entirely in the background until he was heckled by one of his audience, and even then, if I may say
<col>122</col>
so, he only gave an evasive answer, so anxious was he to keep it in the background. But Mr. Asquith was not alone in not mentioning Home Rule in his address. I notice that the Home Secretary, and Mr. Pease, Mr. McKenna, Mr. Herbert Samuel. and even the Minister most concerned, Mr. Birrell, thought Home Rule of not sufficient importance to be mentioned in that important document issued by candidates to their constituents. Liberal candidates also followed the example of their leaders. The addresses of 510 Liberal and Labour candidates at the last General Election have been examined, and in 269 cases&#x2014;more than half&#x2014;no reference to Home Rule was made. I think we are justified in saving that the leaders of the Radical Party, if they had intended by means of the Parliament Bill to carry Home Rule, ought in common honesty to have brought this matter prominently before the constituencies.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I wish to say why we in Ireland, who know Ireland and have studied the Irish question, think it our duty to oppose this Bill by every means in our power. In the first place, we maintain that it is not for the good of Ireland, but is a measure to be passed to recompense Mr. Redmond for having, contrary to the wishes of the people of Ireland, supported the Budget Bill, and since that time maintained in office the present Government. Why do we oppose this Bill? We oppose it because we who know Ireland know that if Home Rule is granted to Ireland there could only follow ruin, disaster, bankruptcy, and, in all probability, civil war. That is the opinion from the Irish point of view. But, my Lords, there are other views taken by English and Scottish people. What is going to be the financial position of Ireland if Home Rule is given? I can tell you what that position will be. After a short period of Home Rule there will be nothing but bankruptcy in Ireland, and English and Scottish people will have to put their hands very deep indeed into their pockets in order to find financial assistance for Ireland to put it back into anything like the prosperous condition that Ireland at the present moment enjoys. At the present time we are waiting to hear the Report of the Financial Committee which has been sent over to Ireland, and it will be very interesting indeed if noble Lords who follow me will tell me that the statements I make
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0066"/>
<col>123</col>
with regard to the financial position of Ireland are controverted by that Committee.<lb/>
Ireland cannot support herself financially at present, and has to be assisted by England, and if Home Rule is granted, naturally in the course of events without that assistance&#x2014;because if once she is a separate country I do not suppose that England or Scotland will assist her as they do now&#x2014;Ireland must become bankrupt. At the present moment there is a deficit, and there must be a still greater deficit if English assistance is taken away. The result will be increased taxation upon that most industrious and most profitable part of Ireland which contributes no less than two-thirds of the general revenue of Ireland. Under the present system I have no doubt Ulster is capable of paying that large amount; but if more taxation is imposed upon her she will not be likely to be able to meet it, because capital will not be invested in Ulster in future. It will vanish, and you will have that industrious part of Ireland, now paying two-thirds of the general revenue of Ireland, finding herself absolutely unable to pay anything like that sum. Then, my Lords, the prosperity of Ireland at the present moment is due entirely to the credit that Ireland can get by being associated with England. It has had a vast sum of money advanced to it for various purposes&#x2014;land reforms and other improvements&#x2014;because she is connected with England. Separate that connection, and at what rate of interest can money be borrowed? I do not know any one who would care to invest money in Ireland at anything but a very high rate of interest, if even then, when the administration of Ireland is being entrusted to the tender mercies of a body of legislators sitting at College Green, who have shown their capabilities by being themselves absolutely bankrupt in their own financial funds and having to appeal to America, and who have also made bankrupt a number of what were previously industrious and prosperous tenants by inducing them to invest their money, and lose it, in the notorious Plan of Campaign. I ask you whether, with that body of men sitting at the head of a Parliament at College Green, it would be possible for Ireland to borrow money at any rate of interest whatever?<lb/>
When I last addressed your Lordships' House and devoted the greater part of my
<col>124</col>
speech to the danger involved in Home Rule, the Lord Chancellor, the following day, criticised my observations, and declared that he considered that the case against Home Rule was weakening in the minds of many Conservatives. I was not in a position then to controvert that statement of the Lord Chancellor, but I take the opportunity of controverting it at the present moment, and I would ask the noble and learned Lord, when he replies, whether he can tell me the name of a single Conservative who has ever said one word in public in favour of what is known as Gladstonian Home Rule. I am not prepared to deny that the feeling against Home Rule is not so antagonistic as it was in 1893. The reason is not very hard to seek. It is because the question of Home Rule has not been prominently brought forward before the people of this country since 1893. The year 1893 is a long time ago, and since then a new generation has arisen, and that new generation has learned to believe, not having heard anything of it, that it is merely a thing which has been heard of in the past but will never appear again. It has been kept steadily in the background, and one of the colleagues of the noble Viscount opposite told the English people that they might sleep soundly in their beds because Home Rule was nothing but a "bogey"<lb/>
Is Home Rule nothing but a "bogey" now, with this Parliament Bill before us? If the noble Viscount thinks Home Rule is not going to occupy a very prominent place in the minds of the people of this country he is making a very great mistake. I can assure him that the people of England, who have not had Home Rule brought prominently before them for nineteen years, are slowly but surely awakening to this danger. In the North of Ireland the people are not only aroused, but are wide awake. I am receiving daily&#x2014;and my noble friend Lord Templetown will tell you the same&#x2014;resolutions and communications declaring that at all costs the Protestant people in the North of Ireland will not accept Home Rule. They naturally feel very strongly on the subject, and I can assure your Lordships of this&#x2014;and I speak with a due sense of responsibility&#x2014;that if a Home Rule Parliament is created at College Green, and if that Parliament endeavours to administer the affairs of Ireland from College Green without the opinion of the country having been taken
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0067"/>
<col>125</col>
on that question, His Majesty's Government will have the rudest awakening that ever a Government have had in the course of modern history.<lb/>
Now I want particularly to ask one question of the noble Viscount, and that is how he and his colleagues propose to maintain&#x2014;they certainly will not improve&#x2014;the present prosperous condition of Ireland if they grant Home Rule to it? The noble Viscount seems to think that if Home Rule were granted to Ireland the millennium would appear. Will be tell me if he can make Ireland more prosperous than it is at the present moment? The noble Viscount seemed to attribute what he called the unfortunate condition of Ireland to the question of absentee landlords. I am going to prove, before I sit down, that the present condition of Ireland is thoroughly prosperous; but even if it were a fact that Ireland was in an unfortunate condition it could not be attributed to Irish landlords, because there are so few of them now. It is the tenants themselves who own the land at the present time, and they will tell you that they are enjoying a prosperity second to none of the tenants in Great Britain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00330"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: When I spoke of absentee landlords and the mischief that they had done, I was not thinking of the landlords of to-day. On the contrary, I was assuming that this House, in legislating for Ireland, had committed a vast number of tremendous errors, and was responsible for the historic misfortune of Ireland. I do not tax the landlords of to-day. I am very glad they are out of Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00331"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: I do not follow the noble Viscount in that, but still I do not agree with him. I am correct in this, that there are no landlords to denounce now because they have sold their land to the tenants. But I do ask, How are you going to maintain or increase the present prosperity of Ireland if you establish a Parliament on College Green? The prosperity of Ireland at the present moment is of an almost phenomenal character. I can tell the noble Viscount that there are men returning from America, of all grades of opinion, political arid religious, who went away from Ireland some years ago, and on returning they are delighted to see the extraordinary changes
<col>126</col>
which have taken place. That is admitted, I believe, even by the leaders of the Nationalist Party. These men came back from America, and what do they see? They see those who were occupiers of land when they left now the owners of it, developing to the best of their ability their own land, enjoying thoroughly the responsibility that accrues to ownership, and if you ask any of those men themselves they will tell you that they are in a most prosperous condition. What, again, will the Americans tell you? They will tell you they have observed the cause of technical education steadily advanced in Ireland during the years they have been absent from it. I believe in all the important towns there are technical schools for the improvement of the mind of the younger generation, which will make them still more attached to the holdings in that part of the country in which their lot happens to be cast. When these men to whom I refer left. Ireland what did they see? They saw people then living in mud cabins who are now occupying comfortable cottages, all built by money advanced from English credit.<lb/>
Let me now turn to the congested districts. I am sure you will be glad to hear that even in that part of Ireland, which appeared at one time a barren district, the condition of the people is steadily improving. The people are now able to develop the resources of the industries connected with their place, and I believe at the present moment those men are making the most of their opportunity. My Lords, all that has been done by money advanced to the congested districts by means of credit with England. There is another thing which I think will show the prosperous condition of Ireland. I turn to what I consider is the best barometer of the financial position of the working classes&#x2014;the amount of money they have invested in the savings banks. I do not think that any one will deny that that is a sure criterion as to the welfare of the poorer classes, because those are the banks in which they invest their savings. Let me show you the improvement that has taken place. I will take the amount of money invested in the savings banks in Ireland in the year 1881, and compare that year with the present. In 1881 there were &#x00A3;3,800,000 in the savings banks. On December 31, 1910, there were nearly 14&#x00BD; millions, an increase of about
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0068"/>
<col>127</col>
&#x00A3;11,000,000. So, too, it will be found that an increase of the people's savings has also taken place in the congested districts. In those parts&#x2014;the poorest and most poverty stricken parts of the country&#x2014;the savings banks deposits have gone up from &#x00A3;300,000 in 1881 to nearly &#x00A3;2,000,000 in the year 1907. How do noble Lords opposite propose to continue that satisfactory state of affairs if a Home Rule Parliament is granted? Remember, my Lords, that the whole of this prosperity is due to the Act of Union, and that the prosperity has taken place since.<lb/>
It may be said, "Let us try a measure of Home Rule, and see whether we cannot do something." If His Majesty's Government try such an experiment with a country prosperous as Ireland is at the present moment I can only say that they will be undertaking the most risky experiment that will ever have been known. But it is not an experiment. There was a Parliament on College Green&#x2014;Grattan's Parliament&#x2014;which sat from 1782 to the year 1800. What was the condition of Ireland under Grattan's Parliament? There was lawlessness in every part of the country. There were no less than fifty-four Coercion Acts, the climax being the great rebellion. Let me read to your Lordships what was the opinion of Mr. Lecky, whom I am sure you will accept as a great historian with regard to Ireland. He says of the unfortunate condition of Ireland in the year 1798 under a Home Rule Parliament&#x2014;
<quote>"Agriculture had ceased; its implements were destroyed; the sheep and cattle had been plundered and slaughtered; the farmers were homeless, ruined, and often starving. Misgovernment and corruption, political agitation and political conspiracy, had done their work, and a great part of Ireland was as miserable and desolate as any part of the habitable globe."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00332"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: What volume of Lecky is the noble Marquess referring to?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00333"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: I have not the volume, but the noble Lord will find the quotation in Fisher's book at page 269. I took it from that, and it is quite correct. But there is even stronger evidence of the lamentable condition in which Ireland was left after the Home Rule Parliament. What did Lord Chancellor Clare say, a man of great authority, who lived on the spot? This
<col>128</col>
is what he said, that before the Act of Union was passed Ireland&#x2014;
<quote>"had not, three years of redemption from bankruptcy or intolerable taxation, nor one hour's security against the renewal of exterminating civil war."</quote>
Surely that experience cannot be ignored. With that experience as to what Ireland was under a Home Rule Parliament, to drag Ireland down from her present prosperous position and restore her to that appalling state of lawlessness and misery would not only be a folly, but a crime of the deepest dye. The Prime Minister, in the course of one of his speeches dealing with this question, said that it would be easy for a Government following this one if they chose, to reverse their legislation and go back to the old state of things. I suppose he means to restore Ireland to what it was under the Union. That is a remark with which I cannot agree. He says that in ninety-nine cases out of 100 it is possible. Whether that is right or wrong I do not know, but this is most certainly the hundredth.<lb/>
Mr. Asquith may talk very lightly, with regard to domestic legislation, of a succeeding Government being able to reverse it; but how would be propose to abolish a Parliament which had been established on College Green? How would Mr. Balfour, supposing he came into office with a mandate from the country to reverse that policy, commence to repeal the repeal of the Union Act. If a Parliament had sat even only for a very short time in Dublin it would have been created with all the dignity, pomp, and paraphernalia associated with Parliament. Posts would have been created, administrative offices established, and Acts of Parliament passed. What would have to be done? There would have to be a repeal of the Act, a repeal of all the Acts that had been passed. and there would be all the difficulty of undoing what had been done in that short period, and I do not believe that such a thing could be brought about without there being civil war in Ireland.<lb/>
Another question I wish to ask is this. What is going to be the outlook of the loyal Unionist minority in Ireland? Mr. Redmond did not hesitate once to say that they would be overborne by the strong hand. That does not give them great confidence in the creation of a Parliament dominated by Mr. Redmond on College
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0069"/>
<col>129</col>
Green. But what I want to point out to your Lordships, and through your Lordships to the people of this country, is that there are two Mr. Redmonds&#x2014;Mr. Redmond who speaks in England and Mr. Redmond who speaks in Ireland and America. In England Mr. Redmond is all toleration&#x2014;toleration is to be shown to the Unionist minority, toleration is to be shown to the Protestant minority. But, my Lords, how will that toleration be carried out? I remember well, when the Irish Government Bill was being brought forward and doubts were expressed as to the representation that the Unionist minority would have on the county councils, that Mr. Redmond assured them that they would have their share of the representation. But what happened? On the county councils in the whole of the three Provinces of Ireland, excepting Ulster, there are only sixteen Unionists. Mr. Redmond, having achieved his end, did not hesitate to boast that the county councils, on which there are hardly any Unionists, had proved a network of national organisation. How are we to look to Mr. Redmond for toleration when we have that experience before us? We feel perfectly sure, that being the experience with regard to the election of the county councils, that there would be the same measure of toleration meted out to the Unionist minority if a Home Rule Parliament were established on College Green.<lb/>
Then we are told that in all probability, if Home Rule is granted, safeguards in the shape of guarantees would be introduced. But, my Lords, are we justified in believing in these guarantees any more than we are in believing Mr. Redmond's promise of toleration? We know that the national organisation would find a way to avoid the guarantees. We had here, if you remember, in the course of the Spring a debate following one in the House of Commons on what is known as the famous McCann case, and a more shameful case of cruelty at the hands of the Catholics to a Protestant was never known. Yet the Government took no part with regard to it, and the situation remains at the present moment exactly as it was, showing to my mind how perfectly possible it is for the Nationalist Party, if they choose, to avoid any safeguard they like. I want to bring before your Lordships a speech made by Cardinal Logue to show the manner in which the Protestant minority would be treated by the Catholic majority should
<col>130</col>
the question arise of money for the purpose of promoting education naturally of an undenominational character. What does Cardinal Logue say with regard to the new National University? I think this is a quotation which ought, not only to be brought before your Lordships, but ought to be brought prominently before all the Protestants of England and Scotland. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"They gave what they hoped to be a Pagan University, but, please God, we will turn it into a Catholic University. They have brought a Mahommedan institution into this country, but turn loose upon it a lot of fine, young Irish Catholics, and they will soon make it a Christian institution. That is what we will do with this new University. No matter what obstacles the Nonconformists of England may have inserted in the constitution of the University to keep it from being made Catholic, we will make it Catholic in spite of them."</quote>
How can we, with that before us, put any faith whatever in any guarantees which may be called safeguards? I venture to say they would be absolutely worthless and I shall be glad to be contradicted if I am wrong.<lb/>
May I again advert to the speeches of Mr. Redmond in Great Britain. He has always spoken here, as I said, with feelings of moderation and loyalty. But let me remind you of one of Mr. Redmond's speeches delivered only four years ago in Ireland&#x2014;at Wexford. He then said&#x2014;
<quote>"We tell her (England) frankly that the choice of weapons with which we work will be a mere question of expediency with us. We tell her that we to-day hate her rule just as much as our forefathers did, and that we are as much rebels to her rule to-day as our forefathers were in 1798."</quote>
Yet this is the man who promised toleration to the loyal Protestant minority in Ireland, and for whom this Bill is to be passed. There is another speech of Mr. Redmond's to which I wish to allude. He would have you in England believe that all he requires in Ireland is a subordinate Parliament, a Parliament partaking in no more active legislation than that of a Province of a Dominion. That is what he would have you believe when he is throwing dust in your eyes. But this is what he says when lie is talking to the people of America&#x2014;
<quote>"We demand an Irish Parliament for Irish affairs, and subject only to the Irish people. Less than that we do not ask, and less than that we shall not accept. They ask us to demand more; and I answer, in the words of Parnell, Let us get this first and then demand more.'"</quote>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0070"/>
<col>131</col>
I ask whether the Government consider that any Bill which may be introduced on the lines of Mr. Redmond's English speeches can be considered finally when we have regard to his Irish utterances? I have ventured to point out to your Lordships that Ireland will be bankrupt and ruined, and England in all probability put to considerable discomfort, if a Home Rule measure is passed. I do not believe that the people of Ireland who are contented now and prosperous, as I have shown you, desire to have Home Rule, and if they were permitted to speak freely I think they would say so. Of course, I merely give my opinion? but that is also the opinion of people who know Ireland thoroughly well. Yet you are proposing to restore Ireland at all costs and hazards to that miserable state of affairs which existed before the Union.<lb/>
I have heard it rumoured that if your Lordships refuse to pass this Bill 500 Peers will be created to swamp the present majority in this House. I cannot believe such a rumour. I cannot believe that any Prime Minister who recognised the responsibility and the dignity of his great position could be found who would do such an absolutely unconstitutional thing and make this country the laughing stock of every nation in the civilised world. More than that, I believe that no honest straightforward Prime Minister would contemplate so revolutionary an action as to smash this Constitution at the bidding of a man who has told him to toe the line, and I believe no patriot could be found who would undertake so dastardly an action as to lay the foundation stone of the disintegration and the dismemberment of the Empire. Any honest and straightforward Prime Minister who desired to grant Home Rule to Ireland, and desired at the same time to act in the best interests of the country, would in a straightforward manner put the question fairly and honestly before the people of this country, and ask them to give him the power to bring in a measure of Home Rule. That would be an honest and straightforward course, and if the country endorsed that appeal from the Prime Minister, fatal as I and my friends behind me believe it would be to Ireland, we should only have one thing to do, and that would be to bow to the will of the people when that will had been expressed.<lb/>
<col>132</col>
Will the Prime Minister take that line? I believe he will not, because he knows full well, when he casts his mind back to 1886 and to the election of 1895, when Home Rule was fought as a clear issue, that the people with no uncertain voice would declare their detestation of any measure of Home Rule for Ireland, once the arguments for and against Home Rule were clearly and fairly and honestly put before them. What is it that we, the loyal Unionist Protestant party in the North of Ireland, ask? We only ask to be allowed to continue in the future, as we have been in the past, part and parcel of England and maintain the Union under which we have prospered and lived happily, and not to be handed over to the tender mercies of a body of people who have never concealed their detestation of you and of that loyal minority in Ireland who are devoted to the Throne and devoted to England. The loyal Unionist population of Ireland appeal to England now as they did in 1895. They ask you to allow them to remain part and parcel of your Constitution. In the words of their great Order, <i>Quis Separabit?</i> England's answer, I am confident, in the future will be what it has been in the past, that we will not separate Ireland from England, for&#x2014;

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00334"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise to reply to the noble Marquess, because I confess although I have no authority in the matter, I should have thought his speech was quite irrelevant to the issue before us. It would have been a powerful speech if we were discussing the Second Reading of a Home Rule Bill; but we are not discussing that, and it is not relevant to the issue which we are now considering whether Ireland has or has not been prosperous since 1801, and whether the people of Ireland ought or ought not to be content with the treatment they have received. All that may come up on a future occasion, but it has nothing to do with the question which we have now to consider.<lb/>
The question we have now to consider is whether under any circumstances, and with any modifications, and subject to any conditions, the Amendment which the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0071"/>
<col>133</col>
noble Marquess opposite proposes to introduce in the provisions of this Bill may be entertained, and I confess on that subject that I listened with regret to the unqualified opposition of my noble friend the Leader of the House to the proposition of the noble Marquess. I know the immense difficulties that are involved in that proposition. I know it is novel. I know the expense and turmoil and confusion which might follow the adoption of his proposal if it were put into operation. But, despite all these circumstances, there appears to be much in what the noble Marquess has submitted for your consideration which deserves your attention, and we must not shrink from it because it involves novelties and disturbs our traditional belief, or because it opens before us a vista of future political life with which we have not been familiar in the past. If the occasion demands it, we must face novelties.<lb/>
I submit&#x2014;and my noble friend below me will agree&#x2014;that we are considering to-day a very serious change, an alteration of our procedure which might justify the contemplation of novelties, strange and unfamiliar though they may appear to be. What is the proposition underlying the Bill? I ventured, when I addressed your Lordships with reference to the first clause, to say that I could not conceive of the possibility of the adoption of the principle which the noble Earl on the Cross Bench proposed in reference to the conduct of financial legislation. Financial legislation must be settled peremptorily; it must be settled within the year, and considerations of finance as well as the respect due to the representatives of the people in the matter of taxation require that the financial legislation of the country should be practically the exclusive work of the House of Commons. It grew up to be so, and it was recognised to be so, not merely out of considerations of the right of the people to say how they are to be taxed, but from considerations of political expediency and political management.<lb/>
But these motives, as I ventured to say in speaking in reference to the first clause, do not apply to the consideration of general legislation. General legislation is rarely in such a hurry. General legislation may be considered on all sides. It may be deferred and brought up to be reconsidered; and the real question which we have to
<col>134</col>
determine is whether, under the provisions of the Bill now before us, we have sufficient reason for confidence that the legislation of the future will always be found conformable to the will of the nation, or whether circumstances may arise under which it may be desirable, if not necessary, to go beyond the machinery of this Bill in order to ascertain whether that conformity exists. The principle of the Referendum is an appeal, as my noble friend said, against the authority of the House of Commons, but it is an appeal from the House of Commons to the electorate at large. It is a democratic appeal; an appeal to all those who have been recognised as fit to join in the election of members of the House of Commons; and to appeal from a subordinate body, however illustrious, and however noble its history, to the power which creates that body is not in itself a necessary degradation. No doubt it involves the confession that that subordinate body cannot, as my noble friend said, be always trusted. Is that confession something which no fact can substantiate? Are we by our past experience, or by the experience of free political communities elsewhere, justified in coming to the conclusion that the House of Commons, even in the first fulness of its life when fresh from the constituencies, necessarily reflects the mind of the nation?<lb/>
I was very much surprised that the noble Marquess opposite, who marshalled his arguments with uncommon gravity as well as force, did not refer to the recent experience in Australia. That experience is most significant and most instructive. A little more than twelve months ago there was a General Election in Australia conducted according to all those traditions of elections which we regard as fulfilling a complete scheme of democratic organisation, and there issued from those elections a majority, both in the Senate and the House of Representatives, of a substantial character supporting a Labour Ministry. I think it happened in April of last year. The Ministry issuing from that election, supported in both Houses, proceeded to submit to the Legislature of the Australian Commonwealth Bills which they held embodied the policy which had been approved by the Australian electorate. Those Bills passed by substantial majorities; but inasmuch as they involved changes in the Constitution of the Commonwealth, inasmuch as they were concerned with the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0072"/>
<col>135</col>
relations between the Commonwealth and the States composing it and also had to do with the organisation of Labour, it was necessary, under the provisions of the Commonwealth Act, that those Bills should be referred to the judgment of the electorate at large. A Referendum was held, and the result was that those Bills, which had been most successfully carried through the Commonwealth Parliament by a Government supported by large majorities in both Houses, were rejected within twelve months of the General Election by a very strong majority of the electorate of Australia. Could anything be more conclusive? Here was a democratic House of Commons working under the best possible conditions, with no arguments against its authority to be derived from the difference in sizes of constituencies, or from the existence of plural votes, or from any other of the drawbacks which attach to our political institutions&#x2014;this Parliament so issuing from the electorate of Australia carried through all its stages legislation which, being immediately submitted to the electorate, was repudiated by the electorate.<lb/>
The experience is significant and instructive in other ways as bearing on the general question of the Referendum. It may be said to dispose of the argument that no Ministry could survive a rebuff so given to it by the electorate when appealed to. For we find in fact that Mr. Fisher's Ministry is going on the same as before. They simply recognised that they had gone beyond the mind of the country. Their counsels may be right. It may be that a year hence, or two years hence, or five years hence, what they propose will be supported by the majority; but for the moment they went beyond the mind of the people, and they have acquiesced in that fact and are going to try and educate the nation up to the point they desire to attain. I understood the noble Viscount to agree with me, but I think he dissents. Does he think it would be convenient for us here to have legislation which went beyond the mind of the nation without any possibility of arresting it? If what could be done in Australia could be repeated here, we should, surely, have done something to avoid it if it could have been avoided. Assume that you are going to instal in the Statute Book Statutes of which the electorate at large disapproved. That is what might happen. That is what did happen in the case of Australia,
<col>136</col>
and that is what we ought to try and prevent here.<lb/>
You have not the security, even in the first flush after a General Election, not even on a question which has been prominent at the election, that the answer of the House of Commons when it is appealed to would be that of the electorate at large. It is a puzzle which there is often great difficulty in apprehending, and yet it ought not to be particularly difficult to understand how that might come to pass. I always myself seem to see it best in a simple example. Take the City of Sheffield. The City of Sheffield is divided into five constituencies, and has five Members. It happens that in two of those divisions there is a large majority of the electorate one way, and in the other three constituencies there are small majorities of the electorate the other way. The result is that the mind of Sheffield is represented by three Members against two, the three being elected by small majorities, and the two by large majorities. When you put the figures together you find that the two have got the real mind of Sheffield behind them, so that the mind of Sheffield is misrepresented in Parliament. So the mind of the nation has been misrepresented in the past, and might be misrepresented in the future. It is against that difficulty that we want to guard ourselves.<lb/>
My noble friend will say there are sufficient safeguards in the Bill as it stands. He will say, Have we not got two years' delay? Is not there ample opportunity for discussion in the House of Commons and in the Press? Shall we not have consultations, deliberations, conferences? Is there not throughout the course of Parliamentary life a consciousness on the part of members of the House of Commons of an outside world, with which they will have to come into contact again, and which would prevent them from abusing their present powers if they have reason to think, or to suspect, that they are going in any way beyond the opinion of the country at large? And will not these two years serve to bring out that difference, if it exists, and save us from the calamity which otherwise might be before us? My Lords, as to that feeling on the part of Members, that a time of punishment may conic, I will ask my noble friend to remember, and I would ask noble Lords also
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0073"/>
<col>137</col>
to remember, the history of the Parliament of 1900. The Parliament of 1900 was elected upon one issue, and it used its powers, as is now confessed, to pass certain great Acts which were not wholly approved by the electorate, and 1906 was the punishment&#x2014;the reparation demanded for that abuse of power. The abuse of power was apprehended whilst that Parliament was going on., but it did not stay the use of the power; and I am afraid our security that the power will not be abused while it is possessed because there is to be an election a year after, or because there is discussion going on without, or because a vigilant Press is watching us, or any other reason of that kind, will not be of much use to us. We have all heard of the guillotine, the suppression of debate, and other things, in the House of Commons&#x2014;painful evils which have grown upon us.<lb/>
What is the real secret of the demoralisation against which accusations are brought so freely, but in which both sides are equally involved? Is it not the decay of the Parliamentary spirit? That is what we feel&#x2014;that there is a decay of the Parliamentary spirit, through not recognising that there are others besides ourselves, the necessity of giving and taking, of compromise and conciliation, and that instead of that there is a perseverance and resolution to go on on the lines you have laid down. This decay has been fomented and strengthened by the great change which came upon us in 1886, and subsequent years. Let me refer you to what happened under two-Member constituencies with two candidates running, Liberals or Conservatives as the case may be, one an old-fashioned moderate Liberal and the other an advanced Liberal. They held their Party together and each felt the necessity of going one with the other, and so Liberalism by itself under that system had the bringing of two elements always into its own Party, and the same with the other side. But when you get an issue fought by one man and that issue supported by an organisation such as the Party caucus, you begin from the beginning, not in a temper of conciliation and cooperation, but in a temper of opposition, and that injures the Parliamentary spirit, which injury has been traced in Parliament since. Now what hangs upon this? The vision of debates and consultations and conciliation and I know not what processes before the two years are up, it is more or
<col>138</col>
less agreed we shall not have, and we shall be spared if after the first year we do not find introduced bald divisions and nothing more, and the affirmation at one stroke&#x2014;quite easy to do&#x2014;of the Bill passed in the previous session. Debates and conciliation, which my old friend Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman so sincerely hoped for, are things which von cannot be certain of realising. On the contrary, they are things which most probably will be put on one side, and this notion that after two years you will ripen into something by the rubbing together of thought and thought, it may be in the smoking room or elsewhere, is one which we cannot dwell upon as giving us sincere confidence.<lb/>
Let me refer to the latest incident&#x2014;I do it with regret&#x2014;illustrating our Parliamentary decay. A Bill of tremendous moment, involving possibly the well being. of our whole industrial community, has been introduced into the House of Commons. Those who know, or at least who by previous study are entitled to speak with authority on the subject, affirm that that Bill contains proposals which, if not wisely handled, will lead to most lavish waste and the painful demoralisation of our industrial people. Whether that is a sound judgment or not I do not know, but it is put forward by responsible persons to whom you cannot but listen with respect. And this Bill, which took three years, according to its author, to frame, which has not been before the public three months, which has received the most casual discussion, because during those three months we have been engaged in many other things&#x2014;this Bill it was proposed, before entering into Committee, to submit to a system of guillotine operations. That is what I call the latest, and perhaps the most painful, illustration of the decay of the Parliamentary spirit.<lb/>
Does the proposal of the noble Marquess opposite give us any hope of finding an escape from this domination of what, after all, is not the will of the people? know the immense difficulties involved in its adoption, but, as I said before, I am not going to shrink from considering it because it is difficult, especially when I recognise the fact that the principle of the Referendum has been adopted in most of the democratic communities of the world and has made most rapid progress
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0074"/>
<col>139</col>
amongst our own kinsmen and our own fellow-subjects overseas. I will not refer to the history of Switzerland and the. State Constitutions and Municipal Constitutions of the United States, but you will find that over and over again the Referendum is invoked in those countries in order to correct the miscarriage of ordinary legislative, action. Mr. Bryce, in his most valuable book to which we all refer much to our advantage, gives an abundant accumulation of evidence substantiating what I have said with regard to America. The principle of the Referendum ran, especially through the Western States, like wildfire as a means of correcting what had proved to be the miscarriage of legislation; and our own fellow-subjects in Australia, as I have already said, have embodied it in their Constitution. If it were adopted here it would be a slur, no doubt, on the House of Commons if it should turn out that the House of Commons had gone beyond the national will; but, after all, what we desire is that the nation at large should govern itself. It should be the electorate to whom we should look for the government of the nation. I do not mean to say that you will find the last word of truth in the decision of the electorate, but it is the best you can get. It is far better than that of this House&#x2014;and having said that may I, without disrespect, say, far better also than that of the House of Commons. Though it would be a slow, almost unintelligent, turning over of considerations one way or the other which would be involved in bringing to the determination of a question the half-instructed opinion of the nation at large, yet you would, after all, get at something of the authority of a real determination. It is the determination by the mass of the nation, imperfect as it may be as a means of ascertaining the ultimate truth, by which we must be governed as we go on. Can it be introduced&#x2014;I come back to that point again and again&#x2014;without absolutely reconstructing this Bill?<lb/>
There are two ways in which the Referendum can be invoked, or, at least, two ways have been suggested. One is by the institution of some special authority such as was proposed by the noble Earl on the Cross Benches and by the noble Viscount opposite&#x2014;a Committee which shall determine. Another proposal was that involved in the Bill of Lord Balfour of Burleigh,
<col>140</col>
whose voice I wish we could hear in these Debates. On personal and public grounds it is a calamity that he is not here. In his Bill he proposes that a vote of this House, or a vote of an adequate minority in the House of Commons, should be able to bring about a Referendum. I am not sure whether something might not be done to combine these two methods of action, and if I were free to construct the process myself I should also proceed to amend the conditions under which the Referendum should be applied. The noble Marquess opposite proposes to make it apply necessarily in the case of the Protestant succession to the Throne, and in the case of what may be roughly called Home Rule legislation. The second provision I would myself remove altogether&#x2014;the provision requiring that Home Rule should necessarily be submitted to a popular vote. I am not saying that Home Rule is not a very grave matter. It possibly ought to be submitted to a popular vote. But I should leave that question, if I had the construction of the Amendment, to the Committee or other authority or joint authority which will have to determine its application. Why not leave out these Constitutional changes, which you cannot define, when you have, through the operation of the proposed authority, a means of securing that if the case is sufficiently important there will be a reference? I say this in spite of all that has been said by the noble Marquess who has just sat down.<lb/>
I think my noble friend below me would be amply justified in saying that at the last election Home Rule was specifically before the electorate. It was so, because those who opposed the present Bill pointed out most vigorously that Home Rule was in its train, and they did all they could to move the minds of the electorate to vote against candidates of the Government because those candidates were not only pledged to the Parliament Bill but to the Home Rule Bill that would follow. I therefore say, not presuming to prejudge the question here whether under a Reference to the people any particular scheme of Home Rule would be approved or not, that you cannot bring it out and say that by special exception and necessity it must be so referred. It should depend on the character of the Home Rule measure that is brought forward. If it involves some very great novelty which nobody had ever
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0075"/>
<col>141</col>
heard of before, then undoubtedly the Committee, or whatever authority was invoked to determine the question, would hold that it should go to a reference. If it merely proceeded on old lines, then the warning to the nation was sufficient to preclude any presumption that they did not understand it. Then there may be other matters leading to the determination as to when the Referendum should be required, but you gain nothing by the insertion of those necessary references of Constitutional questions. You may have very important questions which are not there included, and you may bring in under that proviso as it stands questions of comparative insignificance. I think you may leave it to the class of cases to be considered by the authority. Now as to that Authority. Of the proposal of the noble Earl on the Cross Bench we shall no doubt hear from him a further explanation. To my surprise he has told us this evening that he adheres to the fourteen members of the Committee&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

I would have a Committee of four at the outside. I am a little doubtful about. the Lords of Appeal&#x2014;I will let that pass however&#x2014;but I would have a limited Committee of three or four at the outside. Further, I would not have them take action
<col>142</col>
unless upon a vote of this House or some appeal by a minority of the House of Commons such as is provided for in Lord Balfour of Burleigh's Bill. Under these conditions the process would still be one which may be described as a revolution. But I think under the conditions I have suggested the reference would only arise on rare and distant occasions when the gravity of the issue involved justified the reference being made. At all events I would have the proposal considered. I would like to have it considered as some way of getting out of what promises to be a very bitter controversy, involving issues we would all like to remove from our public life, and also a way of escaping from the real perils of a miscarriage of legislation such as I attempted to describe at the commencement of my speech, such as have occurred elsewhere, and such as would have occurred in Australia but for the existence of the Referendum there.<lb/>
There are before the nation many large and extensive schemes of legislation. Some people are alarmed at what promises to be the taxation proposals of the future; some are afraid of the introduction of a large addition to our electorate, and no doubt I have bugbears and terrors of my own. I see also before us a large quantity of legislation of the most doubtful character which requires the most careful attention. Legislation, it has been said, proposes now to take care of us from our cradle to our grave. That is not enough, because some of the legislation which we have in front of us begins before the cradle is in existence. We have not quite got to the length of legislation laying down what men shall marry what women, but we have got pretty nearly as far as this&#x2014;that certain men shall not marry certain women. Then there is the case of the children, the taking away of children from parental authority and control, the removal at the national or local expense of all destitution, and the physical and moral ill which arise from evil habits and evil traditions&#x2014;the extent of these. proposals before us come under a name which was much abused centuries ago and which perhaps may be likely to be abused now&#x2014;"benevolences." These "benevolences" threaten most seriously to interfere, not only with the self-respect, but with the absolute means of keeping together the industrial body of our nation as a, self-sustained and self-sufficing people. We, or those who come after us, will have
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0076"/>
<col>143</col>
to be on the watch and to be very careful. For myself, I cannot but think that we should not reject any safeguard, however novel or strange, which might secure that. the legislation of the next generation shall go soberly and steadily forward according to the will and ascertained opinions of the mind of the nation at large; and, proceeding from experience to experience, so working out the future that it may be a worthy continuation of our past.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00339"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess's Amendment deals with a great many grave matters besides the one that is commonly called Home Rule, and I have no doubt there are many in this House who will deal with those other matters in the noble Marquess's Amendment. I hope noble Lords in England will remember that what really touches us to the quick is the fact that a National Parliament, or Assembly, or a National Council, can be established in Ireland under this Bill without any reference to the people at all. We are often reminded, and we have been reminded by both noble Viscounts on the Government Front Bench, that it is because of our action with regard to referring the Budget to the people that we have the Parliament Bill brought. before us. But I think it is hardly fair upon us in Ireland that coupled with the Parliament Bill should be a pledge to the Nationalist Party that they are to have Home Rule. That pledge is as much part of the Bill as the Bill itself.<lb/>
The noble Viscount said that the electors must be dupes if they did not understand that Home Rule was put before them at the last General Election. The noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, referred to many election addresses and speeches made by Government supporters and Ministers, in which the question of Home Rule was not mentioned in any way whatsoever. Then the noble Viscount referred to two speeches made by Lord Lansdowne, one in Scotland and one at Portsmouth. But the result of the election at Portsmouth was that a Unionist Member was returned, and I think we may congratulate ourselves that the reference to Home Rule which the noble Viscount tried to father on to the noble Marquess made us win the election at Portsmouth. Let us look for a moment at the history of the Home Rule question as dealt with by the Liberal Government.
<col>144</col>
In 1886 the Home Rule Bill which was then brought in was rejected by this House, and most deliberately rejected by the country. Then another Bill was brought in and passed in 1893. That was also thrown out by the Lords, and at the General Election the action of this House was fully justified. But there was another Bill that nobody has mentioned. That was another attempt of the Liberal Government to bring in Home Rule for Ireland. I am referring to the Councils Bill which was brought in by Mr. Birrell. What happened to that Bill? It was opposed by the Unionist Members most strongly in the House of Commons, and then there was a sort of informal National Parliament held in Dublin on the Bill. It was rejected there, and practically torn up and thrown in the face of the Minister who brought it forward. Yet, my Lords, with that experience before them the Government now try by an indirect means to force Home Rule upon us in Ireland. It is true there is to be some delay. What the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, said about that in his Second Reading speech I should like to mention. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"I must again remind the House what the Bill [the Parliament Bill] does. The House of Commons has to pass a Bill three times; it is rejected here twice; two years must elapse; so there is no sudden flood tide."</quote>
Then he said that to suppose that a Home Rule Bill would go through those two years unchanged and unmodified would be really to show a curious ignorance of legislative conditions in this country.<lb/>
But, my Lords, during that term of two years I do not suppose the question of Home Rule would be discussed at all. There might be some very important measure brought forward which would overshadow in the minds of the electors of Great Britain the question of Home Rule, and the Home Rule Bill might, so to speak, go into the background for a time. But those two years would gradually, but surely, elapse, and the Home Rule Bill would be imposed on the country by the Government, and could be imposed on the country under the terms of this Bill, without amendment, no matter what speeches had been made against it, and I do not suppose His Majesty's Government would take much notice of any disturbances or rows there were in Ireland during that time. That is what we feel in Ireland with regard to Home Rule. We have a most profound
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0077"/>
<col>145</col>
mistrust of the Government upon this question, because we know perfectly well the coalition that exists between them and the Nationalist Party, and I begin to think, and a great many have begun to think, that but for the Nationalist Party forcing the hands of the Government we should not have hail this Parliament Bill brought up to us so soon, or it would not have been of such a very drastic character.<lb/>
I am not going to abuse my fellow-countrymen the Nationalists, nor rake up the statements which have been made by them in America, Canada, and. Australia, and also, when it suits them, the conciliatory statements they make when they speak to the electors in this country; but I must point out this, that Mr. Redmond has said again and again in Ireland that his public policy was to make English government in Ireland dangerous, difficult, and impossible. I do not think noble Lords on the other side of the House will contradict that statement. And it is to this man and his followers that the management and the government of Irish affairs is to be handed over! That is not, to say the least of it, a pleasant prospect for us Unionists and loyal people in Ireland, and I must draw the attention of the House to the fact that the one million Protestants in Ireland are, the great majority of them, entirely against the granting of any measure of Home Rule whatsoever.<lb/>
There is another aspect of the Home Rule question to which I should like to draw the attention of the noble Viscount. I allude to the financial aspect. I am not going to say a word as to the financial relations between the two countries, as shown by the Royal Commission appointed by Mr. Gladstone. I admit that since that time we have had a great deal of money granted for different purposes in Ireland. I admit that we have had the Board of Agriculture, and technical education, and that money has been fully furnished. We have also had large sums of money to carry out the purchase of land in Ireland, and also for the compulsory suppression of congestion in the west of Ireland. But there has been a Committee recently appointed by the Government on this question, and what I complain of is that the Prime Minister has said that nothing will be known to us as to the findings of that Committee. Their sittings, I suppose, have been going on, but nothing
<col>146</col>
whatsoever is to be known. The only inkling that we have had about the matter was in a speech by Mr. Birrell. He said it would be a hard matter to fit in&#x2014;speaking of the findings. I believe the words were, "It would be a very tight fit." I do not think that is satisfactory at all. In fact the Government are keeping the whole question of Home Rule in the dark as much as possible, because they know perfectly well that if this Bill is passed, which I hope it will not be, in its present state, they can slip it in with the greatest of ease and that it will be imposed upon us. I was glad the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, admitted, in his speech on the noble Marquess's Amendment, the enormous difficulties in the construction of a Home Rule Bill. I quite agree with him, and I think he will find that the enormous difficulties which will accrue will be the difficulties of finance, because, as the noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, has pointed out, if the credit of this country is taken away from us I do not know at all how on earth any Home Rule Government is going to carry on.<lb/>
Now I should like to say something as to the wish for Home Rule by Ireland at large. By Ireland at large I mean the majority of the population. I leave out altogether the million Protestants. I am sure noble Lords will remember that in Parnell's time the driving power behind the Home Rule question was the land question, and if he had not had the land question. behind him he would not have had the driving power he did have with regard to Home Rule. The land question is slowly&#x2014;too slowly, alas! owing to Mr. Birrell's last Bill&#x2014;being settled. I say without fear of contradiction that among the farmers and peasants who have bought their land and are now settled: upon their own property, so to speak, the wish for Home Rule, to put it as low as possible, is not nearly as keen as it was; and I can tell noble Lords that in my own part of Ireland if you were to hold a meeting there you would not get the large farmers and respectable tenants to come and listen to a man urging Home Rule. I say further&#x2014;and I speak under correction from my noble friend beside me, Lord Clonbrock&#x2014;that in the west of Ireland, where the purchase of land has been going on much more slowly and where the United Irish League is rampant, if you were to ask a farmer whether he would rather have Irish
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0078"/>
<col>147</col>
Home Rule or his land, he would say, "I would rather have my land and be left alone to look after my own affairs, and not have politics interfere with me." That obtains in the part of Ireland in which I live perhaps more than it does in the West.<lb/>
From a business point of view, what on earth do we gain by severing the bonds that tie us to this country? We are united to the greatest Empire the world has ever seen, and we are helped and financed by the richest Treasury that Empire has ever known. Individual Irishmen are taxed like individual Englishmen, but if Home Rule is imposed upon us and any part of the credit we now have by being attached to the British Treasury is withdrawn we should indeed be in a poor position. I ask noble Lords opposite, supposing we had Home Rule, who is going to lend Ireland a single penny of money to carry out any large public works, and where is she going to get the credit to borrow money? We are as determined as ever to oppose any form of Home Rule. I should like to allude to the statement the Lord Chancellor made&#x2014;it was alluded to briefly by the noble Marquess&#x2014;in his Second Reading speech on this Bill. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"They know the policy of the Government involves Home Rule for Ireland; not only so, but I venture to say tint when that subject comes forward we shall find a very different tone and temper towards it from the country at large and from the Conservative Party than prevailed in the unhappy efforts which we made before. The younger members of the Conservative Party are largely in favour of some measure which may be fairly called Home Rule, and some of the more experienced and leading members of the Party are so too."</quote>
That is a starred speech. It has been revised by the Lord Chancellor. I can only say that I have met none of the younger members of the Conservative Party who are in favour of Home Rule, and I think it has been pretty clearly shown what the leaders of our Party think.<lb/>
Ireland is perfectly peaceful and prosperous now; yet we are to be suddenly plunged into political turmoil, and God alone knows how it will end. The Government have refused every Amendment to this Bill. The noble Viscount has got up time after time and said the Government cannot accept this Amendment and that
<col>148</col>
Amendment. I feel that this is not the place to fight Home Rule, that England is not the place in which to fight it, and that resolutions and speeches are of no use whatsoever. But I do not intend, so far as I am personally concerned, to say anything more about Home Rule. I intend to go back quietly to Ireland and organise and prepare for the worst, not in the least hoping for the best, and to use arguments that I hope in the future will be somewhat stronger than amendments and resolutions. I think the noble Viscount knows and understands what I mean. There are many people in Ireland who are quite determined to resist the matter to the utmost. After all, that is a straightforward and fighting policy to take up, and it is one that will commend itself, I think, to the noble Marquess beside me, and to those who live in the North of Ireland. Ulster is pretty strong and determined yet, and those who live in the scattered parts in the South are going to help all they can to support Ulster in this old fight against separation from this country in any shape or form.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00340"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have the honour to be an Irish landlord at the present moment&#x2014;I hope not altogether an absentee one&#x2014;and I can assure noble Lords behind me that I fully sympathise with them, and as far as I may be allowed to work in co-operation with them I shall do so to the best of my power. But I am anxious that any observations I make to your Lordships' House tonight shall be on the Bill before us as a whole, because I think it would be a misfortune if it went forth that the debate we are now carrying on was only a Home Rule debate. I only mention Home Rule in order to protest as strongly as I can against a doctrine which has been enunciated not for the first time in this House&#x2014;the doctrine laid down by the noble Viscount opposite, that as the Opposition had given a certain amount of prominence to the Home Rule question it must therefore be assumed to have been before the electorate. It is perfectly true that we did refer to it on many occasions. I did myself&#x2014;not altogether, I admit, very successfully&#x2014;as I felt that I was to some extent put into a difficult position. I might recall that at a meeting which I held an interrupter got up, when I was referring to the question of Home Rule, and said&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0079"/>
<col>149</col>
<quote>"I have every reason to believe that you are not a particularly untruthful person, and I would ask you; Can you honestly say that the question of Home Rule is before us when not a Liberal candidate within miles of where you are sitting has mentioned it in his election address?"</quote>
I admit that was a very difficult argument to deal with, and the man himself&#x2014;he was only an ordinary individual&#x2014;afterwards told me&#x2014;
<quote>"Yon know as well as I do that Home Rule has not really been placed before the country at this election. There are thousands of us who object strongly to your fiscal policy but who have a stronger objection still to Home Rule, and though we are going to vote for the present Government on account of your fiscal policy, if we thought for one moment that Home Rule was going to be put forward by them we should give our votes to you."</quote>
That, I have no doubt, was repeated in thousands of instances, and I take this opportunity of protesting most strongly against the doctrine that because the Opposition warned the country of the effects of legislation of this character that proves that Home Rule has been considered by the country at large.<lb/>
I would like to make reference to a remarkable statement which fell from the noble Viscount in regard to subsection (<i>a</i>) of the Amendment of my noble friend. The Amendment, as your Lordships all know, affects the question of the Crown and the Protestant succession. The noble Viscount brought forward as a reason that it was not necessary to put this in the Bill, that no Parliament was ever likely to do such a thing in the future. That is an argument which we on this side cannot accept. We have to be prepared for every possible contingency or emergency that may occur, and, as noble Lords opposite never cease from reminding us we have now got fixed and stereotyped relations existing between the two Houses. This is not solely a question affecting the House of Lords. It affects the Commons; it affects the electorate of the country; and as such, particularly on a question affecting the existence of the Crown and the Protestant succession, we should be especially careful to avoid bringing the Sovereign's name in at all. The noble Viscount said, and of course historically and constitutionally we accept his authority&#x2014;and I believe that constitutionally and historically he is correct&#x2014;that it would be constitutional for the Sovereign to dismiss his Ministers on any question
<col>150</col>
affecting the Crown or affecting the succession. But to have had that used by a member of the present Government, which relies, or professes to rely on the deliberate opinion of the country&#x2014;to say, "Our defence of the existence of the Crown or the Protestant succession rests upon the possibility of the Sovereign himself taking action in this matter&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00341"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: On advice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00342"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: I do not remember hearing the noble Viscount say "On advice."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00343"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Oh, yes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00344"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: If so, let me take up that interruption. The Government obviously must rely on the House of Commons, and if a Minister introduces a Bill affecting the existence of the Crown or the Protestant succession is it possible to assume for one moment that the Sovereign's Ministers would give him advice contrary to that which they are giving to the House of Commons? It would be utterly impossible for a Minister to give advice of one character to the House of Commons and advise his Sovereign to the contrary. I venture to say that at this period of our history, having heard such a doctrine from such an authority as the noble Viscount, we have some right to make a protest against the exclusion of this subsection on the ground that it would be the prerogative of the Sovereign to be able to dismiss his Ministers and consult the people on the matter personally. After all, a fundamental difference exists between those on the Bench opposite and noble Lords on this side of the House. Noble Lords opposite appear to imagine that as soon as an individual is elected a member of the House of Commons he at once, and for all time he may serve there, is blessed with a species of superhuman ability. I trust that I shall never be one who would in any way speak disrespectfully of an institution in which I had the privilege and honour of serving and for which I have feelings of profound respect, but I do venture to say that noble Lords opposite are sometimes inclined to add too great a value to the mere fact that a man serves in the House of Commons.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0080"/>
<col>151</col>
The noble Viscount opposite constantly reminds us that we must not diminish the privileges of the House of Commons. As far as I am aware, no suggestion of that sort has ever been made from these Benches. Certainly there are many of us who would not hesitate for one moment to sever our connection with our Party if we thought that any such attack was made, or intended to be made, on the privileges of the House of Commons. What we are anxious to do is to be able to help and assist members of the House of Commons by furnishing them with the means and opportunity of gathering more directly than they can to-day what the direct opinion of the country is on these great subjects. We must all admit, I think with some feelings of alarm, that the efficiency of our Parliamentary machine is in considerable danger, and that it will be still more endangered by this Bill many of us feel certain. I am not now speaking of the efficiency of this House, but with reference to the House of Commons itself. The inevitable effect of this Bill being passed in anything like its present form will be to cram alt immense amount of legislation into the first two years of the existence of any Parliament.<lb/>
Though it is not altogether germane to this Amendment, I confess I heard with some alarm last night the refusal of the Government to consider the Amendment which was moved by Lord Malmesbury with reference to the use of the closure and the guillotine and the various other methods which are commonly employed for the expedition of business in the House of Commons. Those methods will increase, I am confident, as the legislation grows during the first two years of a Parliament. We are bound to see much legislation hurried through in the first two years of any Parliament in order that it may be ready to comply with the provisions of this Bill. That makes it more necessary than ever that every effort should be made to obtain what is the well-considered verdict of the country upon many of these matters. Many of us welcome these proposals by which great Constitutional questions can be removed from the operation of this Bill, not because they are big Constitutional questions, but in order that they may be referred deliberately and <i>seriatim</i> to the judgment of the country, if it is so desired. But as a matter of fact the mere existence of this machinery would probably act in
<col>152</col>
the way of preventing Bills being introduced unless the Government had reason to believe that they would commend themselves to the majority of the country. As it is now, Bills not always very well considered and involving great issues are brought in and hurried through. Occasionally they are rejected by your Lordships' House, but often they are not. I sat for twenty days this session on a committee in order to attempt to ascertain what was the intention of Parliament in an Act which it passed twenty years ago. The Bill was hurried through to some extent, but, so far as we could find, there was no deliberate intention on the part of the Government of that day of creating the evils which subsequently arose out of it. That shows the inadvisability of hurried legislation, and I can only hope that the Government will hold out a helping hand and enable us to do something. not only to make this Bill more workable, but&#x2014;and this is a matter to which we attach infinitely more importance&#x2014;to improve the efficiency and the good working of the whole of our Parliamentary machine.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00345">[<i>The sitting was suspended at a quarter to eight o'clock and resumed at a quarter past nine.</i>]</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00346"><member>LORD FARNHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the great hostility with which we Unionists in Ireland regard this Parliament Bill in its present form is largely caused by the fact that we look upon it simply as a machine created at the instigation of Mr. Redmond to ensure him securing Home Rule for Ireland without the will of the people first being expressed upon it. It is all very well for noble Lords opposite to continue to say that the opinion of the people was expressed on Home Rule at the last General Election, in spite of what has already been said by noble Lords on this side of the House. True it is that we did our best at the last General Election to try to show the people that Home Rule was in danger of being forced through by the present Government, but at the same time we found it very hard to make them believe that fact when there was no mention of Home Rule, as has already been said, in the election addresses of the Party of noble Lords opposite. We therefore welcome this Amendment of the noble Marquess, as it will at all events guard us against the very obvious injustice of having Home Rule forced upon us without
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0081"/>
<col>153</col>
the people first being allowed to pronounce upon it, an event which we believe would bring disaster to our native country&#x2014;disaster which would shake the very foundations on which the British Empire has been built.<lb/>
So obvious, indeed, is this injustice of forcing Home Rule upon us and disfranchising the British electorate on the matter of Home Rule, and so unconstitutional, that I do not believe even the present Government would attempt to do it if they were their own masters in the matter, though as far as the Constitution is concerned it appears to me that the Government regard it very much in the same light as a small boy would regard a new watch&#x2014;namely, as something to be pulled to pieces and broken up. But we know very well that they are not their own masters in the matter. We in Ireland know that our interests are being sacrificed and heavy burdens of taxation imposed upon us, simply that Mr. Redmond may be handed down to posterity as the man who obtained Home Rule for Ireland; and we know that he has every intention of seeing that the Government carry out his wishes in the matter. Mr. Redmond has been trying for some time past to smooth the path of the Government by allaying their fears and the fears of the British people. as to what would be the ultimate result of Home Rule. He has told them, and told the people in this country, that Home Rule means loyalty to the Crown, a strengthened Empire, and fair play and toleration to minorities. I have no doubt that it is very convenient for noble Lords opposite and their Party to believe these sentiments, as it soothes for the moment those fears which I believe they really possess at the bottom of their hearts as to the ultimate success of Home Rule. But it would be well for them to ascertain first if these sentiments are backed up by the people in Ireland whom Mr. Redmond and the Nationalist Party pretend to represent.<lb/>
Mr. Redmond states that Home Rule means loyalty to the Crown. Yet it is a very curious fact that his own constituents in Waterford held a large meeting on May 21 to protest against the addresses of welcome which were being drawn up to be presented to His Majesty the King on his approaching visit to Ireland; and also we find in the speech of an Irish Member
<col>154</col>
of Parliament at a large demonstration held in Dublin on Coronation Day words to this effect&#x2014;
<quote>"King George of England was a foreigner, and with his personality, if he had such a thing, no Nationalist was concerned."</quote>
The rest of his remarks I would particularly commend to noble Lords opposite, for I am sure they will appreciate them. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"For them in Ireland he was only a figure-head of that guilty institution of clever and unscrupulous men called the British Government."</quote>
Again, Mr. Redmond spoke at Woodford on May 27 and said that Home Rule meant a closer union. "It is not a weakening," he said, "but a strengthening of the Empire." Yet we find that a significant resolution was proposed at a large meeting in Dublin, at which I may mention a letter of apology, or a. telegram I think it was, was read from no less a person than Mr. William Redmond. The resolution reads as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"Resolved, that the right of Ireland to have government solely by the people of Ireland is inalienable, and that no man can fix a boundary to the progress of Ireland's Nationhood."</quote>
And yet Mr. Redmond declares that he is not a separatist! The resolution goes on&#x2014;
<quote>"And further resolved, That we rejoice at the success of all sections of our fellow-countrymen in the United States to oppose any alliance between that country and Great Britain&#x2014;a proposal equally inimical to the peace of the United States and the liberties of Ireland."</quote>
We find that resolution supported by a man called Dr. McCarten, who used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"England's greatest enemy to-day was Germany, and Irishmen, if they were active enough, could have the co-operation of Germany if things developed as they were going at the present time."</quote>
Yet Home Rule means a closer union! It is not a weakening but a strengthening of the Empire! Just to complete that ceremony and to show how much closer the Union would be under Home Rule, they finished, as they have done so often recently, by burning the Union Jack.<lb/>
I am sorry to weary your Lordships with quotations, but they are necessary to show how Mr. Redmond's remarks in this country are interpreted by the Home Rule party in Ireland. Mr. Redmond tells us&#x2014;he is loud, in fact, in his protestations
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0082"/>
<col>155</col>
&#x2014;that Home Rule means fair-play and toleration to minorities. He is quite hurt when we in Ireland do not believe him, and yet at the same time he remains chairman of a League which is expressly organised to defy the forces of law and order in this country. That League tyrannises over and terrorises those peaceful and law-abiding citizens who prefer to obey the law of the land rather than to obey the law of the United Irish League. Mr. Redmond said&#x2014;
<quote>"Let them ask for any legislative safeguards they like, and he would accept them."</quote>
Perhaps noble Lords opposite will notice that he does not think the people have any right to a say in the matter at all. It is Mr. Redmond alone who has the power to grant us these safeguards. There is only one safeguard that we in Ireland require, and that is the safeguard which we have at the present moment&#x2014;namely, the Act of the Union. We have no intention of ever allowing ourselves to be separated from this country. Loyalty to the Throne, fair-play to minorities, and the strengthening of the Empire is what we are told Home Rule means. Yet we find a Major McBride, of South African fame, but who, mark you, at the present moment is a favourite proteg&#x00E9; of the Redmondite Corporation of Dublin&#x2014;we find him being received with loud applause by a large Nationalist gathering in Dublin when he declared&#x2014;
<quote>"They should strike how they might and when they might against the Throne and the cursed British Empire, and for the freedom of Ireland."</quote>
Is it any wonder that we in Ireland decline to believe a man whose protestations are so inconsistently carried out by the Home Rule Party in Ireland? But most of all is Mr. Redmond anxious to try to persuade the people in this country that there is no Ulster question. I have noticed also that members of the Party opposite, whenever they did mention Home Rule on an election platform, which was but seldom, tried to dismiss the Ulster question by saying that the Ulster opposition was confined only to a small band of Orange bigots. I am an Ulster man and I am also an Orangeman, and I emphatically deny that Orangemen are either few in numbers or bigots.<lb/>
The guiding principle of Orangeism is to uphold the civil and religious rights of
<col>156</col>
all men, irrespective of their party or their creed. But the greatest mistake that is made is to say that the opposition in Ireland is confined to Orangemen. Orangemen are doubtless there, well disciplined, well organised, and ready to perform any duties that may become necessary in the disastrous event of Home Rule ever becoming law. As regards the number of the Orangemen, I would like to say that perhaps the best way for noble Lords opposite and their Party to ascertain them would be for them to come over to Ireland on the coming July 12 and see for themselves the numbers of Orangemen at the various county meetings that will be held, and also see for themselves the completeness of their organisation and their stern determination never to have Home Rule. But the opposition to Home Rule in Ulster, and indeed all over Ireland, is of a far wider scope. It embraces all creeds and parties, who are now banding themselves together to show their determination not to allow Home Rule to become law, and in the event of its becoming law to resist it to the utmost of their power. This is rapidly being brought to light in the case of the public at large by the formation or the restarting of Unionist clubs in Ireland. Not only is it false to say that there is no Ulster question, but the Ulster question is as burning to-day as it ever has been in the past, and if one of the real reasons of the Government for opposing the Amendment of the noble Marquess is to smuggle a Home Rule Bill through Parliament without first consulting the electorate, then they will end in plunging a part of the United Kingdom into a state of turmoil, strife, and bloodshed, if not indeed an actual state of civil war.<lb/>
These may be very serious sentiments to bring forward, but I am sure noble Lords who come from Ulster will support me when I say they are uttered in all solemnity and with some knowledge of the preparations which are now going quietly forward in Ulster to resist Home Rule, and, in the event of its becoming law, to refuse to acknowledge any Parliament which may be set up in College Green, or to obey its laws, or pay its taxes. My Lords, I will not detain you at any greater length, but I will say, in conclusion, that if the Government cannot cast off the yoke which now binds them and break away from the line which I am sure by this time they are very sorry to be toeing, they will
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0083"/>
<col>157</col>
bring to pass a great national evil which will involve them in a disaster far greater to themselves than the one they are now trying to avert, of being turned out of office by 70 odd Irish votes which they have bought at so humiliating and so grave a price.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00347"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened this afternoon with very great interest indeed to the speech delivered by the noble Viscount who leads this House, a speech made in answer to the closely reasoned and very conciliatory speech of the noble Marquess who leads this side of the House. Perhaps what interested me most in the whole of the noble Viscount's speech was the answer he gave to that important question which was raised in the first paragraph of Lord Lansdowne's Amendment&#x2014;I mean that paragraph which asks if the Crown and Prerogatives of the Crown are to be interfered with without an appeal to the people of this country. The answer the noble Viscount made to that question so far as I could gather it&#x2014;and there is a good deal in it&#x2014;was that if the people of this country have made up their minds on such a subject as that an agreement between the two Parties in this House would not be of much avail, because it would be swept away. The noble Viscount then went on to deprecate the possibility of such an idea being entertained by the present House of Commons and the people of this country. I confess at once that until the last few months I should have agreed thoroughly with the opinion expressed by the noble Viscount on that point. But lately I have taken the opportunity, in an educational sense, of reading some of the out-and-out Socialistic newspapers of the day. All I can say is that there are writings in them of a kind that I had no idea of at all, and if the noble Viscount can spare a little time to read those newspapers I venture to say he will be thunderstruck by some of the articles he will find in them. I hope he will endeavour to do so, because I tell him quite frankly that what I gathered came upon me in a new light altogether, and I have learnt a great deal since I began to read those newspapers. The noble Viscount's remarks lead me to wonder whether we do enough to try to educate the masses of this country. Are we to try to educate them, or are we trying to keep the people of this country quiet by what I would call a system of bribes and
<col>158</col>
doles? Are we resorting to the <i>panis et circenses</i> of the great Roman Empire of Old days? We all know what the result of that process was in those days, and if we rely on doles to the people I do not know what as a nation we shall become in the future.<lb/>
The old-age pension system in a certain sense, and also the recently introduced national insurance scheme, may both be described as doles. Of course, there is a great deal of good, as well as a great deal that one must admire, both in the old-age pension system and in the newer insurance scheme. The blot on the old-age pension scheme, as was pointed out in this House when it was under discussion, is that it was not made contributory, and therefore to a great extent does away with thrift, because a man who is of a saving disposition up to the age of sixty is faced with the drawback that if he goes on saving up for another ten years he does not come in for the old-age pension given by the Government when a person reaches seventy years of age. It seems to me that lately we have been inclined to try to find out who are the saving people, the hard-working people, the people with brains, who by reason of their virtues and their industry have been able to amass a certain amount of money. We then in some degree proceed, by means of such things as Death Duties, Super-Tax, and so forth, to take away from people who have been hard-working all their lives some of their carefully accumulated means, and give that money to people who have not worked so hard, to people who have no brains, and in some cases&#x2014;and I am glad of these&#x2014;to people who are afflicted by misfortune. I am afraid, however, that the number of unfortunate people who benefit by the money taken away from the hard-working and saving members of the community is very few. Now that we are getting to the end, as it appears to me, of the possible doles, I should like to know what will happen when we have nothing more to offer. Shall we be at the top of that slippery slope that we sometimes hear of? When the people get on that slippery slope will their leaders, however daring they may be, however intelligent and however desirous of stopping a fall, be able to save them? I would point out that at any rate the history of nations does not teach us that they would be able to do so, and I am afraid if we rely upon doles and such
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0084"/>
<col>159</col>
things instead of upon education we may get into a very parlous condition.<lb/>
The next question the noble Marquess asked was that relating to the setting up of an Irish Parliament. Was the proposal of the Government to establish a separate Parliament for Ireland to be submitted to the people of this country before being passed into law? The noble Viscount took up the position that he did not think that was necessary, because in his opinion during the last two elections, at any rate, the Irish question had been fully before the constituencies. In the election at the beginning of the year 1910 I had the opportunity&#x2014;an opportunity I was very glad to take&#x2014;of attending some big mass meetings in some of the largest towns in Yorkshire, and I can say for certain that in January, 1910, the Irish question was not before the constituencies in the true sense. I cannot answer for the election at the end of the year 1910, because I did, not take much part in it, as I was not in good health at the time and was not able to do so. But I repeat that my experience was that at the beginning of 1910 the Irish question was not before the constituencies. I would ask the noble Viscount whether lie thinks that many of these big questions that come before us in Parliament are thoroughly understood by the constituencies. The ordinary voter is a man of few brains who has about 25<i>s.</i> a week and several children to keep. He has not much room to think of anything but money and money's worth, which is food. He has not room for much patriotism and the higher politics. Let me put it in another way. Does the noble Viscount think, for instance, that the constituencies generally&#x2014;and I would take voters from the highest to the lowest on this question&#x2014;understand the true inwardness and importance of pensions?<lb/>
We have heard all over the country from Mr. Lloyd George, who brought in the Old-Age Pensions Act, which I agree is a good Act, that the cost is &#x00A3;13,000,000. It is nothing of the sort. It is &#x00A3;13,000,000 per year, which is a very different thing, because it means, if capitalised, &#x00A3;400,000,000 at least. I very much doubt, if you were to put a straight question to 99 out of every 100 voters, whether they would understand the magnitude of the old-age pension scheme. They would
<col>160</col>
merely say that the cost was &#x00A3;13,000,000. When the ordinary man in the street speaks of the way in which all gilt-edged Stocks, Consols and so forth, are falling he does not appreciate that this is one of the great reasons for the decline. I say again that the cost is not &#x00A3;13,000,000, but &#x00A3;13,000,000 per year, and an annuity of &#x00A3;13,000,000 would cost about &#x00A3;450,000,000. It is such big schemes as these that upset the finances of the country. If the Insurance Bill introduced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer is passed into law it may cost another &#x00A3;300,000,000 or &#x00A3;400,000,000 when put into proper shape. That would mean no less than &#x00A3;800,000,000 for those two schemes if we regard the cost in the light of an annuity purchase. This makes me wonder whether electors in this country, especially in big towns, where people are not so highly educated and have not an opportunity of learning these things, quite know what they are voting about. Is it fair to say that on a question such as Home Rule, and other questions equally interesting, they knew what they were voting for in the last two elections? I doubt it. It would be very much better if they had an opportunity of saying what their mind is about such a big question as Irish Home Rule.<lb/>
The noble Viscount holds out no olive branch to us, and I am sorry for it. I am the more sorry because I fully believe he would like to do so, and I have always thought so. I know there are difficulties in the way of that. He dislikes the Committee that is to be proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Cromer, because he says&#x2014;and I think he made a point there&#x2014;that if we appoint a Committee and just at the time of a General Election the Committee comes into play, its opinion might override that of the electors who had just elected Members to Parliament. I think, from my point of view at any rate, there is something in that point. What I would say is this. It occurs to me that the Irish Bill is the <i>crux</i> of the question. If we knew what the Irish Bill which the Government intends to bring in would be, if we thought it was going to be a fair Bill, having regard on the one hand to the desire of Ireland for a certain amount of Home Rule, and, on the other hand, to the natural desire in this country not to give doles amounting to many millions of pounds a year to Ireland if they want to have a separate entity of their own, speaking for myself
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0085"/>
<col>161</col>
alone I think we might come to a possible arrangement on the Irish question. If we came to an arrangement on the Irish question on fair lines we should then, to use a Yorkshire phrase, be "up against" the House of Lords question. We might very easily settle that by agreement between the two Parties, and then, and only then, should we escape from the one-Chamber government which is threatening us. One-Chamber government if it comes will last for some years at any rate, and from all points of view will bring nothing but disaster to this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00348"><member>THE EARL OF CLANWILLIAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in supporting the Amendment of the noble Marquess I wish to confine my remarks to that part of the question which deals with Home Rule, and I wish to add my protest to that of the noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, against the remark which fell from the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack the other day, that the opposition to Home Rule was weakening. So far as my knowledge goes, the opposition to Home Rule is growing in intensity day by day and hour by hour, certainly in Ireland, which, after all, is the country which is most concerned in the question. The opposition to Home Rule, I believe, arises from two factors. The first is the fear of religious persecution&#x2014;fear which is not based on any hypothetical cases which may arise in the future, but on facts which have actually taken place in the past, which must be fresh in the memories of your Lordships, and which are certainly ever present to the minds of the Loyalists who live in Ireland. The other factor is the fear that those who assume the reins of government in Ireland under the Home Rule Bill will raise taxes which will be unjust and ruinous to the Loyalists and to the manufacturers.<lb/>
Home Rule has not been a live interest of late years. Since 1893 it has not occupied a very prominent position on electioneering platforms, and if you do not talk to electors at election time about a subject which, perhaps, does not actually affect them at the moment, they are very apt to forget all about it. Since 1893, moreover, a new generation has arisen to whom Home Rule is practically unknown, and who do not understand the misery and the ruin which it would entail if it were introduced. But if Home Rule were made a clear issue again I am quite
<col>162</col>
sure that the result would be the same as it has always been, and that it would be rejected by the electors of this country. Therefore I think it is all the more important that Home Rule should be made a clear issue, and I must confess I would have preferred an Amendment which dealt with Home Rule alone and did not mix it up with other matters. That would have made it a perfectly clear issue before the electors. It would also have forced the Government's hand. It would have shown what was their real intention, which, I believe, is simply to use this Parliament Bill as a shield to home Rule. I regret, therefore, that we have not been able to do so. I understand that the Amendment which stands in the name of the, noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, next to this on the Paper&#x2014;
<quote>Page 2, line 33, after ("sessions") insert ("Provided further that the provisions of this Act shall not apply to a Bill to establish a separate Parliament and Executive for Ireland.")</quote>
is ruled out of order, and if that is the case I think it is all the more essential that some safeguard such as is provided in this Amendment should be introduced into this Bill. It would be very unjust to the electors of this country that any Home Rule at the present time should be rushed through, as I expect it would be under this Parliament Bill, before the electors of this country have had an opportunity of understanding what a Home Rule Bill would mean, and of studying and examining it. As I have said before, it is new to a great many of them, and it would be very unfair to Loyalists in Ireland, whose lives would not be worth living and whose property would be confiscated under a Home Rule Bill.<lb/>
I do not believe this Parliament Bill would ever have seen the light of day if it had not been for Home Rule. Noble Lords opposite are never weary of telling your Lordships that the real reason for this Parliament Bill is that your Lordships had the temerity to refer the Budget of 1909 to the electors. They are always ready to talk about the will of the people, and yet somehow or other when an attempt is made to put it into practice they seem to take rather a different view of the matter. But, of course, His Majesty's Government are not their own masters. They cannot do what they want, and they are hampered by their own supporters. Who, my Lords, are the real obstructionists of their policy,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0086"/>
<col>163</col>
and who have been for years the true obstructionists of Liberal legislation?&#x2014;not your Lordships' House but the Nationalist Members of Parliament, these so-called supporters who must be satisfied one way or another, and the one way by which His Majesty's Government propose to satisfy them to-day is by giving them a Home Rule Measure. In 1909 His Majesty's Government found themselves in the same predicament. They had to placate another section of their supporters, and in deference to the wishes and demands of the Labour Party they passed the Budget of 1909. To-day they propose to placate another section of their Party by passing a Home Rule Bill, and this Parliament Bill, my Lords, I believe to be nothing more or less than a cloak to Home Rule.<lb/>
I would like to ask His Majesty's Government a question with reference to the subject of taxes in Ireland&#x2014;namely, how they propose to improve the present state of prosperity in Ireland. Where is the money to come from? They can only raise taxes in the country, and the field of taxation is, after all, a very limited one. They can either tax a few people who have got a certain amount of money in the country, or the manufacturers. That must come to a very speedy end. Do His Majesty's Government propose that under a Home Rule measure they should empower a Home Rule Government to institute a tariff between Ireland and England? I do not see how they are going to raise their money in Ireland. The manufacturers would soon be ruined by extra taxation, and if they propose to allow a tariff to be raised, that tariff would very soon kill every industry in Ireland. It would be very interesting if His Majesty's Government would enlighten us in any way as to how this question of finance is to be carried out. Is the whole of the onus of taxation to be thrown on the English taxpayer? It is commonly said that it would cost the taxpayer another 3&#x00BD; millions sterling a year to carry through a Home Rule Bill, and, there is a rumour that it would cost 6&#x00BC; or 6&#x00BD; millions sterling, which capitalised is a sum of 200 millions. Is that what it is to cost to placate one section of His Majesty's Government's supporters in another place? It would be very interesting if we could be informed on this matter. After all, it has a direct bearing on the question, not only so far as people in Ireland are concerned, but so
<col>164</col>
far as people in this country are concerned. I think that if they pass this Parliament Bill His Majesty's Government will be in a fair way to ruin Ireland, just as they are at the present moment in a fair way to ruin England by their Budget of 1909.</membercontribution></p>

<col>165</col>
Londonderry, has made what one might call a Second Reading speech on a Home Rule Bill, and has given forth to the country his special views upon the Irish question, I feel myself bound to take the earliest opportunity available of explaining what my views are upon these points.<lb/>
The noble Marquess began his speech&#x2014;at all events I shall venture to take up this point first&#x2014;with an estimate of the character of the Irish Parliament, and he quoted Lecky with the object of showing that that Parliament fulfilled none of the objects or purposes which a Parliament Wright be expected to fulfil. I was greatly astonished that any noble Lord should venture to pass such a criticism on Grattan's Parliament as we have heard to-night from the noble Marquess, because the facts of history are patent, and since the publication of Lecky's great book they are known to a very large audience indeed. May I read from the second volume one or two extracts which will show the noble Marquess bow utterly mistaken he has been in his appreciation of that Parliament. In regard to law and order, which the noble Marquess stated were not preserved in those days, I find on page 493 the following passage&#x2014;
<quote>"The roads,' said one traveller, are almost invariably excellent. The inns are furnished with every accommodation that a traveller not too fastidious can require. &#x2026; Travelling is perfectly secure. &#x2026; Footpads, robberies, and highwaymen are seldom heard of except in the vicinity of Dublin.' The splendour of the capital was indeed out of all proportion to the wealth of the country; but it at the same time indicated clearly an increasing industrial activity."</quote>
Lecky goes on to state&#x2014;page 494&#x2014;the condition of things at that time&#x2014;
<quote>"In 1790 Sir John Parnell, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, stated in Parliament that it was his pride and his happiness to declare that he did not think it possible for any nation to have improved more in her circumstances since 1784.'"</quote>
That was said in 1790, during the time of the Irish Parliament; and further on I find that Lord Clare is quoted as having made these remarks&#x2014;
<quote>"I am bold to say there is not a nation on the habitable globe which has advanced in cultivation and commerce, in agriculture and in manufactures, with the same rapidity in the same period."</quote>
And the last quotation I will give is a statement made by Cooke, who was the Under-Secretary of the time, of the Union. This is what he said&#x2014;
<col>166</col>
<quote>"What is meant by a firm and steady administration? Does it Imam such an administration as tends to the increase of the nation in population; its advancement in agriculture, in manufactures, in wealth, and prosperity? If that is intended, we have had the experience of it these twenty years; for it is universally admitted that no country in the world has made such rapid advances as Ireland has done in these respects."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00354"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: May I ask the noble Lord whether there were no less than 54 Coercion Bills passed in that time?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00355"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: Those are details I have had no opportunity to look up. I have only had a slight opportunity since the adjournment of looking up the subject; but if on matters on which the noble Marquess has made certain definite statements I find, on the authority of Lecky, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Under-Secretary of the day, that those statements are not accurate, I think I may fairly infer that if I were able to make further inquiries I should find more inaccuracies in the noble Marquess's statements.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00356"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord has not replied to my query whether there were not 54 Coercion Bills.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00357"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: I am unable to reply, but I will make inquiries on the point, and I have no doubt I shall find some inaccuracy in the noble Marquess's statement. I now come to the question of finance. The noble Marquess has stated that a Parliament could not be run in Ireland because Ireland is in a bankrupt condition. What authority has he for saving that? The only authority he can appeal to are the financial figures produced by the Treasury. These figures show that two or three years ago the Irish revenue collected in Ireland was 11&#x00BC; millions, while the expenditure in Ireland was well under 10 millions. During the last two or three years, as we all know, certain irregularities have occurred in the collection of the revenues owing to the rejection of the Budget by your Lordships' House. Within the last two years there has been shown in the statements of the Treasury a certain deficit, but that matter is now under inquiry by the Committee appointed to look into the matter, and the conclusions of that Committee should not be forestalled or anticipated by any statements one way or the other. If I were to hazard
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0088"/>
<col>167</col>
a statement I should be inclined to say that it will be found by careful inquiry that the income and the expenditure of Ireland, even taking into account the payment of old age pensions, would come out about equal.<lb/>
But, my Lords, I take this point of view in Irish finance. Under the Act amalgamating the two Treasuries, the taxation and the expenditure in Ireland were made indiscriminate&#x2014;that is to say, taxation was to be at the same rate as in Great Britain, while there was to be no restriction of Irish expenditure to Irish revenue. Irish expenditure was to be regulated, not in accordance with the income from Irish taxation, but in accordance with the necessities of the Irish situation. Under the Act uniting the two Treasuries Ireland is entitled, if the necessity of her situation requires, to have, let us say, 12 millions spent upon her, even though only 9 millions or S millions is collected from her. From the time of the Union of the two Treasuries up to the present time the collection of revenue from Ireland has been, roughly, about 550 millions sterling. Of that amount more than one-half has been contributed to England, and less than one-half has been spent upon Ireland. Those figures show that, even if Ireland was in deficit at the present time, regard should be had to the amount she had contributed to Great Britain, and the deficit should be made up with no degree of stinginess. The noble Lord referred to the great increase of deposits in Irish savings' banks. There is another aspect to that matter. Has the noble Lord ever asked himself why is it that the deposits in savings' banks have increased so enormously, while the interest paid upon those deposits is only two or two and a-half per cent. Does it not suggest that there is in the minds of the Irish people some suspicion or mistrust attaching to the existing Irish Government. Does it not suggest that if another method of administration were introduced in Ireland that money would be invested in more paying securities? That, at all events, is the view which I take of the situation.<lb/>
But there is another aspect of the debate to-night. We have heard a good deal of the "loyal minority," and we have heard a good deal of the oppression and the spoliation to which the "loyal minority" would be exposed in case Home Rule were introduced in Ireland. The "loyal
<col>168</col>
minority" suggests that there must be a disloyal majority, and underlying the speeches I have heard to-night three principles were apparent. One is that the majority in Ireland are disloyal to the Throne; the second is that if the majority were in power they would oppress and despoil the minority; and the third, which some noble Lords have suggested rather than uttered, is that Irishmen do not want Home Rule as much as they did. Now, my Lords, not one statement has been made to-night which was not based on one or others of these principles. Not one other argument has been used, unless indeed we may count as an argument the aspersions which noble Lords have thrown so freely to-night upon the Irish political loaders. This last argument I may clear out of my way by saying that in all great political movements history takes small account of the criticisms of political partisans upon their political opponents, and I do not think on this occasion I need forestall or anticipate the verdict of history upon that matter.<lb/>
In regard to the argument that the Irish majority are disloyal to the Throne, I respectfully submit to this House the following considerations. In recent years the veil which had hung for so long over the true facts of Irish history has been largely withdrawn, and one can now see more clearly than before what is true and what is false. From that fuller knowledge I venture to affirm that after the early days of the Plantagenet dynasty&#x2014;certainly after it had ceased&#x2014;the Irish people as a people never revolted against their English King, although they frequently revolted against the executants of his Government in Ireland. There is no more severe critic of the Irish and of Ireland than Froude, and this is what he says about Irish resistance to Dublin Castle Rule up to the end of the 17th Century&#x2014;
<quote>"If the Irish were left with their lands, their laws, and their creed, their chiefs were willing to acknowledge their English Sovereign; the Irish were not to be blamed if they looked to the Pope, to Spain, to France, to any friend on earth or in heaven to deliver them from a power which discharged no single duty that rulers owe to their subjects."</quote>
That is Froude's judgment on English domination in Ireland up to the 17th century, and that judgment is confirmed by Edmund Burke in his letter to Sir Hercules Langreshe. Coming to later times, the impartial and well-informed Lecky
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0089"/>
<col>169</col>
tells us that this general charge of disloyalty was not true in the 18th century, and not even true in 1798, when parts of Ireland rose in rebellion.<lb/>
My Lords, the Irish were loyal to Charles I. They were loyal to James II, although he was personally not very deserving of their loyalty. They were loyal to the House of Hanover. This is what Lecky says about their loyalty at that time&#x2014;
<quote>"More than eighty years had now passed by since any act of rebellion or conspiracy or political turbulence had been proved against Catholics in Ireland. They had maintained an absolute, unbroken tranquillity during the Scotch rebellion of 1715, during the expedition organised against the house of Hanover by Alberoni in 1719, during tile great rebellion of 1745, during the long and desperate war that terminated in 1763, and amid all the complications that had since arisen."</quote>
The next King who came to Ireland was George IV, and him the Irish received in a manner which we all know. Coming to our own days, do we not remember the affectionate greeting which was given to Queen Victoria when, after a period of 50 years, she visited Ireland, which had greatly longed for her presence before? And those who among us witnessed the reception given to King Edward and Queen Alexandra, not only in the great centres of population, but in the remotest districts of Connaught, could not fail to perceive that the Irish people were loyal to their King. I have to ask your Lordships' pardon for inflicting these details upon you, but when I find reference made by noble Lords to the "loyal minority" I wish once for all to point out that the suggestion that there is a disloyal majority is not true or in accordance with the facts of history.<lb/>
I pass on to the second point&#x2014;namely, that the Irish Roman Catholics would oppress the minority if they had the power. The only occasion on which the Irish majority had power and control in Ireland was in the reign of James II during the Parliament of 1689. I can only appeal to Lecky, who gives an impartial and fair account of how the Irish Roman Catholic Members of that Parliament acted, for proof that religious animosity and racial antagonism have no great influence over the Irish race. The animosities of the seventeenth century are now a distant memory. The root and foundation of the quarrel between England and Ireland was the oppression associated with the occupation of land. From the
<col>170</col>
beginning of England's connection with Ireland down to the present time, the entire stream of Irish discontent can be traced to that one source. No attempt was ever made to remedy Irish grievances on that point until the Government of Mr. Gladstone in 1870 took the matter in hand, and since then I am glad to say there has been a gradual improvement. The principles of land settlement have been laid down, and although those principles are being very slowly carried into practice, they must work out to their ultimate conclusion; and that being so, I submit that statesmanship mid commonsense dictate that the Protestants and Catholics should be no longer kept apart, but that they should be allowed in co-operation with each other to learn those lessons of self respect, self-reliance, and toleration which one is so competent to teach the other.<lb/>
I find, from my experience of Irish life, no substantial reason for the fear which noble Lords express that the majority would oppress or despoil the minority. It is a remarkable circumstance that these expressions of fear do not come from those provinces in which the Catholics are in a vast majority, but we always hear them from Ulster, in which the Catholic and the Protestant populations are nearly equal. The fear, where it exists, I trace in my own mind to a sort of consciousness that the harsh treatment which Roman Catholics received in the past might impel Roman Catholics in the present to acts of retribution. That I think is bad psychology. But it goes against self-interest. I believe that the line of cleavage in an Assembly in College Green would be entirely different from a religious line of cleavage, and that it would follow a very much more healthy and beneficial line. And I believe that this would be greatly promoted if, by a system of proportional representation, all parties in every province were enabled at the polls to make their voices effectively heard.<lb/>
No one is more ready than I am to admit the great advantages that have come from remedial legislation, and I admit that the Irish people have been drawn closer to England by such Acts as the Local Government and the Agricultural Departmental Acts, the Act of 1903, the Old Age Pensions Act, the Labourers' Cottages Act, and the University Act. But noble Lords completely misrepresent the Irish nature and the facts of Irish life when they assert that the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0090"/>
<col>171</col>
ill-treatment and the misrule of centuries can be removed by a few well-considered measures of law. Those noble Lords are mistaken who can bring themselves to believe that the Irish people's natural desire for self-government is weakened because tardy justice has been done on a few points. Have those noble Lords seen the Irish Registrar-General's last Report? And if they have, do they fully realise the unspeakable tragedy that underlies these words which I quote from that Report&#x2014;
<quote>"The Returns as quoted and published show that the total number of emigrants, natives of Ireland, who left Irish ports from May 1st, 1855, to the end of December, 1910, amount in the aggregate to 4,187,443."</quote>
That is a number all but equal to the entire population of the island at the present time.<lb/>
What will be the verdict of history on an Administration which has such a horrible result as that to show? In vain will you search the pages of history, ancient or modern, for such a result of British or any other administration. And the irony of the situation is this, that noble Lords opposite, the representatives of the "English Garrison," who have carried out that system now come and ask England for an extension of the life of the system which has had such a result. My Lords, I pray that the answer of England will be, "Cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?"<lb/>
No, my Lords, we know far too much of the Irish administration to weaken in the least degree in our desire for the self-government which now, at long last, seems to be within our reach. I cannot speak for the Irish Parliamentary Party, whom I regard with much sympathy, but whose counsels I have never shared. And perhaps the reason is that I, wishing to benefit Ireland no less than they have looked at this question from the Imperial point of view, from the outside, while they, who have borne the heat and the burden of the day, naturally look at it from the Irish point of view, as it was most natural they should. But now I am disposed to think that we are not so far apart, that in essentials we agree, while I know perfectly well that I am in general agreement with a great body of men&#x2014;Nationalists and Unionists, Ulstermen, and men from the other three provinces, Catholics and Protestants&#x2014;who wish to see this question settled in a fair and reasonable way. And in this connection I welcome more than I can say the expression of opinion from such an authority as the noble Lord, Lord Faber, that such a
<col>172</col>
settlement should be considered as one way of approaching the solution of our Constitutional difficulties. While we admit the excellence of some recent laws, we affirm that these laws are not being carried out with the sympathy with which they would be if we ourselves had the control. We challenge the entire fabric of Irish government&#x2014;that "old-fashioned and complicated organisation," as the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition described it in this House in February, 1905, and an organisation such that, if any of your free Colonies were subjected to it, they would rebel in a year. We know that attention is not paid to questions which intimately concern the well-being of our people. We know that money is being mis-spent while there is a multiplicity of objects on which it could be well spent. We know that our people's children are being badly educated while their fellow children in Great Britain are being well educated. We know also that there is a vast reserve of administrative ability among us which is lying at present untapped and turned to no account. We object to being dragooned by English Departments on matters where our own knowledge is greater than theirs, and our ability to turn that knowledge to use is no less than theirs. We do not ask for the repeal of the Union, nor do we ask for the control or management of, or interference with, any service which is concerned with great affairs of State, or with matters touching the three kingdoms. That we willingly leave to the Imperial Parliament, in which we only ask to be fairly represented as we shall continue to bear our share in all Imperial taxation; and speaking personally for myself, I am willing that Irish finance should be connected with the finance of the Empire in the same intimate and dependent way as the finance of an Indian Province with that of the Indian Empire.<lb/>
We offer all reasonable guarantees to the minority over and above what I should regard as already sufficient&#x2014;the guarantee of this all-controlling and predominant Parliament. We maintain that it is in the interests of the Imperial Parliament, which is overweighted with business with which it cannot deal, that the performance of purely local Irish business should devolve upon a subordinate Irish Legislature, which alone can gee to its due performance, and to which, I infer from subsection (<i>b</i>) of the Amendment of the noble Marquess, he would not object if only legislative functions were withheld
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0091"/>
<col>173</col>
from it. If I am right in that inference, may perhaps say, in passing that I do not envy the reflections of those who wrecked the Irish Council Bill, because we Irishmen would be in a very different position in Parliament to-day if we could show three years' successful work under that Bill as a reason for giving us larger powers. But, however that may be, we see no reason or justice in your denying to us those opportunities of bettering ourselves which you have granted to the component provinces of the Overseas Dominions. Finally, we think that in the concession of our demand, a demand which is approved by the Parliaments of the Overseas Dominions, in extolling whose good sense and political wisdom you have this last few weeks exhausted the language of praise, will be found, not only a reconciliation of two peoples already too long estranged by evil counsels, but an abatement of Irish hostility abroad and the consolidation and the strengthening of our Empire at home.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00358"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope the noble Lord who has just sat down will acquit me of any disrespect for him or his somewhat impassioned argument if I ask leave of your Lordships to recall the debate to the rather larger ground upon which it started this afternoon. At the commencement of our proceedings the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, in a speech which I venture to think for lucidity and moderation and persuasiveness even the noble Marquess has seldom surpassed in this House, submitted certain proposals to your Lordships. Those proposals were made after full consultation with those who usually act with him, and I believe they represent the sense of the large majority of those who sit on this side of the House. They were suggestions to meet dangers by which, if the Bill of his Majesty's Government should become law, we feel this country would be confronted&#x2014;the danger for instance, that measures of first-class importance may be passed by the present majority, or in future by any majority in the House of Commons, behind the back and without the approval of the people of the country. The noble Marquess is not the only speaker who has called attention to that danger. I am very sorry that I was not fortunate enough to hear the speech of Lord Courtney this afternoon. It was a, remarkable speech, I am told, which might very properly
<col>174</col>
give cause for thought to the occupants of the Front Ministerial Bench. No one is more distinguished for his staunch Liberalism than Lord Courtney, or more willing as a rule to find reasons for supporting His Majesty's advisers, and yet I am told that he described the danger to which have been alluding as grave, and that he said the need for precaution was great. And if such words can emanate from such an authority as Lord Courtney, they at least are worthy of serious and sober attention from those who are forcing through this measure.<lb/>
When the noble Marquess resumed his scat we had a speech from the noble Viscount, Lord Morley. I hope I am not speaking disrespectfully of that speech if I say that it appeared to me to leave the main argument of the noble Marquess altogether untouched, that it was weak and inconclusive in its criticism of details, and that in its final passages it was obdurate in temper, although it never failed in courtesy of tone. If we had in this country the practice which prevails in France and certain other foreign countries of printing public speeches and placarding them on hoardings, so that they may be read by the electors, I could wish for nothing better than that the speech of the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, and the reply of the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, should be so treated and placed side by side.<lb/>
Now, may I briefly take the propositions of the noble Marquess and the replies given to them by the noble Viscount. The first proposition of the noble Marquess was that any Bill which affects the existence of the Crown or the Protestant succession thereto should not be passed without reference to the people. The justification of such a proposal was obvious. It is this. It rests on the doctrine which all of us willingly agree to, that the Monarchy in this country reposes in the last resort upon the will of the people; that it ought to be surrounded with the fullest securities you can devise; and that no better security can be o provided in the future as in the past than the confidence and support of the majority of the electors. One would have thought that the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, would have found no difficulty in accepting this proposition. He had not a word to say against it, it is true, but all he said was that the House of Commons was not less devoted to the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0092"/>
<col>175</col>
Throne than your Lordships, and that he could not imagine any House of Commons indulging in legislation such as that alluded to in this Amendment. Nor can I at the present time. But, after all, are not noble Lords opposite always telling us that we are legislating now, not for the immediate or present but for the distant future&#x2014;that they are putting permanent features into the Constitution of this country.<lb/>
While I am fully prepared to agree with what the noble Viscount said about the existing House of Commons, I cannot forget that there is in existence a powerful body&#x2014;the Social Democratic Federation&#x2014;not without representatives in the House of Commons, the main plank of whose platform is the abolition of the Monarchy. I cannot help remembering also that there is an hon. Member in that House possessed o of considerable influence in the country who has said, as recently as during the past year, that he regarded the existence of the Monarchy as a proof of lunacy among the people; and only the other day, with reference to these proposals with regard to your Lordships' House, the same hon. Member&#x2014;I am referring to Mr. Keir Hardie&#x2014;said:
<quote>"When coronets go into the melting-pot the Crown bad better beware."</quote>
No doubt a foolish and demented utterance, but still it was the utterance of a man not without influence and not without a great following in many parts of the country. And, moreover, in reading the debates quite recently in the House of Commons, I noticed that when a speaker on the Unionist side alluded to the possibility that a majority might wish to abolish the Monarchy in the future, the remark was greeted with a "Hear, hear" from one or more of the Labour Members. Therefore I would not be quite so confident as the noble Viscount about the House of Commons. We all of us wish to safeguard the Throne, and I should have thought there would be no difficulty in acceding to this portion of the noble Marquess's Amendment, because, after all, the only safeguard of the Throne is the assurance of the support of the majority of the people of this country.<lb/>
The second proposal of the noble Marquess was that no Home Rule Bill for Ireland or for any other portion of the United Kingdom should be passed unless
<col>176</col>
it was certain that it was demanded by a majority of the people. The noble Marquess pointed out that on the two last occasions when a Home Rule Bill had been before the country it had been rejected. He challenged the Government to say that Home Rule had been as a main issue before the country at the last election, and he definitely disputed the contention that a vote had been given in its favour. What was the reply of the noble Viscount to that? In the first place, he argued that Home Rule had been before the country, and, by a strange method, quoted from a speech of the noble Marquess himself. No doubt it was a great compliment to the noble Marquess to be told that he decides the issues that are to be placed before the country at a General Election by the Government, and we welcome it on that account, though we regret that the people did not attach more importance to the utterances of the noble Marquess. But we attach greater weight to what we find in the speeches and in the election addresses of members of His Majesty's Government. When we recall the fact that in, I believe, only eighty-three election addresses of Liberal Members of Parliament was any mention of Home Rule made, that it was absent from the address of the Prime Minister, from that of the Home Secretary, who seldom omits anything that is likely to be attended by personal or Party advantage, and, <i>mirabile dictu</i>, absent from the address of the Irish Secretary himself, who might reasonably be supposed to take at any rate a passing interest in the subject&#x2014;when we remember that Home Rule was conspicuous by its absence from the addresses of all these gentlemen, I think it becomes impossible to argue that it was, in any fair use of the term, a main issue before the country.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, then went on to an argument which, with all respect, I thought more extraordinary still. He said there was a particularly good reason why your Lordships should not be allowed any voice in any future settlement of this matter, and that reason was that the policy of this House had been one of passion and prejudice in regard to the Irish people, and that we have in the past thrown out so many measures for their relief. I need hardly call your Lordships' attention to the hopeless irrelevance of this remark to start with.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0093"/>
<col>177</col>
What has it got to do with the question whether in the year 1914&#x2014;because that would be the date&#x2014;home Rule shall or stall not be referred to the electorate before it becomes the law of the land? Obviously there is no connection whatever between the two situations. I submit to your Lordships that it is not only irrelevant but invidious and untrue. This House is not the only House of Parliament that has refused measures put forward for the relief of Ireland. The House of Commons has been <i>particeps criminis</i> with us, if, indeed, there has been a crime. How often were measures for Catholic emancipation and other proposals subsequently passed into law refused in the House of Commons before they came to this House? Indeed, looking at the record of this House, I should feel disposed to take the very opposite line, and to say, having regard to the natural prepossessions of your Lordships, that you have been distinguished in a remarkable degree by the abnegation with which on many occasions you have been willing to pass measures extremely distasteful to yourselves because you felt that they had been required in higher interests than your own. I recall only last year an. Irish Land Bill which was most seriously disapproved of and dissented from by many noble Lords from Ireland, but we placed it on the Statute Book because we were told that a measure of that sort was demanded by the representatives of Ireland and should not be kept off the Statute Book by any action of ours. I do not think, therefore, in a retrospect of the past, that this House has any particular cause for self reproach as regards Ireland.<lb/>
It is true that on one occasion we did thwart what were alleged to be the wishes of Ireland, but that is a case to which the noble Viscount, purposely perhaps, did not refer. That was the occasion on which we rejected a Bill introduced by the noble Viscount himself, conferring Home Rule on Ireland, and nobody who remembers the cheering crowds in Palace-yard and Parliament-square when that decision was given out and the reception that that vote met with in the papers the next day will accuse the House of Lords of having on that occasion stood in the way of the wishes of the great majority of the people of this country. Yet the argument of the noble Viscount with regard to Home Rule had great value, if I may be permitted to say so, in one respect, when he contended&#x2014;
<col>178</col>
whether on account of your prepossessions or prejudices or not&#x2014;that you had no right to have any voice in the future settlement of the Irish question, for was he not making the most frank admission we have yet had that this is a system of single-Chamber government which the Government are setting up? Therefore we now know that Home Rule is intended to be carried without the intervention of your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00359"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord is pressing the point a great deal too far. The point was that this House is reserving to itself special powers of Referendum in respect of Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00360"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I will come in a moment to the point about this House reserving to itself special powers of Referendum in respect of Ireland, because I shall presently contend that the power proposed to be reserved to the Joint Committee is not a power reserved to this House, and that it is a travesty to so describe it. I do not want to misrepresent the noble Viscount, and I am glad he disclaims the interpretation which I have, no doubt erroneously, placed upon his observations, but I thought he meant that your Lordships were disabled by your past history from having a fair right to speak on a Home Rule Bill should it come up to the Second Chamber. I am glad to know that the noble Viscount does not mean that, and I will gladly pass on to another portion of his remarks.<lb/>
The noble Viscount reserved his chief batteries for the main proposal of the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne&#x2014;namely, the proposal that a Joint Committee or a tribunal shall be set up, to which shall be referred the question whether the particular subjects specified in Lord Lansdowne's Amendment shall or shall not go for their final decision to a poll of the people. Now, what is the proposition of the noble Marquess? It is this, that to meet the certain dangers of a period of single-Chamber government the Referendum, as it is vulgarly called, should be applied in a very limited number of cases, and he proposes a tribunal to decide the question whether certain measures are or are not of the character specified. There are two proposals before us for the constitution of such a Committee. There is the proposal of the noble Earl, Lord
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0094"/>
<col>179</col>
Cromer, who originally suggested that the Committee should consist of fourteen gentlemen, seven from each House of Parliament. Then there is the proposal of Viscount St. Aldwyn for a smaller Committee, what I may call a more official and a less political and less partisan Committee, consisting of six persons, three from each House with the Speaker in the Chair. If I may at this stage express a personal preference, I think I should be inclined to-day to support the noble Viscount's Committee, but I bind nobody but myself in saving that, and I recall that the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, said that he held himself quite free, when at a later stage we come to Lord Cromer's Amendment, to consider in favour of which he would be disposed to vote.<lb/>
But let me suppose for a moment that a Committee on the lines of the proposal of the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, was constituted. It would, as I have said, consist of six persons three from each House&#x2014;with the Speaker presiding. Under the present conditions it would consist of two open supporters of the Government, one open supporter of the Opposition, two neutrals, and one gentleman, who might belong to either party, nominated from the House of Commons by the Speaker. It is impossible to say that such a tribunal as that is otherwise than an impartial tribunal, and in any case it is not true to say that the dice would be loaded in the interests of your Lordships' House, for, if anything, the balance would tend rather in the opposite direction. Thus, if you have a Committee constituted like this you have a tribunal which would represent equally and impartially both Houses of Parliament. The House of Lords would not be in a majority upon it, nor, ostensibly, would the House of Commons, but the advantage would be given to that House because the Speaker who obviously carries an authority greater than any other man that would be upon it, would have two votes&#x2014;his own and, in the event of an equal Division, a casting vote as well. What I am trying to do is to paint the Committee as my noble friend would call it into existence, and then I shall contrast that with the picture, or rather the caricature, given of it by the noble Viscount. Remember also that this Committee cannot sit of its own accord. It can only come into existence, under the terms of the latest form of the
<col>180</col>
Amendment, on being summoned either by a Resolution of either House of Parliament, or by the Government of the clay on the motion of a Minister, or upon the initiative of the Speaker, acting either on his own account or upon the request of a certain number of members of the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00366"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: This Committee, thus composed and summoned would not decide upon a great or I illimitable range of questions. Its attention is confined not only to a limited number of cases <i>per se</i>, but also to cases which have-been three times passed by one House and three times rejected by the other. Accordingly the tribunal would meet on rare occasions for carefully defined objects, and under the most stringent safeguards. That is the Committee, as I understand it, which has been proposed by the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn. Now observe what I just now called the caricature of it which has been presented by the noble Viscount the spokesman of the Government. I will quote his words. Be said that this Committee&#x2014;
<quote>"would oust the Ministers of the Crown and override and supersede the House of Commons."</quote>
The noble Viscount evidently meant something by that, because he cheers the remark. Well, to me it appeared that the only sense in which the Committee could possibly "oust the Ministers of the Crown and over-ride and supersede the House of Commons" would be in the event of the Ministry or the House of Commons abusing
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0095"/>
<col>181</col>
their authority and utilising a transient and possibly an insignificant predominance in the House of Commons to force into law measures which might not be approved by the country. I hope I am not misrepresenting the noble Viscount. I trust I am delivering what is a fair criticism upon his remark.<lb/>
It is really important that we, should meet the noble Viscount, because I see quite clearly that the representation, or misrepresentation, of our tribunal or Committee will be the platform upon which his followers will argue the case in the country, and it is for that reason that I am trying at as early a stage as possible to emphasise that we do not accept the picture of the noble Viscount. Then his second point was that this Committee would be clothed with powers tantamount to Dissolution and a General Election. That raises the whole question of what the Referendum is. The Referendum, in our opinion is not tantamount to a Dissolution of Parliament or a General Election in any sense of the term such as the noble Viscount implies. The Referendum is proposed by us because you decline for five years to give us a chance of a General Election. That is the point. Hitherto we have always had a security in the background. It was rarely utilised, but in the event of doubt whether a measure was acceptable to the people machinery existed by which there could be a reference to the people, or by which a measure could be delayed until the people could finally pronounce upon it. Because you deny us that liberty, because you are going to cripple the House of Lords of that power, we have been compelled, some of us very reluctantly as I shall show in a moment, to accept the Referendum.<lb/>
Finally the noble Viscount made use of the astonishing remark that the creation of this tribunal would not only destroy the supremacy of the House of Commons but would take away the supremacy of the house of Lords. Well, I thought there was not much of that left to your Lordships' House now. I do not think the supremacy has ever been a very substantial one, and, as we understand it is the policy of His Majesty's Government to strip us of the last vestiges of that supremacy, if the setting up of this Committee can fairly be described as divesting us of any residue that is left I am sure
<col>182</col>
your Lordships will be quite willing to pay that price for the additional security that the country would obtain. But the speech of the noble Viscount has had one effect, it has finally converted me to the Referendum. I confess to being one of those who have never been much enamoured of the Referendum, though I might say that I am not in the least impressed by the popular arguments against it, such as its alleged cost, the frequency of its use, or the reluctance of voters to go to the poll. Those arguments never impressed me in the slightest degree, because they seemed to be derived from analogies not in the least pertinent to this country. I have always admitted in Inv own mind that the Referendum was a great experiment, a great innovation, for which no precise parallel can be found in the experience of any other country and file effects of which in our own country would be uncertain.<lb/>
May I venture for a moment to allude to a personal matter? I did some years ago, as many of us have done in our salad says, commit myself to an expression of opinion about the Referendum in a magazine article which I think has been quoted in the House by the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, and which I believe was made somewhat free use of by members of his Party at the last election. I do not object to quotations being made from that article, though it was written in different circumstances and in reference to an entirely different situation&#x2014;and with much of it I am still in agreement&#x2014;but when I contemplate the policy of the Government, when I hear speeches like that of the noble Viscount this evening, so contemptuous of any suggestion on our part to take the will of the people, so inconsistent, as they appear to me, with tine democratic principle, I am compelled to reconsider my own position and views with regard to the Referendum. Hitherto we have had no need of the Referendum or anything like it in this country because our Constitution has provided us with the necessary securities and safeguards. There has been no need to go to a poll of the people, because in the back ground there has always been the opportunity for taking the will of the people. But now that you have destroyed that security and abolished that safeguard, those who hold the same views as myself are driven, reluctantly but logically, to the conclusion that something must be
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0096"/>
<col>183</col>
set up in the place of that which you destroy. I honestly and deliberately say I know of no machinery which can possibly be set up by any Government, or any security which can take the place of that which we are losing, other than the Referendum such as it appears in the proposal of the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne. Therefore when there is submitted to the House a proposal such as that for the Referendum, closely defined, narrowly restricted, incapable, so far as I can see, of being abused, and only set in operation by a competent and impartial tribunal which can only itself be started in an authoritative way, then I give my adhesion to the proposal of my noble friend, and I am confirmed in that attitude by the arguments&#x2014;a mixture, as they appeared to me to be, equally of violence and of weakness&#x2014; which have been directed against it in this debate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00367"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I should abuse your Lordships' kindness if I made anything like a second speech, but I should like to point out this to the noble Lord who has just sat down. He accused me of caricaturing the tribunal. I said I was quite indifferent as to which of the two forms of tribunal was adopted by the supporters of the Amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Curzon, is really caricaturing the operation under Lord Lansdowne's Amendment. What will happen? A Bill is passed through the House of Commons, proposed probably by a Minister and approved by a majority of that House. Then who is to move the reference to the Joint Committee, which may, if they think fit, end in a Referendum? What is the Committee to do? Here is a Bill passed three times in the House of Commons, and three times rejected by your Lordships. Then you have, if you think fit, by a Resolution to request the Joint Committee to set to work. The House of Commons will not set the Committee to work. The Ministry will not set the Committee to work. Why should they? They have passed their Bill, and sent it up to your Lordships. But the Committee have to determine whether or not the issue in the Bill is a question of "great gravity," and whether the opinion of the people upon it has been sufficiently ascertained. The noble Lord really missed the whole point of this. You are entrusting this Joint Committee, constituted as you please, with certain powers, and it is
<col>184</col>
against the application of the powers of that Committee that I, at all events, protest. That Committee, not caring what the House of Commons think, or what the Ministry think, and not responsible to anybody, has to decide whether or not the Bill is one of such gravity, or the evidence of popular support is so weak, that a Referendum should be taken. That is what I think the noble Lord did not quite understand.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00368"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I understood perfectly, and I accept the definition of the operation of the Committee given by the noble Viscount. I agree entirely with what he has said, that these are the functions which we propose the Committee should perform. But the point where we differ is this, that the Committee in the last resort, by whatever authority it may be summoned, is only to decide whether the question shall go to the people. It does not itself decide the question; it is only a vestibule to the hall in which the people are sitting. That is all, and it is the people who sit in judgment in the hall who are the final tribunal. The Committee have only to open the door which gives access to the hall.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00369"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: One single question. How is the question of "great gravity" to be determined after your Lordships have rejected a measure three times? Are we to understand that your Lordships are guilty of such levity that you will reject a Bill three times and then apply to this Joint Committee to find out whether the subject is of "great gravity" or not?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00370"><member>VISCOUNT MASSEREENE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened with much attention to the eloquent and impassioned speech of the noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell. He is as fully entitled as any one to speak on Irish affairs, but I am sorry I cannot agree with him. If I believed that a separate Legislature for Ireland would solve the land question, would put an end to all strife and bitterness in the country, I would be inclined to vote for Home Rule. The noble Lord referred to the loyalty of the Irish nation, and quoted pages out of history to show that loyalty. I, for one, do not wish to disparage my own country. I am as fond of my own country as is the noble Lord, though I take a different view of the policy to be adopted.
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0097"/>
<col>185</col>
It is quite true that when the Sovereign comes to Ireland he receives a good welcome. I do not for a moment deny that, but when one talks about the loyalty of the country one has to remember speeches made by prominent Nationalist Members. I do not say speeches made in the House of Commons, but speeches made sometimes in Ireland and sometimes in other parts of the Empire. Those speeches do not breathe that loyalty which the noble Lord says the Irish nation possesses.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell, said something about the financial arrangements between Great Britain and Ireland, and, after quoting statistics, practically stated that if Ireland was given Home Rule she could run a Parliament of her own without any grant at all from the Imperial Treasury. I am not a financial expert. I am not in a position to challenge the figures produced by the noble Lord, but there are many financiers who do not agree with his statements. There have been articles in financial papers clearly pointing out that if Ireland is to get. Home Rule it must mean either a considerable reduction of expenditure, which is extremely unlikely, or else a considerable grant from the British Treasury. It is an old subject, and has been referred to over and over again in this debate. The Party of noble Lords opposite are never tired of telling us that they had a mandate for Home Rule at the last election. I think it has been shown that that is hardly the case. But was there represented at the last election to the electorate the possibility, you might almost say the probability, of a grant from the British Treasury having to be given to Ireland in order to carry out Home Rule? Really the whole question of Home Rule is a financial question to an enormous extent. Surely a question of this sort, which affects over 4,000,000 people in Ireland, which affects their property there, you may say their whole life, and, which must inevitably mean, from what I hear, a heavy contribution from the taxpayers of Great Britain&#x2014;surely that ought to be put as a clear issue to the people.<lb/>
One word about Ulster, from which province I come. It is said that we Ulster men are bigots. That is hardly a fair thing to say about us. We are just as fond of our country and just as proud of being Irishmen as the men from Minister, or Leinster,
<col>186</col>
or Connaught, but because we happen to take a different view as to the policy to be pursued in Ireland for the benefit of Ireland we are put down as bigots. It has been said that the Protestant minority will not suffer if Home Ride is granted. That may or may not be so. I must say I doubt it. It is not many years ago that the leader of the Nationalist Party, talking about the Unionists in Ulster, made use of these words&#x2014;
<quote>"After all, they are only a handful even of the Protestants of Lister, and I fear they must be overborne by a strong hand."</quote>
I submit that before Home Rule is granted the people of this country should be consulted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00371"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: I would crave your Lordships' attention for a few moments while I explain why I find considerable difficulty in supporting the Amendment. I say this with the greatest respect to the noble Marquess, because we must all admire the admirable patience and temper with which he has conducted this debate. The difficulty I find myself in is that I do not quite understand from the speeches that have been delivered in favour of this Amendment how much of this proposal the noble Marquess intends to be permanent, and how much of it he only intends to meet a state of things which may be created if the Parliament Bill passes into law. I understand that the Referendum portion of the noble Marquess's proposal is to be more or less permanent, but I should very much like to know whether the noble Marquess proposes that the principle of the Joint Committee pervading the whole of our Parliamentary institutions is to be a part of the permanent settlement of the Constitutional question proposed by the leaders of the Opposition. It seems to me not impertinent for a member of the rank and file to ask this question, because this is a very grave crisis, and I believe that this House will only gain credit in the country if every man speaks for himself for the moment and says that which he considers best for the real benefit of the country. I know there is considerable difficulty in doing that, because, if we on this side all agree with the noble Marquess, according to the Radical newspapers the Conservative side of the House of Lords immediately becomes a "Tory caucus." If we disagree with the noble Marquess, the Radical newspapers next morning come out with "Revolt of the

backwoodsmen," and suggest that there has been a general undermining of the authority of the leaders of the Unionist Party, that the Tory Party is all at sixes and sevens, and so on.<lb/>
If you are going to have a Second Chamber at all, the Second Chamber must have the power of reserving measures dealing with the Crown, Home Rule for Ireland, and other grave matters on which the electors have not been consulted. Noble Lords opposite seem to think it is unnecessary that particular attention should be drawn to these matters. I was going to remind them of the position they are in with regard to their connection with Socialism, only the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, has done it more eloquently than I could attempt to do, so I will not deal with that. But when you do talk to a Socialist, a Fabian, or whatever other name he will always begin by saying that he belongs to no political Party at all, but lie always finishes up by voting for the Radicals.<lb/>
With regard to Home Rule, the reasons for referring it to the people before it is passed into law have already been eloquently stated. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, says that this desire to pass a Home Rule Bill&#x2014;which is in all probability about to be given effect to by the Radical Party if they get their own way&#x2014;is, after all, nothing new, but an ancient conviction to which he, at any rate, has always been consistent. I agree with him with regard to himself, because he has always been a consistent Home Ruler, but at the same time if this desire to give Home Rule to Ireland is an ancient unalterable conviction on the part of the Radical Party, it seems very strange that it was pushed into the background in 1906 when the Radical Party had a majority independent of the Irish Party. It was only when the Prime Minister began to smell powder just before the 1909 election, and was warned that the Budget was not likely to be so popular as he thought it might be, that he found it necessary to go to the Albert Hall and revive the promise of a Home Rule Bill for Ireland. It is quite obvious that anything to do with the Crown, or Home Rule for Ireland, ought to be referred to the people. But are noble Lords quite sure that this Joint Committee is not
<col>188</col>
coming between you and the power of this House to refer what you may consider to be Home Rule for Ireland but which the Joint Committee may not consider to be a measure of Home Rule for Ireland? That point I wish to put to your Lordships, especially as both sides of the House appear to have considerable difficulty in inventing an authority, whether a one-man authority or a Joint Committee, to decide what is or what is not finance. I say that the same difficulty will arise in a Joint Committee saying what is or what is not Home Rule for Ireland. I am old fashioned enough to think that the House of Lords, or the Second Chamber, is, after all, the right body to say what is or what is not Home Rule for Ireland. It is quite true that I voted for Lord Cromer's Amendment to the first clause of this Bill, because, as I said at the time, I can conceive there may be circumstances in which it might be desirable that somebody should be empowered to define what is or what is not a financial measure; but I am not at all sure that we shall not get ourselves into a very serious difficulty by having assented to the principle of a Committee of this kind, especially after the remarks made by the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, and others on this and on the other side of the House, which show how exceedingly difficult it is to set up any body to adjudicate upon an important matter like finance.<lb/>
There is one other thing I should like to bring before the notice of those who have been responsible for the framing of this Amendment. If these references of matters to a Joint Committee is going to be a permanent part of your settlement of the Constitutional question, then I say that that dimishes the power of the House of Lords by taking away from it the principal function of the Second Chamber, which is to decide what Bills are or are not meet to be referred to the people. If this is your idea of anything like a permanent settlement of this question, I say it entirely precludes the possibility of any reform of the House of Lords. I have myself assented to a reform of the House of Lords, but only on the understanding that a reformed Second Chamber should enjoy the full powers which the Second Chambers of all other countries enjoy, and which are at the present moment enjoyed in the Second Chamber of the Transvaal.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0099"/>
<col>189</col>
One more matter upon which I have a certain amount of misgiving with regard to this Amendment as a permanent settlement of the question is that it contemplates the Referendum as a universal solvent of all matters in dispute between the Upper Chamber and the House of Commons. For my part I have given a qualified adherence to the Referendum, thinking, as the Prime Minister does, that it may be unwise to absolutely rule out all cases in which the Referendum might possibly be applied. I have always thought that the Referendum ought to be kept pretty much in the same way as I believe the birch-rod is now kept in a modern educational establishment&#x2014;to be used only on grave occasions when all other means of persuasion have absolutely broken down. If it is proposed to put all matters of dispute between the two Houses willy nilly to the Referendum&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00372"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Only grave matters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00373"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: But it is only grave matters which the House of Lords has ever referred back, or ever will refer back under any conceivable system. Therefore if we are to be made responsible here and now for taking a Referendum on all and sundry matters in dispute between the two Houses, it is exceedingly difficult for me to support this as a permanent solution of the question, because I was quite convinced by those brilliant articles which Lord Curzon used to write for the <i>National Review</i> against the Referendum. I am in exactly the position which lie appeared to be in until a few minutes ago of not being particularly enamoured of the Referendum as a means of settling questions of dispute between the two Houses. Let me say that I do not criticise this Amendment in a captious spirit. It is only because I want information on this subject, particularly after the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, has told us that this is the platform on which we shall probably have to defend our position before the people. If that is so, I should like a platform which is a little less complicated. It is perfectly easy to criticise an Amendment of this kind, and I know that one retort may be that I have no alternative of my own. But my alternative to this or any other question in this connection is a perfectly simple one, and it is the integrity of the functions of
<col>190</col>
the British Constitution. Believe me, that is the best answer that the Unionist and the Constitutional Party can possibly make. When I say the functions, I say nothing about the men who will fulfil those functions, and I believe the argument will be accepted by the people. I believe also that sonic day, sooner or later, perhaps sooner than people think, we shall be working under a Second Chamber based upon public confidence, which will be strong enough to fulfil all the functions which history and experience agree are provided in the bi-cameral system in every country where that system prevails.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00374"><member>THE DUKE OF MANCHESTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will not detain your Lordships very long, because nearly everything I wanted to say has been said, but there are two points that will, perhaps, bear discussing a little more. I am extremely sorry from my point of view, and I consider it a great mistake, that there have been any other Amendments on the Paper except the one now before your Lordships. I think our position would have been far stronger when we came to be judged by the country if nothing but the real essential things contained in this Amendment had been put before the country, and if your Lordships' powers of debate had not been dissipated over such a huge number of questions.<lb/>
The particular cases mentioned in this Amendment are of the greatest importance. I think the House has passed too lightly over the first subsection of the Amendment. I think it would be a terrible thing if the burden of the responsibility for sending a Ministry to the country, as was suggested from the opposite side of the House, was thrown on to the Sovereign instead of on our shoulders, which are accustomed to bearing what abuse is necessary. Many people will agree with me that the Sovereign must at all costs be kept out of political troubles of that description, and that his position must not be made in the slightest degree more difficult than it is already.<lb/>
With regard to the second subsection, which I will not go into although I feel as strongly on the subject as my fellow Unionist Peers in the North of Ireland, this is really, in my opinion, the <i>crux</i> of the whole of this debate. Although this is not the moment for a Home Rule debate, yet one knows&#x2014;and I feel that it is almost
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0100"/>
<col>191</col>
indecent to draw the veil that has been kept over this&#x2014;that Home Rule is the purpose for which this interregnum is created. I feel certain, and I know a great many people who feel certain, that this Bill is only a cloak for a Home Rule Bill to be hurried through Parliament in the next two years. I am convinced that what has already been said this evening by Lord Mayo on the subject of Home Rule is very much the case. I live not only in the North but in the West of Ireland, and I know that the people who are now landowners are very far from having the same desire for Home Rule that they had. The case for Home Rule is very much weaker than it was when it was thrown out by the people of this country, and the case against Home Rule, while just as strong in the North of Ireland, is far stronger than it has ever been before in other parts of Ireland.<lb/>
There is only one other thing I want to say, and that was rather to point to a remark that fell from the noble Viscount who leads this House. He made use of a very curious expression, and as curious expressions have been to a certain extent
<col>192</col>
brought up and held against certain members of this House, perhaps it would not be out of place if I reminded your Lordships of this expression from the leader of the Democratic Party in this House. In his speech this afternoon the noble Viscount used the words, "the penalty of an appeal to the country." That sounds a very curious way of expressing the democratic view. It seems to me that if any Party should support a desire to send questions to the country, it should be the Party which arrogates to itself the title of the Democratic Party. For myself I think I am, and a great many of the noble Lords here consider that they are, just as democratic, though, perhaps, not as violent as those who arrogate to themselves that title. I thought I would like to remind your Lordships of that expression, as it might possibly be useful when it comes to saying that the People's Party is entirely on the opposite side.</membercontribution></p>

The noble Viscount the Lord President of the Council made a reply to the noble Marquess behind me, but I think that those who heard the speech of my noble friend Lord Curzon later in the evening will agree that that reply left some gaps to be filled up, and attempted to establish some points which could not be carried through.<lb/>
But what is more remarkable even than the gaps in the speech of the noble Viscount is the entire absence of support for that
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0103"/>
<col>197</col>
speech from noble Lords on the Benches behind him. This is a vital Amendment on the most important Bill that has ever been submitted to your Lordships' House, and there are sitting in this Assembly, not only a considerable body of Peers who were supporters of the Government before 1906, but a large number of newly-created Peers. We are told that they are all heartily in sympathy with the policy of the Government, designed though it may be to humiliate and paralyse the order to which they have consented to belong. But where are they on this occasion? They were represented last night by a speech from the noble Lord, Lord Courtney&#x2014;a powerful speech, a convincing speech, destined to show that the need was great, and the occasion was grave, for some such Amendment as that which my noble friend has proposed. He was supported also, if support it was, by a speech from Lord MacDonnell, who went a long way back into the arguments and quotations which I well remember were used in Parliament twenty-six years ago by Mr. Gladstone from the same sources. The noble Lord appeared to entirely ignore all the changes which have taken place in Ireland since those speeches were made. Though he shakes his head to imply that he did not ignore them, there is one point, I am afraid, with regard to which he cannot shake his head&#x2014;that is, that throughout his speech he never attempted to apply his argument for giving Home Rule to Ireland to the question which is before your Lordships, as to whether that should be done, not by the wish or against the wish of this House, but by the wish or against the wish of the people of the country.<lb/>
Then, my Lords, if this debate is remarkable for the want of support of the Bill on the part of noble Lords opposite, what about the attendance, and what about the Divisions which have taken place in this debate? There used to be, before 1906, some fifty Peers or more who rallied to the Whip of the present Government. The Government have created the unprecedented number of nearly fifty more Peers to support their policy, and the Government might have expected to put at least 100 members into the Lobby on so vital an occasion as the present; but when your Lordships divided on a matter fought out by the Government, after successive speeches from the Front Bench, on the question of the Speaker deciding as to
<col>198</col>
what is a Money Bill, only forty-four supporters of the Government were found, and I believe the Government themselves number twenty votes. In my opinion, that shows an apathy with regard to this measure even amongst the professed supporters of the Government which goes far on the way of going back on the continued statements of the noble Viscount that this Bill, and this Bill alone, will content the Party to which he belongs, and the country which he refuses to consult.<lb/>
If this is the treatment which is meted out to us while our powers are still intact and complete, what do you suppose will be the treatment meted out to us when we have only a dilatory power and our discussions become of a purely academic character, as they are intended to become? To see what the real position of the Government is with regard to this Amendment we have to consider in quiet language what is the offer which the noble Marquess has made to them; and if I re-state facts which have already been put before the House I hope I shall be excused, because I want to make the matter perfectly plain. We are told that the country is suffering from the predominance of your Lordships' House, and that the supremacy of the House of Commons has got to be unmistakably affirmed. What does the noble Marquess offer? He makes the offer that the battalions behind him, which are supposed to number 400 or 500 to the 100 on the opposite side, shall be reduced so as to secure practical equality in this House&#x2014;an offer which no member of the Government, I submit, ever expected to get, and the importance of which they have continually attempted to decry since it was made. This is offered in place of what is now an absolute power of rejection. Under that offer we confine the purview of your Lordships' House to those measures which are essentially general in their character and not Money Bills, and we ask for a reference to the people beyond the powers given in this Bill only for such grave matters as may seem to a Committee&#x2014;on which, if anything, the House of Commons will predominate&#x2014;matters sufficiently grave to call for a decision of the people on the difference between the two Houses. Is not that a concession which, if it had been contemplated five years ago, the mildest advocate of the House of Commons in this Ministry would have been surprised to receive? But the noble Viscount says,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0104"/>
<col>199</col>
"Your proposal directly traverses our policy." Those were his concluding words last night.<lb/>
Now what is the Government's policy? Their policy is this Bill. If their policy is that the will of the people shall prevail&#x2014;and that is the old watchword of the Party under which the noble Viscount enlisted many years ago&#x2014;they are bound to vote for the Amendment which my noble friend has tabled. If their policy is to shuffle through a measure which the country has rejected on every occasion upon which it has been submitted to it, and to do so behind the back of Parliament, and behind the back of the country, then, undoubtedly, we are traversing the whole of their policy; but to one or other of these alternatives they are bound to assent. Now watch the evolution of the proposal and pretensions of the noble Viscount. We were urged not to speak in any way disrespectfully of the work of the House of Commons, but the other day I was called in question by the Lord Chancellor because I said that if the privileges of the House of Lords were to be clipped and taken away, we had a right to ask that the pretensions of the House of Commons with regard to privilege should not be extended. That is our view. Our view is that the privileges of the House of Commons, which we are prepared absolutely to maintain o and give way to, should not be allowed to encroach on the privileges of the Second Chamber so long as that Second Chamber exists. But you have asked something beyond that in the course of this debate. The homage which we are being asked to pay to the House of Commons is now being exacted from us for measures which have never figured in the election addresses of members of the House of Commons. My noble friend Lord Londonderry pointed out last night that in the majority of the election addresses of the present supporters of the Government the question of Home Rule never figured at all. If we are to pay homage to the House of Commons it must be on subjects with regard to which the House of Commons has obtained the approval of the country.<lb/>
Then, again, we are asked to render homage to the proposals of the Government in regard to clauses which may commend themselves to the Government but which have never been allowed to be discussed in the Lower House of Parliament. Again,
<col>200</col>
we are asked to give full homage to the decisions of the Speaker, who, being, however eminent, the nominee of one party in the struggle, would in no other struggle which takes place in English life be accepted as the arbiter of both parties. It has been claimed that even in these circumstances the House of Commons faithfully represents the people. I think in the last 40 years there have been ten Parliaments. The Parliament of 1865 was reversed by the General Election of 1868. The dealings of the great Parliament of 1868 were reversed at the General Election of 1874. Lord Beaconsfield's Ministry, which seemed all powerful in August of 1878, was thrown out by a large majority 18 months later. The first Home Rule Bill was thrown out by 120 majority, I think, by the constituencies in. 1886. That Government, again, was reversed in 1892. The Government of 1892, and their Home Rule Bill, was also reversed in 1895. With the exception of the Parliament of 1906 the proceedings of not one Parliament out of ten have received the assent of the electors when they were asked to express their opinion. We should be sure that the present House of Commons faithfully represents the opinion of the people before we are asked to stake our all, the whole existence of the United Kingdom, and to stake every measure that may be brought forward, to the chance vote of a bare majority in the House of Commons.<lb/>
A still further step in the evolution of the noble Viscount was to tell us that Home Rule could be properly decided in this way. This point has not yet been made, and I therefore hope I may trouble the House for a moment upon it. You can, of course, claim a general assent to Home Rule even if you can get no surer ground than to quote the speeches of members of the Opposition warning the constituencies that Home Rule would be the result of the success of the Government at the last election. But think what a Home Rule Bill means. It involves great considerations of finance, which caused a large portion of the wreckage of the Home Rule Bills which were proposed in 1886 and in 1893, and from all the evidence that has reached us the problem will not be rendered any more easy at the present time. Home Rule Bills involve also the whole question of Irish Members in the British Parliament,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0105"/>
<col>201</col>
whether they should be there for Imperial purposes, or whether they ought to be there at all&#x2014;whether they should manage their own affairs and manage ours. That, again, was a subject on which Mr. Gladstone, after months of deliberation, made one proposal, and changed it half way through the Bill, and the failure of that proposal finally assisted largely in the wreckage of the Bill.<lb/>
Then there is the question of the protection of minorities, which I imagine this House will not pass by with unconcern. Is it conceivable that all these questions can be held to have been decided by the electors because of a few loose words put together by the Prime Minister at the Albert Hall covering a general idea of Home Rule, and not touching any of the intricacies of the subject, any of which might tend to change the votes of the electors with regard to this measure? I do not believe that any eminent City firm would invest &#x00A3;10,000 for a client without more precise guidance than the present Government desire to receive from the electors when they are dealing with &#x00A3;10,000,000 of the revenue of the United Kingdom and the future lives of 4,000,000 of the population.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, after giving the go by to the people, spoke, as I thought, some rather bitter words with regard to the past history of your Lordships' House. It is true, as Lord Curzon observed, that, whatever be the past history of your Lordships' House, it is hardly relevant to the Amendment before the House to say, as Lord Morley said, that this House should not have a deciding voice in reshaping the Government of Ireland, because it is not proposed by this Amendment that this House should have a deciding voice, but that it should be the subject of a Referendum to the people. When the noble Viscount uses such language, which throughout, the whole country will create prejudice as regards the rights of this House to be heard on an Irish Home Rule Bill, I do not think his statements should be allowed to pass unchallenged.</membercontribution></p>

<col>202</col>
good tactics, and was maladroit in view of the facts which I brought forward.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00416"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount's contention, with great respect to him, was this, that the past history of this House was so black in this matter that this House had not even the right to move this impartial Committee, headed by the Speaker of the House of Commons, to decide whether the issue of Home Rule was sufficiently grave to be submitted to the judgment of the electors. I challenge his statement from every point of view. He tells us to go back for 100 years and look at the character and history of this House, and he further tells us that Irish legislation was ignorant, mischievous, and retrograde. Lord Curzon asked, and I have yet to hear the answer to it, What were the House of Commons doing during all this period? I would still more ask the noble Viscount what in the early days of his own Parliamentary life was that majority of the House of Commons, which for 25 years had complete control&#x2014;during which time the Conservative Party never had a majority&#x2014;doing when they could reduce the Irish population during the 25 years from eight millions to five millions? Has the noble Viscount ever considered what measures this House can put to its credit with regard to Ireland? He tells us that we have been the mainstay of all the prejudices and passions, religious or otherwise, which have divided that country? I do not think that even the noble Viscount will contend that all the Land Bills, stretching now over nearly 40 years, have done as much to set at rest this vexed question as the legislation for land purchase initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Ashbourne, and carried by your Lordships, and of which debate after debate in this House was the pioneer.<lb/>
We are, of course, averse to giving powers of self-government which we think will interfere with the rights of minorities in Ireland; but have we been backward in granting local government? How many countries in the world can claim that they have a larger power of local government than that which the Ministry of Lord Salisbury gave to Ireland with both hands, as it was given to England and Scotland? If there is one subject more than another on which divisions have been created in Ireland and which has probably been the mainstay of passion and sentiment in that
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0106"/>
<col>203</col>
country, it is the question of religious education. What has been our policy, persevered in up to this day, with regard to that? We have fought the battle of freedom on behalf of religious education for every denomination according to the wishes of the parent. Where was the noble Viscount, and where were his colleagues, when we were fighting that battle side by side with every Catholic in the Empire? He was in the Lobby with the political Nonconformists, who were grudgingly endeavouring to prevent the denominations from obtaining that which every Churchman and every Catholic in Great Britain and Ireland desired to secure. I think we have no blackness to look back to in that respect.<lb/>
Although neither the noble Viscount nor any of his colleagues served in Mr. Gladstone's Government of 1880, I would ask him to let me make this comparison. Take the history of the Liberal Government from 1880 to 1885, and consider the changes from coercion to concession, and concession to coercion, when after a period of concession the Ph&#x0153;nix Park murders were followed by more coercion. Lord Salisbury said of those black days that what Ireland required was 20 years of firm government, and I ask, Where in the British Empire has there been progress equivalent to that which took place in Ireland in all departments of material prosperity during the 20 years of Unionist Government, from 1885 to 1906, which had the support of the House of Lords? As Lord Mayo so truly said last night, the <i>crux</i> of Irish agitation was the land difficulty, and that difficulty has been largely swept away by Unionist policy. The feeling as regard local government and want of power in their own affairs was swept away 20 years ago. The battle of education, if it has not been won, at any rate has not been lost, by this House, and the policy, largely decried by the present Government, which was carried through so unflinchingly by Lord Salisbury, with the consent of this House, resulted in such material prosperity that I venture to say the noble Viscount has no right to brand this House as having been the means of ignorant, retrograde, and mischievous legislation with regard to Ireland. Such a statement is an attempt, perhaps not intentional, to increase bitterness and arouse fires which have been smouldering and passions which have been dying out.<lb/>
<col>204</col>
My Lords, I have spoken mainly on Ireland because I believe that Ireland is the most important question for exclusion under this Bill. I feel, and I believe it will be felt generally, that these debates prove conclusively that the effect of the Bill will not be to free the hands of Parliament. The Bill abolishes the control of this House over finance. It abolishes also our control over legislation, and it abolishes the safeguards on which your Lordships' House is supposed to rely in carrying out its Constitutional functions. All this is done in the name of what?&#x2014;not of obtaining fairness between the two Parties, for that has been already offered to the other side of the House and refused. The Government cannot make out that anything has occurred requiring the Parliamentary machine to be recast entirely. What country in Europe can show such material progress, can show a better record in legislation, can show such prosperity as the result of the action of Parliament, as Great Britain can to-day? I am far from saying that there is not much to be done. But upon Home Rule the country has apparently made up its mind for 100 years, and therefore it is a strong proposal to ask Parliament to pass a measure with regard to it in two years against the wishes of one House of the Legislature and behind the backs of the people.<lb/>
The Government are acting with the power of a temporary majority. They know that they are acting contrary to all precedent, and I hope that even now, at the eleventh hour, or before this measure is sent back to us from the House of Commons, they will weigh this Amendment, not in the light of the prejudice of preconceived ideas, but in the light of what they may well think will be advantageous to Liberal legislation. I hope that something may yet result. Otherwise, although it is always unwise to prophesy, we cannot help believing that the day will come when they will rue their mistake in not securing such a settlement as they can secure, and which is held out to them this afternoon with both hands, rather than a Pyrrhic victory which will recoil upon themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00417"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WEARDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must apologise for intervening in this discussion, but I do so in order to place before your Lordships a view somewhat different from that which has been expressed in many
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0107"/>
<col>205</col>
quarters in the course of this debate. I certainly do not propose to follow so narrow a line as has been lately taken by speakers on the other side in endeavouring to confine this discussion to the consideration of the question of Home Rule. Home Rule is, no doubt, an important element for our consideration, and it is probably going to be one of the earliest topics with which Parliament will have to deal, but it is not solely upon the question of Home Rule that I should like to discuss this Bill, but rather from the point of view of a wider outlook into the future as affecting the interests of the Constitution and of the people of this country.<lb/>
There have been many speeches on this particular question of Home Rule, but few speakers have discussed, as it seems to me, the general principles of the Amendment of the noble Marquess opposite. We unfortunately had introduced at an early stage into this Bill certain Amendments&#x2014;Amendments which I hope I may be excused for saying seem to have been introduced under pro-Consular influences&#x2014;which, in the judgment of many and in my own, have largely enforced, and in certain conditions perhaps enlarged, the control or the interference of this House in matters of finance. I believe the country has made up its mind absolutely that the control of pure finance shall remain entirely and indisputably in the hands of the House of Commons, and everybody will admit that it is because for the first time in its history the House of Lords took upon itself the rejection of the Budget that we find ourselves to-day discussing this great Constitutional change. I therefore deplore the adoption at an earlier stage of our proceedings of Amendments which to my mind prejudice the case put forward by those who desire to see a final and permanent settlement.<lb/>
Passing from that, I will now approach the Amendment of the noble Marquess, of the terms of which I regret I cannot altogether approve, because it seems to me that the provisions which specify the questions that are to be submitted in certain circumstances to a vote of the people are not wisely drawn. But the Amendment enshrines the principle of the Referendum, a principle to which I am committed. It is to that that I desire to confine my remarks. Last night we had a remarkable speech from my noble friend Lord Courtney.<lb/>
<col>206</col>
The noble Lord speaks with the authority of a man who has been in public life for thirty if not forty years, who has presided as Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons during a long course of years, and who probably classes himself as one of the old school of Liberals. I also class myself as one of the old school of Liberals, or Radicals, who believe in the principles taught by one of the great masters of Liberalism, Mr. Gladstone, and carried on so earnestly by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, whose loss we so deeply deplore. Has the appeal, so able, convincing and moderate, which Lord Courtney addressed to my noble friends below me, received any kind of response or consideration? On the contrary, has it not been rather flouted? I dare say, in their hearts, my noble friends regard his opinions as those of a "crank." We have arrived at this pass now, that those of us in the Liberal Party who venture to have an independent opinion upon great questions of public policy and who remain convinced Liberals, are to-day classed as "cranks," or even put into the last of the three categories: Party men, cranks, or idiots. I am willing to be classed at present amongst those men who enjoy little or no favour with the Liberal leaders&#x2014;I will not say the Liberal Party, because there is a large Liberal party outside who have yet to be consulted on this question and to be taught by bitter experience.<lb/>
I am not in the least afraid of coming here to-day to express with all sincerity, and as clearly as I can, my view that the Government are making a profound mistake in not accepting, or, at all events, taking into favourable consideration, the question of the adoption of the Referendum in the interests of the country, and, even more, in the interests of the great Party which they represent. The Referendum has been attacked by my noble friends on various grounds. The first is that it is destructive of representative government. I have lived long enough to see representative government take many different forms and shapes. Twenty-five years ago Liberal opinion had its say from whatever quarter of the Liberal Benches it came and influenced the course of action of Liberal Ministers. Since then we have seen the closure and the guillotine in the House, the caucus in the constituencies, and we have seen growing up in the House of Commons itself a system of groups which
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0108"/>
<col>207</col>
has entirely modified and changed the whole position of our representative system. It is absurd to argue that the position is the same to-day as it was twenty or thirty years ago when there were two Parties in the State, one opposing the other and both endeavouring, according to their conscientious belief, to carry out public business to the public advantage. To-day, you have none of those conditions in your representative government, and it is because the conditions have been entirely modified that, however great the innovation may be&#x2014;and no one denies that the Referendum is a great innovation, as is also this Bill&#x2014;the Referendum is imposed upon us by the circumstances of the hour, and is necessary for the security of the State and for the safety and security of individual citizens. Representative government to-day is tending, not to liberty but oligarchy, and I regret to see my noble friend, Lord Morley, whom I have so often listened to with pleasure, taking a hand in setting up or bringing about a state of government which is surely opposed to the best principles of Liberalism. Last night Lord Morley said that lie was unable to define democracy. I may be wrong, but I fancy that in the old days I heard him define democracy as "Government of the people, for the people, and by the people." Does my noble friend disagree with that statement? If he does not, how can be possibly contend that a reference to the people by means of the Referendum is not a democratic assertion of that principle? I really am at a loss to understand how he will be able, although I admit his dialectical ability, to establish that a reference to the people of matters of urgent and vital moment is not a democratic method of settling them according to the wishes of the people.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, may I deal with one or two points which arise on the proposal as to the Referendum? In the first place, I do not entirely agree with the proposed form of Committee, certainly not with the form of Committee suggested either by the noble Earl, Lord Cromer, or by the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, and I am inclined to think that the smaller the Committee, the more representative if you like of the great offices in the State, the better it would be. But I would leave the Committee in the position of a tribunal, and in order to put that tribunal in action there should be two forces. Both of those
<col>208</col>
forces, as it seems to me, should be perfectly capable of taking the necessary steps for that purpose. In the event of a Liberal Bill being thrown out by the House of Lords, it would be the majority in the House of Lords which would make an appeal to that tribunal. Now for the converse proposition, and it is there that the interests of the Liberal Party are chiefly concerned. Assume a Conservative Government in power, and a Bill passed by a Conservative majority in both Houses. What protection will Liberals have under this Bill in a case of that kind? None whatever. Therefore I would put it in the power of a sufficient minority in the House of Commons, probably not less than 200 Members, to make the appeal to the tribunal for a reference to the people. It is in that way also that you will be able to secure to the Liberal Party some guarantee for the permanence of its legislation.<lb/>
We may be told that there is no risk whatever of this Bill being modified or reversed. I do not share that view. And I believe that the immediate effect of passing this Bill into law will be that the floodgates will be opened. The various fractions, all of them worthy of attention&#x2014;the Home Rule fraction, the Welsh Church fraction, the Plural Vote fraction, and, last but not least, the Woman Franchise fraction will all come and say, "Now is our opportunity. We insist that you shall take advantage of those precious first two years in order to pass into law without any reference to the people measures on which the people have so far expressed no judgment whatever." But I must at once say that I do not include Home Rule in that category. I entirely share the view that Home Rule has been sufficiently long before the constituencies and was sufficiently understood at the last General Election. The election turned upon two things&#x2014;upon the reconstitution of the House of Lords and the curtailment of its Veto, and upon the consequent introduction of Home Rule. I believe that. Home Rule in principle has been accepted by the electors of this country. But when we say that Home Rule in principle has been accepted by the country, that does not cover all forms of Home Rule. Have the Government the least idea of the form of Home Rule they are going to propose? I well remember the Home Rule debates on Mr. Gladstone's Bills of 1886 and later,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0109"/>
<col>209</col>
and the differences in the Cabinet itself upon the question, for instance, of the inclusion of the Irish vote&#x2014;and at last a compromise was brought about between those conflicting interests. As we all know, my noble friend Lord Morley expressed himself in favour of the exclusion of the Irish Members, and others were in favour of their inclusion; and in the latest Bills there were a good many in and out clauses, and there have been upon the whole principle of Home Rule a good many in and out minds since then.<lb/>
Various views have been enunciated by prominent men as to what is meant by Home Rule. I may tell the House quite fairly that by Home Rule I mean Home Rule on the lines of Mr. Gladstone's Bills&#x2014;those at least which I supported years ago, and which I am prepared to support again. But that is not the mind of many of those who favour Home Rule to-day on the Liberal Benches, and while I say that the country in principle has accepted Home Rule I maintain there will be very great and serious questions arising out of the debates on Home Rule which must give rise to strong passions and feeling in all parts of the country. Now I will ask my noble friends this question. You have passed let us assume, as I think you will pass, this Bill at the point of the bayonet. It is a gallant act to carry any position at the point of the bayonet, but when you have got there you must maintain your position. How do you think you are going to maintain your position in the future in the privileged position in which this Bill will place you? During the next three years we shall have a controversy with regard to Home Rule and with regard to the Welsh Church, and we shall have, I greatly fear, profound dissatisfaction with the increasing expenditure of the country. We may also have trade depression, and it is possible, no doubt, that the popularity of the Government itself may wane and diminish in those days, and that circumstances may lead to a great reaction, such as we have seen before, which will place a Conservative Government in power. If that happened, what security have the Government that the Conservative Party then in power will not take advantage of this particular measure to establish a reformed Second Chamber with much greater powers than are suggested to-day, and with perhaps a complete Veto upon certain classes of legislation? I ask my noble friends what means will they have
<col>210</col>
then of preventing such a radical and unsatisfactory change as that in the fortunes of Liberalism? None whatever, as the Bill now stands. But if they incorporate within this Bill some simple system of Referendum, then at least they would have an appeal to the people of the country which would guarantee that no change which might take place in the constitution of a new Second Chamber would be of a character seriously to injure and to impair the liberties which we have fought for, and which we hope to win.<lb/>
I know that my noble friends will tell us that they had a mandate for this Bill. But do they pretend that the mandate went to the extent of creating a sort of sacrosanct document admitting of no change, of no kind of new provision, and absolutely so sacred that it is not to be touched by the sacrilegious hands of Parliament? It seems to me that the mandate of the people meant nothing of the kind. I know it is very difficult to interpret what the mandate of the people may mean, but I have had enough to do with elections in time gone by to form a rough-and-ready guess of what was in the minds of the electorate when they came to their conclusion at the last election. My belief is that the country was determined, in the first place, that the control of finance should be indisputably in the hands of the House of Commons. Secondly, I believe they were determined that the Liberal Party should have equal opportunities with the Conservative Party for legislation. Thirdly, I believe they were profoundly dissatisfied with a House which is solely based upon the hereditary principle. But, my Lords, this Bill leaves the hereditary principle just where it was. I know that some of my noble friends&#x2014;Lord Haldane in particular&#x2014;are very anxious at some future date to deal with this matter. I believe my noble friend is of opinion&#x2014;and the Prime Minister has also expressed a similar view&#x2014;that in the course of the present Parliament an opportunity will be taken for dealing with the constitution of this House. I really ask my noble friends in all seriousness, what prospect do they think there is of obtaining the concurrence of their supporters in the other House to deal with this part of the question. They know as well as I do that there is none whatever. Do they rely upon the consideration and the co-operation of the Party opposite,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0110"/>
<col>211</col>
because if they do it seems to me, after this debate, and after this Bill, that they rely upon a very broken reed indeed.<lb/>
It seems to me, therefore, that this Bill is going to have the effect of handing over the final settlement of this Constitutional controversy very probably to the Party opposite in a sense extremely unfortunate for the interests of Liberalism; and as a Liberal, believing that it is important that the great Party with which I have been so long associated should continue in full strength whenever called upon by public opinion to control the destinies of this country, I greatly deplore the decision which the Government have arrived at, and I earnestly appeal to them before this matter goes to a final conclusion to reconsider the determination which they have expressed so often in this House and endeavour to make the settlement a permanent one, which will give satisfaction to the Liberal Party, and, in a lesser degree, of course, to the Conservative Party, but, above all, to the great electorate of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00418"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend who has just sat clown has referred to me, and there are a few words which I should like to say, not about that part of his speech in which lie seeks to penetrate the enveloping gloom of the future, but upon the question which we are at present discussing at such great length&#x2014;the value of the Referendum. On this question the House is in a very curious position. The Referendum is regarded with almost passionate affection by the noble Earl who, I believe, is going to speak later&#x2014;Lord Selborne&#x2014;and is regarded with an equivalent suspicion by Lord Willoughby de Broke, who thinks it wholly unconstitutional. But the case upon the other side is not worse than the case upon my own side of the House. There are my noble friends Lord Courtney of Penwith and Lord Weardale, both of whom think that in the Referendum you have the true solution of the principles of democracy. I think I have before quoted Rousseau in this House. He used to say that the British nation, whose representative institutions he hated, was never free except at a General Election when there was no Parliament; but although the opinions of Rousseau have had a great deal of attention paid to them
<col>212</col>
they have not converted modern States, much less this country, to the doctrine of the Referendum.<lb/>
It is worth while considering why it is that every country in Europe regards the voice of the people, if one may use the phrase, as best expressed through representatives. This is no new question. It is not some striking discovery that has been made, that you can substitute for the voice of Parliament the voice of the people directly ascertained. That is not as old as the hills, but it is as old as the most ancient democracy. In ancient Athens the voices, when they were taken, were the voices of the people taken directly. That was a possible means of proceeding, because the democracy of Athens was enclosed within a wall of no great ambit. It was possible, therefore, for the great orators of that time to make the people hear and understand. I have before used the illustration in your Lordships' House, and I venture to use it again. It occurred to Themistocles, when he was desirous of building the great fleet with which he was so successful in inflicting a crushing defeat upon the Persians at Salamis, to consult the Athenian people with a view to their devoting the proceeds of the silver mines of Laurium to that purpose. That he did by means of the Referendum, and he got the reply which, no doubt, he was wishing for. But there is no analogy between the conditions existing in ancient Athens and the conditions which exist in this country. Why is it that the Referendum has been rejected by democracies systematically and continually, except for very special purposes, right through modern times?</membercontribution></p>

It is questions going far beyond matters dealing with the Constitution that you are proposing to send to the Referendum. I challenge my noble friend to point out any case in modern times in which States have taken any other course than reject this expedient as an impossible, clumsy, and inadequate way of ascertaining the will of the people. I will tell your Lordships why I conceive they have taken that course. What you want to ascertain is the considered opinion of the people, and in a form in which it can express itself and make itself usefully declared. There is only one way of doing that. You cannot go to the people on every detail of every Bill, and on every sort of question. My noble friend spoke of the Insurance Bill as a Bill which he thought was not unlikely to add to the demoralising tendency which was going on amongst the people of this country. How could you refer such a Bill as the Insurance Bill to the people of this country and ask them whether they will have it or not? I have had a good deal of experience, as many of your Lordships have, in dealing with electors, and I know that unless you go and explain every point to them in detail, unless you bring before them your side of the question, and somebody else puts before them the other side of the question, and does it in detail and adequately, large numbers of them will not take the trouble to vote, and even as it is others of them say, "We will not vote because we are not in a position to apprehend the point."</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00428"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Duke has brought out the very question with which I was dealing. As I say, the Referendum is employed with regard to questions dealing with the Constitution. It was exercised in Natal upon the question of Natal coining in under the new Constitution. The thing had been debated over and over again, and everybody in Natal knew every detail connected with it, and the question that was put to the people was a simple one on a specific point, to which only the answer "Aye" or "No" had to be given. I have never said that it is not possible to make use of the Referendum in certain cases. I only say that it is not possible to make it useful in such cases as are covered by the Amendment of the noble Marquess. In the case of Natal it may have been a good way of ascertaining the opinion of the people of that country, but the Referendum there is widely different from what is offered to your Lordships to-day by the Amendment of the noble Marquess to take the place of our own representative institutions.<lb/>
How do we govern this country? There are two great Parties in the State&#x2014;the Party which is in power and the Party which is in Opposition. The Party in power puts forward its programme; the programme is put before the country, and the Government brings forward its Bills, which at a General Election are discussed
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0112"/>
<col>215</col>
in the constituencies. Numbers of the electors are not the stupid people they are sometimes imagined to be. They take a keen interest in these things and insist on having them debated, and they go, many of them, to the meetings of both sides. What happens? A general approval is given to the principle of the Bill, and the Member representing the constituency is left to work out the details with other representatives and the Government. The constituencies do not want to be consulted on every point that arises in the discussion in the House of Commons, and never express a wish that their representatives should come back and consult them upon the details. They say, "You are our representatives, and we are satisfied for you to represent our general point of view. We have authorised you to give our assent to this particular Bill, the general evolution of which we leave in your hands, and we send you to Parliament to represent us in the working out of the details." That is why every modern State, without a single exception, has eliminated direct reference to the voters for the ordinary purposes of carrying out democratic government, and that is why, where the Referendum is kept, it is only kept for exceptional cases and for special purposes. With regard to the argument of my noble friend Lord Weardale, that representative institutions lead to oligarchy, which is what he said, they certainly in my own opinion lead to nothing more than this&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00432"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: In that case my noble friend will doubtless put himself at the head of a new Party. But whatever the Referendum is, it is no substitute for representative government. It may give you an indication of the ideas of the great mass of the people, but it is no substitute for the reasoned opinion or what has been called the general will of the community which the experience of every State in modern times has shown is obtained best through the medium of representative institutions.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Courtney of Penwith spoke of the decay of the Parliamentary spirit, and my noble friend Lord Weardale spoke of the tendency in the House of Commons to split up into groups. Have we not been accustomed to the splitting up into groups in the past? We have not witnessed the group system for the first time, and perhaps Lord Weardale himself will form another group in this House. At present I doubt whether we have more groups in the House of Commons than has been the case during the past seventy years. In the years before the Reform Bill there was the Repeal Party, the O'Connell Party, the Economists, represented by Joseph Hume; the Whigs, and the Radicals belonging to the Westminster school, and there were the sections of the Tory Party which had split up&#x2014;Peelites, Protectionists&#x2014;and between 1850 and 1860 there were so many groups seen that it was always a difficult task for any person forming a Government to see whether or not he could obtain the support of them. We have always groups, sometimes more and sometimes less; and it is a feature which you cannot dissociate from our Parliamentary life. It is true that there is more control of representatives by Whips than there used to be. Why? Because of the amount of business to be got through and the little amount of time in which to do it. The amount of business transacted in the House of Commons is enormously greater than before. Does the noble Lord doubt that it is becoming more and more necessary to economise the time, and that those who are responsible for using the time are compelled to apportion it out by means of the closure and other machinery originated by a succession of Governments in order to deal with a situation which is getting more and more intense. The congestion of local business in Parliament is such that for the working
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0113"/>
<col>217</col>
of Parliamentary institutions you will have to resort to some sort of devolution if you are to make progress. But I do not believe that the spirit of our Parliamentary institutions has in the least decayed. The same spirit exists in the House of Commons as has always existed; but there is a greater necessity for the economical use of its time; and until you have made some provision for the relief of the congestion of business you will never get to the root of the existing evil.<lb/>
This Amendment proposes to apply the Referendum in a way which goes far beyond any previous experience. It raises the question whether the representative institutions with which we have been familiar for centuries are now to be destroyed and something quite different substituted which has been condemned by the political experience of our own and other nations. It is because we hold the view very strongly that we are standing here in defence of representative institutions, and because this Bill gives its place, and nothing more than its due place, to the House of Commons in that representative system, that we are resolute opponents, not of the Referendum in any conceivable circumstances, but certainly to the Referendum in the vast bulk of circumstances which are covered by the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00433"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we who sit on this side of the House are believers in the virtues of Parliamentary discussion, and I do not think we shall be likely to modify that conviction by our experience this afternoon. We have witnessed the effects of Parliamentary discussion even upon the flinty hearts of His Majesty's Government, and at last, after a great pause, we saw the noble Viscount, who according to rumour was to have spoken later in the debate, brought to his legs. Your Lordships will judge of the kind of defence there is of the Government resistance of this Amendment from the remarks of the noble Viscount. There was a sort of parrot cry of representative institutions. The noble Viscount repeated over and over again that this Amendment was the negation of representative institutions, and he seemed to think that there was some virtue in the phrase. We do not believe that this Amendment in the least bit conflicts with representative
<col>218</col>
institutions. It is a necessary corrective to the invasion of the rights of the ancient Constitution of this country which the present Bill constitutes.<lb/>
The noble Viscount had the boldness to appeal for an example to every country in Europe. Could there be anything more amazing than that one of the authors of this Bill should appeal for support of it to Europe? There is not a country in Europe or in the civilised globe, except, I believe, Greece and one South American Republic, which has a Constitution the least resembling what this ancient British Constitution will be after His Majesty's Government have worked their will upon it. The noble Viscount&#x2014;I do not complain of it a bit&#x2014;was driven, in his defence of the Government position, to reminding us of a former speech of his own. He told us how Themistocles appealed to a Referendum. I confess I did not see the point of the illustration. Themistocles seemed to be entirely successful; the Referendum seemed to have worked perfectly, and in regard to a sort of extremely unpopular proposal&#x2014;a proposal for extracting money out of the pockets of the people. I certainly should not have supposed that the most likely field for a Referendum was Navy Estimates, but Themistocles did use that as the occasion of a Referendum and used it successfully and obtained the consent he asked for. The noble Viscount says that the Referendum is almost unknown in the civilised world. It is incredible that he should commit himself to such an assertion. Although lie was reminded of the classic cases in Australia and the United States, he made light of them. What right had he to make light of them? He said he understood that the principle of Referendum was much discredited in America. My information is entirely to the contrary. The principle of Referendum has not been introduced into the United States very long, but its popularity is increasing every day. It was started first of all, I believe, in the case of certain great municipalities, but it has already extended to complete States and is being adopted in all directions, and is, in fact, an integral part of the Constitution of the United States. I am informed that as many as forty-six out of forty-seven States cannot amend their Constitution except by means of the Referendum. So that, far from being unknown in the civilised world, it is perfectly well known and particularly in the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0114"/>
<col>219</col>
Anglo-Saxon parts of the civilised world, which is important from our point of view.<lb/>
The noble Viscount seemed to despise the case of the United States, and he said he did not think much of the Australian precedent. Why not? Could there be anything more in point than that? Here is a recent Constitution and a purely democratic one. I cannot improve on the statement of the case which was made by Lord Courtney last night. There the Referendum has been allowed by the British Government to be established, and it has been used with absolute success, not on trifles, as the noble Viscount seems to think, but with regard to very important proposals affecting the Constitution of the great Australian Commonwealth. What possible ground has the noble Viscount for his argument? I must remind him that mere assertion is of no value. He will never convert your Lordships' House or the country by mere assertion. When he says that the Referendum is not known to the civilised world and when he makes light of the Australian precedent he must back his assertion by argument.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00434"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I did not say it was not used.

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00438"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I do not think you understand me. What I said was that the very specific case which obtains in Australia does not cover the much more wide and general cases which are proposed in the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00439"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: That might be, but it certainly would cover such
<col>220</col>
a case as Home Rule, for example. If there ever was a Constitutional issue that is one, and yet the noble Viscount shrinks from the conclusion of his own argument. Is it not obvious that he has not got a word to say for himself? Then the noble Viscount told us that there was a difficulty in submitting every detail to the constituencies. Who wants to submit every detail to the constituencies? If the Government are prepared even to submit the principle of a Bill that will be something gained. But they do not want to submit anything. They want to be returned to power and to pass any Bills which they please. Does any noble Lord call that assertion of mine in question?<lb/>
I should like to draw attention to a most significant observation of the Lord Chancellor with reference to one of the Bills which your Lordships were pointed to as criminals for having rejected in the last Parliament&#x2014;a Bill which the noble and learned Lord was defending and reproving us for throwing out. This is no contest between the House of Lords and the House of Commons; the contest we are waging is in defence of the people themselves. Let that be perfectly understood. Did the noble and learned Lord when advocating the Bill to which I am referring&#x2014;the Licensing Bill&#x2014;really desire to follow the wishes of the people? No, not at all. He is far too honest a man to say so. He knew that he was not following the wishes of the people and took pride in the fact. This is what was said by the representative of the Party who think that the people's will ought to prevail&#x2014;
<quote>"I know very well that the subject is unpopular, and it may have influenced the recent by-elections, but I think it is our duty to stand by this Bill no matter how many by-elections may have gone against us."</quote>
The point is that the noble and learned Lord was quite aware that the Licensing Bill was unpopular, and he took credit to himself for the fact that he was, as a member of the Government, advocating a Bill which was unpopular. I am not criticising the noble and learned Lord but his statement confirms my assertion that the Government do not in their hearts desire to carry out the wishes of the people. That is a matter of indifference to them. They desire to carry out the programme of the Liberal Party, and if they can by means of the Parliament Bill make it impossible for your Lordships to refer
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0115"/>
<col>221</col>
these Bills which are unpopular to the people themselves, then they will be thoroughly satisfied.<lb/>
There is no question, as I have said, of submitting every detail to the people. Yet it is not true, on the other hand, to say that the people will be ill-informed of the issue they have to determine. The noble Viscount thought it would be impossible for the people to understand the issues submitted to them by Referendum. He did not seem to think it applied in the case of a Dissolution. He thought that in the case of a Dissolution following on the discussions in Parliament the people would be fully equipped with the necessary information, but, if you please, that argument is not to apply if it happens to be a Referendum. Why does it not apply? Can there he anything more ridiculous than that distinction? Reflect what will have happened. The Bill will have been passed on three occasions by the House of Commons and rejected on three occasions by your Lordships' House, the period extending over two years. I am afraid I have already had occasion to say in your Lordships' House that it is probable that the discussions in the House of Commons may be seriously curtailed, but at any rate the Government cannot take advantage of that particular argument. According to them the discussions there are to be full, and I can answer for it that the discussions here will be full. Are the people deaf, are they blind, cannot they read? Are all these discussions to take place in Parliament and nothing reach the people?<lb/>
It does not rest there. The various Members of Parliament will, of course, go down to their constituents. Many Members of your Lordships' House will go down to the various parts of the country and make speeches on the subject which has been referred to the people. The matter will be discussed in the greatest possible detail. Every device known to modern electioneering will be availed of in order to bring the matter home to the people. And there will be this immense advantage over a General Election. The effect of a Dissolution is not to concentrate the attention of the people on a particular issue&#x2014;there are a great many issues submitted, and it is very easy for any evilly-disposed person to confuse the issues. It is easy when a candidate at a meeting finds himself pressed on one subject for
<col>222</col>
him to shift his ground and go on to another subject. None of that will be possible at a Referendum. There will be a single issue on which the whole attention of the people will be concentrated. It will be quite impossible to evade it, and, so far from the noble Viscount being right in thinking that the people will be less informed, they will be a thousand times better informed of the arguments to be advanced on one side or the other. I maintain, as do all of us who sit on this Bench, that the Referendum will be an admirable method of really ascertaining the wishes of the people. We quite recognise, however, that it is not an operation to be undertaken without great care and circumspection, and that it should be applied only in really important cases.<lb/>
Is it thought that the use of the Referendum will become an abuse? I do not believe it for a moment. We have taken the greatest trouble in drafting the Amendment to prevent its becoming an abuse. Let me remind your Lordships&#x2014;I know it has been said before&#x2014;how difficult it will be to abuse the system of Referendum, if your Lordships and Parliament are good enough to adopt the Referendum of my noble friend. In the first place, only very grave matters would be referred to the people. The great mass of ordinary legislation, even when the two Houses of Parliament differ upon it, will not be subject to the operation of my noble friend's clause. It may be that the House of Commons and the House of Lords will differ diametrically upon half a hundred Bills, but unless they involve very grave matters the operation with regard to a Bill will take place as the Government propose. It is only in the case of the very few Bills which this impartial Committee consider to be grave that the Referendum will operate at all.<lb/>
Then it is thought that your Lordships' House will invoke a Referendum with a light heart upon trivial occasions. Of course not. It is not a very easy proceeding to invoke a Referendum. There is a good deal of disturbance of business and a great deal of expense incurred, and we know that if this House were ill-advised enough to invoke the Referendum without due cause it would suffer in credit and popularity in the country. So far from thinking that the Referendum will be very often employed, I believe it will be very seldom employed, but it will remain
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0116"/>
<col>223</col>
of the very greatest value, because it will be there as a protection of the most vital interests of this country. When the House of Lords believed that the House of Commons had not really received the assent of the people, the Joint Committee would be convened, and if they agreed with this House there would be a Referendum, and if the people justified your Lordships' action they would be protected from changes in the law to which they had never assented and which they agreed to be of the greatest danger to the interests of the country at large.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00440"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member>?<membercontribution>: The noble Marquess overlooks the fact that it is not what the House of Lords thinks about referring a Bill, but what the Committee thinks. The House of Lords will move the Committee, who will then be free to say "Aye" or "No" to the request that a Bill should be referred to the people. There is all the difference between that and this House deciding for itself. You are erecting a tri-cameral arrangement. This Committee will have the deciding voice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00441"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I really do not see the force of the noble Viscount's interruption. He says it is not the House of Lords that is going to decide it, but the Committee. It is quite true the Committee has the last word, but the point is that as it stands the Referendum is not brought into operation unless both the House of Lords and the Committee desire it. I think that is quite clear. I am assuming that if the general form of the Amendment of Lord Cromer is passed this Committee cannot be moved other than by a Resolution of either House or on the action of Mr. Speaker. I would ask is there likely to be an incautious Resolution of either House of Parliament? Is it likely that a Minister of the Crown will provoke a Referendum unnecessarily about one of his own Bills? Is it probable that Mr. Speaker, whose great position we have been justly reminded of again and again in these debates, will use the power entrusted to him trivially? No, It is perfectly clear that these great authorities would only act with due circumspection, and even then they would not do more than put the Committee in motion, who would decide whether the Referendum was to take place or not.<lb/>
<col>224</col>
It only remains for me to remind your Lordships that even supposing a mistake were made no great harm would be done. All that would happen would be that the people themselves would be consulted. Nothing worse would happen than that this great democratic principle should be vindicated, and that the people themselves should decide. For these reasons we recommend this Amendment to your Lordships' House; and we are bound to say that unless the Government can put up a better defence than, with all his great forensic ability, the noble Viscount has been able to offer in the speech he has just concluded, we cannot doubt what verdict your Lordships will give when you are asked to go into the Lobby. We commend most confidently this Amendment to your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00442"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think we are at this moment on what I may call a Second Reading debate on the principle of tile Referendum. I do not think it would be fair to press the Opposition and the noble Marquess who has moved this Amendment too closely on the fact that his Referendum does not satisfy us. If we accepted the Referendum at all it would have to be in quite a different form, and I think we have heard enough from the other side to show that the Amendment as presented is not quite satisfactory to them either. It makes no provision as to the point which my noble friend Lord Weardale pressed&#x2014;the security and protection of the Liberal Party when the Conservative Party is in office. It would only work to protect the Conservative Party, and would do nothing for the Liberal Party. We have heard nothing of that form of Referendum which was promised us before the General Election by Mr. Balfour&#x2014;that there should be a Referendum in the case of any Budget which tampered with the question of Free Trade. I do not press that too much, because if the Opposition got any sort of encouragement with regard to their Referendum proposal they no doubt would bargain with this side to modify it, and endeavour to make it as fair as possible to both sides of the House.<lb/>
In my opinion we shall not gain much advantage by discussing the results of the Referendum in other countries. I do not think precedents gained from other countries, especially so remote a precedent
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0117"/>
<col>225</col>
as its operation in Athens, are very useful. The government of Athens was conducted very much as affairs are now conducted at a parish meeting. It was the ordinary and necessary procedure for Themistocles in Athens to present his Navy Budget to the people; but that is quite different from the way in which the Referendum would have to be conducted in this country. It is a simple matter in a small area such as Athens comprised to call the people together and to educate them, but where you have a country with 45,000,000 people, distributed over a large area, who would all have to be educated in the various questions, the proposition assumes a different character. Therefore I do not think there is any analogy between what prevailed in Athens or of what prevails in the cantons of Switzerland and what would prevail in a country like our own. It is safer to follow the guidance of our own history, and the lesson which our history has taught us is that it is best to work on the lines of the old-established political system.<lb/>
I do not think my noble friend Lord Courtney was entitled to use the analogy of Australia for the purpose for which he used it. His point was that it was possible for Parliament to misapprehend the wishes of the people. He cited the instance where the Ministry in Australia, having somewhat outrun their mandate, were on Referendum pulled up and checked by the power of the people. None of us can deny that it is always possible for a Parliament to outrun what we familiarly call the mandate of the people. I do not quite like the expression "mandate," but, after all, it conveys a sound idea that the House of Commons is elected to represent the will of the people for the time being and to give effect to it. But when we have been dealing with the question of the Referendum in other countries we have been dealing with countries which had Constitutions, in other respects also, but pro-eminently in respect of their Second Chamber absolutely different from ours. If we had a House of Lords which was as truly and readily in touch with the dominant feeling of the people of this country as the house of Commons is, the friction between the two Houses would rapidly diminish, and the possibility of a Referendum would arise much more rarely. But it is not fair to introduce machinery which would allow a body
<col>226</col>
unsensitive to the general feelings of the country to force upon the representative body such a new machinery.<lb/>
I can quite understand that there might have been, in the early stages of the discussion, some opportunity of meeting the views of the other side, because I feel there is an element of truth and true political insight underlying some of the ideas expressed in the speeches on the other side. We all of us would be glad of many occasions to secure further deliberation before a thing is passed into law. If I remember right, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, in the earlier stages of the suggestion for modifying and limiting the powers of the House of Lords, suggested that if there was any important piece of legislation proposed, the Government of the day should introduce Resolutions indicating broadly the purposes of their legislation in the House of Commons, and that then those Resolutions should stand over as a sort of signpost to the electors of the tendency of the legislation proposed to be introduced in the new Bill, and in that way they would have as full notice as they could expect of the broad lines of the legislation which was to follow. I do not think noble Lords opposite can expect the electors to go into the details of a Bill, and you would not allow them to do so where the Referendum was employed. If the Referendum was applied in the case of education, or licensing, or the disestablishment of the Welsh, or the whole English Church, it would not be on the details of the Bill. The question would be, after the people had been educated by means of the political organisations and meetings and speeches, "Do you think you ought to take the Bill as it stands, or throw it out altogether?" That is all you could get out of the Referendum, and that is why I think if five or six years ago the Conservative Party had met the Liberals while Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was Prime Minister they might have come to a settlement on some such lines as I have suggested. But you were not ripe for it then. When Falstaff thought he was dying he said "God! God! God!" and Mrs. Quickly saw there was no need to think of God yet. Now like Mrs. Quickly your Lordships thought while there was time there was no need for a settlement, and now under compulsion you offer a settlement when it is too late. I wonder how many of your Lordships were in favour of the Referendum eight
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0118"/>
<col>227</col>
years ago when Mr. Balfour was Prime Minister. I think not one, but misfortune brings strange bedfellows and the extraordinary spectacle is now presented of the Tory Party lying down with ultra-democratic principles.<lb/>
For my part, while I have great sympathy with the desire to consult the nation on important matters of legislation, I have no sympathy whatever with the proposal to consult it by means of the Referendum. I think that to work upon the old lines of the political institutions which we have inherited, which have been improved and modified with time, is better than to work with something quite new. We have always considered that the proper way of consulting the nation was by a Dissolution and by the electors returning a new Parliament. The electors cannot determine details of policy; they can only determine whether they prefer the Liberals to the Unionists, or the Unionists to the Liberals, leaving the responsibility and power to the Government they return to make the decision on questions of policy, and I should be very sorry to see that responsibility and power taken to any extent out of the hands of those who have to lead and guide the Party and transferred in any way to a <i>pl&#x00E9;biscite</i> of the country.<lb/>
Noble Lords say we have plenty of experience of <i>pl&#x00E9;biscites</i> in various countries. We know the experience of France under the Second Napoleonic Dynasty, and I think every French politician would tell you that the habit of taking <i>pl&#x00E9;biscites</i> by Louis Napoleon was merely a device for confusing the people. There has been a great deal of discussion and dispute in France&#x2014;I am sure the noble Marquess who was the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has followed it and is intimately acquainted with all the movements of French politics since 1870&#x2014;and the pl&#x00E9;biscitary idea in France is completely discredited, politicians of all kinds considering that it is through the improvement of representative institutions not through appeals to the vote of a scattered population that the best, results are achieved. We have to work out from our own precedents and history what is the best way of going forward. I am only now dealing with this Amendment on Second Reading lines, not criticising it in detail. It is the principle that it should be by an appeal to the whole electorate, and not by an appeal to the
<col>228</col>
new House of Commons, that I object to. As I said before, I have not heard a single word from noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite that they would accept a Referendum of the character suggested by Mr. Balfour, by means of which we should get rid of plural voting&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00443"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: The noble Marquess himself referred to Lord Saltoun's Amendment as a reasonable method of working it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00444"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SHEFFIELD</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid I did not catch that. I think it is only fair, in discussing this Amendment, that we should go to the root principle of it rather than discuss details. While I should have been glad if this thing had been taken in hand at a time when it was possible to have had some agreement between the Parties with regard to it, yet I feel that such a time has gone by. The situation is too strained between both Parties; the temper of the House of Commons is much too high and resentful for any Government to be able with any hope of success to accept Amendments such as have been put forward by the other side, which, even considered fairly, must be objectionable, and can very well be held up as outrageous and tyrannical. But I cannot help hoping that this legislation may be temporary only, and that we may come with a reconstituted House of Lords to a period when the relations may be reconstructed, and possibly more powers given to the new Chamber than are left to the present one. I cannot help hoping that when the finance of the year is protected to the House of Commons there may be discussion allowed to your Lordships of Money Bills which, though including grants from the State, are Bills dealing with social matters, like the Old Age Pensions Bill and the Invalidity and Sickness Bill. But we are face to face with the extreme ruling that the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, gave on the question of the Voluntary Schools Aid Bill, when he absolutely suppressed all discussion and all amendment. Those precedents have to be got rid of before we can look to getting any reasonable power for dealing with such things. I hope your Lordships will excuse me for having given that illustration, but I think it is a necessary one and until something of the kind I have suggested is done I have no hesitation in voting against the Amendment of the noble Marquess, because in the present temper of the House
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0119"/>
<col>229</col>
of Commons and with the present constitution of your Lordships' House I see no possibility of its being accepted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00445"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CLONBROCK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it has been said that this debate is assuming too much the character of a Home Rule debate and that sufficient attention is not being paid to the portion of the Amendment dealing with other subjects, but really the danger of Home Rule is so imminent and it is so notorious that this Bill has been introduced chiefly as a prelude to a Home Rule Bill that I may be excused for returning to the subject. I wish to strongly support what fell from my noble friend Lord Mayo when he stated that opposition to Home Rule was as strong as ever in all parts of Ireland, and was not confined to Ulster. I do not know who the junior members of the Unionist Party are who were mentioned in the quotation my noble friend read from the Lord Chancellor's speech as being less strongly opposed to Home Rule than the senior members of the Party&#x2014;probably some young gentlemen who have not given much attention to the subject. Anyhow, I feel sure that they do not live in Ireland. That I think I can say. I can only recall one instance of any member of the Party having asked me what dangers we anticipated from Home Rule. The answer which he received gave him, I think, very serious food for reflection.<lb/>
Living as I do in Ireland, I have a large acquaintance with people in all the provinces, and I receive constant assurances from them that the feeling against Home Rule is as strong as ever it was and probably even more widespread. For, as was pointed out by Lord Mayo, farmers who have purchased their holdings are not so keenly in favour of Home Rule as they used to profess to be. The reason is perfectly plain. They have something to lose. As was pointed out by the noble Lord opposite, Lord MacDonnell, land is the main question in Ireland, and they know that the large farms they are now possessed of are as much coveted by the landless men as the land which is held by landlords. Irish Unionists are convinced that on the maintenance of the Union the prosperity of their country depends. They love their country, they absolutely refuse to concede to their political opponents a monopoly of patriotism, they are keenly interested in
<col>230</col>
the welfare of their country, and they are convinced that any weakening of the tie which binds the two countries together will materially injure that welfare, and that therefore it is in the interests of the two countries that this bond should remain unaltered. I say "in the interests of the two countries." For let Englishmen reflect on the difficulties that might arise, in the event of any foreign complication, front having a possibly hostile Parliament, sitting at no great distance from this country, with full control of the Executive.<lb/>
In addition to the question of material prosperity, there is a strong bond of sentiment uniting Irish Unionists to this country. They wish to maintain unimpaired the traditions of their forefathers in the past century, and to remain united to the governing centre of the great Empire which their countrymen have done so much to extend and to consolidate. They wish when they land on these shores to feel that they are not treading upon foreign soil, that they are not strangers in the land, but that they can identify themselves with all the feelings, hopes, and aspirations of the people of this country, just as when Englishmen come to Ireland they wish to receive them not as strangers but as fellow-citizens of the United Kingdom. Irish Unionists like to know, when they see the electric light shining in the tower above us that the interests and destinies of Ireland, as well as those of Great Britain, are committed to the charge of the Parliament sitting below. The intensity of this feeling cannot, perhaps, be fully appreciated by people who are not in the same position, but it ought to enlist the sympathies of people in this country and render them averse to placing those who hold this feeling so strongly at the mercy of an Irish Parliament. The knowledge that in most parts of Ireland where patriotism has shrunk to a narrow provincialism such sentiments are looked upon as criminal, and the knowledge that in some cases they are still guilty of the unpardonable crime of holding property which is coveted by others, renders Irish Unionists most apprehensive of being placed at the mercy of an Irish Parliament with full control over the Executive.<lb/>
I know we shall be told that these apprehensions are unfounded, that the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament will be
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0120"/>
<col>231</col>
maintained, that with the establishment of an Irish Parliament all differences will be forgotten, and that peace and goodwill will prevail everywhere. In spite of the plausible utterances of the leaders of the Party and the promise of toleration and peace and concord, we cannot believe in this restoration of the Golden Age. We have too much experience of the bitterness of feeling which, unfortunately, still prevails in Ireland, and how recollection of past grievances, whether real or imaginary, rankles in the Irish mind. Then as to the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament, what security have we, even if that was accepted by the Nationalist Party, that it would be strictly enforced? Any difference of opinion between the Imperial Parliament and the Irish Parliament would be strongly resented. Recollections of the struggles against the operation of Poyning's Act before the Union at the close of the eighteenth century would be invoked, the example then set would be followed, and turmoil and agitation would succeed. Is it not to be feared that the dread of agitation would again prevail and that the Government of the day would give way? We have every reason to believe that if such a state of things was accepted as an Irish Parliament under the supremacy of this Parliament, it would only be taken as an instalment to secure further power. The utterances of the leaders of the Party&#x2014;not intended for consumption in England, but in America&#x2014;show us that they cannot rely on the support of their followers unless they demand complete independence. As was said by the noble Lord opposite, Lord Weardale, there are several kinds of Home Rule; and he was not aware, any more than we are, what sort of Home Rule His Majesty's Government contemplate. But we believe that there is no half-way house between the present state of things and complete independence, and, as I said before, the interval between those two points would be filled up with turmoil and agitation. We therefore hail the subsection in this Amendment which provides that this question in which they are so vitally interested should in the last resort be submitted to the electors of the United Kingdom for decision. We look to the electors of the United Kingdom to see that we should not be made to suffer for our attachment to this country. We look to them for justice. It has as ever been the proud boast of Englishmen that no one appeals to their sense of justice in vain,
<col>232</col>
and it is before that tribunal that we wish our claims to be laid.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00446"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when I read and consider the Amendment before the House and remember the speech with which it was introduced by the noble Marquess I say frankly I am surprised at the result. The Amendment was framed with infinite care, so as to secure in the most reasonable and moderate way that great topics that might legitimately, it was conceived, be excluded from the normal operation of the Parliament Bill should be reserved for further consideration by the nation. I thought it not unlikely that the noble Viscount opposite, although he might not feel at liberty to accept the whole of the Amendment, would at once have accepted the first part of it; and, for myself, speaking perfectly frankly as a man accustomed to look at problems from many sides, I cannot see at all why the noble Viscount should not accept the first part.<lb/>
The first part of the Amendment says that any measure affecting the existence of the Crown or the Protestant succession should not be dealt with under the normal operation of the Parliament Bill, but should be left for the whole nation to express an opinion upon by Referendum. Is it not commonsense that it would be a monstrous thing to change the existence of the Crown or the Protestant succession without the nation having a frank and free voice in reference to the matter? I heard the Duke of Devonshire speak yesterday with great force and clearness on this point and I heard the reply of the noble Viscount and I am still unable to understand why such a reasonable and obvious proposal is not accepted by the Government. What was the answer that was given? That in the present House of Commons such a proposal was not likely to be made, and that if such a thing ever were done the Sovereign would have a remedy. I listened attentively to the noble Viscount, but I do not know what he has suggested as the Sovereign's remedy if a Bill were presented to him by the Prime Minister of the day affecting the existence of the Crown and the Protestant succession. What was to be done by the Sovereign in a case of that kind? I am at a loss to follow the meaning of the observations of the noble Viscount in reference to that matter, because the only course open to
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0121"/>
<col>233</col>
the Sovereign would be to recur to the Veto, or else ask the Prime Minister of the day, "What am I to do to save the existence of the Crown and the Protestant succession from the consequences of the very Act which you present to me." Surely that is a ridiculous way to leave a great Constitutional question of the highest conceivable importance, and I honestly and sincerely say that I thought this part of the Amendment would be accepted mainly on the ground that it was just and in a lesser degree because there was no vestige of an answer to it.<lb/>
A good many of the speeches have been necessarily addressed to the question of Home Rule. My noble friend behind me, who is entitled to speak with the highest authority on that question from his character and ability and from the part he has always taken in the counsels of Irish Peers, has dealt with the question, but to a certain extent we are in a difficulty in dealing with Home Rule now. If we had a Bill before us we should then know what the mind of the Government was on the matter. I do not believe they know themselves at present. It would be a great advantage to us if we could see the Bill, and if we could know&#x2014;shall I say?&#x2014;its enormities. I would like to see how the Government skate round the difficulties of the question. But we have not got the Bill, and therefore we can only say this, that we know enough of the question from its history and what has been said to see that it is a question which it is legitimate should be kept out of the ordinary ambit of such a Bill as this in order that the nation should have an opportunity of saying what they think in reference to it.<lb/>
We know on the broad outlines that Home Rule must lead to disruption of the Empire. It breaks up at once the United Kingdom. That is a tremendous fact. It must lead to a great disturbance of the incidence of taxation and an enormous change in the expenditure of the two countries, and it will lead to much heart-burning as to what is to become of the poor Irish Members. As a general proposition, they are pretty well able to take care of themselves. As an Irishman I am the last person in the world to disparage the brains and intelligence of my own countrymen, but if you think you are going to get rid of Irish difficulties
<col>234</col>
by having a Home Rule something in Dublin you are mistaken. What is to become of the Irish Members? Are they to be kept here to look after Imperial concerns, and keep you in order? We know nothing about that except from speculation, and we can only speculate on the bearings of a Home Rule Bill in reference to Ireland. How is Ireland to get over the tremendous difficulties in regard to finance? You have a Committee sitting on the question, which is some guide that you yourselves recognise the obvious difficulties of the case.<lb/>
Then there is the case of Ulster. No one can question that in a great part of Ulster&#x2014;may I say Protestant Ulster?&#x2014;there is a tremendous hatred of Home Rule, as there is in countless homesteads spread all over Ireland. That is the question of the Protestant minority. I only mention it as showing that it is one of those great subjects that necessarily attract the attention of every fair-minded man. This question of Home Rule is an exceptional one. It affects England tremendously, and it affects Ireland so seriously that you are bound in all fairness and justness not to treat it as an ordinary matter of legislation, but allow the free voice of the nation to express itself upon it. When you have the Bill drafted and ready you ought to submit your policy to the judgment of the people. There are vague sentences which deceive nobody. "Let the Irish manage their own affairs." Beautiful. But who are the Irish? Are we not one composite united people, springing from the same stock, the same race, and having the same instincts? When you talk of the Irish you do not mean a united people but a disunited people, some of whom seem strongly in favour of your plan whilst others believe that your plan is one of the wickedest ever invented to disturb a nation.<lb/>
When you say "Let the Irish manage their own affairs," I ask, What affairs are they to manage? Are they to manage the affairs of the minority against their wish and determination? Are they to send a coterie over to manage your affairs? Are they to have the right to tax Ulster? That is a tremendous question. I have the greatest possible respect for the noble Viscount opposite. I had the honour of sitting, though not on the same side, with him in the House of Commons, and I
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0122"/>
<col>235</col>
have had the privilege of reading many of his works. But I do not think he was quite fair to this House in indicating that this House could not be trusted to act fairly and reasonably in reference to Irish affairs owing to its past history. Where was his right to say that? Ireland, owing to the Acts of this Legislature and the cooperation of this House, has one of the widest systems for the purchase of land that any civilised country has ever seen, and the widest Land Acts. The noble Viscount knows that the Land Acts of 1870 and 1881, two great achievements of Mr. Gladstone, were passed by this House, on the beneficent working of those Acts. Take the Local Government Act of Mr. Gerald Balfour, a man of whom we do not hear enough, passed by the Conservative Government. That Act gave as wide a measure of local government to Ireland as exists in England. Surely that is an immense thing, and my noble friend Lord Londonderry, in his speech last night, teeming with information, mentioned the present position of our savings bank, brought about by the thrift and possibility of saving of the people of Ireland, and that shows that prosperity has been able to grow up under the Union.<lb/>
A predecessor of mine in the office both of Attorney-General and Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Mr. Law, who I am sure enjoyed the friendship of the noble Viscount opposite&#x2014;he was an eminent lawyer and distinguished statesman&#x2014;said, when prosecuting Mr. Parnell in the King's Bench in Dublin, that the Irish tenant had been made a cat's-paw to help on the Home Rule movement. Something else has been said here about the balance between the actions of both Parties with regard to Ireland. I will not go into that. I admit that each side acted according to what they honestly believed to be the requirements of Ireland at the respective times, and it is not fair, or just, or reasonable, to suggest that either Party acted otherwise than in an honest belief that they were doing their best to cope at the time with the difficulties of the position. I remember well some of Mr. Gladstone's sentences with regard to the crime that had occurred in Ireland, and when the Acts that had been passed did not achieve as rapidly as was hoped the results that were anticipated. One of them was, when some great crime had taken place in Ireland, "The resources of civilisation are
<col>236</col>
not yet exhausted." When Mr. Gladstone was asked what was to be done because improvement was not advancing rapidly enough, he said, "Do not let us weary of doing good." My Lords, each side must take responsibility for what has been done in Ireland, and you cannot blame Peers connected with Ireland if they raise their voices and testify to what they believe will be the results of legislation which they know is impending. It is essential for them to point out that this is one of the great measures which ought not legitimately and justly to be placed in the category of ordinary legislation. It is a measure which should be submitted for the free opinion of the nation, in order that the people may say, looking at the question of Home Rule fairly and all round, whether the measure is one that is called for by the requirements of Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00447"><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF RIPON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is only natural that those who feel strongly on this subject should express themselves strongly, and it is only natural that those who have fears, perhaps I should be allowed to say legitimate fears, should give expression to those fears on such an occasion as this. I venture to say, and I am sure noble Lords on both sides of the House will forgive me if I am perfectly frank, that. I do not quite feel that it is a fair description of the conditions of the last Election to say that Home Rule was put very prominently before the electors. It is perfectly true that on one side there were those who were ready to warn the electors that probably Home Rule would follow, but I do not think that the voice which uttered those views spoke with authority so definite and distinct as to make it an absolute certainty to the people of this country that Home Rule was intended. If I remember rightly, when it was asserted on one side of the House that Home Rule was, as it were, the bogey behind the door, an answer was given more than once to the effect that it was merely a "red herring" that was being drawn across the track. If responsible members at that time were ready to retort that the idea of Home Rule was a red herring across the track, there must have been a large section of the Party who did not intend to put the Home Rule issue as a prominent matter before the people, and I venture to think it is quite legitimate on the part of those noble Lords who have done so to argue
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0123"/>
<col>237</col>
that the Home Rule question was not so explicitly before the country so that anyone could say that the country had absolutely decided in favour of it.<lb/>
I am in the unfortunate position of being one who cannot see eye to eye with the various partisans. I do not know under what category I should come if the descriptive political epithets were to be applied to me. I am afraid I should have to take my chance. I presume I should be called a speckled bird. In my judgment the only way to deal with questions which come before a great legislative assembly like this is to ask yourselves what is your best judgment; what is your honest opinion; and to express that opinion to the best of your power. I understand that the Referendum is the main issue of the debate at present. I venture to say, with all courtesy, that to my point of view there has been something of a discursive method of dealing with that issue, and it seems to me that Home Rule has loomed rather too largely in the discussion to the obscuring of the main issue before us, which is: Is the Referendum a wise and just method of dealing with present-day difficulties?<lb/>
I confess I am not ready to yield to the noble Viscount who leads the House in the extreme aversion I have felt to the Referendum. I do not like the Referendum because the whole of my hypothesis of government is this, that I being an elector not having a wide experience concerning administrative action employ somebody else whom I believe to be wiser and better fitted than myself to take up the matter and deal with it. I take that attitude feeling that the members elected to the elective Assembly are better fitted to judge than those who send them there. That being so, it seems to me unwise that maters should be referred back from the better instructed to the less better instructed, and I venture to think that wherever that is done there is a confession of weakness in the Assembly that is driven to do it, because it seems to me to involve this admission, "We cannot make up our minds, we are in a difficulty, and you who are less instructed must form your opinion on the subject." That seems to me the real difficulty with regard to the Referendum.<lb/>
For that reason the question presents itself to my mind in this way&#x2014;Have
<col>238</col>
circumstances arisen which make it desirable that we should resort to the Referendum? I do not want to say a word which would disparage the position of any legislative Assembly, but a great deal has been said about the difficulties which exist in the House of Commons and the great congestion of business that exists there. I think it is but just and fair to admit that the House of Commons is in difficulty because of the enormous amount of work thrown upon it. I for one feel, when great and grave measures have to be discussed, that it is a very hard thing for the people of this country that discussion should be cut short on important measures because a whole host of minor measures are a waiting consideration. In the case of the affairs of a growing Empire such as ours, the complication of whose circumstances is increasing every day, which complication may lead to tremendous problems in the future, I do not think we are dealing justly with the great Imperial policy of this country if our representatives in Parliament are obliged to say "We have no time to discuss, consider, or deliberate on these matters as we should like." I blame nobody for it. I speak merely of I he facts of the case, but it does seem to me that it ought not to pass the wit of man to find some means of escape from such an intolerable position.<lb/>
What has been the result? There is a symptom, as has been pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Courtney, of a decay in Parliamentary spirit. I do think, if we are to be perfectly frank in the matter, we must admit that. Everyone who looks at the method&#x2014;I will not say the hurried method&#x2014;by which sometimes Members are driven by circumstances to give a vote with which, according to their inmost convictions, they do not feel satisfied at all, must recognise the danger of the tendency. Party organisation has become extraordinarily perfect in these days. The machinery is as complete and as perfect as it can be made, but I must say I cannot bring myself to look at this machinery with anything approaching approval or satisfaction. It seems to me that in the end this mechanism is likely to destroy the reality of freedom and the real value and the moral effect of a legislative Assembly. My Lords, I have no axe to grind and no sort of leaning from a Party point of view, and I speak with frankness and freedom
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0124"/>
<col>239</col>
as one who has formed as independent an opinion as I can. It is written in history that the idea creates the organisation, but the organisation often ends by destroying the idea; and I would ask: Are we not in danger lest the very perfection of our organisation may tend to kill the very idea which brought that organisation into existence?<lb/>
What did Burke say concerning the position of the House of Commons? He said that the House of Commons was, in his view, an Assembly created to watch with due care the actions of the Executive. That is perfectly reasonable. I can go back in imagination to the days when the Executive had great power, and the House of Commons was bound to be on its guard lest there was any unwise or unfair exercise of power on the part of the Executive; and Burke's view was that the House of Commons must watch very jealously the action of the Executive, because the Executive had power to do things at variance with the will of the people. I recall a statement made by a noble Lord who said, speaking of the Executive of the country: "We have reversed by our administrative action Acts of Parliament which were passed before we came into office, and there was no one to come and say, 'That is very wrong.'" Where was the vigilance that ought to have been exercised at such a moment as that? Is there not every reason why the House of Commons should exercise extraordinary vigilance lest the Executive should exceed its powers? The perfecting of Party organisation has given to the Executive enormous power, and therefore there is tremendous danger of our falling under the tyranny of bureaucratic government. That being the case, it seems to me that every vigilance should be brought into play which will tend to prevent the invasion of the rights and the freedom of the people to judge and think for themselves without the Executive being tempted to go beyond its powers. I am afraid of what might happen if your Party organisations become so perfect that you were able to carry measures right through, having dragooned your followers into subjection&#x2014;measures which really had never received the broad and wide sanction of the people of the country. I only put this forward as one who does see that there are certain dangers which threaten an invasion upon the rights and freedom of the people.<lb/>
<col>240</col>
If I may I will give one illustration which occurred in my own experience. I was seated in my study one evening when I was told that a certain Member of Parliament desired to see me. I confess I did not feel very grateful for the interruption, because I was at that moment intent upon the preparation of my Sunday evening sermon. He said, "I want you to sign a petition." I said, "What is it?" He said, "It is a petition to keep that"&#x2014;I will not repeat the adjective that he used&#x2014;"gentleman, Mr. Bradlaugh, out of the House of Commons. It is a petition to the House of Lords to ask them to throw out the Affirmation Bill." I looked at him and said, "This is very extraordinary. If I remember rightly you are on the side of the House which has brought in that Bill." "Oh, yes," he said, "I am." "Well," I said, "I suppose you opposed it?" "Oh, no," he replied, "I went with my Party." Then I said to him, "You come to me and request me to sign a petition asking the House of Lords to undertake a responsibility you had not the courage to undertake for yourself. You can go away. I will have nothing to do with it." "As a matter of fact," I added, "I approve of the Affirmation Bill, but even if I agreed with you I would never dream of signing a petition to liberate you from responsibility when you had not the independence to settle it for yourself."<lb/>
May I say also that I greatly deprecate what I may call the financial necessities of Party organisation. A man may be assisted into the House by contributions from Party funds. Is he allowed to give a free and independent vote always? I believe it is the duty of the Whips in the case of a man who has come under the auspices of the Party to see that he follows the Party lead. That is exactly what gives me courage to rise in your Lordships' House, because it seems to me that the House of Commons is in danger of ceasing to be what it was intended to be&#x2014;an Assembly of free Englishmen gathered together to consider, debate, and decide on the great issues which affect the welfare of the country. In the present conditions I think that the Referendum is a step in the wrong direction, and that it is essentially and theoretically a blunder, because it is an appeal from the wise to the unwise in theory. Yet, seeing that you are withdrawing from the House of Commons a great deal of protective force which acted
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0125"/>
<col>241</col>
as a shield to the freedom of the country, I cannot see that there is any alternative except, in some form or another, to take advantage of the opportunity offered to us of a Referendum to the people on all really great issues. Is it quite impossible to find a <i>modus vivendi</i> in this matter? Is it really to be said that we are going to stand out on a matter of this kind and say that there shall be no case in which there shall be this Referendum or appeal to the country? My noble friend Lord Sheffield desired that there should be opportunities, under certain conditions, of consulting the people, and the Referendum is a method for doing it. I ask whether it is not possible, even at this late hour, to find some mode by which both Parties could agree with regard to it.<lb/>
I gathered, from what the noble Viscount said, that he did recognise that there might be Constitutional questions which it would be desirable under certain circumstances to refer to the people. Nobody wants to make this a usual expedient. All we want is that there should be certain special cases referred on matters touching the Constitution. It has been said that a Government which comes in by the will of the people is elected to carry certain measures, and that to refer those measures back to the people again is a superfluous thing. If I thought that I should say, By all means go on as you are. But that is not always the case, and I think I am right hi saying that some Bills have become Acts which did not bear quite the same complexion as when first introduced. Indeed, some Bills remind me of a scene in the "Inferno," where a serpent attacked a man and penetrated the man through the middle so effectually that by and by the man became the serpent and the serpent became the man. Therefore it does seem to me, after due deliberation, that there are exceptional cases&#x2014;I do not attempt to define them&#x2014;where the use of the Referendum might be advisable, and I make an earnest and humble appeal to His Majesty's Ministers to-day, putting whatever restrictions they like upon it, to see if they cannot at least give the people of this country an opportunity of expressing their opinion on those great issues which must inevitably affect their welfare and their prosperity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00448"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have not ventured up till now to
<col>242</col>
interpose in this debate, but I should like to ask your Lordships to allow me to offer a few remarks this evening, not because I have any hope of being able to say anything that is new, but because I do look upon the present situation as one of a most serious and grave character. I should like to endorse the appeal made by the right rev. Prelate in his most eloquent speech. Personally I support the Amendment that has been moved by the noble Marquess, because I believe that if it was accepted a great deal, in fact almost all, of our objections to this Bill would be done away with; and it seems to me that if there is any real desire for compromise a means of compromise is to be found in this Amendment.<lb/>
I would, in the first place, say that in supporting this Amendment there is no desire on my part to in any way reflect upon the House of Commons. I have been myself elected to that House on no less than six occasions, and I look back to my connection with it as the most notable portion of my life. There is no desire on our part to reflect upon or to express distrust of the House of Commons. What we do distrust is the disproportionate representation. The noble Lord, Lord Sheffield, following the line set by a good many noble Lords opposite, referred to the subject of plural voting&#x2014;a question which has been before your Lordships on many occasions. Hut I would ask any noble Lord who is in favour of the abolition of the plural vote to take a short journey to the Library of your Lordships' House, where he will find an ingenious plan, prepared by Major Morrison-Bell, which I think will convince him that there is something more important than the question of plural voting&#x2014;and that is the question of representation in the House of Commons. He will find a very elaborate plan, giving the proportional representation of every constituency. And it may be interesting to noble Lords to know that the defeated Unionist candidate in Romford, which is the most prominent of all the constituencies set out in the plan, polled more votes than were polled by Mr. Asquith, Mr. Lloyd George, Sir E. Grey, and Mr. Haldane combined. That suggests that the reconstitution of the House of Commons is far more necessary than the reconstitution of the House of Lords. If the object of the franchise is to give fair representation to the electors I would suggest that the present Government should introduce a
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0126"/>
<col>243</col>
Redistribution Bill, and that when they have reconstituted the House of Commons it will be time enough for them to attempt to deal with the House of Lords. The reasons I am in favour of the Amendment are, in the first place, that I see a possibility of compromise, and, in the second place, it differentiates the character of the measures that would come before Parliament and gives an opportunity of appeal to the country.<lb/>
We have heard a good deal to-night about the Referendum. It seems to me that those who object to it have occupied their time in finding out bits of this Referendum and bits of the other Referendum that do not suit us. Very likely. I believe America worked out a scheme of Referendum that would suit itself without regard to what suited other countries; and if it becomes necessary, as I believe it will under this Bill, that some appeal should be made to the people of the country before these questions of great importance are passed over our heads, some such consideration will become necessary. The noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, mentioned subjects which be considered unsuitable for Referendum. But surely that is a matter that can be easily arranged. Lord Crewe last year, when dealing with the question of the Referendum, said that the issue which was referred ought to be a simple issue and one that would materially affect those who were called upon to vote. I think we all agree with that. And while so many questions that are unsuitable have been suggested to your Lordships, I should like to suggest one that, in my opinion, is absolutely suitable&#x2014;namely, Payment of Members. I suggest that that would be a very easy question to submit to a Referendum. It is a simple issue, and one that materially affects the people who are called upon to vote in respect to it; and it seems to me that the common-sense action to take would be to allow those who have to pay the money, not those who are to receive it, to say whether payment is necessary. I undertake to say that if that question were put to the country very few constituencies would estimate the value of the services of their respective representatives at &#x00A3;400 a year.<lb/>
The right rev. Prelate quoted an eloquent passage from Burke with which I fully agree. One of the principal objections to this Bill is that it reverses what are the
<col>244</col>
proper functions of Parliament. We have a more recent example than Burke. On November 21 last year Lord Crewe gave a definition of Parliament, and what it ought to do. He said that Parliament was not an end in itself; it was a means of doing certain things for the nation; and he went on to explain that it was a machine with three principal objects&#x2014;first, to keep in check the Executive; second, to raise money; and, third, and not the primary one, to pass legislation. I venture to say that in this Bill that position is entirely reversed. This Bill is apparently framed and brought before you for the one purpose of forcing through Parliament legislation, Party legislation. We have already had it explained to us, and we know from our own experience, that at the present moment the Executive, on which Parliament ought to keep a check, is supreme, and that Parliament has no power of instituting such a check. We have also heard a good deal about the questions that were raised at the last two elections, and we have had it apparently generally accepted that this particular Bill was fully discussed during the last election. Those who make that statement apparently ignore a speech that was made by the Prime Minister at Oxford on March 18 of last year, after the January election. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"This absolute Veto upon legislation must go. That was the issue submitted to the electorate. We believe they intended to answer it, and did answer it, in the affirmative, and this will become clear when the matter is submitted as it will be submitted the week after next, to the House of Commons."</quote>
He was referring to the Veto Resolutions on which the House of Commons were about to decide, and it will be borne in mind that those Veto Resolutions were passed under the guillotine on the distinct understanding that the Bill framed on those Resolutions should have full discussion when it came up. The Prime Minister went on to say that the matter, of course, could not rest there, and that the judgment of the House of Lords must also be obtained, but that he did not know what that judgment would be, although he had his suspicions. Now is it credible, after that speech of the Prime Minister, that that Bill, for which full discussion had been promised, should have been withdrawn from the House of Commons before the House of Commons had an opportunity of discussing it on Second Reading? And had it not been for the insistence of the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0127"/>
<col>245</col>
noble Marquess the Bill would never have been brought before your Lordships at all. I maintain there was no idea at that time of any second election.<lb/>
It is rather interesting to consider what were the causes that produced the second election. At elections various questions are raised, and the difficulty really is, not in getting the support of the country to a particular proposal, but in putting the platform cry into an Act of Parliament. For instance, you are in favour of education; so are we. You are in favour of temperance; so are we. But when the one side or the other come to put their licensing or their education proposals into a Bill, then arises the difficulty. There was no real reason for a second election at all. I have quoted the words of the Prime Minister, and I think it was Lord Crewe, at Newmarket, who said that the Liberal Party did not want the election, and that it was forced upon them. An interrupter said, "By the Irish Party," and the answer was, "No, by the House of Lords." I challenge any noble Lord opposite to show in what way your Lordships forced that second election. The real reason was given by the Master of Elibank, a very important person on the other side. Addressing the London Liberal Open-air Speakers' League on February 24, he said that when he was asked as Chief Liberal Whip what would be the best time for a General Election he replied, "At once," and he added that be staked his soul upon London, because he had heard of the work that had been carried on by Liberals at street corners. We were, therefore, put to all the expense of a General Election because of the work done by Liberal orators at street corners.<lb/>
Have we ever had fair play from the other side? The noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, comes here and pays us compliments, but it is no good his telling us what fine fellows we are because we already know it. If he would go and pay us the same compliments on public platforms there might be something in it. What did he say the other day? He said he wanted a Second Chamber, but not one like the House of Lords, which "hunted Liberal measures like a terrier hunts rats." It would have been more fair, instead of making that remark, had he told his audience that on no single occasion had the Veto of the House of Lords been put in operation between the January and December elections. What we did was to suspend our
<col>246</col>
Standing Orders in order to pass the Budget in a single day, after the many months of what we thought rather discreditable man&#x0153;uvring before the other Chamber was able to pass it.<lb/>
The present Postmaster-General said, in the January election, that the Liberal Party claimed that the last word was not with the House of Lords but with the House of Commons. We claim that the last word is neither with the House of Lords nor with the House of Commons, but with the people. It is because I believe that by this Amendment we shall secure the last word being with the people that I shall give it my most strenuous support; and I venture once again to remind your Lordships of the definition of an ideal Second Chamber given by the Prime Minister in 1904 and quoted with excellent effect by the late Lord Cawdor during the Budget debate&#x2014;that a real Second Chamber was a revising authority over tile details of legislation, that when a doubt existed as to whether the House of Lords or the House of Commons more accurately interpreted the wishes of the people, the Veto should be introduced in order teat that doubt might be effectively solved. That is all we have ever asked for, and that is all we ask for now.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00450"><member>THE EARL OF ARRAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, yesterday the noble Lord, Lord Courtney, commenced his speech by finding fault with the noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, for making what he considered an address appropriate for the Second Reading of a Home Rule Bill. With all the deference that is due to a man of great distinction like Lord Courtney, I venture most emphatically to join issue with him on this matter. Speaking as a life-long and an unrepentant Liberal, though not a supporter of his Majesty's present Government, I believe not only that we should never have heard of a Home Rule Bill at this juncture had His Majesty's Government not been dependent on the Nationalists for their majority, but that we should have heard very little, if at all, of thee Parliament Bill.<lb/>
There is another reason which makes the debate on this particular Amendment
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0128"/>
<col>247</col>
a debate upon Home Rule in disguise, and why we, particularly those who come from Ireland, should discuss Home Rule. That reason is the fact that, as was so amply and ably proved in yesterday's debate, Home Rule was never before the country as a controversial measure at a the last General Election; and this important debate is one of the few occasions open to us on which we can bring the question of Home Rule, not only before the people of England, but, what is equally important, before the province of Ulster. It is most essential that this purpose should be fulfilled, because up to now the province of Ulster has not realised the imminence of the danger of Home Rule which now threatens it.<lb/>
Speaking, as I said just now, as a Liberal, I cannot help wondering whether the Party which I followed so faithfully and so long are entirely wise in having supported Home Rule so enthusiastically during this controversy. I confess that in many ways I have great sympathy with my old Party, and I confess also that during the debate of the last two days, when I have listened to the arguments on both sides, the Liberal Party have had my deepest sympathy in regard to the outcome of the fight. But I repeat that I wonder whether they are wise, for their own purposes, in supporting Home Rule as strongly as they are doing at the present time. We do not know in the least what measure of Home Rule is to be proposed. It is said that Home Rule has been before the country; but I would remind His Majesty's Government that no indication of the kind of Home Rule which they propose to introduce has yet been elicited by any question put from the Unionist side of the House. The Government have still to realise that the question of Home Rule has at some time or another to be considered by the country.<lb/>
I do not believe, whatever anybody may say, that Home Rule is popular in England. The experience I gained when speaking years ago on Liberal platforms showed me that it is impossible to work up any great enthusiasm on the subject of Home Rule, but that it is very easy indeed to arouse enthusiasm in support of the Union after a fortnight's campaign. Although I know that the Nationalists are in a position, if they choose, to inflict a defeat on the Government in the Lobby of the House of
<col>248</col>
Commons, I do not think if they were pressed to do so that the Nationalists would carry matters to that extreme point for they would have to face a General Election fought on the subject of Home Rule. I know that other methods of passing the Parliament Bill have been in the minds of many people of late. There has been laid before us in the Press&#x2014;I do not know whether it has been threatened officially by His Majesty's Government&#x2014;a proposal for the creation of sufficient Peers to swamp the Conservative and Unionist majority in this House in order to carry a measure of Home Rule, the Parliament Bill, or anything else that might be required by supporters of the Government. I confess I shall believe in these 500 Peers only when I see them actually created. An anonymous friend the other day sent me a copy of a Liberal newspaper, though I do not know if it is a Government organ&#x2014;I refer to <i>Reynolds' Newspaper.</i> In that paper was published what purported to be a list of the names of those people who were to be the first stalwarts to support the Liberal policy in the House of Lords by sacrificing themselves and becoming Peers of the Realm. I confess, on looking through those names and considering the stake the people there mentioned hold in the country, that it appeared to me that the title to which they might lay the greatest, almost the only, claim would be that of their telephone numbers. I wondered whether those 250 new Peers&#x2014;for that was the number of names published&#x2014;would, when the time came for asserting the opinions for which they were created and giving definite support to Home Rule, be found in the proper Lobby.<lb/>
Again I say, taking all these questions into consideration, I wonder whether the Liberal Party have been entirely wise in placing so much faith and so much confidence in the necessity for passing Home Rule in order to remain in the position in which they now hold office. My reason for saying this is that the Nationalist Party are, as your Lordships will admit very shrewd politicians, and t hey will consider their own position carefully before they force a General Election on this unpopular subject. The Nationalist Members have a great deal to count on from a Liberal Government while it remains in office&#x2014;far more than they could count on from a Unionist Government if it should
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0129"/>
<col>249</col>
be returned to power. Therefore I believe, and I think I shall find many to agree with me, that they would consider their position very carefully before they went to the length of forcing the Government into a difficult or almost impossible situation. I venture to lay these remarks and considerations before His Majesty's Government in the earnest hope that they may be willing to consider them.<lb/>
There is another reason why I think there are great difficulties before his Majesty's Government. There is the difficulty of the Nonconformists. People have said lately that Nonconformists in England no longer care one way or the other, as they did on previous occasions when the subject was before the country, on the question of Home Rule, and that they view with equanimity the possibilities of injustice to their co-religionists in. Ireland. I confess I was beginning to hold that opinion myself until I read an extract from the <i>British Weekly</i>, which reflects the opinions of English Nonconformity as in a mirror. On April 27 last that paper referred to this subject, and I will read this remarkable extract&#x2014;
<quote>"That Home Rule in the old Gladstonian sense will ever be curried, or ever proposed, we do not believe."</quote>
I confess it appears to me, after reading such an opinion, that if Ulster and the loyalists and Protestants in Ireland make the same forcible objections to Home Rule as they did in 1886 and in 1893 the knell of Gladstonian Home Rule will have sounded, and with it the knell of His Majesty's present Government. I do not suppose for one moment that the Government will be much influenced by what I say, but although I am a staunch opponent of Home Rule and absolutely against the policy of disruption, I also consider myself a Liberal. I do most earnestly venture to hope, therefore, that the Government will pay heed to the breakers which lie ahead of them.<lb/>
Many people say that the objection to Home Rule in Ireland is beginning to diminish. I understand that such a belief is hugged by many Liberals, on the principle, no doubt, of the wish being father to the thought. I confess that in the South and West of Ireland the objections heard against Home Rule are no longer as loud as they were fifteen or twenty-five years ago. But under the rule of a Liberal Government during the last five or six
<col>250</col>
years the local Camorra, whether it be the United Irish League or the Ancient Order of Hibernians, has gained such a hold that no small local Unionist would dare to air his opinions. In the North of Ireland, however, things are entirely different. I am deeply interested in this subject, and I have been making inquiries lately as to time possible chances of any Home Rule Bill being successful in the state of public opinion existing in Ireland at the present moment. I confess that the result of my inquiries has not been very promising. The lower classes of Nationalist opinion at this moment believe that Home Rule is inevitable. They are now beginning to say what they think, because they believe that Home Rule cannot be stopped. Certainly the result of my inquiries is that the feeling which existed in 1893 has again begun to assert itself&#x2014;namely, that Home Rule means the millennium, when all loyalists are to be put aside from their property, and their liberties, even their lives, are to be the sport of the public. I could give examples, but I understand that many of your Lordships think that enough has been said about Home Rule in this debate, and therefore I will curtail my remarks as far as possible on this subject.<lb/>
I must touch, however, on the question of the North of Ireland, because the North is only now beginning to realise how immediate the danger of Home Rule is. There are many people who believe that a separate Ulster Parliament would be a solution of the difficulties of Home Rule, and I confess myself that when one first looks at it it would seem, as far as England is concerned, an easy way out of the difficulties which lie before us. I believe the idea was mooted to the Ulster leaders, but with the exception of a few weaklings it was at once refused even consideration by those whose influence counts in Ulster. All over Ireland the Protestants and the loyalists have for years married and inter-married. The ties of blood are very strong, and Ulster Unionists believe strongly that "United we stand, divided we fall," and that to accept an Ulster Parliament at the expense of the remainder of Ireland would be a gross act of betrayal of which they would never be guilty.<lb/>
Now we come to another question which His Majesty's Government will have to consider; that is, the action Ulster will take if Home Rule is forced upon Ireland
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0130"/>
<col>251</col>
without the consent of the predominant partner. Are we to believe that Ulster will accept it peacefully? I do not think so, and I do not think either that we ought to imagine that Ulster should reasonably consent to be placed under the Nationalist yoke.<lb/>
Ulster has not yet properly awakened to the fact that Home Rule is upon her. Is it wonderful that she has not clone so? I would remind your Lordships of something which occurred during the South African war. There were battles fought which ended in disaster to the British arms. During those battles English, Scottish, and Irish soldiers were dying on the veldt, and English, Scottish, and Irish homes were rendered desolate by the bereavements which fell upon them. While these things were happening the chosen representatives of Ireland cheered the news of English reverses. Is it wonderful that Ulster is slow to realise that for the sake of political advancement, as some of us believe, the British Government is willing to hand over the lives and liberties of Irish loyalists to the very men who cheered the tidings of English disasters? Some people say that the idea of resistance by Ireland&#x2014;of armed resistance shall we call it?&#x2014;would be impossible, and that it would be suppressed at once by the forces of the Crown. There are others who believe that by such suppression Ulster would gain, from the fact that in her defeat she would secure the very object for which she fought. This question has been asked, I believe, in another place, and I only hope we may get a serious answer to it. If Ulster does resist, what are His Majesty's Government going to do? Are they going to send British troops to shoot down loyalists and Protestants in Ireland for the sake of men who cheered our defeats in South Africa? I do not think so. I do not think any Government would dare to do that. It would send them into the wilderness, from which they would not return for many a long day; because I am convinced that the people of England would not sit quietly by and see their fellow loyalists in Ireland shot down merely in order to gratify the wishes of men such as I have described.<lb/>
I think your Lordships must be almost tired of the question of Home Rule, and therefore I will cut short my remaining remarks. In conclusion, I would ask you
<col>252</col>
who belong to the Unionist Party to remember that noble Lords from Ireland are among the few existing Parliamentary representatives of Irish Unionism and Irish loyalty. We have our duty before us. It is a duty that we cannot and will not betray. Through every argument and every Division right up to the end we will fight this matter. We will fight the question of Home Rule until it has been decided by the opinion of the predominant partner. We turn to the Unionist Party, not only with hope, but with confidence, for the name of the Unionist Party explains the reason for its existence; and we believe that because of the reason for its existence the Unionist Party is in honour bound to fight Home Rule to the very end.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00451"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in rising to support the Amendment moved by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition I shall, in view of the discussions which have already taken place, confine my remarks to what I conceive to be the main object of this Amendment. The Amendment provides the only means of securing under the Parliament Bill that the will of the people shall prevail. I know that the Parliament Bill professes to be based on the same principle&#x2014;on the desire to give effect to the wishes of the people. It had its birth in the Resolution which was brought forward in the House of Commons by the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman in 1907, in which great stress was laid on this question of giving effect to the will of the people. But the Parliament Bill is not a Bill to give effect to the will of the people. It is not even a Bill to give effect to the will of the House of Commons. It is merely and solely a Bill to give effect to the will of the Cabinet of the day, a small body not directly elected by the House of Commons or by the electors of the country. This was indirectly admitted by the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, this evening when he got up I think principally with the view of suppressing the insurrection which was inclined to break out on the Benches behind him. Some noble Lords opposite, showing an independence of spirit not very pleasant to noble Lords on the Front Bench, manifested a great desire to express themselves in strong terms in favour of the Referendum as an absolutely democratic necessity under the provisions of this Bill.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0131"/>
<col>253</col>
It is true that the noble Viscount denied, as he was bound to do as a Party man, that the Government were introducing single-Chamber government. But did he adduce a single argument in support of that bare statement? He admitted that the independence of the private Member in the House of Commons was disappearing every day. I might point out that the independence of the private Member will disappear a great deal quicker when members of the House of Commons are paid an annual salary. In saying this I am not casting any reflection on the character of any member of the House of Commons, because my remark would apply just as much under the same circumstances to your Lordships' House or any other House. The noble Viscount did admit that the independence of the private Member was fast disappearing and that the power of the Executive was daily increasing&#x2014;in fact, that the Cabinet, commanded the votes of its supporters. If that is admitted, and if this House under the Parliament Bill has not the power to refer a single measure to the people of this country, then I ask, How on earth can anybody say that His Majesty's Government are not introducing single Chamber government?<lb/>
Now, under the Amendment of the noble Marquess the electors of the country may be called in to give their decision upon legislation affecting their interests, and that really is what the Government take exception to. The Prime Minister mainly bases his case on the assumption that the House of Commons represents the electorate at any rate during the first two or three years of its existence. If so, why did Radicals, including Mr. Asquith himself, only a few years ago go all over the country denouncing the Unionist, Government for proceeding with the Education Bill of 1902? I am not going to discuss that Bill or to argue either in its favour or against it, but I desire to point out to your Lordships that that Bill was introduced within two years of the General Election which placed a Unionist Government in power. Therefore it would appear that when a Unionist Government is in power the House of Commons does not, even during its first two years, represent the will of the people. Perhaps I might be permitted to ask the noble Viscount who is in charge of this Bill whether he wishes the House
<col>254</col>
to understand that the representation of the will of the people is confined to those periods when a Liberal Government happens to be in power. At any rate, I think the noble Viscount will agree with me that nothing gave rise to more bitter complaint on the part of the Radicals than the passing of the Education Bill in 1902.<lb/>
Perhaps I might ask the noble Viscount whether he has considered this fact, that had the Parliament Bill, with the Amendment now under consideration incorporated in it, been in force in 1902, the Education Bill of the Unionist Government would without any doubt have been submitted to the electors of the country by means of the Referendum. The noble Viscount will hardly dispute that statement. By the Amendment of the noble Marquess, in fact by the whole proceedings of the Opposition during the discussions on this Constitutional question, I claim that we have shown a real desire to give the people that say in the legislation of the country to which they are entitled. When the Government speak of the will of the country they speak merely of the will of the Radical Government, subject, perhaps, at the present moment, to the will of Mr. Redmond. The right rev. Prelate the Bishop of Ripon this evening asked whether no <i>modus vivendi</i> could be brought about. It is very simple. This Amendment of the noble Marquess does not interfere in any way with the objects with which this Bill was avowedly brought forward. The noble Marquess assents to the Government's proposals so long as some real provision is made for securing that the will of the people shall prevail.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00452"><member>THE EARL OF WICKLOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel the greatest reluctance in venturing to address your Lordships, because you have already listened with great patience to many speeches on this subject, and it seems almost impossible that anything new can be left to be said. A great number of the speeches which have been made have come from noble friends of mine from Ireland, and I think you may perhaps have heard nearly enough about the Irish part of this question. But with your kind indulgence I should like to say one or two words in support of this Amendment, because although I am not very much in love with the principle of the Referendum I recognise in the proposals of the noble
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0132"/>
<col>255</col>
Marquess an attempt to rid this Bill of some at any rate of its most objectionable features.<lb/>
It has always seemed to me that His Majesty's Government, in trying to make out that they have been compelled to introduce this Bill by the attitude which they say your Lordships have adopted towards Liberal legislation, do not correctly represent the circumstances of the situation. As a matter of fact that is not so much a reason for their action as an excuse. I cannot believe that His Majesty's Government, in their heart of hearts, are really in favour of these extraordinarily revolutionary proposals. I think they are propelled by a force which they have not the strength to resist. We have heard the boast that His Majesty's Government would be made to toe the line, and your Lordships now have the opportunity of seeing with what dexterity they are able to perform that not very dignified evolution. There can be very little doubt in anybody's mind that this Bill has been introduced at the bidding of Mr. John Redmond and in order to secure for His Majesty's Government the votes of his army of supporters in another place. I have been very much strengthened in this opinion by the remarks which fell from the noble Viscount in charge of the Bill, and I have heard nothing whatever from noble Lords opposite which tends in any way to remove from my mind that impression.<lb/>
The noble Viscount expressed himself as most indignant at the idea that your Lordships should venture to interfere in any way with a proposal to give a measure of Home Rule to Ireland I am not in the least surprised at the noble Viscount's indignation. I am very sympathetic with his feelings in this matter, because it would be dreadful for the noble Viscount and for his colleagues if your Lordships were to succeed by any means in preventing the Government from carrying out instructions which they have doubtless received from the dictator of their policy. I would like your Lordships to consider for a moment what manner of men these Irish Nationalists are for whom it appears this tremendous Constitutional change is to be taken in hand. The Irish Nationalist Party is that Party which, as your Lordships have been reminded, openly rejoiced during the South African War at British reverses. It is that Party whose leaders stood by when
<col>256</col>
outrages were taking place all over Ireland, or in many parts of Ireland, and did not lift a finger in protest, although I believe if they had said the word that disgraceful state of things would have been brought to an end. These are the men whose national aspirations noble Lords opposite seem so anxious to further, and at whose word your Lordships and the people of this country are asked to believe that by granting Home Rule to Ireland that country will be transformed into the most contented, prosperous, and loyal portion of His Majesty's Dominions. I have lived all my life in Ireland and my home is there. I have not been what the noble Viscount calls an absentee, and I am quite certain that I and many like me, if we could think for one moment that Home Rule was likely to have such a result, would be Home Rulers to-morrow, and would leave no stone unturned to bring about so desirable a result. But we are convinced that Home Rule would have no such result, but would plunge our unfortunate country into bankruptcy and into the hands of a corrupt and probably tyrannous Government.<lb/>
It seems to me that noble Lords opposite, in common with many eminent, honourable, and patriotic gentlemen in this country, base their view on this question upon a total misapprehension of the motive power which is behind the Home Rule movement. It must be borne in mind that among the people of Ireland a very large proportion are not only not in favour of, but are most bitterly opposed to, Home Rule in any shape or form. And is it by any means certain that all those who call themselves Nationalists are in their heart of hearts in favour of setting up a National Parliament in Dublin I think not. Your Lordships will be able to decide that there is grave doubt whether they are so keen on Home Rule by the speeches which you have heard delivered by my noble friends from Ireland. If we want to arrive at the mainspring of the Home Rule movement we must look, not to Ireland, but to where the money comes from which supports the Irish Nationalist Party. We must look to the avowed enemies of England abroad, and to those men, or the descendants of those men, who emigrated from Ireland at a time when there was some cause to complain of British misrule in that country, and who no doubt took with them into exile a bitter and rancorous hatred of
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0133"/>
<col>257</col>
England and everything English. Those men are, I think, ready and willing to give their moral and financial support to any movement which may lead to the humiliation of England and the disintegration of the Empire. And surely they have not got far to look for such a movement. It must be clear to them that if they can bring about the passage into law of a Home Rule Bill they will have inserted the thin end of the wedge of separation; and if they can bring about the separation of Ireland from England they will have driven the first nail into the coffin of the British Empire. I know this is a view which has often been looked upon as an extreme one&#x2014;as the view of an alarmist. But it is my conviction, and I think I am not alone in holding that the Irish Home Rule movement is the outward and visible sign of a secret but none the less real conspiracy against this Empire, and of a danger which it behaves your Lordships and the people of this country to take into the most careful consideration.<lb/>
It can never be sufficiently regretted that no compromise on this great Constitutional issue could be arrived at. I do not know whether it is now too late, but I am inclined to agree with the noble Lord who said that he believed it might not be too late even at the eleventh hour. Even now, if His Majesty's Government would honestly give their great collective ability to the consideration of this problem, I believe they would not fail to arrive at some scheme of compromise which would be acceptable to both great Parties in the State, and which might lay the foundation of a permanent settlement of this great controversy. If they brought about that settlement they would deserve not only the gratitude of the whole nation but of generations of Englishmen yet unborn. On the other hand, my Lords, it may be, and I daresay it is, in their power to force the passage into law of every letter of this Bill, if they decide to take that course, to bang and bolt the door on compromise and turn a deaf ear to all arguments which may be addressed to them, to insist on their pound of flesh and on paving the way to the Home Rule Bill which I believe they have in contemplation, they will most likely be remembered in history as the Government which were so fond of power and so afraid of losing their offices and emoluments that they sold the Constitution of their country to their country's most bitter foes.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00453"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ASHTOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was not in the House last night and can only gather what was said from the Press, so that if I repeat facts which have been already stated I hope I shall be forgiven. As regards the Amendment we are discussing, there are two points with which I do not agree. I should prefer that Home Rule was in a separate Amendment, so that the people could understand that it was an Amendment against Home Rule for Ireland pure and simple. Secondly, I am not entirely in favour of referring matters of State to a Joint Committee. I think it would be reasonable enough to appeal to the country without the assistance of any Joint Committee. As an Irish Peer I speak freely on Home Rule, and I hope your Lordships will not be bored too much. It is very difficult for people not living in Ireland to understand Ireland, and I think a great many of your Lordships know very little about that country.<lb/>
First of all, in considering Ireland we have to remember that there are three forces in that country. There is the United. Irish League, backed up by some secret societies which are really the driving force behind it; the Catholic Church; and the English Government, which I am sorry to say is the weakest of all in enforcing its power. That is where the misfortune of Ireland lies. The majority of the people of Ireland, I believe, do not want Home Rule, but unless you live among them and know the tyranny of the League you cannot understand why they call themselves Home Rulers. It is simply and solely because they are in fear of their lives, of outrage and of tyranny, that they have declared for Home Rule. In their heart of hearts I am sure they do not want it. Twenty per cent. drive the rest. That is one thing to be considered. Another thing is, Who are these Irish Members who are forcing Home Rule on the English Parliament? They are the nominees, first, of the United Irish League, who press them forward, and, secondly, of the Irish Americans, who pay down the money.<lb/>
As an Trish Unionist who has lived constantly in the country, who has had a great experience of living in it, I should like to say why we do not like the idea of Home Rule. I am sorry the noble Lord, Lord MacDonnell, is not here to-night.
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0134"/>
<col>259</col>
From a report of his speech yesterday I understand that he said that there was no disloyal majority, and that we heard too much of the loyal minority. To a certain extent I am with him there. The large majority of the people who pretend to be disloyal have to do so because they are compelled. It is like it is on the question of Home Rule; they are driven by about twenty per cent., perhaps less, of the population, who are led by the agitators and hacked by the League and secret societies. To a certain extent, therefore, there is not the disloyal majority you hear about, but the unfortunate thing is that these people have not the backbone to stand out against the agitators.<lb/>
I have referred to the forces in Ireland. The League is undoubtedly the chief force in Ireland. Another is the Catholic Church. I do not wish to touch on religion, but the Catholic Church is a force which cannot be ignored. I am not sure whether Lord MacDonnell said there was no intolerance, or whether there would be no intolerance under Home Rule. Anyone who looks into the matter will see that there is both political and religious intolerance. I will take first political intolerance. I have here the figures as well as I can get them. In 1900 the county councils outside Ulster returned 131 Unionists. I have not got the figures for 1903, but in 1906 they returned only 23 Unionists instead of 131, and in 1909 they returned only 16 Unionists. That does not look as if intolerance was disappearing, but rather the opposite. I have not the figures of the last election, but I have the figures of the Kildare County Council. In County Kildare there are 54,000 Roman Catholics and 8,700 Protestants. What is the representation? There are 27 Nationalists, 2 of whom are Protestants but they are Protestant Home Rulers, and there is 1 Conservative whose religion is not stated. Then look at the sub-committees of the county council. On the county infirmary committee there are 7 Catholic laymen, 1 Bishop, and 3 priests, but not a single Protestant. On the education committee there are 4 Catholic laymen and 2 priests.<lb/>
I now come to what we may describe as religious intolerance. There is a certain organisation of which I am not a member and of which I do not altogether approve called the All-for-Ireland League, which
<col>260</col>
aims at uniting Protestants and Roman Catholics-in fact, at conciliation. What was said by Father Lillis on June 19 in discussing this question? He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Unless Mr. O'Brien is suffering from some extraordinary delusion he must know in his heart that all this loud-sounding talk about conciliation, the weeding out of the Old Guard, the creation of a new Heaven and a new earth, is the merest rant &#x2026; He tells us that he wants Home Rule, and wants conciliation&#x2014;two things that are absolutely incompatible, that will not coalesce any more than oil with water. If he wants to have conciliation he cannot have Home Rule. If lie wants Home Rule, he must let conciliation go by the Board. He can only be either one thing or the other. He cannot by any possibility be both."</quote>
That is what we must expect if we get Home Rule. I have other speeches here but I do not wish to quote more than I need to your Lordships.<lb/>
I am afraid I shall differ a little from the Unionist Front Bench, but I cannot help it for I must say what I think. This is an occasion for every noble Lord to say what he thinks whether his own Front Bench likes it or not. To my mind this question of Home Rule has largely been kept up by both Front Benches trying to conciliate the other Party, and I must say I blame the Unionists rather the more of the two. I dare say my fellow Irish Peers do not agree with me, but I see what is going on in Ireland. What did the Unionist Government do in order to conciliate Ireland? They gave local government. The result is that the Unionists are put out of place altogether, and immense strength has been given to the Nationalists. Local government has greatly helped them to break the law. The chairmen of the county councils have all become magistrates. Under the Land Purchase Act, with which I do not altogether agree, landlord magistrates are leaving the country and the Benches are being packed up to the hilt by Nationalist magistrates who are there simply and solely not to enforce the law. Indeed, many of those magistrates are there for no other reason than that they have broken the law. I have sat on a Bench with men who have been tried for murder. One man I know went to America because he had embezzled money; when he came back he was promptly made chairman of a local authority and sits on the Bench to-day. How is the law to be enforced when you have Benches like that? It is almost impossible to get men sent to
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0135"/>
<col>261</col>
trial, and if they are convicted the fines are ridiculous. I do not wish to say too much against my own Party, but this is what has happened and it ought to be considered.<lb/>
I must touch on land purchase. No doubt in many cases people who bought their farms are settling down, but in a great many cases they are doing nothing of the sort. If you read the local papers, as I do regularly, you will find that many have sold their farms before paying the Government a sou. Yesterday I actually came across a case where a man signed an agreement, departed for America, and left his address for the money to be sent to New York. I do not think that is the object of the Act. It has also broken up a large number of the grass farms of Ireland, which are not tilled at all and could not possibly be tilled. The people who rush for the grass farms are simply turning them into cash and going away with the money. There is another thing which you must remember&#x2014;it was referred to tonight. The Irish people are not of one race. They are of a very mixed race indeed. They are partly Teutonic, and the others are Celtic, and the grievance comes from the Celts, simply because they cannot live up to the standard of the Teutons. Is it right that the descendants of the Teutons who settled there under the English Government should be threatened because they have been loyal to the Crown? You have no right to lower the highest of the population down to the level of the lowest. You cannot do it unless you want to ruin the country. I do not consider that the present House of Commons represents the British electorate. Without a redistribution of seats it is not fair to say that the English people have expressed themselves in favour of Home Rule passing into law. If after a redistribution of seats the question is put to the country we shall have to take our chance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00454"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to detain your Lordships with a speech. I only wish to refer to one or two points which have arisen in the debate and of which I have made notes, because it seems to me they have been overlooked in the replies which have been made. First of all, I should like to make some answer to my noble friend Lord Weardale, whose frank and courageous speech
<col>262</col>
appealed to me as a Liberal of the old school and a believer in those principles which he so eloquently set forth. But it seems to me that my noble friend fell into a very serious error, and I think it important to refer to it because it is an error which has been repeated in many authoritative quarters and into Which I think my noble friend was betrayed by the example of his political leaders. He said that we were discussing this Constitutional question because, for the first time in its history, the House of Lords rejected a Budget. That, my Lords, to say the least of it, is chronologically incorrect. This Veto policy on which the Parliament Bill is founded was conceived and submitted to Parliament long before there was any question of the Budget of 1909&#x2014;long before that Budget had even germinated in the brain of its author. How, then, can my noble friend say that it is on account of our rejection of that Budget that we are now discussing this Veto policy when this policy was based on the Resolutions of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and we have been told over and over again in this House that it is of still more ancient origin?<lb/>
There are other errors underlying that statement to which I think it worth while to refer, because a very similar statement has been made by the noble Viscount the Leader of the House, and no doubt it is intended that it should be repeated all over the country. The suggestion is that during the 800 years of its existence the House of Lords has never rejected a Budget until 1909. Your Lordships know, but a very large number of people in the country do not know, that Budgets have only existed for fifty years or so. Before that time there were only Money Bills, and this House has not only rejected but amended Money Bills. If you fall short of a statement to that effect I say you are not putting the case fairly before any audience in the country. That is all I wish to say in answer to my noble friend, unless I may venture to refer to this remark which he made. He said he believed that the people of this country had made up their minds absolutely&#x2014;and he used the word "absolutely" with great emphasis&#x2014;that the control of finance should rest entirely in the hands of the popular Chamber. I do not believe, if I may express my own opinion as he did his, that the people of this country have made up their minds any
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0136"/>
<col>263</col>
more absolutely on that question than they have on ally other. The whole essence of our political life is change. The people of this country have often changed their minds on this or on that question, and so I do not think it is a very safe thing to say that the people of this country have made up their minds absolutely.<lb/>
The noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War paid me the compliment of singling me out for a derisive remark when I ventured, among others, to smile at one of the more humorous portions of the lecture on political science with which he favoured this House, so perhaps I may say a word in reply to him. He told us that you cannot submit a Bill to the people, the suggestion being that the people are not capable of forming an opinion on a single measure. I hope I did not misunderstand him. But almost in the same breath he described to us, in picturesque and interesting language, how Members of Parliament belonging to the political Party which is in power go down to their constituencies with Bills in their pockets which they discuss and explain, as he seemed to suggest., in a homely kind of manner to their constituents, clause by clause. They thus obtain general approval for the principles of those measures and a mandate to carry them out in the House of Commons. Surely those two statements are rather inconsistent. If the people can form an opinion which is worth taking in discussing several Bills with their candidates or Members of Parliament, surely it is hardly fair to say that they would not be able to do so in regard to any one measure which might be submitted to them by some system of reference to the people. But I dare say if I pressed the noble Viscount we should find he was still further inconsistent in this matter. No doubt he claims&#x2014;I am sure he will not deny it&#x2014;that the people of this country have approved of this Parliament Bill which we are discussing. Is that so? Silence they tell me signifies assent. The noble Viscount evidently does claim that the people of this country approve the Veto Bill. Then why in the name of fortune does he say they will not be able in future to approve similarly of any particular measure which may be referred to them?<lb/>
I come now to the actual Amendment which we are discussing, and as there is such a paucity of speakers on the other side
<col>264</col>
it is very difficult to find material for criticism and repartee. I am therefore obliged, very reluctantly, to address myself to so formidable an opponent as the Leader of the House, Lord Morley. He said that this Amendment was no Amendment at all; that it was a direct and plain traverse of the Bill. I must confess that that criticism greatly astonished me. From our point of view, and I believe I can speak for others in this respect, the position is this. The Government in their Bill have made a rule as to the manner in which legislation is to be dealt with. We on this side of the House say, "You have the power to force this upon us, but we suggest to you that there should be an exception to your rule, or that there should be a certain class of exceptions. "It is a homely saying that exception proves the rule. There are very few rules which do not admit of an exception, and I think it is in accordance with the whole spirit of popular opinion in this country that in all our institutions there should be reasonable exceptions, and that is all we are asking His Majesty's Government to do in this respect.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, having in that somewhat unsatisfactory manner disposed of the Amendment, proceeded to describe the principle of the Bill. I hope I shall not be misquoting the noble Viscount, but I understood him to say that after two years of discussion the opinion of the House of Commons does represent and may be presumed to represent the will of the people. Would the noble Viscount adhere to that theory in all circumstances? Would he be willing that it should be put to any test? Take one of the most recent cases. The House of Commons by a majority of three to one, after discussion for more than two years, approved of the principle of female suffrage. Does he maintain that that decision represents and may be presumed to represent the will of the people at the present time? It would, I think, require a great deal of courage to say so.<lb/>
Then the noble Viscount went on to say that the mere fact that we endeavoured to discharge our ordinary legislative functions by proposing Amendments to this Bill implied distrust of the House of Commons, and he said it in a tone and manner which would really lead one to believe that lie regarded distrust of the House of Commons as a sort of sacrilege. Does he trust the House of
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0137"/>
<col>265</col>
Commons in all circumstances? Does he trust the House of Commons when a Unionist Government is in power? Trust and confidence surely must be reciprocal. It is impossible as between Governments and bodies of men to trust those who obstinately refuse to come to any arrangement. There must be a system of mutual confidence and reciprocal trust. It seemed to me that what the noble Viscount was driving at was to assert some sort of new theory of the Divine right of the House of Commons. He did not, of course, say so in so many words, but the whole tendency of his remarks led one to believe that that was the sort of idea he had in his mind. Any such theory would, I believe, be as abhorrent to the people of this country as was in former days the theory of the Divine Right of Kings. But what struck me most, not only on this but also on other occasions, was that the attitude of the noble Viscount in asserting what I venture to think is his theory was exactly the same as the attitude of those who, in days gone by, asserted for their own ends the Divine Right of individual Monarchs, for it is clear that in his heart he has no great veneration for the object for which he pays the lip-service of servile adulation. He told us only a few days ago that there is nobody whom he can trust in the 'House of Commons to express an independent opinion, except possibly a few "cranks." He brands them as partisans and as puppets. There is an extreme inconsistency about this contempt for the House of Commons as a collection of individuals, and almost in the same breath this extreme adoration of it as an institution and this assertion of its Divine Right.<lb/>
I can well understand and sympathise with the feelings of the noble Viscount as a Commons man and as one who has had almost an unequalled experience of that House, an experience of which, unfortunately, I have not had even a small share. I can understand his sticking up for that House in every way and thinking there is nothing like it. But now that he has left the House of Commons and accepted a seat in your Lordships' House, and, more than that, since on him has devolved the leadership of this House, I say that he does owe something to this House as an ancient institution which has been for eight centuries an integral part of the Constitution and of Parliament. There is, however, no trace of such respect in his language. He is always saying that
<col>266</col>
we must not criticise or distrust but show unquestioning respect to the House of Commons, but there is no corresponding exhortation in regard to this House. It is difficult to resist the impression that he despises this House even more than he does the House of Commons so far as independence and that sort of thing is concerned. We on this side of the House do not believe in the Divine right of individual Monarchs or of any Assembly. If we believe in any Divine right at all or in anything which could be called a Divine right, it is the Divine right of the people, and it is that which we are endeavouring to assert; but it is not a term we ourselves would use, it is not an idea which should tinge or influence anything we say.<lb/>
What we feel is that the House of Commons no less than the House of Lords is the servant of the people, and it is the people who in the end must decide. But what is the good of Parliament for national purposes if there is to be no effective debate, and if debate is to have no result? Yet it seems it is that to which we have come. I will not venture to comment on the changes which have taken place in another place, but here we are arguing until we are all exhausted and it would seem we cannot make the slightest impression. His Majesty's Ministers do not seem to be susceptible to argument. They do not seem to think it is reasonable that they should give way in the slightest degree, and I must say it is that more than anything else which fills many of us with despair as to the ultimate solution of this extremely grave, difficult and anxious problem.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00455"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would ask leave to make two preliminary observations before passing to the consideration of this Amendment or to the clause to which it refers. We have had a number of speeches from noble Lords on the other side of the House to support the Government, but not one of those speeches supported this Bill without some reservation. The reservation differed in degree. But there was not one single noble Lord who spoke from the Back Benches opposite who accepted this Bill without some reservation. The next observation I would make, and I make it with sincere respect and concern, is upon the absence of the Lord Chancellor from to-night's debate. The Lord Chancellor
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0138"/>
<col>267</col>
is not only one of the most distinguished Members of his Majesty's Government; he is not only one of the ablest debaters who has ever spoken in this House, but even on this side of the House, I may say, he is cherished by the whole of us as a possession of this House, and not of his own Party alone. But here, on the most critical night of the most critical debate of the most critical Bill that has ever been before Parliament, the Lord Chancellor is absent the whole evening. I can only attribute it to the fact that he is not well. If that is so, I can only say that his indisposition will be a matter of sincere and real concern to all of us on this side of the House.<lb/>
No one can have listened to the debate to-day without feeling that the Referendum has come to stay in British politics. Some noble Lords opposite laugh, but I repeat that. It has been accepted with reluctance by my noble friend Lord Curzon. There are still many noble Lords who do not like it, but the Lord Chancellor, the Prime Minister, and the Secretary of State for War, every single one of them, after criticising the Referendum have been careful to make a reservation and say there are circumstances, or there may be circumstances, in which this would be an appropriate instrument to introduce into our Constitution. We hear no more of the difficulty of the machinery and of its application. The only question is the authority by which it may be invoked, the occasions on winch it is appropriate, and the circumstances by which its use should be safeguarded. That being so, I must say I listened to the speech of the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War with amazement. I very frequently have the misfortune to differ from him, but I never listen to a speech of his without feeling that he is illuminating the subject; that he has mastered it, and thoroughly understands the subject he is discussing. He will not, I trust, think I am impertinent when I say that to-night he left the impression on my mind that he had never studied the Referendum at all or the circumstances under which it is used. If he had done, most of his opinions might have been wholly changed and he would not have made the speech which he made to-night.<lb/>
The noble Viscount asked, as if it clinched the whole matter, what precedent is there
<col>268</col>
in civilised countries for introducing the use of the Referendum into representative institutions? I will answer that question presently. I will ask him another one now. What precedent is there in the Constitution of civilised countries for making the existence of one Chamber wholly dependent upon the will of another? I think the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War will find it much more difficult to answer that question than I shall find it to answer his. I hope your Lordships will pardon me, but I do desire to endeavour to remove the impression that Lord Haldane meant to create to-night&#x2014;that there really is no experience in civilised countries and great communities of a popular nature for the use of a Referendum. I would begin with the smallest and least important instance of its use that I know of. It was used in Natal, a very small British community, to decide whether Natal would accept the complicated Constitution which now is the Constitution of the Union of South Africa, but so thoroughly was that complicated document understood by the limited electorate of Natal that the majority voted in its favour in every constituency in Natal. Then, again, the Referendum has been used in South Australia and in Queensland, not as part of the Constitution, but to settle special difficulties which had perplexed the public mind for a series of years. In each case that difficulty was our old friend religious education. That question was settled by a Referendum <i>ad hoc</i>, both in South Australia and in Queensland.<lb/>
I pass on to the greatest of all the peoples of the earth in point of view of population and of wealth, and where no one can pretend that democracy is not the political idol of the people. I allude to the United States of America. The Referendum is no part of the Federal Constitution of America. As the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, knows quite well, each State of the American Union has an elaborate Constitution of its own, just as the United States has its Federal Constitution. The Referendum is an integral part of the Constitution of no fewer than 46 out of the 47 American States. In forty six of these States no change of any sort or kind can be made in the Constitution except after the will of the people has been signified at a Referendum. The use of the Referendum is not confined to Constitutional cases in some States. In a
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0139"/>
<col>269</col>
large number the Constitution has been enlarged so that other questions which approach more to our ordinary domestic problems at home must also be referred to the people in the form of a Referendum. I will give two instances&#x2014;the prohibition of liquor, and woman suffrage. In many States those and kindred subjects have to be dealt with by means of the Referendum.<lb/>
Then we come to what is the most remarkable case of all, and that is the case of Australia. Here the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, will forgive me for saying that obviously he has not looked up the Commonwealth Constitution lately. The Referendum in the Commonwealth is confined to one class of cases. No change can take place in the Constitution, even if both Houses of Parliament have agreed upon it, until it has been referred to the people in a Referendum. I will tell your Lordships how that has worked, and worked quite recently. Part of the original Constitution of Australia involved the distribution of revenue between the Commonwealth Government and the State. It was known as the Braddon Clause, and was a compromise which was to last ten years. The period of ten years has just elapsed. Just before it elapsed, Mr. Deakin, when Prime Minister brought in an amendment to the Constitution, according to which the Commonwealth was to pay to the State 25<i>s.</i> per head in permanent composition of the revenue they lost for ever. That proposal went through both Houses of the Australian Parliament; it went to the people, and the people rejected it on the ground that this was an arrangement "for ever," and therefore was settling the matter too quickly. A Labour Ministry came into power, and "Mr. Fisher, the present Prime Minister, who is now in England, brought in the same proposal, but limited it to ten years. That went to the Referendum and the people passed it.<lb/>
But the most extraordinary case occurred the other day. Your Lordships know that the Government of Australia is a Labour Government with very strong and clear views on the functions of the State in the social evolution of the people. As part of its programme it brought in a measure which I may roughly describe as giving power to the Commonwealth to nationalise
<col>270</col>
all monopolies. I express no sort of opinion on the merits of the measure, but; your Lordships will recognise from that description that it was of a very far-reaching and important character. That proposal passed through both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament, and then it had to go to the Referendum because it involved an alteration of the Constitution. That measure was thrown out by 240,000 votes, and so far from the people of Australia not understanding the question or taking an interest in it&#x2014;and, mind you, this Referendum was wholly divorced from a General Election and stood entirely by itself, the voters going to the poll on no other question&#x2014;out of just over four and a half millions of persons in Australia quite two millions of voters went to the poll. Your Lordships will pardon me for having given this answer to the speech of the noble Viscount, but what does it prove? What I have endeavoured to explain does not prove that the exact proposals that suit an American State or that suit Australia will suit us, but it does prove that the Referendum is a flexible instrument of democratic government which can be adapted in different countries to different conditions, without impairing either the true spirit of democracy or the man features of representative government. What we are endeavouring to do is not blindly to imitate somebody else's example, but to borrow a democratic weapon that they have found useful in Constitutional difficulties and apply it <i>mutatis mutandis</i> to the difficulties with which we find ourselves confronted.<lb/>
Before I pass on I wish to remind your Lordships of what has been from the beginning the whole basis and foundation of the case of the Government and the Liberal Party against the House of Lords. They have said that when the Liberals were in, power the will of the people was liable to be thwarted by the House of Lords. It is that contention that we have had mainly in mind, and our proposals have been drawn up with a view to removing that grievance. Your Lordships may or may not like the method, but it is quite obvious that if there is the power to send to the people a measure which has been rejected by this House it cannot be said that this House has prevented the will of the people from being fulfilled. But what I would point out is that the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, in his very strong desire to show the people of this
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0140"/>
<col>271</col>
country that no pride of House, of spirit, or of Party was going to stand between him and a national settlement, if such were possible, has gone far beyond that position and has told you in no uncertain terms that if you thought that by his proposals the balance was unfairly drawn between the two Parties he was willing and anxious to consider proposals for redressing that balance. I draw your Lordships' attention to that fact, because I do not think it can be too clearly explained to our fellow-countrymen. That being so, who can doubt that if the Liberal Party were willing a national settlement of this question is still possible? But, I say it in no spirit of Party malice but with deep and sincere regret, the Liberal Party are out, if possible, for a Party triumph. Under those circumstances it is incumbent upon us to restate our position quite clearly.<lb/>
There are two questions to be considered&#x2014;the permanent solution and the solution in connection with what I may call the transitional period. My noble friend Lord Lansdowne has shown quite clearly that we are prepared to unite with the Party opposite in a reconstruction of this House in a manner fair to both Parties. For such a House he has claimed those powers which are the attributes of Second Chambers all the world over. He has expressed in the clearest terms our willingness by way of Conference, Joint. Sessions, and, in exceptional cases, by Referendum, to make deadlocks between the two Houses impossible. But now about the transitional period, the period during which this Bill is to operate unamended and before any reconstruction has taken place in your Lordships' House. It is in relation to that transitional period that we are discussing Lord Lansdowne's Amendment to-night. The terms of it, the conditions of it, have been so thoroughly and completely debated that I should be only wasting time if I repeated them. The answer of noble Lords opposite is really this. I am talking of the Front Bench. They say that the Referendum in any shape or form is not compatible with representative institutions. We say that it is compatible. That is a matter of opinion; but I ask this House, and I ask the country, Is it not better that representative institutions should be somewhat modified, so as to admit into the Constitutional practice of this country the occasional working of the Referendum, rather than that the country should be liable for an indefinite period to the passing
<col>272</col>
of measures which the majority of the electors do not desire to see become law? That is the danger, and the Government have evaded it. They have pooh-poohed it. They have never faced that position like statesmen. And what is the indictment made by their own supporters? It is that under this Bill as it stands measures may be passed and our institutions destroyed against the wishes of the majority of the people.<lb/>
Noble Lords opposite have over and over again protested that the House of Commons has frequently passed measures which the country did not desire. But when we ask them whether it is not true that the House of Commons under this Bill could destroy this House or perpetuate its own tenure of life, all they say is, "Is it really possible that these things could happen? Do you think that we who sit on this Bench would ever connive at such an abuse of authority"? I do not think that either the noble Viscount or the Lord Chancellor would do the one thing or the other. But I ask them, Do they know who are going to sit on those Benches and on the corresponding Benches in the House of Commons in the years to come? How are they going to answer for the future? It is as trustees that they should deal with this remodelling of the Constitution. If in their private capacity as trustees they handed over an unlimited series of blank cheques to the servants of the trust, on the ground that they knew their present character and had implicit confidence in them, the law would call that fraudulent trusteeship. How can the same practice be right on the part of statesmen who are occupying the greatest positions that the world offers to private individuals? They do not know who are going to sit on the Government Benches in the future; and yet they propose to put into the hands of unknown men in the future powers that will lend themselves to the grossest abuse. I have said with complete sincerity what I feel about noble Lords who are here to-night. But there are men amongst us even now whom I would not trust with these powers, no, not the length of their own modesty. If democracy is capable of being abused to the extent to which I have suggested, then I submit it is no longer a form of government to be respected. It becomes only an organised hypocrisy. Democracy means the rule of the majority. This Bill puts it in the power of the minority to coerce the majority. That is our indictment against this Bill.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0141"/>
<col>273</col>
We have been told over and over again from the Benches opposite, and we shall be told in the country, that the electors have approved of this clause and of this Bill. We do not admit that. We say it is not sufficient merely to print and publish a Bill in order that the electors may understand it. I desire no better explanation of the way they should understand it than that given by the noble Viscount opposite. A Bill must not only be printed and published but it must be discussed in Parliament and in the Press; and this Bill was not discussed for one single day in the House of Commons before the electors were asked to pronounce upon it. That is our view. It is not the view of noble Lords opposite. They think the Bill was sufficiently before the electors. I would take them for one moment on their own ground, and I would test it. They say that the electors had this Bill before them and approved it, but this Bill has on it the stamp from cover to cover of a temporary measure. If the electors did approve of it, they approved of a temporary measure, pending the time when His Majesty's Government remodelled this House and put on a fresh basis, and permanently, the relations between the two Houses. Is there the slightest chance of the Government doing anything of the kind? The noble Lord, Lord Weardale, in his speech to-night only said what we have all thought for a long time past&#x2014;that whatever the intentions of the Prime Minister and the Government may be, the majority of his Party in the House of commons do not intend to see this Bill touched again if it once becomes law.<lb/>
Apart from that, I wish to draw attention to the, from my point of view, sinister observations that fell from Lord Morley and from Lord Haldane. The noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, spoke of this Bill as stereotyping the unwritten permanent tradition of the relations between the two Houses of Parliament. That means that even if this House is reconstructed the relations between the two Houses are to remain the same as they are defined in this Bill. What is the use of reconstructing this House? Any House will do with the powers you leave us by this Bill. That position is not consistent with the spirit of the Bill as printed. The other noble Viscount, Lord Morley, when alluding to this subject&#x2014;I hope I am not mis-
<col>274</col>
representing him&#x2014;said that there might be some slight modification in this Bill resulting from the reconstruction of the House of Lords by the Liberal Party. I see that I have not altogether failed to represent his attitude. Therefore I say that, even supposing the electors approved of this Bill, they approved of a Bill which purported to commence a policy which the Government have no power, even if they had the intention, to fulfil.<lb/>
There is another argument in this connection of which I would remind your Lordships. According to the contention of noble Lords opposite, this Bill has been approved by the people because of the majority which their Party commands in, the House of Commons. What is the moral force behind that majority to carry out this movement? Go to the Library of your Lordships' House and look at the model there of the constituencies. What a paradox of democracy and representative government the distribution of seats is! You see an Irish constituency of 1,500 and an English one of 50,000. We are entitled, with the knowledge of the extraordinary accident which has favoured the Government in their majority, to go behind the returns to the House of Commons in this great national movement that has stirred the heart of the people on both sides and see how the votes were distributed. If we do that, the fact remains and cannot be controverted that half the electors, roughly speaking, support this side of the House. The position, therefore, is that you are endeavouring to change the whole Constitution of this country, not at the demand, or with the willing assent, of the great majority of the electors; but one half of the people of this country are trying to force their conception of the Constitution upon the other half. That fact absolutely denudes the proposals of the Government of any moral force.<lb/>
I wish to point out what this clause does as between the great powers of the United Kingdom, because in doing so I am showing at the same time the reasons for the Amendment of the noble Marquess. I think I shall be carrying all noble Lords opposite with me when I say that we are agreed that the sovereign power of government in this country resides in the Crown and in the people.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00459"><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: That really is the essence of the dispute between us. Lord Morley says that the power of government in this country rests with the Crown and Parliament. I say the Crown and the people. Parliament is the representative and servant of the people; the House of Commons, which is far more important, far greater in authority and procedure, than the House of Lords&#x2014;the House of Commons itself is nothing except as the servant of the people. That is our position.<lb/>
Now what is the effect of this clause on these several powers? The position of the Crown is made more precarious because it is deprived of the possible effective support of the House of Lords if a crisis ever arose such as noble Lords opposite no less than ourselves hope will never arise. The position of the House of Lords is made as precarious as it is possible for the position of any House of Parliament in the world to be made, because it could be treated in any manner which the House of Commons thought fit, or it could be abolished altogether by the action of the House of Commons alone, repeated three times in two years. The position of the electors, of the people, is also made precarious, not to the same extent, but for the first time since Parliamentary government has existed in this country, except with the sinister instance of the Long Parliament, it would be possible for the House of Commons to regulate the length of its own existence without any reference to the people at large. Therefore the influence of the people is rendered more precarious by this clause.<lb/>
And what about the House of Commons? I do not think it is any exaggeration to say that if this Bill becomes law the House of Commons will become the most unchecked, the most untrammelled, authority in the
<col>276</col>
whole world. I make no exception of Emperors or of any rulers of any sort or kind. In the whole of the civilised world I do not believe there will be any authority, single man or Chamber, so unchecked, so untrammelled, so absolutely autocratic if it chooses to exercise its powers as the position of the House of Commons will be under this Bill. That is what we call single-Chamber government. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, protests against that. He will not admit that that is a fair description of the effect of this Bill. I will, however, use another simile. I ask Lord Morley's special leave to make this simile, because I think it is a true one. I say that the House of Lords in future, if this Bill becomes law, will bear just as much resemblance to a true Second Chamber as the waxwork effigy of Lord Morley in Madame Tussaud's does to his own vigorous, intellectual, and charming personality.<lb/>
About this settlement of the Government there is nothing great, nothing national, nothing lasting. They have erected the Constitutional settlement as an idol, but the feet of that idol are of clay. That idol will not last. It will not stand. Our case is so strong, the case of the Government is so weak, that in the end our contention must prevail. If the Government for the moment succeed in erecting their idol it is the people of the country who will shatter it, and will shatter it in the early lifetime of many members of this House. We have endeavoured to show in this great crisis that we are not thinking only of Party. We have done all that men could to show the Party opposite that if they would meet us we would join in a national settlement. We have also tried to be absolutely straight with the electors of the country. Have the Government?</membercontribution></p>

The inquiry has been one of great labour by very distinguished persons, with a very satisfactory result. But considering the number of misstatements that have appeared in the public Press on this subject it is very desirable that we should have a public discussion with reference to it, and I hope that the noble Earl will take steps, next week if he likes, for the purpose of commencing a public consideration of this subject.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00500">The noble Lord said: My Lords, it will probably be recollected that at an early stage of our proceedings, upon an Amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Ancaster, the views embodied in this Amendment were put forward in the shape of a question addressed to His Majesty's Government, and I am bound to admit that the reply which was then received from one of the triumvirate who represent His Majesty's Government on this occasion was not of a favourable and encouraging nature. But I am emboldened to think that the proposals in this Amendment are so fair and reasonable and moderate that I am justified in again bringing them before the notice of His Majesty's Government in the hope&#x2014;possibly the vague and illusory hope&#x2014;that they will look upon them with a more favourable eve than on the last occasion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00501">This debate has, in one respect at all events, shown a considerable amount of monotony. Every noble Lord who has spoken from these Benches, without exception, has expressed the opinion that this Bill constitutes single-Chamber government. I think it not improbable that from mere force of habit I may myself, perhaps, say the same thing before I have finished. But the replies made by the representatives of the Government have been characterised by equal monotony, because whenever an Amendment has been moved from this side of the House it has invariably been rejected upon two grounds&#x2014;one, that it unduly interferes with the independence of the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0147"/>
<col>285</col>
House of Commons, and the other, to use the stereotyped phrase which is so common in Parliament, that it strikes at the root of the measure, the plain truth, devoid of all rhetorical embellishment, being that His Majesty's Government have been told by their so-called followers not to accept any changes whatever in this Bill, under threat of severe penalties.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00502">I submit that the Amendment which I am moving at the present moment cannot be fairly described either as sapping the independence of the House of Commons or as being in the nature of a root-cutting Amendment. As a matter of fact, it preserves the Bill intact in its pristine shape and beauty; and I should like to point out that it has this recommendation, that it is perfectly consistent with the Amendment which was carried by the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, last night, but should that Amendment not be carried into effect, with the alteration of a few words this Amendment is perfectly capable of standing by itself. We have been told, not once but on innumerable occasions, that this Bill in its present form represents the passionate desire of the British democracy, the British democracy being synonymous, of course, with the Liberal Party, although I am bound to say there does not appear to be any very passionate enthusiasm for the Bill amongst noble Lords who sit behind the representatives of the Government. I think the state of the Benches opposite at the present moment is a fair indication of the enthusiasm felt for this Bill. The Bill appears to resemble one of those delicate articles of export which suffer in the process of travelling. In the process of its journey from the House of Commons to this Chamber it appears to have lost a considerable amount of its attractions for a large proportion of noble Lords opposite, and. I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that on no occasion on which the Government have divided against an Amendment to the Bill have they mustered in the Division Lobby, unless reinforced by noble Lords from this side, as many Peers as have been created since the Liberal Government assumed office.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00503">Now, my Lords, this Bill represents more than the passionate desire of the Liberal Party for justice and fair treatment, or whatever it may be that they claim. It represents the climax, the quintessence I might say, of Liberal constructive states-
<col>286</col>
manship, and it is avowedly brought in to deal with a transitional state of things, which is only to last until a new Second Chamber is set up, to use the words of the Prime Minister, "as and when the proper time arrives." This Amendment of mine, as I have already said, leaves the Bill absolutely intact, and all that it provides is that any Bill which proposes to inflict further restrictions upon our legislative powers shall, at all events, not be passed until an opportunity has been afforded to the people, by means of a General Election, in the ordinary course of things to pronounce an opinion upon the subject, and to sanction the proposed change. The other day when I raised this particular point the noble and learned Viscount opposite, Lord Haldane, told us that he did not know any Party worth talking about, to use his own expression, who desired to tear up or to alter the Constitution. I cannot help thinking that the noble and learned Viscount must have made use of this phrase in order to illustrate and to emphasise the isolation in which members of this House are supposed habitually to dwell with regard to all political questions. Is it possible that the rarified atmosphere which the noble and learned Viscount has been inhaling since he became a member of this Assembly has blinded him to the existence of some prominent politicians to whom he owes, directly or indirectly, a good deal of support?</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00504">The Olympian ignorance of the noble and learned Viscount reminds me of the ignorance which is occasionally displayed by the Judicial Bench, and which I certainly disclaim owning myself. I do not live in the least in the same atmosphere as the noble and learned Viscount opposite. The existence of those politicians in whom he disbelieves is painfully evident to me. I have no illusions whatever on the subject, and I have not the smallest illusions as to what the feelings of such a man as Mr. Keir Hardie or Mr. Snowden are on this particular subject, however ignorant the noble and learned Viscount opposite may be. I know perfectly well that the opinion of these gentlemen&#x2014;an opinion which I do not think is shared by anybody in this House except my noble friend Lord Montagu of Beaulieu&#x2014;is that under this Bill we are treated in far too generous and kind a manner, that in fact we are getting a great deal more under the Bill than we probably deserve. It is just as well on
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0148"/>
<col>287</col>
these occasions to look facts in the face, and to assume the worst. I will do so on this occasion, and assume that this Bill becomes law. It does not require much of a prophet in order to anticipate what certainly will happen. I do not share the somewhat fanciful apprehensions of some of my noble friends who sit around me. I do not imagine that the Crown will be swept away, or that some of the terrific contingencies which alarm them will take place. But what I feel perfectly certain about is this, that if under this Bill we exercise the statutory power of delay to which we are entitled and which really is the only safeguard we still possess, there will be immediately an outcry for restricting and taking away possibly altogether the powers of delay which we possess under this Bill. I do not think the most sanguine optimist, no matter on which side of the House he may sit, can feel any sort of confidence that if a demand of that sort is put forward in the House of Commons there is any certainty that it will be resisted by noble Lords who are members of the Government at the present time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00505">Under this Bill we are placed&#x2014;I do not exaggerate in the least when I say so&#x2014;absolutely at the mercy of the House of Commons. We are placed in a position which, as the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, pointed out last night, it; not occupied by any Second Chamber in the civilised world, and there is absolutely nothing in this Bill to prevent, not only further restrictive powers being used against us, but our being practically abolished altogether. I do not think that this is a question which needs much elaborate argument. I have never used particularly strong language about this Bill, but I confess it seems to me a perfectly intolerable injustice that it should be possible, as it undoubtedly is possible, to utilise a Bill brought in for dealing with a temporary situation in such a way that it may permanently destroy such future rights as we are accorded under this Bill. After all, if you submit yourself to a dentist, and allow au opiate to be administered to you for the purpose of dealing with a tooth, you do not authorise the dentist to take out every single tooth in both your jaws. Yet that is the position in which we are deliberately placing ourselves under this Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00506">Whilst I cheerfully acquit noble Lords opposite of any desire or intention of using
<col>288</col>
the Bill in the way in which I have indicates, unfortunately we know perfectly well that noble Lords opposite are not masters in their own house. That being so, it seems to me that without asking anything abnormal we are absolutely justified in asking for some safeguards against the dangers which I hare endeavoured to indicate, and all I ask under this Amendment is that the powers of the House of Commons shall not be utilised to further deprive us of such powers as we enjoy under the Bill until at all events the opinion of the country has been taken upon the subject at a General Election in the normal course of things. In conclusion, I can only repeat that the proposal which I venture to make seems to me so modest, so reasonable, and so obviously fair, that it is almost a matter of surprise to me that the Government have not given some indication of dealing with us in this matter without an invitation from me or from anybody else on this side of the House. I beg to move.</p>

It is true that it goes very near to the points raised by the noble Earl, Lord Ancaster, which we discussed and dealt with. We parted from that Amendment on the understanding that it would be covered by discussion on the noble Lord's Amendment, and there it was left. Still I do not say for a moment that the noble Lord is not justified in presenting this Amendment, but I could indeed have wished, from the point of view of legislative business, that he had left out some of the decorative faceti&#x00E6;, which are quite harmless and with which we have become familiar. The noble Lord commented upon

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00509"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: What I said was that the number of Peers the noble Viscount was able to put into the Lobby last night did not amount to the number of Peers which have been created since the Liberal Government assumed office.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00510"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I will not discuss the bearings of the noble Lord's point, but, as a matter of fact, after one of those anxious scrutinies of the Division Lists which take place on both sides on the morning after an important Division, it appears that out of the forty-six noble Lords who voted against the Amendment twenty-seven only owed their Peerages to the present Administration. But that triviality of the noble Lord has no real bearing upon what is undoubtedly a serious Amendment. I admit that this Amendment is one of the very few Amendments&#x2014;I am not sure it is not the only one&#x2014;which does not directly contradict the fundamental principles of the Bill. But it is a very serious thing to go on piling up an indefinite number of new exceptions to the restrictions in the legislative power of the House of Lords. I say indefinite, because the words "further limitation of the legislative powers of the House of Lords" are vague and tremendously wide words. Everybody, and I am sure the noble Lord himself, will see that they are capable of an elasticity of construction which might undoubtedly involve a traverse of the principle of the Bill. On detail, as I have said, the words are vague and wide. But there are other points which, though they may be called technical, are of vital importance and which all make against the noble Lord's Amendment as it now stands.<lb/>
The noble Lord will pardon me for saying that his Amendment would create, or might create, a really absurd position. Supposing there had just been a General Election raising points not very far distant from the points mentioned in this Amendment&#x2014;if the noble Lord's Amendment were free from conjunction with the noble Marquess's Amendment there would be more to be said for it&#x2014;and that that election showed that the opinion of the electorate was in favour of the measure which the noble Lord has in view "further
<col>290</col>
limiting the legislative powers of your Lordships' House," then according to this Amendment&#x2014;notwithstanding that decision&#x2014;another General Election would have to follow which might or might not reverse the previous decision. If the Amendment as it now stands were incorporated in the Bill you might have the absurdity of forcing a second General Election within a very short and measurable distance of time from an election which was just over. That is a point which the noble Lord, with his practical experience and his shrewd judgment about elections, will see is a fatal point against his Amendment. I do not want to detain the Committee on drafting points, but, after all, drafting points are very important, and the Committee stage is the stage at which you have to look at them. It would be extremely difficult to say whether any particular Bill did or did not come within the description of a further limitation of your Lordships' powers. I would commend this to the noble Lord, that if he has any chance of further pushing forward his Amendment he had better include the definite points which he would consider as further limiting the legislative powers of this House. I take it that the points he has in mind are the three sessions, the two years, and the duration of Parliament. If I were in his place I should regard those, as I think he does, as being the points to be covered, and I would therefore have them specially dealt with. If Parliament were to adopt the policy of the noble Lord's Amendment it would be far better to limit it in the way I have indicated. The Amendment probably should not take effect in cases where there has been a General Election during three sessions. It is a most important point, and if the noble Lord had expected, which he tells us he did not, that the Government would accept the Amendment, the wording would have had to be, in these and other particulars which I will not dwell upon, more carefully guarded and more fully thought out. I merely mention that as a point which would have to be considered if the noble Lord could successfully persevere with his Amendment. But certainly at the present juncture, taking the Amendment in conjunction with Lord Lansdowne's Amendment&#x2014;which your Lordships have accepted by so enormous a majority but which we regard and must regard as fatal to the Bill&#x2014;it is impossible for the Government to accept the proposal of the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00511"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the course of his observations the noble Viscount took my noble friend Lord Newton to task for what he described as a triviality of which he had been guilty in the course of his speech. The triviality in question was a reference on the part of my noble friend to the very meagre support received by His Majesty's Government from the large number of Peers whom they have lately added to this House. The noble Viscount may consider that point a trivial one, but I can assure him that it is one which is attracting a great deal of attention out of doors. What are the facts? As far as I am able to ascertain, His Majesty's Government have added to this House since they took office in 1906&#x2014;I exclude from my calculations those Peers who were ex-Civil servants, Colonial Governors, and so on&#x2014;about forty Peers. What has happened since we have been in Committee on this Bill? The supporters of the Government have varied in number from forty-four to forty-eight, and taking the number who voted last night&#x2014;forty-six&#x2014;I find that only twenty-six came from the category of those newly-created Peers to whom my noble friend referred. That is a very striking illustration of the manner in which the old Liberal Party in this House has been dissipated by the policy of noble Lords opposite, and also of the very hesitating support which they are receiving even from those who have been most recently rewarded with Peerages for their political services. When the noble Viscount tells my noble friend that this is a triviality, may I venture to remind him that comments of exactly the same kind were made from the Bench opposite when, for various reasons into which I need not enter, the famous Resolution of my noble friend Lord Rosebery was supported in this House by a majority considerably below its usual strength. So I do not think that my noble friend was out of order in referring to that matter. I am bound to say that I congratulate my noble friend, whose eloquence I always admire, upon the fact that on this occasion he has produced more effect on the Front Bench opposite than any of us during this long discussion have been able to produce. For the first time, if I may quote a phrase with which the noble Viscount is familiar&#x2014;
<quote>"a ray of reason stole Half through the solid darkness of his soul."</quote>
The noble Viscount, in effect, admitted

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00512"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Not unjustifiable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00513"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: That is quite good enough. We never have risen so high in the noble Viscount's estimation as that. But beyond all that it would, indeed, be a perfectly monstrous and intolerable proposition that any Government should take advantage of a Bill of this kind for the purpose of altering the machinery of the Bill itself. That is my noble friend's point, and, as he truly said, his Amendment, far from being aimed at the root of the Bill, is intended to protect the Bill against innovators even more audacious than those who now sit on the Front Bench opposite. The noble Viscount's criticism, which we had some difficulty in following, was of a somewhat technical description. I think he pointed out and he probably pointed out successfully, that in some particulars my noble friend's Amendment might not fit in exactly with the scheme of the Bill, and particularly with the scheme of the Bill if we regard it as including the Amendment which your Lordships carried last night. Those really are technical difficulties, which could probably be overcome without much trouble. That being so, I would venture to suggest to my noble friend that he might consider what was said by the noble Viscount in regard to these technical difficulties and perhaps bring up his Amendment on the Report stage in a shape which would meet the objections urged by the noble Viscount opposite. These are really little more than drafting difficulties, and I feel sure they could be easily overcome.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>(3) The decision of the Joint Committee on any question so referred to them shall be final and conclusive for all purposes and shall not be questioned in any Court of Law.</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00517">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I do not often detain your Lordships for long, and as this matter has been so thoroughly thrashed out and I am fully aware that your Lordships desire this debate to be concluded to-night, I will detain you even a shorter time than usual in moving the Amendment that stands in my name. We now have to deal with the very important question of the composition and mode of appointment of the Joint Committee of which we have heard so much in the course of this discussion. That Joint Committee, let me remind your Lordships, will have to deal with two classes of subjects. In the first place, it will have to decide whether a Bill is or is not a Money Bill properly so-called. In the second place, it will have to deal with all the very important questions which are catalogued in the Amendment moved by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, to which your Lordships assented yesterday. Those two functions are distinct, and although I may, perhaps, be in error, I think I am right in saying that the attitude which His Majesty's Government have assumed in respect to them is not quite identical. If I am wrong in that respect, I shall, of course, be corrected. The difference may not be very great, but I think there is a difference which is appreciable.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00518">As regards the Committee fulfilling those functions which were set forth in the noble Marquess's Amendment yesterday, I understand, from what the noble Viscount the Leader of the House said, that he did not attach any importance to the composition of the Committee&#x2014;that he cared very little whether it was composed in the manner I have proposed, or in the manner which is about to be proposed by the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, became he objected to a Committee of any sort or kind. Therefore I think I may infer that any minor alterations in the mode of the composition or the appointment of the Committee would not appreciably affect the noble Viscount's
<col>294</col>
position. But as regards the functions of the Committee in respect to Money Bills, I hope and believe that I am not wrong in stating that the position is not quite the mine. The noble Viscount, indeed, did on the occasion of our dealing with Clause 1 of the Bill criticise very adversely the composition of the Committee which I proposed. I think&#x2014;though speaking from recollection I ant not quite sure&#x2014;that he also criticised the method of appointment. He further said that he entertained strong objections to the functions which the Committee would exercise, more especially executive functions, and he also criticised the method of putting the whole of this machinery into operation. Let me say at once that I am not going to deal with the last point now, because it will come under your Lordships' consideration after this Amendment has been dealt with. Although the noble Viscount did criticise all these points, I hope I am right in saying that he did not, in the case of the Committee to deal with Money Bills, discard so absolutely the proposal of a Joint Committee as was the case in dealing with the functions under the noble Marquess's Amendment. He left us, with regard to that at all events, some glimmer of hope that on this point he was open to conviction and persuasion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00519">I am all the more desirous of going on with this, because I cannot forget that we had a very distinct admission from the noble Earl, Lord Crewe, that the Government were not absolutely wedded to making the Speaker the sole arbiter as to Money Bills, and that they would be prepared to consider proposals for any reasonable tribunal to take the place of the Speaker. I think I am correct in saying that the noble Viscount in the course of his remarks said he fully adopted what the noble Earl promised, but he coupled it with the condition that he and his colleagues must be persuaded. That is a very natural condition, but at the same time a very onerous and almost leonine one, although I do not abandon all hope of being able to persuade him. Before I go further, I must allude to one episode in regard to Money Bills which has occurred in the course of this debate. In spite of the very explicit declaration that I made in my first speech, and in spite of the fact that similar declarations have been made by noble Lords behind me on the Front Opposition Bench, there still appears
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0152"/>
<col>295</col>
to be great misapprehension in the minds of noble Lords opposite and of the public generally as to what we are really aiming at in reference to dealing with Money Bills. There appears to be a suspicion, almost a conviction, that our avowed intentions are not identical with our real intentions. The noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War gave utterance to that feeling in the course of the debate yesterday. He said, in allusion more especially to some remarks that fell from the noble Earl, Lord Selborne and myself, that what we really wished to do was to invest the House of Lords with financial powers such as it had never possessed before. I really think that both the noble Earl and myself, as well as your Lordships collectively have some very fair reason to complain of that statement being made. I need hardly say I do not challenge it on any personal grounds, because I am sure the noble Viscount never intended anything discourteous. But I observe that that statement has been taken up by the whole of the Radical Press, who have rapturously echoed the noble Viscount's sentiments and criticised us sharply, not for proposals we have made, but for proposals we have never made, and proposals which I will undertake to say not one single individual on this side of the House has ever had the slightest intention of making. I repeat the emphatic denial which I gave to the noble Viscount's statement whilst he was speaking, and which was given again by the noble Lord, Lord Curzon, shortly afterwards on behalf of the Front Opposition Bench. We do not at all want to assert new powers. We do not even seek to retain those powers which we have hitherto possessed. All we want to do is to prevent tacking, and nothing more. I do not pursue this question further now, because although possibly our own proposals may be defective we shall have a further opportunity of discussing them on the Report stage of the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00520">But besides that clause, which will come up for discussion on the Report stage, we have another anti-tacking proposal now before us&#x2014;that is, the substitution of a Joint Committee in the place of the Speaker. I do not think I need trouble your Lordships by going over again all the arguments which militate against making the Speaker the sole arbiter of whether a Bill is or is not a Money Bill. The subject has been thoroughly thrashed out in both
<col>296</col>
Houses, and I think everybody who has paid the least attention to it must be perfectly familiar with the arguments for and against. I therefore proceed at once to the question of the composition of the Committee. The proposal I originally made, and which still stands on the Paper, was, as your. Lordships will remember, that there should be a Committee composed of fifteen members, the Speaker being the President and having only a casting vote, seven members to be elected by your Lordships' House, and seven members to be elected by the House of Commons. At the time I stated that although I attached great importance to a Committee of some sort I did not feel myself at all pledged to the particular details of the proposal I brought forward. I may now go a step further and say that when I put down that proposal I had very considerable doubt as to whether that was the best possible solution of the question, and I really put it down merely to form a basis for discussion. What I anticipated would happen has happened. The noble Viscount (Lord St. Aldwyn), who has very much larger Parliamentary experience I need hardly say than myself, has come forward with another proposal, and I wish to say, so far as the matter rests with me, that I accept that proposal, and I think that the noble Marquess, when he speaks, will say that he and the Front Opposition Bench are in favour of it also.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00521">I will not forestall what the noble Viscount is going to say, but I should like to state very briefly why I think, on reflection, that the proposal of the noble Viscount is an improvement upon my own. I quite accept the criticism, which has been made from many quarters of the House, that the Committee ought to be a small Committee, and that my numbers are too large. My proposal is that the Committee should be composed of fifteen members. The noble Viscount proposes six. That is a large reduction. I wish to point out that there is one important change to a certain extent of principle made by the noble Viscount's proposal&#x2014;that is, that whereas under my proposal, having an uneven number, the Speaker only has a casting vote, under the noble Viscount's proposal, having an even number, the Speaker will have two votes. I merely point that out, though not by way of taking exception to it. The noble Lord, Lord Courtney, in
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0153"/>

the very interesting speech to which we all listened attentively yesterday, said, if I understood him rightly, that he thought six too many and that he would prefer four. I do not suppose that the question between four and six is one upon which it is possible to have any very strong opinion, and I hope that in the course of this debate the noble Lord will give us the advantage of his assistance and advice, and state the arguments which he thinks can be adduced against six and in favour of four. But I must say that, as at present advised, though I should like to keep an open mind on the question, I am rather inclined to think six a better number than four. My reason for holding that view is this. I cannot help thinking, although the number ought to be small, that when you get to such a very small number as four it will scarcely be possible to adequately represent on the Committee all those interests which ought to be represented. On that account I say, whilst keeping an open mind on the subject, that I rather prefer six, but your Lordships will be better able to judge on that point, which is, after all, only one of detail, when you hear the views set forth by the noble Viscount.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00522">Again, although I think my Committee would be an impartial one&#x2014;I certainly intended it to be so&#x2014;I think perhaps the noble Viscount's Committee gives greater guarantees for impartiality, which is a point to which all of us must attach the greatest importance. When any Party man deals with these questions the first thing he asks himself is whether a proposal of this nature is likely to militate to the advantage of his own Party or to that of his opponents. I do not know that I am a very good judge in a matter of this kind, because I have very little experience of Party tactics and management, and to say the truth they are not matters that very largely interest me. But since the noble Marquess put down his Amendment I have conversed with several Party men on this subject, and I find this remarkable result, that whereas my Liberal friends rather object to the noble Viscount's proposal on the ground that the Committee is likely to be too Conservative, my Conservative friends, on the other hand, object because they think the proclivities of the Committee proposed by the noble Viscount will be too Liberal. I do not say that that testimony is a
<col>298</col>
conclusive argument in favour of the noble Viscount's proposal, but I think it does involve the pretty fair assumption that he has hit the happy mean. At any rate, he has deserved the greatest compliment that can be paid to an arbiter in drawing up a proposal of the kind, that he has failed to completely satisfy either Party.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00523">I say, again, I bring this proposal forward in a spirit of conciliation, and although I have very little hope that it will be accepted I ask His Majesty's Government to deal with it in the spirit in which I have brought it forward. I have already made, in deference to the views particularly of noble Lords opposite, certain concessions, and I wish it to be understood that so far as I am concerned I have not yet said my last word. If I thought there was the smallest hope of arriving at some amicable and mutual arrangement with noble Lords opposite I would be content, speaking entirely for myself, to consider any further suggestions. This matter of the Committee is a matter which could be settled, and I think, with a little amount of good will and give and take, it could be settled. If it is not settled it certainly will not be my fault or the fault of the noble Marquess or noble Lords behind him; it will be the fault of His Majesty's Government. Let me explain that, according to what I am told by the noble Earl the Chairman of Committees, I ought, as a matter of procedure merely, to move the Amendment as it originally stood in my name. But your Lordships will understand that is a mere matter of form, and that after the noble Viscount has spoken I am prepared to withdraw all the latter part of my Amendment and substitute the words which he proposes in its place. I beg to move.</p>

It is ridiculous to say, Why do not we show a conciliatory spirit? for when it comes to the points on which conciliation is demanded we find that they are points which mean neither more nor less than destroying the structure of the Bill. We are reproached with being slow and sullen in the matter of concession, but I have gone through these Amendments more than once and if I could I would have been delighted to find an Amendment which would have been a fair subject for concession. A more keen eye than mine may find one, but up to this point I have been unable to find any Amendment which could be the subject of a concession which would not be a complete betrayal and traverse of the object of the Bill.<lb/>
I only make one single point on what my noble friend has said to-day. We have gone over this ground in three sittings, but my noble friend again says that the impartiality of the fourteen gentlemen, whom he has now thrown overboard, might be trusted. Who are they? Seven Members of the House of Lords and seven Members of the House of Commons. Every one of those seven Lords and every one of those seven Commoners have, if they have been attending to their legislative duties, already
<col>300</col>
given votes for or against the Bill. How can it be pretended, therefore, that when they go into committee to say whether a question of great gravity has arisen, and that the Bill in question raises it, they are by their antecedents perfectly impartial and free to judge independently? We object to this Committee, either as regards a Money Bill or as regards deciding in respect of any other Bill whether it does or does not involve a question of great gravity, and whether the judgment of the country has been sufficiently ascertained with regard to it or not. We object to any such Committee, either as superseding the Speaker of the House of Commons, or as the solitary authority, or otherwise. Therefore it would really be a farce for us to-day to intervene in the discussion among noble Lords opposite as to which of the two kinds of Committee they would like to accept, whether that of Lord Cromer or that of the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn. That is your question. It is not ours. Our opinion is perfectly well known. We have recorded it in these debates, and therefore I hope it will not be thought impatience nor want of respect either to the noble Earl or the noble Viscount if I say that we must leave this discussion to those members of your Lordships' House who approve and desire the formation of a Committee.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00538"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount amends his language in rather curious ways, but I will address myself to what he has said. The principle of this Bill is that there shall be a distinction between the treatment by the House of Lords of Money Bills arid of other Bills, and that therefore there shall be a tribunal to decide what is and what is not a Money Bill. That, I admit, is the principle of the Bill. But is it the principle of the Bill that the Speaker shall necessarily be that tribunal? Can it be contended for a moment, that at the election of last December the country supported the proposal that the Speaker should be the sole tribunal for arbitrating what were and what were not Money Bills? It cannot be so contended, for the simple reason that only last December the noble Earl, Lord Crewe, distinctly told us that the proposal that the Speaker should be the arbiter was not vital to the principle of the Bill.<lb/>
<col>302</col>
I will, in spite of what the noble Viscount has said, endeavour to address myself to this Amendment as a proposal which does not supersede the principle of the Bill. I do not wish to repeat what I have already said on the subject nor to repeat what was said by my noble friend Lord Cromer, who gave such good reasons for my Amendment that I really thought he might have moved it instead of his own. But I will venture to say that as regards Money Bills I have never been able to see how the Speaker could be a fair tribunal as between the two Houses. I am not questioning for a moment the impartiality in political matters or as between political Parties of the many distinguished men who have held the high office of Speaker. I have had the honour of serving in t he House of Commons under five Speakers, all of them but one held different political opinions from my own before they took their high office, and I venture to say&#x2014;and I am sure that what I am saying will be approved of by all who served under those Speakers&#x2014;that no one whatever his political opinions could, from the moment each one of those right hon. gentlemen assumed the Chair of the House of Commons, have told what their previous political opinions had been. There never was, as far as political Parties were concerned, any doubt as to the impartiality of the Speaker. Neither, my Lords, is there any doubt as to the duty of the Speaker. The first and foremost duty of the Speaker is to maintain the privileges of the House of Commons, and how an official whose first and foremost duty that is can possibly be considered a proper arbiter as between the two Houses in matters which directly and enormously affect the privileges of the House of Commons I confess passes my understanding. Therefore, my Lords, I have ventured to propose this form of joint Committee in place of the Speaker in regard to Money Bills. On that matter the Commit tee's duty will be solely to interpret the provision of the first clause of this Bill.<lb/>
Now I come to the further duties imposed upon the Joint Committee by the Amendments which have been subsequently passed, because I first suggested this proposal when the sole question for the Committee was the decision as to what a Money Bill might or might not be. The Committee now, according to the decisions of your Lordships' House, would have to decide whether as
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0156"/>
<col>303</col>
regards a Money Bill its governing purpose was financial or not; and it would also have to decide, under the proposal carried last night by my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition, whether a Bill affected the existence of the Crown or of the Protestant succession, whether it established a National Parliament or Assembly with legislative powers in any part of the United Kingdom, and whether it raised issues of great gravity upon which the judgment of the country had not been sufficiently ascertained. So far as regards the existence of the Crown or the Protestant succession, or the question of Home Rule, which also must be a matter for interpretation, I can conceive no great difficulty in the way of members of the Committee addressing themselves to such matters; but I confess the difficulty in their way is greater to my mind when it comes to a question of what is the governing purpose of a Money Bill, and the further question of what is an issue of great gravity upon which the judgment of the country has not been sufficiently ascertained. Speaking for myself, I very much doubt whether those proposals, if this Bill ever becomes law, will be retained. But assuming that they are retained in the Bill, and taking the Bill as it now stands, I venture to say that if it be possible to appoint any tribunal capable of dealing with such matters as these&#x2014;matters not of the interpretation of a Statute but matters of opinion&#x2014;the kind of tribunal I have suggested to your Lordships is the best that could possibly be framed. I have endeavoured in suggesting this tribunal to do two things&#x2014;first of all, to suggest a tribunal which shall be absolutely fair between the two Houses as representing the opinions of both Houses and yet shall give a preponderance to the House of Commons; and, in the second place, to suggest a tribunal the members of which should by their ordinary duties be accustomed to decide impartially matters of grave importance affecting Parliamentary procedure or the interpretation of the law.<lb/>
May for one moment, call the attention of your Lordships to the list of names which I have suggested for this Committee? In the first place, I have suggested the Lord Chancellor. The noble and learned Lord is not now in his place, and therefore in his absence I venture to say that I would trust his impartial decision in any matter referred to him judicially as much as that of any man I know. He is, no doubt, a member of the Government, and
<col>304</col>
as such not quite in the position of the other members of the Committee I have ventured to suggest. But it has always been the practice, the laudable practice, for the Lord Chancellor of the clay to separate himself as far as possible&#x2014;while, of course, defending the measures of his colleagues&#x2014;from Party controversy, and to deal even with subjects of Party politics with a more or less judicial gravity as compared with the manner in which they are dealt with by his colleagues. He is not only a Minister of the Crown but Speaker of your Lordships' House, and I venture to say that, being Speaker of your Lordships' House, he is qualified for such a position as I have proposed. Next comes the Speaker of the House of Commons. I need say nothing more with reference to him. Then the Chairman of Committees of the House of Lords is also in a position in which he has to decide every day impartially as to matters of procedure in this House and matters of great importance with regard to private legislation, which places him in a position entirely apart from ordinary Party controversy. I next suggest the Chairman of Ways and Means in the House of Commons, who is in a similar position to our Chairman. He never, I believe, votes or speaks on any Bill which comes under the consideration of the House, unless it be with regard to private legislation. Then I suggest that some one Peer should be chosen by and from the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and other Peers of Parliament holding, or who have held high judicial office. I need not dwell on the position which those noble Lords occupy in the estimation of the country and of the Empire, or of the nature of the judicial duties which they have to perform. Finally, I suggest as the sixth member of the tribunal a member of the House of Commons to be appointed by the Speaker. He would necessarily be someone experienced in Parliamentary work, and a man of an impartial mind, who would bring his best ability to the judgment of any questions referred to the tribunal. The Speaker would have, as the noble Earl on the Cross Benches has said, not only one vote, as one of the six members of this tribunal but a casting vote, so as to ensure the preponderance of the House of Commons.<lb/>
I have not thought of what the political opinions might be of those of whom this tribunal would probably be composed, because I believe that they would be able,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0157"/>
<col>305</col>
in dealing with the matters referred to them under this Bill, to throw off their political opinions and act in a perfectly impartial manner. It would be far more difficult for the fourteen members proposed by my noble friend on the Cross Benches to take up such a position, because they must necessarily have taken in the other House an active part of some sort or another in the previous consideration of Bills that had cone before them, and therefore I think they would necessarily be somewhat prejudiced in dealing with them afterwards. I hope your Lordships will be pleased to accept this proposal. I do not say that it is by any means perfect. It is a matter of enormous difficulty to frame a tribunal for the purpose of dealing with the provisions of this Bill. But, such as it is, I commend the proposal for your Lordships' approval, and I wish to conclude by thanking my noble friend on the Cross Benches for the manner in which he has himself dealt with my Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

I had the honour of being Speaker of the House of Commons for many years, and I can speak with some experience of the responsibilities which attach to that high office. I gladly recognise the approbation which the <i>status</i> of the Speaker has received at the hands of your Lordships during this debate, and I take
<col>306</col>
this public opportunity of expressing my grateful acknowledgment to Lord Curzon and to the Leader of the House for the kind words which they expressed with reference to myself personally.<lb/>
The Speaker of the House of Commons is a responsible office. He undertakes that responsibility very willingly, but it is a little hard that his responsibility should be added to by any other duties of the kind proposed by this Bill. The Speaker has to decide questions of very great gravity arising within the House of Commons, and also in relation to questions arising between the House of Commons and your Lordships' House. I have tried to recollect what were the occasions on which I gave any decisions against your Lordships' House in maintaining the privileges of the House of Commons. I have found two instances only. One was in 1891 when, in the Elementary Education Bill, your Lordships introduced a clause for grouping elementary schools. I held it to be my duty to rule that if that Amendment of your Lordships was introduced it would increase the charge upon the public, and that if in any case the charge was exceeded in any particular school it was a clear violation of the House of Commons' privilege. The other case was in reference to a Local Government Bill. Your Lordships had made some alteration in the financial relations between the owner and the occupier, the result of which would have been to increase the charge upon the public. On those grounds I decided that your Lordships had committed a breach of privilege against the Commons, and the Amendment was disregarded. Those are the two occasions, and the only two occasions, on which. I gave any decision on the question of privilege as between one House and the other. I do not know whether the present Speaker has given any decision upon any question affecting the relations of the two Houses, but that he has decided questions of great gravity with great impartiality no one, I think, will deny for a moment. For instance, on the Redistribution scheme in the year 1905 when Mr. Balfour, who was then Prime Minister, proposed to substitute Resolutions for a Bill, the Speaker held that Resolutions would be incompatible with the privileges of the House, that he was not able to put the Resolutions before the House <i>en bloc</i>, and that discussion upon them could only be taken separately. No time, therefore,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0158"/>
<col>307</col>
would be saved in proceeding by Resolutions, and Mr. Balfour withdrew his Resolutions.<lb/>
Your Lordships may ask, "What is the use of these precedents you have quoted?" I quote them only for the purpose of showing that the Speaker of the House of Commons may decide questions of privilege affecting the relations between one House and the other, and questions of privilege affecting the internal relations of the House of Commons, but to place upon him other duties is quite another matter. It would be impossible, in my judgment, for the Speaker to maintain his high position were such a duty as this Bill proposes saddled upon him. At present the Speaker is able to take advice from any quarter; he may consult anybody he pleases, but he is not bound to state the means by which he arrives at his decision. But this proposal, if accepted, would fetter, I feel sure, the responsibility of the Speaker and expose him to a suggestion of suspicion which would be unworthy of his character and position in the House of Commons. The Speaker of the House of Commons occupies a great position, and is recognised as a responsible officer. It is that responsibility which I believe attracts to him the admiration of your Lordships' House and of the House of Commons, and it is the impartiality with which he exercises it that is at the base of the universal admiration and respectful affection in which the present Speaker of the House of Commons is held, and I should be very sorry indeed if at any moment the fair fame of the Speaker's character should be blown upon by a breath of suspicion, or if any alteration were made in his position which might derogate from his high office.<lb/>
As to the Amendment now before the House, my objection to Lord Cromer's proposition is to the magnitude of the Committee he proposes. I think it is very important, if we are to have a Committee at all, that it should be a small one, for the reason that unanimity is a great object to be gained, and you are more likely to get unanimity by a small Committee than by a Committee of fourteen or fifteen. I would not despair at all of selecting fourteen impartial members from the House of Commons. I believe there are as good men in the House of Commons as ever there were, and that their character is as high, and I have not the least doubt that you
<col>308</col>
would be able to select as many impartial men from that House as you required. I need not say that I could say the same of your Lordships' House; and the method proposed by Lord St. Aldwyn for the selection of the members of the Committee guarantees, I think, the impartiality of the Committee quite apart from the number of members it is proposed to put upon it. It is a high question which I leave to your Lordships to decide as to what their duties should be, but that they should assist the Speaker in defining what is a Money Bill, for instance, is, I think, a most wholesome proposal. I do not wish to address the House any further, and I thank you for the kind attention with which you have listened to me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00542"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like a good many other Members of your Lordships' House I had the honour of serving in the House of Commons under the noble Viscount who has just addressed us. I have grateful recollections of the way in which he exercised his great Authority- as Speaker and of the respect and affection in which we all held him, without distinction of Party, and I am grateful to him to-day, as one who has recently left that House, for the tribute he has paid to its character, a testimony derived from his own observation of the way in which the old traditions are carried on to-day as they were carried on of yore. The weight of authority of the noble Viscount is very great. So is the authority of the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, on a question of this kind. Speaking for myself, and, I think, for others, I say at once that we would rather that the question had not arisen of imposing the burden of new statutory judicial duties upon the Speaker of the House of Commons, but we know of no way out, and your Lordships appear to know of no way out. In dealing with the introduction of a statutory authority in the shape of a Joint Committee it may well be that it would be desirable to relieve the Speaker of the House of Commons, if he could be relieved, of this burden.<lb/>
I do not rise to debate the general question&#x2014;my noble friend has expressed all we have to say upon that&#x2014;but I desire to point out that in the speech of the noble Viscount opposite, and, I think, throughout this discussion, what to us is the dominant
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0159"/>
<col>309</col>
consideration, the dominant difficulty, has been ignored. It is not merely a question of setting up the Speaker as a judicial authority who, before a Bill conies to this House from the other House, has to give a certificate, but of setting up an authority who is to decide and to give guidance as to whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not&#x2014;not a Money Bill in the abstract, but a Money Bill of the kind described in subsection (2) of Clause 1, a Bill which may be one of a number of different species. One of the unavoidable peculiarities of this position is that in the course of its passage through the House of Commons a Bill may alter its character. Having begun as a Money Bill, it may cease to be a Money Bill and become a general Bill, subject to Clause 2. If that happens the whole finance of the year may be thrown into confusion. A Budget Bill may thus come under Clause 2, and then we may have the legitimate exercise of your Lordships' rights in that case and the Bill hung up for an indefinite time. That is just the situation which we look upon as impossible, as reducing the financial stability of this country to a state of confusion. The noble Marquess did not agree with me when I made the statement before, but perhaps he will consider the real force there is in what I am saying now.<lb/>
Unless you can get somebody who can give authoritative guidance right through all the stages of the passage of a Bill through the House of Commons confusion is unavoidable. For example, take a Budget Bill. In the Committee stage there are all sorts of discussions and Amendments by private Members, and it is very easy to turn a Bill which originated as a Money Bill into a general Bill which comes under Clause 2. The Government of the day may wish to make Amendments. It may be most desirable to do so, because there may be slips to be rectified and necessary improvements to be made. As I say, unless there is authoritative guidance as the Bill goes along, guidance which can be relied upon to steer its course correctly, confusion and uncertainty seem to be unavoidable, and there would be a serious risk of the passage of the Budget Bill of the year being delayed. That is one cogent reason why we have adopted our plan. We quite recognise that a burden is being placed upon the Speaker, but somebody must be entrusted with the duty, and unless the authoritative exercise of the
<col>310</col>
Speaker's functions is employed right through from beginning to end of the Bill there is no certainty that confusion will not result. These questions arise from hour to hour. How can you get a Committee of the kind together from time to time to deal with the points as they arise? It is on that ground particularly that we object to this Amendment. If the deciding authority in the House of Commons could always exercise the influence over us all and command the confidence of us all in the way recent Speakers have done, as the present Speaker has done, and as the noble Viscount who has just spoken has preeminently done, then I think your Lordships would be satisfied to accept the authority of the Speaker. We must hope that the great traditions of the past will be continued in the future. It is better to put up with a mere question of the balance of convenience and inconvenience than to set up machinery which would put the financial stability of this country in peril.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00543"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like my noble friend who has just sat down I had the honour of sitting for many years under my noble friend Viscount Peel, and I should have hoped that the Government, after hearing what the noble Viscount with his great experience has said and the strong reasons which he urged against the duty that is proposed being cast upon the Speaker, would have at least intimated their readiness to give careful consideration to the Amendment now before the House. The remarks which have just fallen from the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, are therefore very disappointing. His speech, moreover, makes the prospect, if possible, even more alarming than it was before, because I understood him to say that during the course of a Budget Bill through the House of Commons additions might be made to it which would make it a Bill coming under Clause 2, and yet your Lordships were to be precluded from dealing with it, although those additions introduced into the Budget Bill might refer to anything on earth. That is a very alarming prospect.<lb/>
My noble friend opposite repeated an argument which seems to me&#x2014;and I speak from having had the honour of sitting for, more than 30 years in the House of Commons&#x2014;not to have any foundation whatever. He has told us this evening, not for the first time, that it is necessary to have an authority at hand
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0160"/>
<col>311</col>
which would determine from day to day whether an addition to a Bill left it a Money Bill or made it an ordinary Bill, and that unless this were done the finances of the country might be thrown into confusion. I venture, however, to say, and I appeal to other noble Lords who have had seats in the House of Commons, that there is a complete answer. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that a Bill is brought in quite properly as a Money Bill and that provisions are introduced into it which, in the opinion of this Joint Committee sitting at the end of the Committee stage of the Bill in the House of Commons, bring the Bill under Clause 2, and that in the opinion of the Government it was most important that it should remain a Money Bill and that they should be able to pass it without coining to this House. I venture to say, and I doubt if any noble Lord who has had the honour of a seat in the House of Commons will contradict me, that all that need happen would be that the Government would move that the Bill should be recommitted, that the clauses in it which prevented it from being a purely Money Bill should be omitted, and then the Bill would go through without coming to this House at all. If I am correct in that statement, what becomes of the argument of my noble friend opposite that it is necessary to have a decision from day to day, the only alternative being that it would throw the finances of the country into confusion? If the account is right which I have ventured to give of the procedure in the House of Commons, I submit that no such confusion need arise, and I would ask any one of your Lordships who has had a seat in the House whether he can deny that the description as to procedure which I have given is a correct one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00544"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after the very grave pronouncement of the noble Viscount, Lord Peel, I think it might almost have been well if we could have suspended for a while our proceedings and bethought ourselves what effect his statements should have on the future progress of this Bill. I enter upon the discussion under the influence of the statement of the noble Viscount with much hesitation, and with grave consideration, I hope, of what I am about to say. I must at the outset say that I regret that the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War should
<col>312</col>
have given us&#x2014;and on this point I agree with my noble friend who has just sat down&#x2014;a perfectly imaginary statement with regard to the conduct of a Bill through the House of Commons. I have had the honour of presiding over Bills in Committee in the House of Commons, and I was never aware that the Speaker was always at hand to determine what was the nature of any Amendment that was moved, and to rule from day to day upon the character a Bill might assume. That guidance is not given, and it is not wanted.<lb/>
I deduce from at all events the first part of the statement of the noble Viscount, Lord Peel&#x2014;under whom I also had the honour of serving&#x2014;a very different moral, and one which seems to me more appropriate to the Bill as it stands. What did Lord Peel tell us? He told us that he had examined the records of his own action as Speaker and found that on two occasions, and two occasions only, had he pronounced on the question as to the action of your Lordships in relation to the money privileges of the House of Commons, and that those pronouncements were explicitly accepted in the House of Commons and observed and respected by your Lordships. In other words, the experience of Lord Peel confirms the statement that the Speaker has been in the past the real arbiter of the question whether the action of this House has or has not been interference with the money privileges of the House of Commons, and his sole and independent decision has been accepted as final.<lb/>
What the noble Viscount has said is a confirmation of the view that I ventured to submit in the first discussion that arose here&#x2014;that the only real solution consonant with the practice of the past and with the maintenance of the privileges of the Commons, which we must hold to have been asserted at two successive General Elections, is to accept the scheme of the Bill in respect to Money Bills, and leave to the Speaker, and to the Speaker alone, the absolute authority of determining what is a Money Bill. There was, as I admitted, some little risk that in the future there might be a deterioration in the character of the Speaker, and that your Lordships would lose under the Bill now before us the power which you did nominally possess, but never until 1909 exercised, of rejecting a Money Bill. But taking into
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0161"/>
<col>313</col>
account all the considerations on the one side and on the other&#x2014;and, I am pleased to be fortified by the speech of the noble Viscount, Lord Peel&#x2014;it would be wise, in my opinion, to maintain the first part of the Bill as it stands, and leave to the Speaker the sole determination of what is and what is not a Money Bill.<lb/>
Now I come to the composition of the Committee in relation to the subsequent part of the Bill. Here I am pleased to be again supported by Lord Peel in my view of the great importance of having a very small Committee. The noble Viscount did not intimate any opinion as to whether six would be too many, but he much preferred the smaller number because he thought there would be not only a greater feeling of responsibility but greater authority on the part of individual members, and that you might hope to secure greater unanimity. I do not think you could look for that so much with six as you could with four, and I hold strongly that the proposal of the noble Viscount opposite would be unproved if he consented to a reduction from six to four. In the first place I would cut out&#x2014;I hope the noble Earl who is presiding over us to-night will forgive me for saying so&#x2014;the Chairman of Committees of this House and the Chairman of Ways and Means of the House of Commons. I propose that, not merely because of the greater responsibility that will be created by having a smaller Committee, but because by including those two officers you are making an entirely new departure. These two officers hold their office on different tenures.<lb/>
I dare say your Lordships read in <i>The Times</i> the other day the history of the position of Chairman of Committees in this House. I think I am right in saying that our Chairman of Committees is formally voted to the Chair every Session, but when he gets there his tenure may be said to be life-long. But in the House of Commons the Chairman of Ways and Means is voted into the Chair at the commencement of a Parliament and only holds his position during the duration of that Parliament, and until very recently the position of Chairman of Ways and Means was filled by a Party man. Lord St. Aldwyn has told us that that officer now very rarely votes still less speaks on what may be called a Party discussion. It used to be quite the custom to vote,
<col>314</col>
but I am not sure how far the process was carried. When I was Chairman of Ways and Means I always abstained from voting on the Second Reading of a Bill Over which I was going to preside in Committee if it raised any question of Parliamentary importance, but there was no such duty recognised on the part of a Chairman of Ways and Means in those days and he is still largely looked upon as a Party man. He is displaced when a change of Party arises in the House of Commons. He does not sit, as the Chairman of Committees does in this House, through successive Ministries. He holds his office at the will of the House of Commons, so to speak, at the commencement of a Parliament, and if he fails to be re-elected at a General Election he is displaced. I remember looking up the past history of Chairmen of Ways and Means, and I found that during thirty years riot one of them had ever been re-elected at a General Election, so unlucky had been their experience. Somehow or other they do not come back. These considerations, therefore, lead me to think that it would be as well if these two officers were excluded from the Committee. They do not add to the weight of it, but by appointing them you do add to the Committee persons who, for the reasons I have stated, are subject, at all events in some measure, to considerations which make it desirable to my mind that they should not be on the Committee.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl on the Cross Benches said&#x2014;I do not know that it was repeated by Lord St. Aldwyn&#x2014;that it was as well to have a sufficient number on the Committee to represent all the interests involved. I strongly deprecate the suggestion of interests in this matter. What you really want on this Committee are men with a large knowledge of affairs and as much aloofness from Party considerations as possible&#x2014;men who have been accustomed to look at things in a broad way, and who would be able to bring to the determination of the questions submitted to them large and broad views of policy and of national movement. I am talking perhaps too vainly, because there emerges out of this discussion the determined and uncompromising attitude of His Majesty's Government. But I do not despair. I still think that if the Government could by any means bring themselves to recommend to the House of Commons the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0162"/>
<col>315</col>
appointment of the Speaker as the sole authority to decide what is a Money Bill, and again as to other Bills, should, assisted by four persons of presumably the highest character, decide, not whether a Bill is to be defeated or even to be set aside, but whether before its finally becoming law it should be approved of by popular vote, we might still have a solution of this question. But I think it can only be done by having a very small Committee.<lb/>
Two members have been indicated&#x2014;the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker of the House of Commons. I will not at this moment traverse the suggestions the noble Viscount made, but I do not much like, as I said on a former occasion, the introduction of the Law Lords as the electors of one member of the Committee. I think it would be better for the third and fourth members of the Committee to be elected, one by your Lordships' House and the other by the House of Commons and not by the Speaker. If your Lordships at the commencement of a Parliament elected a member of your House to the Committee the act of election would be a very serious business, and you certainly would choose one who would command the respect of all. The same may be said of the House of Commons. The Lord Chancellor, the Speaker, and two other members elected in the way I have suggested would form a Committee to which the questions involved in the Amendment of the noble Marquess might well be referred. I conclude with the feeling that I have been occupying the attention of your Lordships too long, not because I am diffident of the propriety of what I have submitted, but because I really fear that the determination of my noble friends below me shipwrecks all hopes of arriving at a solution of this question by compromise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00545"><member>LORD NORTHCOTE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I be permitted to supplement the remarks of my noble friend Lord Avebury with a single observation addressed to the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War. I wish to remind him&#x2014;he must know it from his long Parliamentary experience&#x2014;that the class of Amendments which may transform a non-Money Bill into a Money Bill or <i>vice versa</i> are necessarily much more often moved when the House of Commons is in Committee than in the full House, and, as Lord Avebury pointed out, when the House is in Committee it has not the
<col>316</col>
advantage of the immediate guidance and direction of the Speaker. The noble Viscount, therefore, can hardly claim that the Speaker will be constantly there to advise the Government at a moment's notice. As we know, Amendments are accepted in the course of Committee&#x2014;the Government are obliged to do so&#x2014;on the spur of the moment without having the opportunity of consulting the Speaker as to whether they are changing the character of their Bills in doing so. The noble Lord, Lord. Courtney, spoke somewhat despondently of the general attitude of His Majesty's Ministers with regard to this Bill. May I make an appeal to the noble Viscount the Leader of the House? He told us last night that compromise and concession were two great political jewels. Will he not take the present opportunity of exposing those jewels to the open air, or is he afraid of tarnishing them? I must confess that the Amendment of the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, appears to me to be of a most reasonable and nonpartisan character, and if His Majesty's Ministers will not accept an Amendment of that kind I really think the noble Viscount opposite might spare himself the trouble of praising compromise and concession.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00546"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL FORTESCUE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, under the Bill as it stands the whole working of the measure may at any time be brought to a standstill. We all remember how his late Majesty was disabled on the eve of his Coronation, and even Speakers are not immune from such commonplace complaints as influenza and colds, which for a time may render them quite incapable of attending the House. There is no provision of any sort in the Bill for anyone to take the place of the Speaker. The Deputy Speaker is not mentioned, and if he were the Deputy Speaker is not the same thing by any means as the Speaker&#x2014;instead of being chosen by the House he is the nominee of the Government of the day. These difficulties are disposed of if the functions of arbiter are given to a Committee instead of to the Speaker, and I think that point of some importance in this consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00547"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened with great interest to the remarks that fell from the noble Lord, Lord Courtney, but I was not quite certain at the close of his speech whether he was in favour of the Speaker being the sole arbiter or whether he preferred a Committee. I should think,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0163"/>
<col>317</col>
however, that after listening to what Lord Peel said as to the great burden that this additional duty would impose upon the Speaker he was inclined to the opinion that the Committee was the better solution. The noble Lord suggested that the number of members should be reduced from six to four. It will not have escaped him that in Lord St. Aldwyn's proposal the Speaker has a casting vote. When there are six members on a Committee a casting vote is powerful, but when there are only four it becomes much more powerful still. I do not know whether that point has been considered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00548"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, two speeches which we have heard this evening from this side of the House certainly received, and I think deserved, the earnest attention of your Lordships. I refer to the speech of my noble friend Viscount St. Aldwyn, and the speech delivered by Viscount Peel, to whom the House listened with attention and pleasure. Lord Peel, speaking with the immense weight which attaches to his record and position, told your Lordships that in his view it would be impossible for the Speaker to maintain his high position if the duties which this Bill contemplates were imposed upon him. That seems to me to be a warning of the utmost significance. What was the reply that was made by the noble Viscount opposite? He said that there was no other way out&#x2014;I think those were his words. We have endeavoured to show that there is another way out, and I do not think that anything which has yet been said has been sufficient to show that the way we have ventured to indicate is one which might not safely be pursued.<lb/>
The noble Viscount who leads the House, it is true, dwelt upon certain difficulties of procedure which were likely to arise during the passage of a Bill through the House of Commons if our proposal for a Joint Committee were adopted. His argument was, I think, to the effect that the complexion of a Bill might alter during its progress through the House of Commons, and that at any moment or at any hour a question might arise as to whether a Bill was a Money Bill or not. I speak with great deference upon this subject because it has been my misfortune never to have held a seat in the House of Commons, but I am led to believe that what would happen would be this. The Speaker would
<col>318</col>
still watch over a Bill during its progress through the House, and if at the end of that progress the result of any changes which had taken place was to convert the Bill from a Money Bill into a Bill which was no longer a Money Bill, or to raise a doubt upon that point, he would then call the Committee together and obtain their decision upon the matter.<lb/>
Then there is the question of the composition of the Committee. We are inclined upon the whole to think that the composition suggested by the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, is preferable to that suggested by Lord Cromer, and, indeed, I understand that Lord Cromer has withdrawn his proposal in favour of Lord St. Aldwyn's. But, my Lords, I venture to say that the composition of the Committee, though no doubt very important, is not a matter which is really fundamental in this case. I can conceive many ways of constituting a body of this kind. But surely what you want, and what it should not be beyond your power to obtain, is some small body of cool-headed, clear-headed and experienced men who can&#x2014;I think the phrase was Viscount St. Aldwyn's&#x2014;throw off political prejudices when they address themselves to the important task which is imposed upon them. Viscount St. Aldwyn suggested that although his Committee might be a very suitable Committee for the purposes of Clause 1 of the Bill, he was not equally convinced of its fitness for the duties which Clause 2 would impose upon the Committee under the Amendment which your Lordships agreed to last night. I cannot help thinking that there is a certain amount of misapprehension as to the functions of the Joint Committee, and as to the place which it would occupy in our political system. One misapprehension, for I think it is one, is that the services of this Committee would be constantly invoked. I believe myself it would be upon the rarest occasions that recourse would be had to it.<lb/>
I noted that the noble Viscount last night, when criticising our proposal that the Committee should deal with the gravity of questions which might come before them, said&#x2014;
<quote>"You are contemplating a measure which has been three times rejected by the House of Lords, and is it conceivable that such a measure should not be a crave measure?</quote>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0164"/>
<col>319</col>
I think it is perfectly conceivable that it might be very far from being a grave measure. Let me take a measure which we were discussing not very long ago and which occurs to me at the moment&#x2014;it dealt with the camping grounds of gipsies or some subject of that kind. A Bill of that nature might be three times rejected in this House, but it would still remain a measure of second or third rate importance, and would certainly, if our clause were reasonably interpreted, be regarded as in no sense a grave measure. What has to happen before the Committee is invoked? There must be three rejections in this House and a lapse of two years, and surely after a question has been as thoroughly discussed and debated as it must have been during that period the Minister, or the House, or the Speaker of the House of Commons&#x2014;the three authorities who can invoke the assistance of the Committee&#x2014;will have had ample opportunities of considering whether it is really worth while setting the Committee in motion, and they would not do so unless the matter was of such importance as to require the solution of the knot by a tribunal of that kind. Neither the Minister, nor either House of Parliament, nor, I venture to think, the Speaker of the House of Commons, would be likely to risk what would be a kind of rebuff at the hands of the Committee, if they sent to the Committee a measure which the Committee did not consider of sufficient moment to deserve their investigation. And, my Lords, not only will both Houses of Parliament and the Minister consider what the Committee is likely to say when the subject comes before it but they will consider what the people of this country are likely to say supposing the Committee sends the measure to a Referendum. Therefore, everything points to this, that this piece of new machinery will be handled very cautiously, and that it will not be set in motion except when there are quite sufficient reasons for doing so.<lb/>
Then we are told that the appointment of this Committee indicates that we have a complete distrust of the House of Commons. Surely that is an unreasonable imputation. If the proposal indicates distrust at all&#x2014;and I do not admit that it does&#x2014;it indicates distrust of both Houses equally. The Committee has to decide between the two Houses, and is that not a fairer arrangement between House and House than the
<col>320</col>
arrangement contemplated by this Bill, under which, when the two Houses differ, it shall always be assumed that one House is right and the other House is wrong? I may remind your Lordships that, unfair as the procedure of the Bill is as between the two Houses, we accept that procedure except in the special circumstances covered by the Amendment which your Lordships have accepted. And when we propose that the issue should go to this Joint Committee be it remembered that we are going to a body not independent of the two Houses, but a body which draws its very existence from, which has delegated authority accorded to it by, the two Houses of Parliament. It is a kind of reasonable arbitration, as Lord St. Aldwyn said, between the two Houses when they differ. In these days we are all great believers in arbitration. We are at the present moment much interested in the project of a new Arbitration Treaty between ourselves and the United States of America. Is not this a case where we may safely submit ourselves to arbitration? Be it remembered that there is this difference between our proposal and a proposal for arbitration in the ordinary sense of the word, that if you go to the arbitrators and they decide against you their decision is final; there is no more to be said; but if you go to our arbitrators the worst thing that can happen is that you are referred to the country, and it is the country who decides which is right and which is wrong. As I said before, we prefer the Committee suggested by Lord St. Aldwyn and if he goes to a Division we shall certainly support him.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00554"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have now to deal with subsection (2) of my proposed new clause, which treats of the manner in which the Joint Committee is to be put in motion. Your Lordships may observe that a change of some considerable importance has been introduced into this Amendment since I first put it down on the Paper. The first proposal was that there should be two means of bringing this Committee into operation. One way was by the action of the Minister of the Crown, and the other was by a resolution of either House of Parliament. I now propose to add a third method, and to allow the Speaker of the House of Commons to put the machinery in motion on his own initiative if he should think fit to do so. As regards the Minister of the Crown, the noble Viscount opposite has said that it is quite unnecessary to put him in because <i>ex hypothesi</i> he will never wish to summon the Committee. I agree to a certain extent. His insertion is the least important, but I think it is better to put him in, as before proposing any measure such as would come under the noble Marquess's clause the Minister might like to consult the Committee. Then with regard to the next method&#x2014;upon Resolution by either House of Parliament&#x2014;that was intended to deal with a situation arising where there was difference of opinion between the two Houses. I do not think I need say any more on that point. The other method is by the action of the Speaker himself. I put that in because, even before the criticisms of noble Lords opposite, I had noticed that as there was no machinery for bringing this Committee into operation where both Houses were in a majority in favour of a measure, there was no means of safeguarding the rights of a minority. That was a defect that certainly had to be remedied. There are only two ways of doing so&#x2014;either by allowing a certain minority in one or both Houses to have a right to enjoin the Speaker to set the Committee in motion, or the way I suggest. Lord Weardale in the course of the debate yesterday proposed, as I understood, that a minority of 200 should be allowed to set the machinery in operation. I have no objection to a minority power of that description, but there are certain objections to it. If once you begin to say that a minority can put the machinery in motion, you at once have to consider what is to be that minority, whether it is to be 50, 100, 150, 200, and so on. I do
<col>322</col>
not suppose anyone would suggest that the Committee ought to be summoned by a very small and insignificant majority&#x2014;10, 15, or 20 people; but when you get above that number the difficulties become considerable, because the moment a thing of this sort is proposed all the Party wire-pullers and managers put their heads together and ask themselves whether it is conceivable that their Party in the House would ever sink below the required minimum. I do not consider that a fatal objection, but it is a thing to be considered. It would be wiser, I think, to leave the decision of the question to the Speaker. He is always in touch with all Parties in the House; he would be perfectly impartial in this as in other matters; and he would be able to judge whether there was a substantial minority in the House of Commons in favour of bringing the Joint Committee into operation. For these reasons I think that this matter might confidently be left in the hands of the Speaker. I beg to move that subsection (2) of my proposed new clause be here inserted.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00571"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member> had an Amendment on the Paper to insert, after Clause 3, the following new clause&#x2014;</p>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0167"/>
<col>325</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00572">.&#x2014;(1) In every Bill presented to His Majesty under the preceding provisions of this Act, the words of enactment shall be as follows, that is to say&#x2014;
<quote>"Be it enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, in accordance with the provisions of the Parliament Act, 1911, and by the authority of the same, as follows."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00573">(2) Any alteration of a Bill necessary to give effect to this section shall be made, in the case of a Money Bill, by the Speaker of the House of Commons, and, in the case of any other Bill, by the Clerk of the Parliaments, and for the purposes of this Act shall not be deemed to be an amendment thereof.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00574">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I propose to take subsection (1) of the Amendment first. The second subsection really relates to machinery, and I will not trouble your Lordships with if at this moment. This clause, or some such clause, is absolutely necessary in consequence of the new kind of Act of Parliament which is created for the first time by this Bill. Hitherto all Acts have been passed after obtaining the consent of both Houses, but under this Bill, as I say, there is to be a new kind of Act. This Bill says that a Bill shall become an Act of Parliament "notwithstanding that the House of Lords have not consented to the Bill. "In those circumstances it is quite clear that the enacting formula to which we are accustomed is absolutely inapplicable. The existing formula runs as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, &#x2026;"</quote>
This Bill departs from that altogether, and creates a wholly new kind of Act of Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00575">It would have seemed hardly necessary to argue a thing of this kind before your Lordships had it not been for the extraordinary conduct of the Government in the other House. A clause very similar to the one I propose was brought forward in the House of Commons and objected to there. It was to a certain extent argued in Committee, but when it was renewed on Report the statement was made that the clause had already been considered and rejected, and it was thereupon again voted down. It is worth while, I think, to point out the action which the Government have taken with regard to this matter and the line of argument they have followed. The Attorney-General opposed the insertion of this
<col>326</col>
clause. He began by admitting that it was necessary to deal with the matter, but he ended by saying that it was not necessary now. His words were&#x2014;
<quote>"One aspect of the policy of the Government is to avoid making any distinction between Bills which are passed under the provisions of the Parliament Bill and Bills which are passed in the ordinary way. &#x2026; What we desire is to accept no formula which would make a different formula to be applied to Bills passing under the Parliament. Bill and to Bills passed under the ordinary procedure."</quote>
In other words, a Bill passed by one House alone and a Bill passed by the two Houses are to be described by one and the same formula.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00576">Let me examine those two statements. Why is it not necessary to make this change now? If the change has to be made and to be made by Statute, as was admitted, why not insert it in this Bill? This Bill is the proper place in which to put an amendment of this sort. You are creating a new kind of Act of Parliament altogether, and therefore you must create a new formula to describe it if you wish to describe it correctly. With regard to the other argument of the Attorney-General&#x2014;that they would accept no formula which would make a different formula to be applied to Bills passed under the Parliament Bill and Bills passed under the ordinary procedure, and that they did not wish to recognise any distinction between those two kinds of Bills&#x2014;the question is not whether the Attorney-General wishes to recognise a distinction between the two kinds of Bills. The Government have by this Bill created that distinction. They have introduced an entirely novel Act of Parliament different altogether from that to which we are accustomed, and what we want now is some means of stating it correctly. I quite understand the motive of the Government in offering this opposition, which appears to me factious and not very much to their credit. Their desire is to conceal from the public as far as they can the revolution which they are making. We are accustomed to that line of argument from them. It has been adopted over and over again in this House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00577">Noble Lords opposite deny that they are creating a one-Chamber Act of Parliament. We are not a set of special pleaders refining upon the meaning of individual words. What we are dealing with here are facts. And what are the facts? This Bill deals
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0168"/>
<col>327</col>
with cases in which the Lords decline to pass Bills. It is limited entirely to cases in which this House declines to pass a Money Bill within a month or rejects other Bills three times during two years. The very words of this measure state that the particular Bill referred to is to be passed "notwithstanding that the House of Lords have not consented to the Bill. "What do your Lordships think of a formula which says that this Bill is passed "by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, "when the Lords Spiritual and Temporal have not only not given their consent but have done everything in their power under the Constitution to resist the passage of the Bill? I am reluctant to use strong words, but so far as I can see no words will describe an action of this sort except to say that it is enacting a deliberate falsehood, a falsehood which is patent upon the very face of the Bill which contains it. So far as I know there is no precedent whatsoever for legislation of this sort, or for enacting a formula which obviously does not apply to the cases for which it was made to apply. If there be anything approaching to a precedent I can only find it in the ridiculous Preamble of this Bill&#x2014;a Preamble which contains all kinds of things which the Bill does not deal with, and which holds out a kind of shadowy promise that things will be dealt with which noble Lords opposite know quite well in their own hearts their most extreme supporters will never permit them to deal with.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00578">I have mentioned the way in which the Government treated this matter in the other House. The Bill has now come to this House, and I am submitting an Amendment to your Lordships which appears to me accurately to describe what will take place under this Bill with regard to any measure which is passed under it, and until I hear it I will not believe that noble Lords on the Front Bench opposite will insist upon supporting the enactment of what I have already described as an untrue statement. We know that the present leaders of this House are willing to destroy as far as they can, and possibly it may be in their power to curtail or destroy, the liberties of this House, but I will not believe that they will insist upon retaining the present formula as the formula to precede Bills passed under the Parliament Bill. If they do, they will be really doing what amounts to calumniating this House. I beg to move the first subsection of my Amendment.</p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00582"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose to spend one sentence in replying to the language which the noble Earl has permitted himself to use as to the motive and spirit and falsehood on the part of the Government. The noble Earl raises a very natural and good point which is independent of all that ugly declaration. It was admitted to be a good point in the House of Commons, and, although the noble Earl will perhaps not believe what I say, it is true that great pains and trouble were taken in discussing this question before the Bill was laid before the House of Commons. It is not an easy point to settle off-hand, but we admit, and it was admitted by the Attorney-General, the necessity of altering the enacting words. What was said was that it was desirable&#x2014;and I do not believe any noble Lord will deny that it is desirable if it can be done&#x2014;that we should have one common form of enacting words for all Acts, and it is proposed, and we shall try as hard as we possibly can, to find a formula of that kind. It is a great deal less easy than the noble Earl thinks. Let me say only one word more. The occasion cannot arise for two years. There can be no case of a measure becoming an Act under this Bill before then, and it ought not to be beyond the wit of man, and of lawyers especially, to find out before the need arises a formula which will meet the perfectly just objection the noble Earl has made.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00584"><member>VISCOUNT HALIFAX</member><membercontribution>: It is not only a question of what is desirable with regard to a formula. It is infinitely more desirable that Parliament should speak the truth, instead of saying that an Act is passed in one way when it is nothing of the sort.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0009P0I0169"/>
<col>329</col>
in proposing his Amendment, for it would not be a truthful statement to say that such a Bill was passed by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal. I think he might even make his Amendment a little stronger than he has done by adding words saying that it was passed without their advice and consent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00586"><member>LORD ASHBOURNE</member><membercontribution>: I am not sure that the words of my noble friend's Amendment are complete, because it might be that after the two years the House of Lords withdrew their objection to a Bill. There is not a syllable here as to the absence of the consent, and therefore I am disposed to think that my noble friend should put in some words to make it complete.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00587"><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: I merely rise to ask, How does it require two years in the case of a Money Bill? I should have thought that it might arise in six weeks.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00588"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: Supposing this House rejects a Bill and two years hence that Bill becomes law. The noble Viscount says that before that time he will bring in some phraseology altering the enacting part of the Bill. This House may refuse to accept the alteration, and so far as I can see this situation will arise. The Bill has been refused three times by this House, but under the Parliament Bill it will become law, though the enacting part will not have been then accepted by this House. Unless you bring it in at the same time the two years will not run from the same period, and the Bill will then become law "by and with the consent of your Lordships" although that consent has been got practically at the point of the bayonet. I do not pretend to understand anything about legal matters, but I ask the noble and learned Viscount opposite, if he has got consent at the point of the bayonet, whether at law such consent is of any value whatever; and I should like further to ask him whether an Act passed against the consent of this House and with the present enacting clause really becomes an Act which the general public need take any notice of at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00589"><member>LORD STANMORE</member><membercontribution>: The strongest point in favour of the noble Earl's Amendment is that every year there must be a Finance Bill.

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00590"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, considering that you are about six to one of us I think your Lordships might approach the consideration of this Bill upon the hypothesis that we really do not necessarily wish to include lies in an Act of Parliament. Of course we do not want to do anything of the kind, and it can be no profit to any human being to put in a formula which is not an accurate statement of the facts. Surely there can be no deep design in our objecting to an Amendment of this kind. It is quite clear that something will have to be provided either in this Bill or in some other Bill. That has always been admitted in the House of Commons. If you like to put this Amendment in, it may be considered necessary on Report to alter it; but as to asking our consent, it seems that it does not matter in the least what the Government say. We are told repeatedly that we are desperately wicked and will not consent to this, that, or the other, but your Lordships have the power and can do exactly as you think right.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00591"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we do not wish to argue this matter upon the footing which the noble and learned Lord has just described. What we do feel is that we ought not to asked to agree to the use of an enacting formula which will not only be absurd hereafter but will place this House in a very false position indeed. My noble friend said that the formula would be untruthful, and the noble Viscount had to admit that Lord Camperdown's point was a natural and good point. He said that it was the intention of His Majesty's Government to meet the point by legislation, and that they hoped to be able to discover a uniform formula which would be applicable to all legislation. He further observed that he hoped to discover it before any case could arise under the Bill we are now discussing. Upon that my noble friend on the Cross Benches pointed out very pertinently that in the case of a Money Bill the issue might be raised long before the expiration of the two years, or whatever period the noble Viscount had in view. What we want to know is, How are you going to deal with a Money Bill next year? Do you propose to use the old formula, which I venture to describe as in the circumstances a very misleading and absurd one?</membercontribution></p>

years, for which I may say I was responsible, was really in relation to Bills coining under Clause 2. As regards Clause 1, if a Money Bill is not accepted by your Lordships within a month by that time I should think we would be able to draw up a formula which would contain no misstatement. But I hope there is no probability of your Lordships throwing out another Money Bill within the next two years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00593"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I jump at the first notion of any offer of conciliation. I am quite willing to accept what the noble and learned Lord has said, and I will withdraw my Amendment on the present occasion. But I repeat that every word I have said is justified by facts. With regard to the noble Viscount's idea that he can invent one formula which will correctly describe Bills passed by one House and Bills passed by the two, he has, as we know, a very fertile mind, and I have no doubt, if anybody can, that he will succeed in drawing up a formula of that sort. But I do say that this Amendment ought to be inserted, because you are creating by this Bill a new kind of Act of Parliament. That is an undoubted fact, and if you apply the existing formula to the new kind of Act of Parliament you will be stating that this House has given its consent when it has done nothing of the sort. It is not sufficient to say we must look forward to some alteration in the future. I always observe when there is anything brought home in this House to noble Lords opposite and remedies are proposed, we are relegated to the dismal and uncertain future to have them carried out. I venture to hope, therefore, that on Report the noble Viscount will be successful in producing a formula. No one will be more pleased than I shall if he succeeds. I will withdraw my Amendment on this occasion, but will put it down again on Report.</membercontribution></p>

I shall not attempt any flights of eloquence, but will tell you in a few plain words the object I have in view. Neither shall I weary you by quoting pages from Lecky and other distinguished authors, and I hope I shall be saved from the temptation of referring to such a remote subject as marriage with a deceased wife's sister, as has been done in the course of the debate in the last few days. I do not think that the point to which I wish to call attention has been previously referred to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00607">Under Clause 1 of this Bill your Lordships will be deprived once and for all of the privilege, enjoyed by almost every British citizen, of having a voice in the taxation of the country. Your Lordships are expected to pay taxes and perform all the duties of citizenship, but you are being relegated to a class of political outcasts. You are not allowed to express any opinion whatever on the taxes which are to be laid on your shoulders. And Clause 2,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0171"/>
<col>333</col>
although to a lesser extent, will also considerably affect and reduce your right as British citizens of a voice in the management of the affairs of the country, and I am surprised that a Party professing themselves as the champions of liberty and enfranchisement should be guilty of practically disfranchising 600 of His Majesty's subjects. I am surprised at the indifference&#x2014;I might say the almost callous indifference&#x2014;displayed by the Government in this matter, I wonder what would be their attitude if we were depriving a considerable number of seamen, or dockworkers, or railway men, or any other class of the body politic of their rights or their votes. When it comes to Peers, however, it seems to be regarded by His Majesty's Ministers as a matter of no account whatever. I am sure they will pardon me if I say that I can only attribute it to some vindictive purpose&#x2014;I hope I am wrong&#x2014;to pay out members of this House for not agreeing with them in their political opinions by saying that in future they should not enjoy the same political rights as are now enjoyed by the humblest working men.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00608">What have your Lordships done that we should be utterly deprived of this right? Can anyone for one moment assert that members of this House are any less intelligent, or less honest politically, or less honourable, or&#x2014;may I add&#x2014;even less patriotic, than the rest of our fellow-countrymen? Reference has been made this evening to the considerable number of additions to your Lordships' House since the present Government has been in power. I wonder what those newly-made Peers think of the Government's proposals. I wonder if they have any sense of the fact that they will be freed from all duties and all responsibilities to the public in the future, or practically so. I wonder what their feelings are on entering a House so emasculated and deprived of all powers and functions of government. In some cases they may not be sorry; it may afford them an opportunity of devoting the whole of their time to amassing wealth; and in the case of younger men the opportunity may be seized of saying, "Nothing is expected of us. We will therefore devote our lives to pleasure and amusement; we have no longer any responsibility to the State or the country," and probably what will happen will be that they will spend the money their father made.</p>

Personally I will not be satisfied with being denied what I consider are my rights as a British citizen, and if I am deprived of those rights on the present occasion I shall not cease to take every step I can to have them restored to me. The reasons which have been given by the Government in objecting to some of the other Amendments do not apply in this case. This is not a root and branch Amendment and does not affect any of the principles of the Bill, and I hope I shall not be told that I am proposing a Constitutional revolution. I admit that it would be a large Constitutional change, but, as we have been told in the course of this debate, no change could be of greater Constitutional importance than the one proposed by this Bill. If we embark on revolutionary changes of this kind nobody must be surprised if further changes are proposed to meet the altered circumstances. I sincerely hope also that I shall not be told that this matter will receive consideration on some future occasion. On the very day that any Bill of this nature becomes law our rights and privileges as British citizens will be to a large extent taken from us, and I maintain that we are entitled to have at least some part of them restored to us.</p>

I think it should be received favourably by His Majesty's Government, as it affects particularly one part of the great Constitutional question which is now troubling us. The Government are always telling us that there is a great difference between the numbers of noble Lords who support them and those who support the Opposition, and it seems to me that if this Amendment is adopted the position will be changed, because noble Lords on this side will think it very little use sitting in this House with the restricted powers proposed by the Bill whereas the opinion of noble Lords opposite is that there are still

valuable duties which can be performed here. In those circumstances it seems to me we shall see a depletion of the benches occupied by the noble Marquess and his supporters, and in a very short time I have no doubt the numbers on both sides would approach equality.

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00612"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is to me a very interesting Amendment, because I recollect in my earliest days in the House of Commons bringing in a Bill enabling Members of this House to get seats in the House of Commons. I forget why I did not proceed with it, but I do remember an ultra-Radical saying that he did not think he would support my Bill, because, as he said, "those men will be very awkward customers to us as rival candidates, and you had better leave the matter alone." There is one feature in Lord Barnard's proposal which I never thought a possible element in any operation of this sort. I refer to the words which seem to imply that after a Peer has tried to get into the House of Commons, or has got in and has afterwards been put out by his constituency, he is to come back to this House&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

All these points, however, are really irrelevant to-night, because they are wholly outside the scope of the Bill. This is a Bill for limiting some of the powers of your Lordships' House. It deals with powers and not with qualifications, and the noble Lord is surely wholly wrong when he says that this is a Bill disfranchising members of this House.

At the same time I trust he will make it clear that he means to shut out the possibility of noble Lords who have stood for and taken a seat in the House of Commons coming back to this House, because it would be grossly unfair if they could change in and out after losing an election. I would point out to the noble Viscount opposite that he has rather sold the pass on one point. Members of the other House have been constantly in the constituencies heaving abuse on noble Lords here. We have been called "backwoodsmen" and described as quite inefficient for our duties, whereas it has just been admitted by the noble Viscount himself that we would prove very dangerous as rival candidates at an election. You cannot have your cake and eat it. The Peers must either be the fools they are represented to be or efficient individuals able to fight an election, and I would point out that if this contention of the noble Viscount is correct&#x2014;that they would be dangerous rivals in the constituencies&#x2014;the treatment accorded to them by His Majesty's Government is even more harsh than one at first imagines. The Government are going to take away their powers and at the same time make them the only individuals who cannot take any active and real part in the government of the country. As to this question being outside the scope of the Bill, I am quite ready to concede that, but unless we fight for getting this done now we shall never have a chance of getting it done in the future. I therefore advise the noble Lord to go to a Division now while we still have a portion of our powers left. I trust that this Amendment will commend itself to the Front Bench below me. We on the Back Benches never know whether the Front Bench are going to sell the pass or not. We see them constantly going to the Table and thumping upon it with simulated enthusiasm in favour of one thing and another, but we never know whether they are going back on what
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0173"/>

they have said, and we should like to know whether any noble Lord who wishes to continue his Parliamentary life will have an opportunity of exhibiting his forensic ability elsewhere.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00618"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I confess I sympathise with a good deal that has been said about this Amendment. There is no doubt that His Majesty's Government are proposing to take away most valuable legislative privileges from the members of this House and leave them absolutely without the power of representing either their own interests or those of their fellow-countrymen in dealing with the taxation which the other House will alone impose. That is a grossly unjust position, and to my mind it is the strongest argument that can be brought forward for the very early introduction of a Bill giving those Peers who cannot obtain seats in this House the opporutnity which the noble Lord desires for them of seeking a place in the other House. Having said that, I hope the noble Lord will not prejudice his case by pressing this Amendment. I think it is impossible for any reasonable person not to see&#x2014;and it was admitted by the last speaker&#x2014;that this proposal cannot come within the scope of this Bill. I therefore think the noble Lord will only prejudice his own case, which I admit is an extremely strong one, if he asks us to divide on this Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00619"><member>LORD ST. DAVIDS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is only one suggestion I would make to noble Lords opposite, and it is this. It does appear to me that the noble Lord who moved the Amendment made out a practically unanswerable case, but at the same time he himself admits that his wishes are not fully expressed in his Amendment and that it will have to be altered before it will carry out his intention. As the noble Viscount opposite has just said, this Amendment does not come within the scope of the Bill, and I would therefore suggest to noble Lords opposite that as they have the Government in a yielding mood on this point they should carry out their object by trying to induce the Government to help forward in the House of Commons a Bill on the lines suggested by the Amendment of the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00620"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is always a little difficult to follow the line of argument of noble Lords who have
<col>338</col>
just taken their seats in this House, because on this particular question they gave us no assistance whatever in the House of Commons when they were there and when we were endeavouring to obtain this very reform. I am glad to find myself for once on this subject in agreement with the noble Viscount behind me. Some years ago when three members now sitting on this Bench did their utmost to obtain this very reform, the noble Viscount told them in the bluntest manner that they were glad to get rid of them in the House of Commons, and that they had better stay in this House and be content.<lb/>
There is no question whatever that my noble friend Lord Barnard has a very strong case indeed. I venture to say there is not a man on this side of the House who does not regard his position under this Bill, if it passes, as being an intolerable one. I do not think noble Lords opposite can appreciate the vehemence of our feelings on this subject. Money Bills represent one-third or one-fourth of our legislation, and yet a Peer is to be shut up here and debarred from touching them; and with regard to the remaining legislation, three-fourths of the power which this House has is to be taken away from it. And yet you ask a number of men who have had long experience of the House of Commons and long public experience in office and in this House to sit down under these limitations, to be content with them, and to thank the Government for what has been left to them. We do not believe that this can be permanent. Your proposal is so one-sided that in the last week you have not been able to establish it in debate. Indeed, we have reason to complain that some members of the Front Bench opposite were not present when the most important parts of the debates have been going on, and we know that some of their supporters have not been present here at all. The Government have created Peers for the purpose of supporting their measures in this House, and they have shown by not being present that they do not appreciate the legislation which you have asked them to support. I repeat that forcing us to remain here in these large numbers, unable to do anything effective for the legislation of the country, creates an intolerable position and one which cannot continue. However, I quite agree with the noble Viscount behind me, Lord St. Aldwyn, that it would be impossible to reconcile
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0174"/>
<col>339</col>
this particular provision with the Preamble of the Bill. That being so, I trust my noble friend, being fully assured&#x2014;however bad the opinion which Lord Lovat entertains of the backbone of the Front Opposition Bench in this particular&#x2014;that we are to be relied upon to carry out to the full the view which he has expressed and which has already found its place in my noble friend Lord Lansdowne's Bill&#x2014;will not think it necessary to divide.</membercontribution></p>

My chief reason for the proposal is this. Very often when there is another Bill brought in there is a tendency on the part of the Government to only repeal some portion of the previous Bill. That creates a lot of confusion in the future. It also seems to me very important indeed, when you are going into the question of the powers of the Second Chamber, that you should start with an absolutely clean slate, and that everything should be embodied in one and the same Act of Parliament. The Secretary of State for War assured us that this Bill was only a temporary one, and that His Majesty's Government were going to bring in a Bill to reconstitute the Second Chamber. Feeling as I do that there should be an absolutely clean slate I beg to move the Amendment standing in my name, and I think it will very much simplify the procedure when the time arrives.</p>

My noble friend behind me, it is true in only a few sentences, has raised a very important
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0175"/>
<col>341</col>
question, and one which I think might well have been deserving of rather serious and long discussion at the hands of your Lordships. My noble friend has placed an Amendment on the Paper to the effect that the provisions of this Act shall continue in force until such date as the House of Lords is reconstituted under an Act which His Majesty's Government have promised to introduce. That really is a question of the most vital moment, because it raises the whole issue of the nature of the pledge given by the Government for the reconstitution of the Second Chamber.<lb/>
As to the period within which that pledge is to be redeemed and as to the question whether this Bill is or is not regarded by the Government as a transitory measure, I would not presume upon the first question to doubt for a moment the sincerity of His Majesty's advisers. The words of the Prime Minister, over and over again repeated in the House of Commons, assure us that in the view of the Government it is a pledge of honour on their part that they will introduce a Bill for the reconstitution of this House. But when we come to the question of the date at which that promise is to take effect, His Majesty's Government have spoken in more uncertain tones. I could, if I had the time, read out to your Lordships various obscure and indecisive and sometimes inconsistent utterances by His Majesty's Ministers in the House of Commons on the matter; but they have committed themselves to this undertaking&#x2014; that they will within the lifetime of the present Parliament introduce a Bill for the reconstitution of the Second Chamber.<lb/>
But no promise has been given to carry such a Bill through the House of Commons. The mere promise to introduce the Bill there within the next four years does not carry us very far, because there is not one of us who does not know&#x2014;allowing everything for the good faith of His Majesty's Government, as I am quite willing to do&#x2014;that considerations will be at work in the House of Commons which will militate against the fulfilment of that pledge. There are plenty of supporters of His Majesty's Government in the House of Commons who will be anxious to extend the period of interregnum in order to get as much of the legislation that they favour carried within
<col>342</col>
it as they possibly can, and I doubt very much oven in the most favourable circumstances, if His Majesty's Government could command the numbers and the strength to enable them to carry a Reform Bill of this kind in the House of Commons. If that be so, how extremely important it is that now, on the last occasion that is open to us, we should get some indication from His Majesty's Government of what their real views are as to the temporary or permanent nature of these provisions. The whole; case of the Government up to this time has been that these powers are being withdrawn from the House of Lords and added to the House of Commons because of the opinion they hold as to the character, composition, and prejudices of this House. Is it not clear, therefore, that if you constitute a new Second Chamber on a more representative and democratic basis the case for restoring those powers is complete? I would ask His Majesty's Government when we may hope to receive their Bill, and whether they accept our interpretation of their case that the provisions of the Bill are temporary provisions only?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00632"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I should have been sorry if the noble Viscount did not; otherwise I should have been tempted to say that His Majesty's Government had been guilty of a breach of faith to the country. We are all of opinion that these provisions are temporary only, and I think we should have some acknowledgment of the fact. I am not quite certain that the noble Viscount's words carry out fully his own intention. He proposes that the provisions of the Act shall continue in force until such date as the House of Lords is reconstituted under an Act which has been consented to by both Houses of Parliament and no longer. But, even allowing to the fullest degree the serious intentions of His Majesty's Government, it is quite obvious that if for any reason they are compelled to postpone the fulfilment of their pledge this Bill might remain in operation for five years or for an indefinite length of time, and I am sure that is the last thing that my noble friend desires. I would therefore
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0176"/>
<col>343</col>
suggest to him whether he might not amend his Amendment with a view of introducing into it some specified period within which His Majesty's Government might reasonably be asked to carry out their own undertaking. The sort of suggestion I have in view is this, that we might amend the Amendment as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"The provisions of the Act shall continue in force for three years"&#x2014;let us say&#x2014;"or until such time as the House of Lords shall have been reconstituted under an Act which has been consented to by both Houses of Parliament and no longer, whichever is the shorter period."</quote>
I do not know that I attach overwhelming importance to the suggestion of three years, but surely that is a reasonable period within which, if His Majesty's Government remain in power, to ask them to carry out their pledge and send up the Bill they have promised to this House. I think those words will carry out the intention of my noble friend better than the words he has put on the Paper, and I submit them to His Majesty's Government in the hope that they will give us some clearer indication of their views as to the transitory nature of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00637"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: It may be convenient for me to say at this stage that this subject will come up upon the Preamble&#x2014;I do not mean to say effectively&#x2014;in the form of an Amendment. If the noble Viscount wishes to press the Amendment so be it, but, as I say, the subject will come up when the whole of the Preamble is discussed. However, I am quite ready in a few sentences to state our view upon it now. Everybody knows what the nature of our proposals with regard to the Preamble is. The noble Lord has referred to them, and, of course, we adhere to what was said. As regards the question how long this Bill is to remain in force until the other Bill is brought in, I would point out that these two Bills are what I may call twin Bills. It is the same as happens with redistribution on one side and representation on the other. When you bring forward redistribution you are told that you will have to remedy representation, and if you bring forward representation you are told that you have to deal with it together with redistribution. When Mr. Gladstone was faced with the question of Disestablishment in Scotland he said, "I am prepared whenever the Scottish Members will support Disestablishment to bring forward a measure," and each Scottish Member in his constituency said, "I am prepared whenever Mr. Gladstone brings forward a Bill to support that Bill in Parliament, and not before." We think it best to do one thing at a time. We have commenced with the powers of this House, which to our mind is the most important and also the most pressing matter. We do not wish, and do not intend so far as we can help it, to be diverted from that branch of the subject until we have completed it, and when we have done that we intend to take up the other branch of the subject&#x2014;the reconstitution of your Lordships' House. That is an open statement of our position, and I do not think there is any difficulty in understanding either the strategy or the necessity for it.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0009P0I0177"/>
<col>345</col>
this House. It falls to my lot, I think, more often than to that of any other member of this House, to keep a debate going until their Lordships have returned from refreshment. But very different qualities are required to speak after dinner in ordinary life from what are required to speak after dinner in your Lordships' House. Although those qualities are different, I think they are equally deserving of credit and approbation. As a matter of fact, those qualities are precisely the reverse of each other. To be a successful after-dinner speaker in ordinary life you need to be brief, you need to be witty, and you need to be to the point in your remarks. But to be an after-dinner speaker in your Lordships' House you need to be precisely the reverse. You have to be prolix, perhaps even to the extent of being tedious; and with that, of course, it is impossible to be witty, for brevity is the very soul of wit, and generally it is impossible really to be very much to the point when you are obliged to fulfil the condition I have named.<lb/>
I hope the noble and learned Lord on the Government Bench (the Lord Chancellor) will forgive me if I address myself to him, seeing that with one exception he is the only representative of His Majesty's Government present at this moment. It is also the case that he was the last speaker before the adjournment for dinner. As far as I remember, what the noble and learned Lord said was this. He called the Bill which we are discussing and the Bill which is foreshadowed in the Preamble twin Bills. That is a new idea, and it certainly struck me very much indeed when he gave utterance to it. It is one to which I think it is worth while to call attention in order that we may get at the meaning of the noble and learned Lord, for I confess his meaning was not entirely clear to me. I believe the noble and learned Lord was somewhat hampered by his courteous consideration for the convenience of members of this House. He knew that noble Lords were in a hurry, and he did not explain himself so fully as he usually does. When I say that, I am far from suggesting that the noble and learned Lord ever says a superfluous word. I am not going to flatter&#x2014;it is not my custom to do so&#x2014;but I really mean that there is no member of your Lordships' House who is more concise, more concentrated, and more clear in his language.<lb/>
<col>346</col>
The noble and learned Lord proceeded to illustrate what is meant by twin Bills. The illustration he gave us&#x2014;I hope he will correct me if I misquote him&#x2014;was one which was concerned with Mr. Gladstone and a Scottish Disestablishment Bill. He told us Mr. Gladstone said of that Bill that he would do what the Scottish Members wished, and the Scottish Members said they would do what Mr. Gladstone wished. That was an interesting story, but I confess that since I heard it I have been puzzling my mind very much as to what on earth was the point in it. What was the allusion which the noble and learned Lord wished us to gather? I can only put one interpretation on it, and it is this&#x2014;that it is the most frank, perhaps the only, admission we have yet had of the relations which exist between His Majesty's Government and the members of the Irish Nationalist Party. If we are to follow the illustration, the Government say they will do what the Irish Nationalist Members wish, and the Irish Members, according to the noble and learned Lord, say they will do what His Majesty's Government wish. Here surely is log-rolling extraordinary. It is a real illustration of the old and homely adage, "you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours." I really think the Lord Chancellor is a little bit over-sanguine. I can well believe, in fact I have not the slightest doubt that His Majesty's Government will do what the Irish Nationalists wish. We all know that. We have never had the slightest doubt about it, although there have been denials. But I am not so sure that the Irish Members will do what His Majesty's Government wish, and it is in that respect I think that the noble and learned Lord is over-sanguine. I think that there his illustration fails.<lb/>
The Lord Chancellor went on, to explain, in terms which were far too brief and which were unhappily cut short, that the Government are proceeding by stages in this matter; that they are dealing with this grave Constitutional question in two stages. The first is to deal with the powers of the Second Chamber and the second is to deal with the composition of the Upper House. The noble and learned Lord said that with tremendous solemnity, and for a moment I was almost deluded into the belief that he was enunciating some statement of policy which was new to us, and was of great importance. But after a
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0178"/>
<col>347</col>
little reflection I realised that we have known that for a very long time. Not only have we heard it before, but we are actually faced by the fact. We can see it for ourselves. I was disappointed with the statement of the noble and learned Lord for what we wanted to know, and what he did not tell us, was whether the second stage&#x2014;the stage of dealing with the composition of the Second Chamber&#x2014;would involve any modifications of the first stage. That is the point of this discussion, and we wish to continue the discussion on the Amendment of my noble friend in order that we may elicit a little more information on that point. It is really of immense importance.<lb/>
On the face of it this Bill is a temporary, a provisional, and transient measure, and we cannot doubt that what is written in the Bill expresses the intentions of His Majesty's Government. If that is so, surely we have a right to know what the next stage will be. If this is a temporary and provisional expedient, surely before embarking on a policy of such immense importance and so far-reaching in its effect His Majesty's Government, as all statesmen or men of business or men of common-sense would do, have looked a little ahead and have seen what the next step will be. Why do they not take us into their confidence? I venture to suggest it is hardly frank, it is hardly fair, either to this House or, what is still more important, to the country at large. You are seeking to alter the Constitution of this country which has existed for eight centuries, and to alter it in a manner which, to put it briefly, for I do not want to dwell on the point, has absolutely no parallel either in history or in the present circumstances of any other civilised country. Yet while doing this you will not tell us what the next step is to be. Either His Majesty's Government have a plan for the reconstitution of this House or they have not. It is hardly conceivable that they have no such plan. If they have a plan, why in the name of common-sense will they not tell us what it is and what it involves? Surely that is the only frank, the only fair the only honest and statesmanlike course to take. At least they should tell us what are the reasons for this secrecy.<lb/>
There has not hitherto been such reticence or secrecy in regard to domestic legislation. We can understand His Majesty's Government preserving a discreet
<col>348</col>
silence in regard to any matter affecting international relations or diplomacy. We can understand them maintaining an air of secrecy on a strategical question in connection with the conduct of a campaign; but in regard to domestic legislation of such enormous importance as this, I say with sincerity and candour that this secrecy is really absolutely incomprehensible. I think we have a right, not only on our own account but on account of the people of this country, whom so far as we are members of a Second Chamber we represent, to demand that that information should be given to us. That is all I have to say in reply to the noble and learned Lord, who no doubt would have made a fuller statement if the arrival of the dinner hour had not unfortunately cut short the interesting speech which he had commenced. But in regard to this point I should like to remind the House what the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, has said, because the question has arisen once or twice before and we have pressed him on it. I hope I am not parodying what he said, but the effect of his words on each occasion has seemed to me to be this, that the Government could not say now what their intentions were as regards the permanence or otherwise of the provisions of the Parliament Bill, but that they must retain a free hand. That, again, seems to me to be a very ingenuous, but a very disquieting admission. It means, if I understand the English language at all, nothing more and nothing less than this. If the Radical Party cannot get a Radical House of Lords when the process of reconstitution and reform takes place, then they will do their best to withhold from the new Second Chamber those powers which are accorded to Second Chambers in every decently-governed civilised nation in the world. But if they succeed by debate, by discussion, by fair means, or means which are not fair, in getting a Second Chamber which is Radical in its complexion, then they will be perfectly willing to accord that new Second Chamber the powers accorded to Second Chambers in other countries. I ask, Is that statesmanship? Is it in accordance with the traditions of statesmanship or good government either in this country or in any other civilised country in the world? I say without the slightest hesitation that it is naked, shameless, Party opportunism.<lb/>
The Liberal Party in the past have often been warned by their great leaders to keep
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0179"/>
<col>349</col>
on the straight path of principle. They have been warned that if they leave the straight path of principle and go into the devious byways of Party and political expediency, then they are running to destruction and ruin. It seems to me that is what they are doing at the present time. They have no principle; at any rate, they will not tell us of any principle on which they are acting. Everything they do, everything they say, leads us irresistibly to the conclusion that their only concern is the present transitory expediency from their own Party point of view. Is that straightforward as regards this nation? When His Majesty's Government tell us that they are dealing first of all with the powers of the House of Lords and secondly with its composition, I am irresistibly reminded of a riddle. I wish the noble and learned Viscount the Secretary of State for War were here, because the riddle which I have in my mind is a German one which he, at any rate, would appreciate. Teutonic wit is not always appreciated in this country, but I remember in my young days this was thought an exceedingly good witticism. The riddle was this, "How do you make a cannon?" The answer was, "You take a hole and pour molten iron round it, and then you get your cannon." It seems to me that in dealing with the question of the reform of the Constitution in the way adopted by the Government you are proceeding in accordance with this German prescription for making a cannon. You arrange your powers first, powers which are intangible and immaterial, and pour round them the material and tangible substance of the composition of the House. A cannon made in that way will not be solid, will not be lasting, will not be effective&#x2014;in fact, I doubt whether it will take shape at all.<lb/>
To turn to another point, I should like to ask His Majesty's Government whether they think this policy will help them to anything more than a temporary retention of place and power? Will it help them with the solution of the Irish problem, in regard to which we know the noble Viscount the Leader of the House is tremendously in earnest? Will it enhance the credit of the Radical Party? Is it, I ask again, in accordance with the traditions of the old Liberal Party to preserve this reticence not to say what you mean, what you intend to do, or what you have in your mind? I am again reminded of an old saying that
<col>350</col>
"Honesty is the best policy." I believe that for the Radical Party at the present time it would be far the best policy to take the nation into their confidence and say exactly what their intentions are and how they mean to carry them out. If we cannot be told what those intentions are, at any rate let the Government give us some explanation why they cannot tell the people of this country what they intend to do, how they intend to do it, and when they intend to do it. I for one cannot believe for a moment that the nation will long rest content with the answer "Wait and see," which is given in response to every suggestion we make, however reasonably it is put forward, and however conciliatory and temperate may be the tone in which it is submitted. In spite of the fact that suggestions are made in accordance with our duty to Parliament and our duty towards the nation, the only answer we get is, "Wait and see." That may serve for a while, but I cannot believe, for I have a strong faith in the robust common sense and the innate appreciation of fair play of the people of this country, that the nation will long rest satisfied with being put off with such an answer on a matter of the most vital and important concern to the nation.</membercontribution></p>

The original Amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Galway was, for reasons which seemed obvious to us, considered inadequate to effect the purpose which he had in view, and an Amendment in a different form was suggested by my noble friend Lord Curzon. Under that Amendment, as I understand it, the Bill on the Table, were it to become law, would have a limit assigned to its operation, not a single limit as proposed by my noble friend behind me, but a two-fold limit. It would remain in operation either for a period of three years, or until such time
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0180"/>
<col>351</col>
as His Majesty's Government have been able to effect the reconstitution of the House of Lords; and my noble friend stipulates that that limit should be whichever of the two periods is the shorter. That is a very important proposal, and surely it is one which deserves some examination at the hands of noble Lords opposite. We have already elicited this from the noble and learned Lord. He regards the Bill on the Table, the Bill which is in existence, and that other Bill which is not yet in existence but which is to be called into existence before long&#x2014;the Bill dealing with the reform of the House of Lords&#x2014;as twin Bills. That is a very remarkable expression. It is a very unambiguous expression. I do not suggest that it is a case of Siamese twins, but twins in the usual sense of the word. We have throughout insisted on that view. We have throughout insisted that it was impossible to deal with the question of the alteration of the powers of this House except in connection with the other question, that of the reconstitution of this House.<lb/>
Therefore we have again and again insisted, and I do not think we have been really contradicted by noble Lords opposite, that we were justified in treating the Bill on the Table as merely a provisional Bill. It must be obvious to anybody that if this Bill is to be defended at all it can only be defended as a provisional and interim arrangement. After all, what is the real point against the House of Lords? It is that it is unfairly constituted as between the two political Parties, and that we have taken advantage of that unfair constitution in order to obstruct the progress of Liberal legislation. We do not admit the charge for a moment. But assume that that is the charge. Is it not quite obvious that from the moment when the inequality is removed, from the moment when this House is fairly reconstituted as between the great political Parties, the necessity for imposing upon this House the extraordinary disabilities, the humiliating disabilities, which this Bill contains ceases to exist and disappears? That seems to me such an obvious proposition that I really cannot conceive that noble Lords opposite would seriously dispute it. What was the noble Viscount's comment upon that proposition? The noble Viscount will correct me if I do not quote him accurately. He said that in
<col>352</col>
the view of His Majesty's Government it may or may not be desirable that the policy of this Bill shall be made to extend beyond the period of restriction. May or may not be desirable! That is, it seems to me, a most unreasonable demand for latitude on the part of His Majesty's Government, and it is the more unreasonable because the noble and learned Lord told us earlier in the evening that His Majesty's Government have got their plan for reforming this House.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00643"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble and learned Lord used words which would certainly suggest that idea.

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00645"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: How, as my noble friend suggests, could one of the pair have been produced apparently in full vigour&#x2014;though not a very ornamental infant I must say&#x2014;whereas the other twin is apparently in a dormant and suppressed condition? I will not pursue the metaphor, because I see a noble Lord on the Back Bench (Lord Ilkeston) who would probably find some fault with my metaphor if I did. But I do venture in seriousness to say that our claim that this should be treated as a provisional measure and that therefore a time limit of some kind should be imposed is a most reasonable claim. We suggest a time limit which appears to us to be reasonable and appropriate. That is really the effect of the Amendment as amended by my noble friend Lord Curzon, and it is an Amendment on which we desire to obtain some expression of the views of His Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00646"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have unfortunately trespassed against a precept which was instilled into me in early youth at the great college with which the noble Marquess and the noble Earl, Lord
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0181"/>
<col>353</col>
Camperdown, are not, unfamiliar, by a very great master. He said, to me, "Never make use of any metaphors." I have made use of a metaphor, departing from the injunctions which were laid upon me, and the noble Marquess has made a very adroit use of it. When I spoke of twin Bills I meant, of course, that the one Bill is here in the body and the other is projected in the Preamble; and whether my metaphor was accurate or not, I think the sense of what I meant was pretty clear. The real truth is, of course, that we are bent on dealing with one side of this subject&#x2014;namely, the powers of the Second Chamber. I think the noble Marquess will recognise that when you have this task on hand you will immediately divert attention and produce endless controversy and dialectics upon the other side, which has not yet been brought forward or discussed at the instigation of His Majesty's Government, if you hamper the present discussion by a forecast of what may come hereafter. In accordance with the dictates of the most common prudence we wish to keep our attention for the present fixed on the one side of this question. In the Preamble we have stated our intentions. They are, of course, the intentions of the Government and have been confirmed by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons in language that is quite clear. While apologising for making use of a metaphor and expressing the hope that it may never occur again, I cannot add anything further to what has been said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00647"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: Apparently I can only speak again with the leave of the House, and I am not anxious to continue the discussion; but we are really left in rather a peculiar position. The noble and learned Lord opposite employed a metaphor at an earlier stage of the evening contrary to the advice given to him by his Oxford mentor and mine. But do not let the House conceal the fact that the disappearance of the metaphor from the scene has left us with no real information as to His Majesty's Government's intentions. We are driven back now on the Preamble and the statement of the Prime Minister with regard to the Preamble, but these statements, explicit as they are as to the intention of the Government, give us no guarantee whatever as to the length of time during which these provisions are to apply. That is the difficulty which I sought to meet by my Amendment to the Amendment of the
<col>354</col>
noble Viscount behind me, and it is an Amendment which I believe the majority of your Lordships' House would not only be willing to consider, but to carry. I feel, however, a certain difficulty in asking your Lordships to proceed to a Division on an Amendment which I think is important in a House so sparsely attended, and when, owing to the hour at which we are sitting, some prominent members are absent. My suggestion, therefore, would be that my noble friend should not proceed with the Amendment at the present time, but that we should read in print the words of the Lord Chancellor spoken a little earlier in the evening and reserve to ourselves the right, if it seems best after consideration, to bring up the matter again on Report.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00651">The noble Earl said: This Amendment is a very simple one. It is merely for the purpose of clearing up exactly what is meant by a Public Bill. As this Bill was originally drawn the word "Bill" alone appeared in Clause 2, but after discussion in the other House the word "Public" was added. It does not appear quite certain that the words "Public Bill" exclude private Bills, or at all events private Bills which are half public and half private. There is also another form of Bill known as a Provisional Order, which is carried out by means of a Bill, and which I believe is not intended by the Government or by any one to be included. I am not at all confident that the terms of my Amendment are quite right, but it is a point on which I think the Chairman of Committees could very likely give the House valuable assistance. I do not know whether the noble Earl, Lord Donoughmore, feels himself in a position to say anything with regard to the Amendment, but if he can I think he is the person who is most likely to tell us what really ought to be done in a matter of this sort.</p>

I have, of course, consulted my advisers on the point, and we have come to the conclusion that, whilst the private; Bill procedure of your Lordships' House would not come under the provisions of this Bill, there are certain Bills which, in the language of the noble Earl's Amendment, are founded upon a petition to either House of Parliament which might come under this Bill. Some of these proceed as private Bills and some do not. On the other hand, there is no doubt whatever that Provisional Order Bills, although practically private Bills in their procedure, are public Bills and would undoubtedly come, we think, under the provisions of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00660"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member> had an Amendment on the Paper to insert the following new clauses&#x2014;
<quote>A.&#x2014;His Majesty, notwithstanding any Constitutional usage which has hitherto obtained, may, without the advice of a Minister, submit to the Parliamentary electors by means of a Referendum any question; but at least one hundred and eighty days shall elapse between any two submissions to the electors under the foregoing provision.

Provided that nothing herein contained shall prevent the dissolution of any Parliament which has lasted less than one year if that Parliament is dissolved in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister.</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00661">The noble Lord said: With the permission of the Committee I wish to add the words "or Joint Committee" after the words "Prime Minister" at the end of my proposed Clause A. A year ago I should never have thought of putting such clauses on the Paper. But from the time that the Government introduced their Parliament Bill the whole of the conditions of our Constitutional existence have changed. Written laws are now to be substituted for custom. If part of our Constitution is to be written, the whole of it must be reconsidered and not merely such portions of it as may suit one Party. I expect to be told that my Amendments attack the whole theory of the British Constitution. But the Government is bent on destroying it root and branch by upsetting its balance and depriving the people of any chance of exercising their right of being consulted before the passing of important measures, as they leave no body, either hereditary or elected, with the power of insisting that they shall be consulted when the powers of this House are curtailed.</p>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0183"/>
<col>357</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00662">The Government are throwing the whole of the Constitution into a witches' cauldron which already contains such noxious ingredients as "Gag," "Guillotine," and "Kangaroo" closures. What will eventually come out of it in three years' time it is hard to know. I understood the noble Viscount to say that he disapproved of the Referendum because it would over-ride the opinion of the House of Commons. Well, that is exactly what it ought to do. A vote of the House of: Commons cannot have anything like the moral authority of a vote by Referendum until seats are redistributed according to population and proportional voting is established. At one stroke the Referendum gets rid of the over-representation of Kilkenny and of the Irish Home Rulers, and of the under representation of Romford and of Irish Unionists. Incidentally it also abolishes plural voting, which ought to recommend it to democrats.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00663">From the speech of the noble Viscount on Lord Avebury's Amendment, I think it is now perfectly clear that the majority of the House of Commons mean to keep the power of prolonging their own existence up their sleeve, ready for use in case of a Party emergency. If they never mean to exercise that power why insist on taking it? The noble Viscount said that that Amendment showed a complete distrust of the House of Commons. But the demand of the Government is merely a political form of the confidence trick by which foolish young men are induced to trust their purses to strangers in public houses. If this Bill passes unaltered we shall be at the commencement of what may or may not be a Long Parliament. There is nothing but the discretion of the present Government to prevent its becoming so. History shows that when rulers have commenced great reforms they become maddened at the idea that statesmen not in sympathy with their ideas may succeed them and prevent their intentions from being completely carried out. When in that frame of mind, it is easy for them to think it right to take any steps, however wrong they may be. Under such circumstances absolute Monarchs have killed their eldest sons. The Government at present declare that neither they nor the members of the other House would think of prolonging the life of a House of Commons, but in a year's time they may be in such a position as to have to declare that "circumstances alter cases." The Long Parliament began with excellent intentions and did useful
<col>358</col>
work during the first five months of its existence, which is more than I can say of the present Parliament. But it would not allow fresh elections to take place for fear of its work being undone.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00664">The reason that I cannot put any trust in the discretion of the present Government is that I consider they commenced their career in this Parliament by deceiving the people. When they went to the country they declared to win on the "abolition of the hereditary principle in the Second Chamber." It is true that the Parliament Bill had been printed before; the election, but it had not been completely discussed in either House, and the chief cry on their platforms was "Abolition of the hereditary principle." But the moment that all the votes or seats that, they had wished to get had been duly booked, they scratched "Abolition of the hereditary principle," turned it out to graze in a clover field, and declared to win with "Single Chamber" in the first race, and "Home Rule" in the second race. They have further intimated that "Abolition of the hereditary principle" is to remain at grass for an indefinite period. From what the noble and learned Lord said I gather it is now their intention to take it from grass and put it into training again, but no exact date was given when that is to be done. Such conduct would not meet with approval on a race-course. Having strayed so far from the path of rectitude at the very commencement of their rule, to what depths may they not descend in the course of a year or two? Able to bribe the members of the existing House by an offer to double or treble the present salaries of &#x00A3;400 a year, with a firm conviction that their own prosperity and that of the people is bound up with their continuance in office, what likelihood is there of their being able to resist the temptation of putting aside their quinquennial innovation and making a permanency of the present House of Commons? If this Bill passes, what is there to prevent the House of Commons making itself into a close and self-elected corporation, and filling up its own vacancies? We have been told that public opinion would never permit such a usurpation of authority. But if all legal means of preventing a prolongation of the life of the House of Commons is taken from the people, what remedy is left to public opinion but that of raising barricades and using rifles in the streets? Hitherto the people of this
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0184"/>
<col>359</col>
country have been a law-abiding people, but it is hard to say what they will do if you pass unjust laws without giving them an opportunity of rejecting them. Whether the War Minister has in him the making of a Cromwell and whether he would be, able to put down any such rising with a new model Territorial Army entirely composed of Socialists I do not yet know, and I would rather not have the opportunity of ascertaining.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00665">From the legal point of view the King can do no wrong. But this maxim is singularly at variance with the generally accepted theory of our hitherto unwritten Constitution, which is that the King can do nothing at all without the advice of a Minister, with, perhaps, the single exception of dissolving Parliament. But if, under present conditions, the King were to dissolve Parliament in defiance of the advice given by the present Prime Minister, or of that offered by a future Prime Minister chosen from the ranks of those who are now sitting on the Opposition Benches, I am certain that he would be accused by some people of acting unconstitutionally. The Government is engaged in destroying part of our Constitution, and it proposes nothing in the way of reconstruction. The power of consulting the people must reside somewhere outside a Single Chamber. If these clauses are accepted they will tend to prevent conflicts arising between the House of Commons on one side and the King and people on another. It has been loudly declared that if this House does not accept this Bill in the exact shape in which it left another place, 500 Peers are to be created. Next year if this House refuses to pass a Home Rule Bill this threat is certain to be renewed. You surely do not expect that Mr. Redmond and Mr. Dillon will continue to give you their support for two years after you have passed a Home Rule Bill that has not become an Act of Parliament. They will insist upon its becoming law at once, and a fresh Constitutional crisis will arise. Ought not His Majesty to have the Constitutional power of consulting his people if approached by a Prime Minister with such a demand, or by demands still more outrageous&#x2014;such as the prolongation of the life of an unpopular House of Commons beyond the statutory limit, or a Bill for the total abolition of the Second Chamber?</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00666">The objection, has been raised that if this clause became law and the Crown
<col>360</col>
were to insist on, a Referendum the Prime Minister would resign and the Opposition would not dare to take office. I think that in most cases the Prime Minister would prefer to remain in office, as is the practice in Australia when polls of the people go against the Government. At any rate a Dissolution would settle the question. But the consequence would be that the wishes of the people would be carried out in all important matters, whereas if the Parliament Bill becomes law in its present shape this is most unlikely. The knowledge that the King might either call for a Referendum or a Dissolution would make a Prime Minister more cautious as to what advice he gave, and therefore I think that the Crown would seldom require to make use of these clauses. If these rights were only exercised once in fifty years it would be a sufficient justification for these Amendments. I look upon, these clauses as a support to the Throne, and I think that on some future occasion they may prevent its being involved in the fall of some unscrupulous Prime Minister. I have heard that Louis Philippe was in the habit of saying that reigning in a Constitutional country was a very simple matter. All that he had to do was to ask Ministers, <i>Messieurs, avez-vous une majorit&#x00E9;?</i> If the answer was <i>Oui,</i> he replied <i>Alors, j'irai me promener.</i> If the answer was Non, he said to them <i>Allez-vous promener.</i> Unfortunately he acted on this plan too often, and the result was that the Monarchy disappeared at the same time as an unpopular Minister who had a majority in Parliament but not in the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00667">As we are legislating for all time and not merely for the present generation I have, in drawing up this clause, put a time limit to the number of polls of the people or Dissolutions for which the King should have Constitutional authority. I have done this to prevent a dead-lock occurring, which might happen if a very obstinate King were to inherit the Throne at some future period. I scarcely expect these clauses to become law this year, but as there is no finality in, the present Bill I think that the principle of these clauses is one deserving of consideration, and that it should receive attention before these matters are definitely settled, and that some modification of them may eventually form part of our new Constitution. I look upon them as a possible alternative if the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0185"/>
<col>361</col>
Parliament Bill is amended a year hence, and as providing a Constitutional method by which the King could obtain the opinion of his people as to whether he ought to act on the advice of a factious Prime Minister.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00668">My object in moving these Amendments is to make such appeals to the people not only legal but undoubtedly Constitutional. The ancient form of words <i>Le roi s' avisera</i> meets the case exactly, only in this case the advice that he will be able to take will be that of his people direct without the intervention of a Parliamentary caucus that may have lost its influence in the country. There is one point in the manner in which this debate has been carried out which should not escape notice. All through this debate those who sit on this side of the House have been championing the rights of the people. We say that they should be consulted on matters of importance, whereas the Government insist that they shall not. The effect of the Parliament Bill, if passed unaltered, would be to make it possible for the present House of Commons to keep the Government in power for ever. They insist that there shall be no power in the State with a Constitutional right to appeal to the people, and yet they declare that they represent democracy! I move Clause A first.</p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00671"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I confess that I rather welcome the two proposals of the noble Lord. There is a kind, of nautical freshness about them which relieves the monotony of ordinary debate. I wonder if anybody has mastered the proposals of the noble Lord. I think the best answer to them is to read the substance of the two new clauses which he proposes. [The noble Viscount here read the two proposed new clauses.] I am sure your Lordships will have gathered the purport of these most remarkable clauses&#x2014; perhaps the most remarkable clauses that
<col>362</col>
have ever been presented to either House of Parliament since Praisegod Barebones. I cannot imagine anything more remarkable, and I hope the noble Lord will not think me disrespectful because of what I say upon them. The noble Lord says, by the way, that he does not expect these new clauses to be brought into active operation immediately, but I should say they will not come into active operation until a very short time before the Day of Judgment. To put it quite simply in a single sentence, both these new clauses propose that there should be a statutory direction to the Sovereign to act without the advice of any Minister. Such proposals, I submit without much fear of contradiction, are hardly consistent with the usages which have governed the administration of the affairs of this country for a very long time. I am, therefore, afraid we cannot accept the clauses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00672"><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My answer to that is that the Government are altering a great many usages, and the only way to put things straight is to alter some more. I wish to provide a Constitutional harbour of refuge for the Monarch in times of difficulty and danger, and if the Monarch acts on the Referendum that is surely taking advice direct from the people without the intervention of a Minister. It is a great alteration, but as noble Lords opposite are throwing the whole Constitution into the melting-pot, and as nobody knows what the Constitution will be five years hence, I brought this subject forward so that people might consider it. Any sudden thing like this will receive no support at the moment, but by and by it will, and I daresay in five years time. With the permission of the Committee I will withdraw the clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00673">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00674"><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have an Amendment on the Paper, but I am not quite sure whether at this how of the night I ought to propose it. Rightly or wrongly, I feel it is a duty to do so. Indeed, I find myself on the horns of a most unpleasant dilemma. If I refrain from moving my Amendment because the House is practically empty, I lay myself open to the charge of want of modesty in not speaking because there is not a good enough House; but if I move it in spite of the emptiness of the House I am considered a
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0186"/>
<col>363</col>
bore. And if I withdrew the Amendment it would be taken that I was not sincere in putting it forward, so on the whole I prefer to be thought a bore but sincere than regarded as immodest and insincere. I therefore beg your Lordships' attention to my Amendment. I move to insert the following new clause&#x2014;
<quote>"This Act shall cease to be operative on the 1st of January, 1913, whether or not an Act of Parliament has then been passed altering the constitution of the House of Lords and regulating the relations between the two Houses of Parliament."</quote>
This Amendment must be read together with the Amendment that I have on the Paper to the Preamble, and I express the hope that your Lordships have read them together.<lb/>
These Amendments are somewhat different from the one which was proposed by my noble friend Lord Ellenborough and which we have just discussed. They are in fact, certainly in intention&#x2014;I will not speak dogmatically about the effect&#x2014;more in the nature of a proposal for a compromise between the two great Parties than an attempt to amend the actual Bill. I hope it will not be considered presumptuous on my part to suggest the basis of a compromise between the two Parties in the State. What has led me to do so is the fact that for many weeks past, in common I suppose with most other Members of this House. I have been anxiously brooding over this difficult problem and endeavouring to contribute my humble mite to a possible solution of the question, which I think is causing anxiety not only to the Unionist Party but also to the members of the Party in power. I put forward these Amendments for discussion principally to ascertain what are the objections to them. I presume that, like every other proposal, they are open to objections, and I sincerely desire to know what those objections are. I hope it is not presumptuous in me to entertain the idea that it might possibly be worth while to know what His Majesty's Government think of such a proposal, because it has happened more than once that a suggestion from insignificant and humble individuals has started important ideas in the minds of statesmen.<lb/>
The proposal amounts to this. I will paraphrase it. The Bill is to be passed in the form in which it left the House of Commons&#x2014;that is an assumption on which

I proceed in this Amendment&#x2014;but it is only to be operative for eighteen months, during which time the reform of the House of Lords, which is now the object of the two great Parties in the State, is to be discussed in Parliament on the initiative of His Majesty's Government. The object of my several Amendments is to enable a fresh start to be made without prejudice in the consideration of a measure which alone can solve this Constitutional problem&#x2014;that is to say, a measure for the reconstitution of your Lordships' House. It seems to me that if this proposal were adopted, though I am not so presumptuous as to suppose it will be, the effect would be this&#x2014;it would be a drawn match in this great Constitutional struggle, and the match would be drawn in favour of the Radical Party. There would be an armistice in which the Party in power would have the advantage, and that, of course, I admit is only right. After that armistice a fresh match would have to be started. The hostilities, or, as I prefer to call it, the competition of Parties, could be resumed without loss of time, without humiliation, without disappointment on either side, and, above all, without prejudice to the future solution of this immensely important question.<lb/>
Thinking out this idea, I proceeded on certain assumptions, and I feel confident that I can prove that those assumptions were not unreasonable. The first assumption was that the Government would be willing to find some compromise, at any rate that they would not be unwilling to listen to and discuss any suggestion for compromise which was made in a reasonable way. That is the first assumption, and if it is a wrong one I hope I may be corrected at once. His Majesty's Government surely cannot wish to leave behind a settlement of this question bitterness and humiliation, anger and resentment, in the hearts of their opponents&#x2014;and their opponents, mind you, are not only in this House and in another place but they are half the people of this country. A question settled in that way, leaving such bitterness, humiliation, and disappointment, cannot possibly be final. Surely it is not unreasonable to assume that His Majesty's Government wish for a final settlement of this question, which has caused them more trouble than it has caused to us. They say, indeed, that this settlement is the one thing which delays all those great
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0187"/>
<col>365</col>
objects which they have at heart and with which they wish to proceed. That is my first assumption, and I hope that it will be accepted as reasonable.<lb/>
My second assumption is that His Majesty's Government sincerely intend to carry out the promise contained in the Preamble, and that they have a plan for doing so. If they have no plan, it seems to me incredible that they should have endeavoured to make a pledge. You do not promise to do a thing which you cannot perform. That is surely a matter of honest dealing and commonsense. If you promise to do a thing you know how you can do it, and you know how you are going to do it or to try to do it. Therefore I assume that His Majesty's Government intend to carry out that promise and that they have got a plan. The third assumption is, their intention being perfectly sincere and honest, that this Bill is merely a transient and provisional expedient. I do not see that that is an unreasonable assumption, and I cannot understand how they can possibly deny it. It is written on the Bill itself. The very first words of the Bill seem to imply that it is a temporary provision, that it is purely a tentative measure. What is the effect of the Preamble put into ordinary language? His Majesty's Government say that because it is necessary to reform the House of Lords and not possible to do so at once, they have, therefore, to make a certain arrangement. If that does not mean a temporary and provisional arrangement I do not understand the English language. That is my third assumption.<lb/>
And the last assumption is this, that His Majesty's Government and the Radical Party generally have been perfectly sincere in saying on platforms and in Parliament that this question must be settled without delay. That has been to my mind the one burden of their speeches. They say that nothing can go on, nothing can be settled, until you have disposed of this House of Lords question. Some representatives of the Party opposite said that it must be settled before the Coronation. I do not think any member of the Radical Party of any importance has failed to say that this question must be settled with all possible speed. Will any member of His Majesty's Government or any noble Lord opposite say that any of the assumptions that I have ventured to set forth are un-
<col>366</col>
justifiable, unreasonable, or, to use a term which is oftenest on the lips of the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, ridiculous? If so, which of them is unreasonable? Which is unjustifiable? Which is ridiculous? That is what I should like to know, because if any of them are I am perfectly willing to stop. It is no use going on. But if I may assume that they are fairly reasonable then perhaps I may go on.<lb/>
The only doubtful point is whether the Government would be willing in any circumstances to consider a compromise. That seems to me the only doubtful assumption, and perhaps on that point they would be good enough to tell us rather more than we have heard already. All we want to know is whether it is any use suggesting a compromise. Will they entertain any sort of compromise? If they cannot possibly entertain the idea, if they say, "we are not going to have any compromise," then it is merely wasting our breath and wasting your Lordships' time even to attempt to suggest anything. But if they are willing to listen to proposals for a compromise, if their attitude is that which I have just suggested, then I ask what possible objections can they have to stating more clearly and defining more precisely what they declare in their Bill to be their intentions, promises, and pledges. Is there anything unreasonable in that? Let me explain it more exactly. Why not say in the Bill that the House of Lords is to be reformed, and to be reformed as soon as possible. That is the intention; it is what you have said not only in this Bill but everywhere else. What is the objection to putting in your Bill a few words to make it a little more clear? You have said it all over the country; it is nothing new. Why not say a little more clearly that this Veto Bill is provisional? You say it is in the Preamble. You do not deny it when we ask you. Why not make it quite precise, why not make it more definite in the Bill itself than you have done, and say it is to tide over an interval until you have settled what you admit to be the vital points of reconstructing the House of Lords?<lb/>
Lastly why not fix a limit of time? If this is a provisional measure, why not fix a limit of time. Surely it is necessary to put some limit to all this unrest, all this uncertainty, which is producing bad feeling all over the country, impeding
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0188"/>
<col>367</col>
the consideration of every other important question, and undoubtedly doing harm to trade, commerce, finance, and everything else on which the prosperity of the people depends? That unrest will continue until this Constitutional question and the reform of your Lordships' House is settled. The grievance of the Radical Party, one cannot repeat it too often, relates to the composition and not to the powers of this House. That is a complaint which noble Lords opposite have made all over the country. To put it in popular language used by every Radical speaker, they say&#x2014;"We do not want a hereditary House of Lords. Why should a man make laws for you or assist in making laws because he is the son of his father?" That is the way it is presented to the mind of the people, and they understand it. I maintain stoutly that that is the one idea present to the minds of the people, whose grievance is that there is a permanent overwhelming Unionist majority in this House. Will any one deny that that is a fair statement of the case? That is a grievance we admit. We cannot deny it. It exists. We understand it because we are human like other people and we realise that it must be vexatious and galling to you, and we say frankly that we are willing to do our utmost to remove the disability under which your Party labours.<lb/>
But you are not going to remove that difficulty and that grievance by this Bill. It does not attempt to remove it. You are not attempting to remove that grievance about which you have complained and on which you have roused the indignation and wrath of the people. The Veto Bill only mitigates the grievance for three years, and during the last two years the whole of this complaint revives again in its fullest force. It is the composition of your Lordships' House, not the powers of any possible Second Chamber, which is the subject of complaint in the country and which has been the subject of political discussion for the past five years or more. What His Majesty's Government are doing, so it seems to me, is to ignore the grievance to which they have drawn attention and concerning which they have excited public opinion, and to establish a form of single-Chamber government&#x2014;they must forgive me for calling it so, because that is the opinion we all of us hold&#x2014;which has not been demanded by the country. There,
<col>368</col>
again, surely nobody will contradict me. To reform this House and reconstitute it in such a way as to be fair to all Parties is a matter on which we are all agreed in principle. The Radical Party have long advocated it. The Unionist Party have now agreed to it. Your Lordships' House is absolutely committed to some great change in principle. In this respect, circumstances have enormously altered since the Government first embarked on the policy indicated in this Bill. Surely reasonable men in all walks and conditions of life, alter their attitude, their policy, their method of business, in the face of altered circumstances. That surely is a matter which one need not dwell upon or argue. As a "man in the street," as a "backwoodsman," as a Back Bencher, as an ordinary man, I ask, Why not take advantage of that common ground for a national settlement of a national question? I can quite well imagine the sort of answer I may get from some of His Majesty's Ministers. They will say, "That is not our policy."<lb/>
Let me try and suggest how these Amendments would work. You would pass your Veto Bill. That is the great object you have in view. That is a point of honour with you. You have pledged yourselves to pass it. You would do that. Your honour would be satisfied. There would be no loss of dignity. Your Party would have that satisfaction. On the other hand, the Opposition would have the satisfaction of knowing that, although they had given way to that extent, the Veto Bill would be harmless except in the matter of finance, and on that point I think that there might very well be an honourable understanding between the two Parties. How could you justify this to the people of your own Party? You could fairly say that your veto policy, as would be a matter of fact, had very largely had the effect you desired. It had brought about a recognition of your demand for reform. You have got the Unionist Party to recognise that it is fair to make some alteration in the constitution of this Chamber. You have accordingly passed the Bill for which the people gave you a mandate. "But circumstances have changed," you could then say, "It is agreed by all that there should be reform, and therefore we must try something else. We have passed your Bill, and now we ask you to agree to our fresh proposals for meeting the real difficulty
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0189"/>
<col>369</col>
&#x2014;the reform of the House of Lords." Surely there would be no loss of dignity in an attitude of that kind. On the other hand, the Unionist Party might say to their supporters, "We have had to give way before superior force, but the Bill is not going to do any harm to the questions which we all hold dear and have at heart. We have had the satisfaction of bringing about a state of affairs favourable to that final settlement of this question which is desired by every reasonable and patriotic man in this country. We have had the satisfaction of avoiding a grave crisis." So I imagine it would be possible for the leaders of both Parties to explain their action in the possibly inconceivable circumstance of His Majesty's Government accepting an idea of this kind. There would be no loss of dignity about action of that sort, and next year, without bitterness, anger, or humiliation in either Party, we could all set to work to make a fresh start, without prejudice, and devise a Second Chamber which would be satisfactory to all Parties.<lb/>
We have pledged ourselves in this House to some measure of reform, and it seems to me that there is no more convincing evidence that some change is necessary than our experience during these debates. The very existence of this House has been at stake. No more important question has ever been discussed here; yet half the members of this House are absent. I say this just as much against my side as against yours. It is clear there are a large number of Peers who are superfluous, as far as the discharge of legislative duties in this House is concerned. Surely it is only right, only reasonable and economical, to relieve these members of duties for which they have no time or no inclination, and leave the work to be done by those, who are ready and willing to devote themselves to it.<lb/>
I quite realise that these proposals of mine are unusual, but, as has been said by many others, the Bill itself is unusual in character and therefore cannot be touched in any way except by unusual suggestions. The noble Viscount, Lord Morley, at the conclusion of his speech in reply to the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, challenged us to say whether any of us seriously and candidly believed that it would be possible for His Majesty's Government to accept Amendments of the
<col>370</col>
kind suggested by the noble Marquess. I confess I did, and had I not been reluctant to interrupt the noble Viscount I should have answered him in the affirmative. I may have been foolish to entertain any such idea, but in all sincerity I prefer to believe that there are still men in the Radical Party who are open to reason, who are patriotic enough to forego a full measure of Party victory or Party revenge, or whatever else you like to call it, for the national good, and who prefer a peaceful solution of a question of admitted difficulty. It is in that belief, whether foolish or not, that I humbly and respectfully submit these suggestions of my own. I want His Majesty's Ministers to tell me what the objections are. Of course, I do not intend to press them. I have only put them forward for discussion and in order to elicit any reasons that may exist for regarding them as unreasonable, or unpractical, or, as the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, would say, ridiculous.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00677"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: The prospect of conciliation, reconciliation, or compromise is always inviting, but the noble Lord must realise that at this stage of this controversy it would be quite impracticable to commence an attempt to solve the whole Constitutional difficulty in that way. It has not been for "the fun of the thing" that the Government have brought forward this Bill. We have brought it forward because we believe that there is a great and real public necessity for it. The noble Lord is mistaken if he thinks that we have put forward in the country the composition of the House of Lords as the primary object to be considered. The history of the question is very short but very significant. We proposed to limit the powers of the House of Lords. Thereupon it was from the Conservative side that the project was started, as a substitute for the limitation of powers, that there should be a change in the composition of the House. As always happens when a course of that kind is taken, instead of being a substitute the proposal became a supplement, and both of these projects
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0190"/>
<col>371</col>
have been before the country. But although both have been in a degree mentioned, the primary and main one was that relating only to the powers of the House in the first instance. The subject has been very fully discussed in the course of this controversy during the past eighteen months. There have been further proposals put forward which I will not discuss now or further characterise; but may I respectfully suggest that they are more revolutionary than anything contained in this Bill. Remember this, when once you begin pulling down something that is old and familiar you may find yourselves engaging in a very difficult enterprise and committed to it. But without the least desire to return to old stories or old grievances, I must say that it was not we who commenced the innovations upon Constitutional usage. I pass from that subject to say that I am afraid that the proposals of the noble Lord in this Amendment are quite incompatible with the maintenance of this Bill. With that he will agree. He put his Amendment forward in a spirit which everybody must respect&#x2014;in the hope that it might lead to a compromise on the whole subject. I am afraid that this is a stage at which it is impracticable to anticipate any good results from a project of that kind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00678"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: It is not, I think, necessary to say more than a word or two upon the few remarks to which we have just listened. The noble Lord, Lord Ampthill, was, I think your Lordships will agree, quite justified in moving his Amendment, not only because of the excellent arguments with which he supported it, but because of the spirit by which it was animated and the nature of the appeal he made. The noble Lord told us that he made his proposals solely in the interests of compromise and in the hope of eliciting some statement in reply from His Majesty's Government. The noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor, gave us, not for the first time&#x2014;and I very much doubt whether it will be the last&#x2014;his version of the history of the last few years. I do not know whether my view of history is distorted or whether I look through a different end of the telescope from the noble and learned Lord, but I confess my version of recent events is quite different from his. But inasmuch as he apologised for what was not a novel but still an irrelevant disquisition, I shall
<col>372</col>
not have the necessity of following him. Other and better opportunities will occur of placing our version of history before this House and the country.<lb/>
The main point of the noble and learned Lord's remarks was the obstinacy with which he refused to consider the idea of compromise or solution. I do not imagine any of your Lordships, perhaps not even Lord Ampthill himself, supposed that the suggestion for that purpose embodied in the Amendment would be accepted by the Government, and therefore I do not express surprise at this refusal. What I should like to take this opportunity of confessing some surprise in regard to is that the attitude of uncompromising refusal to which the noble and learned Lord has just given expression has not been confined to this case, but has been equally offered to every proposal, however reasonable and by whatever arguments supported, that has been advanced by noble Lords on this side of the House. And this is the more disappointing to us because on one occasion we had our views enforced by the powerful authority of one of the greatest Speakers of the House of Commons who ever sat in this Chamber. But those words fell upon deaf ears on the other side. Then, again, we had positive encouragement from the actual words of Ministers opposite. I allude, of course, to the often quoted remarks of the noble Earl, Lord Crewe. But although we had that encouragement, we meet with a stubborn refusal. And we leave this discussion, the present stage of which is now drawing near to the end, with feelings of natural bitterness on our side. We are satisfied at the opportunity we have enjoyed of stating our case. But we do feel that His Majesty's Government have not, so far, treated us in the matter with that courteous consideration which they led us to expect and which we had a right to receive.<lb/>
There was another aspect of the noble Lord's Amendment which an opportunity will arise of discussing later on. One portion of Lord Ampthill's Amendment proposed that this Act should cease to be operative after a certain space of time. The space of time named was not the same as that suggested in the Amendment of the noble Viscount, Lord Galway. The question of an attempt to secure a limit to the operation of the Bill will again come before your Lordships upon the Report stage.

The noble Duke said: My Lords, I have not taken any part in this discussion because from my point of view the Bill is a hopelessly bad one. I am not very much in favour of trying to make a sieve hold water, and although we have had a large number of able speeches and the debate has been carried on at a very high level the net result, it appears to me, leaves the Bill still a hopelessly bad one. But although I have not wished to take part in the discussion on the Bill itself, I must say that I think this Preamble deserves the title "ridiculous," of which the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, is so fond, and I do not think it ought to become part of the Statute without strong protests from this House. There are only three points on which I shall trouble your Lordships with regard to this Preamble. In the first place, it is not the custom, I believe, of your Lordships' House to put Preambles in your legislation. At least it has not been done of late years, and I know of no
<col>374</col>
particular reason why you should select this Bill for a breach of your usual custom. In the next place, the Preamble, according to all precedent so far as I can understand, is absolutely out of order, because it has not the smallest reference to anything in the Bill itself. I cannot understand how this Preamble can have passed the purview of the Chairman of Committees in another place without being ruled out of order.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00687">I ask your Lordships, especially those of you who have had experience in the Lower House, to consider this. Supposing this Preamble had been put forward as an Amendment to the Bill, can it be doubted that any one who moved such an Amendment would be told it was out of order? But because apparently it was part of the original Bill as it emerged from the Cabinet Council this utterly irregular Preamble has been allowed to pass. This remarkable Preamble says&#x2014;
<quote>"And whereas it is intended to substitute for the House of Lords," and so forth.</quote>
Who intends? This is an Act of Parliament, or is going to be. It is not an expression of opinion from the Bench opposite. Of course, originally it is the Cabinet who intends. Who are the Cabinet? The Cabinet are a body unknown to the Constitution, to begin with, and they are of all bodies the most ephemeral. They only exist as a rule for a few years, and, as far as my experience goes, if they exist at all for a protracted period they invariably fall out amongst themselves. We have been told to-night that "the Government intends," so that when this precious production left the Cabinet the Government adopted it. I wonder whether when the Cabinet framed this Preamble they ever thought of the old proverb of the way to a place which we never mention to ears polite being "paved with good intentions." I wonder whether they thought that perhaps their intentions would lead to a condition of things in this country not altogether foreign to the character of the place to which I have alluded. But they appear to have contrived to get the House of Commons to say also that it "intends." The House of Commons is a rather more permanent institution than the Cabinet of the Government, but even the House of Commons is very liable to be changed from time to time. What business has the House of Commons to put into an Act of Parliament that it "intends"?</p>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0192"/>
<col>375</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00688">But there is a much more serious question raised here. Are we going to pass this and say "we intend"? Remember what it is that we say we intend&#x2014;
<quote>"And whereas it is intended to substitute for the House of Lords as it at present exists a Second Chamber constituted on a popular instead of hereditary basis."</quote>
I have heard a good many speeches in this House with regard to the reconstitution of the House, but I have never heard your Lordships as a body, or even any considerable proportion of your Lordships, say for one moment that you even thought of putting the Second Chamber on a popular instead of a hereditary basis. Upon that ground alone, if on no other, I say that your Lordships cannot pass this Preamble. Whatever other part of the Bill you agree to you must reject this Preamble as it stands now. I protest altogether against intentions. I say with all due respect that this House has hitherto been, and will be still, more stable than either the Cabinet, the Government, or the House of Commons, and I say that this House has no right to speak of its intentions in an Act of Parliament. You have no right to commit posterity. It is the commonest A B C of every other body that has anything to do with administration that it cannot commit its successors. I observe that the noble and learned Lord assents to this proposition. Then how does he defend this Preamble? Let me remind your Lordships that this is a Preamble expressing not the intentions of the Government but the intentions of Parliament. Parliament has a perfect right to legislate for the day, but it has no more right to commit posterity than any administrative organisation. It would make the whole of legislation ridiculous if we were to put into Acts of Parliament that we intended to do this, that, or the other. When I heard the noble and learned Lord say that the Government had not brought this Bill forward for fun, I could not help wondering whether they had not brought forward the Preamble for fun. I have given your Lordships my reasons for altering this Preamble. In the first place, we do not in ordinary usage place Preambles in our Bills; secondly, this Preamble is out of order because it does not relate to the subject-matter of the Bill; and, thirdly, we have no right to commit posterity and to speak of our intentions. We ought to reject this Preamble, and if I can get a teller I will divide upon it.</p>

I am ready to accept all that has been said by the noble Duke with regard to the Preamble, but I will confine myself to the second paragraph of it, which reads&#x2014;
<quote>"And whereas it is intended to substitute for the House of Lords as it at present exists a Second Chamber constituted on a popular instead of hereditary basis, but"&#x2014;</quote>
And I wish to emphasise these words&#x2014;
<quote>"such substitution cannot be immediately brought into operation."</quote>
Whatever may have been the case at the time this Bill was drafted&#x2014;some fifteen or sixteen months ago&#x2014;it cannot be said now that "such substitution cannot be immediately brought into operation."<lb/>
A great many things have happened in the last fifteen months. Indeed we may take it that it was fifteen months ago when the Bill was drafted, because the Prime Minister said on February 21 of last year that the Bill had not been submitted to the House of Commons. That was in reply to an inconvenient question asked by one of his supporters. But after it had been printed and submitted to the House of Commons nothing more was heard of it, and then came the Conference. The Conference lasted for nearly six months, and according to the best authorities there was substantial agreement at one period of the proceedings. Although we do not know officially on what points there was that substantial agreement between the members, or what was the particular rock upon which they split, we have had a good deal of circumstantial evidence since which to those who follow public affairs affords a pretty good glimpse of what was agreed upon and the rock upon which they split. I am one of those who have done a great deal of magisterial business for fifty years, and those who have had similar experience know that a train of circumstantial evidence which is not direct evidence is very often of greater force than the evidence of a witness who may be able to give direct evidence but who may be wrong in what he says. But the Conference having resulted in no decision, the Resolutions
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0193"/>
<col>377</col>
of Lord Rosebery and of Lord Lansdowne wore immediately proceeded with, and they were passed, if I recollect rightly, without a single Division&#x2014;passed unanimously by the whole House. They were then put into a Message to the House of Commons and sent to them. But the door was slammed in their face and there was a Dissolution. The General Election took place within three weeks of the passing of those Resolutions, and the country was thereby deprived of knowing what the House of Lords were prepared to do to meet the Government on the question of the reconstruction of this House. And this Election was taken on an old register, thus depriving the new electors of an opportunity of voting.<lb/>
The Bill which we are now discussing and the House of Lords Reconstitution Bill are practically twin Bills, about the same age, having been brought into this House, within a fortnight of one another. Therefore this Bill has no great precedence over the other Bill, either in age, weight, or authority. I should like to know this. If at the time this Bill was drafted it had been known that the House of Lords was willing to agree (1) that a hereditary Peerage should not give the right to sit in this House without some sort of election or nomination, (2) that the number of Parliamentary Peers should be reduced by at least one, half, and (3) to arrangements being made for Joint Sittings, with the Referendum on very grave subjects&#x2014;would not that have made a great difference? I think it would have done. With all these facts before us it is impossible truthfully to say, as is said in the Bill, that "such substitution cannot be immediately brought into operation."<lb/>
I do not wish the House to be guided entirely by what I have said. I would refer your Lordships to the speech made by Sir Edward Grey at the National Liberal Club on June 1, when Earl Carrington was in the chair. Sir Edward Grey said&#x2014;
<quote>"If the other side had been prepared to, agree that there should be a Second Chamber in which one Party should have for a term of years as good a chance as the other, that the Second Chamber should be smaller in numbers than the House of Commons, and that there should be some adjustment between the two Houses by which when the House of Commons had a substantial majority its will should prevail &#x2026; it was much more likely they would not have been divided as they were at the present moment."</quote>
<col>378</col>
I think that is a very significant speech. It was made after the two Bills had passed the Second Reading, and though I have, no doubt that Sir Edward Grey had not seen it, it was after my Instruction had been put down on the Paper on the Second Heading, but which, unfortunately, from circumstances over which I had no control, I was, unable to move. I can conscientiously say that I cannot vote for putting these words into this Bill. The words may have been appropriate when the Bill was drafted, but they are not appropriate now; they are not true now, and we cannot put them in. Therefore I shall support the noble Duke if he goes to a Division, and if his Amendment is not accepted I shall move the omission of these particular words.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00691"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: The Amendment moved by the noble Duke opposite is, of course, in accordance with the view that he has expressed about this Bill consistently and from the commencement, and also consistent with the view that I think he expressed with regard to the Bill of the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne. I am sorry if I am wrong; but the noble Duke regards this Bill at all events as a thoroughly bad Bill. He thinks the principle is wrong. The noble Duke, therefore, has taken no part, or very little part, in any of the discussions in Committee. I think also that the noble Duke's attitude towards the Bill of the Leader of the Opposition was not of a friendly character.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00692"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to interrupt the noble and learned Lord, but I do not know why we should enter into any question that is not before the House. With regard to the Bill of the noble Marquess, I have never expressed any opinion whatever upon it. I have often expressed an earnest desire for a reform of this House, but I have never expressed any opinion as to the particular way in which the noble Marquess wished to effect his object.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00693"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I do not desire to make it in any way a subject of complaint, and if I am wrong I am sorry, but I have been under the impression that the noble Duke did not take a favourable view of that particular proposal. Accordingly it is not to be wondered at that he not only dislikes this Bill but particularly dislikes the Preamble. The
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0194"/>
<col>379</col>
Preamble states the intentions of the Government and asks Parliament to state its intentions also. [Several Noble Lords: "No."] Well, it asks Parliament also to state its intention to effect a reform of the constitution of this House in accordance with the terms of the Preamble. I agree that it is unusual to preface a Bill of this kind by a Preamble of this kind. I make that admission freely. But there is no rule, either of the Constitution or anything else, to prevent you from making an appropriate Preamble in an appropriate case. We think that this Preamble is appropriate in the particular circumstances in which we stand&#x2014;namely, that we are bringing forward a Bill relating to one side of a subject alone; and we did not anticipate that we should meet with censure from noble Lords opposite because we also ask Parliament to announce its intention of dealing with the other side of the subject, to which they themselves attach importance.<lb/>
Parliament, of course, cannot commit its successors, and we do not ask Parliament to attempt to commit its successors. It is this Parliament that we ask to express an opinion in regard to this particular Bill, and of course it will not bind any future Parliament if the other Parliament think proper to differ from it. If I rightly understood the noble Lord, Lord Heneage, his view is that at present it is not true to say that it is impracticable immediately to bring forward the Bill referred to in the Preamble. He must be more sanguine than I am. All I can say is that at present we have got our hands pretty full in carrying this Bill through Parliament. The task of drawing up and framing a new constitution for either one or both Houses of Parliament is one of extreme complexity and extreme difficulty. It has been found in many countries that to draw up a constitution for the Upper House of Parliament is no easy task. I do not believe that the noble Marquess opposite, in framing his Bill, found it an easy task, and with all respect to him I was not very satisfied with the result. When we bring forward a Bill we shall have to preface it by a great deal of labour, and we shall be confronted with a great many difficulties with which the noble Lord himself must be pretty familiar. If he thinks it is a light and easy task I am sorry to say I cannot agree with him. The Preamble was inserted by the Government; it has been
<col>380</col>
supported by the House of Commons, and, of course, we adhere to it in this House. Your Lordships are able, if you think proper, to do as you have done on former occasions and strike it out, or put another in its place, but we cannot be assenting parties to that course.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00694"><member>LORD CLIFFORD OF CHUDLEIGH</member><membercontribution>: This is a curiously drafted Bill. As has already been said, the word "whereas" generally refers to something past, but in this case it refers to something which has yet to come. The third paragraph appears to be absolutely inconsequential. It commences&#x2014;
<quote>"And whereas provision will require hereafter to be made by Parliament in a measure effecting such substitution for limiting and defining the powers of the new Second Chamber,"</quote>
and then it proceeds&#x2014;
<quote>"but it is expedient to make such provision as in this Act appears for restricting the existing powers of the House of Lords."</quote>
What on earth has the latter part to do with the former? It may be necessary to define a new Second Chamber but how is that necessarily connected with its being expedient to make provision entirely limiting the powers of the House of Lords? The formation of a new Chamber is one thing; limiting the powers of any such Chamber, or a future Chamber, is quite another. The provisions in this Bill appear to have no connection at all with the first part of the sentence which I have quoted. I certainly think that a Preamble like this, which has such a very shadowy connection with the subject matter of the Bill, is one that had far better be left out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00695"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say one or two words with regard to this extraordinary Preamble. The noble Duke pointed out the absurdities and anomalies in the Preamble, but I do not think he said what he might have said on this point. Where is the precedent for such a Preamble as this to be found? A Preamble, of course, should refer to things which follow it in the Bill. Undoubtedly in the usual course of legislation the Preamble to this Bill ' would run&#x2014;
<quote>"Whereas it is expedient that provision should be made for regulating the relations between the two Houses of Parliament. Be it therefore enacted," etc.</quote>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0195"/>
<col>381</col>
That is a Preamble of the ordinary sort which would be followed by the Bill. But when the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor, came to answer my noble friend the Duke of Northumberland, he appeared to me to turn away altogether from the question which the noble Duke raised. He made no answer to the remarks about the Preamble, but began by saying that he believed the noble Duke did not agree with Lord Lansdowne's Bill&#x2014;a matter which was not before the House. Then he proceeded to talk about this Bill, but said nothing in defence of what I venture to assert is a most ridiculous Preamble. If it appeared before any Committee of your Lordships' House upstairs it would be struck out without the slightest mercy, simply because it has no reference to what follows in the Bill and contains many things which are not to be found in the Bill.<lb/>
The Preamble refers to all kinds of things. I shall not speak of its ridiculous grammar. Its grammar is simply beneath contempt. The noble and learned Lord was good enough to say he was at a great college of which I also happened to be a humble member. I would like to ask him what he would say if this had been read to him&#x2014;
<quote>"And whereas it is intended to substitute for the House of Lords as it at present exists a Second Chamber constituted on a popular instead of hereditary basis, but such substitution cannot be immediately brought into operation."</quote>
There is grammar for you! We have often heard of the grammar in Kings' and Queens' speeches, but no noble Lord in this House ever heard of grammar approaching to that. The use of the word "but" is perfectly inappropriate. The next paragraph runs in the same way&#x2014;there is another "but." I wonder whose invention this Preamble was, or which member or members of the Cabinet would claim the glory of having written it? We know that draftsmen are a long-suffering race, but when the draftsman was told to put this Preamble in the Bill he must have blushed with shame. If it was the noble and learned Lord who ordered him to do it, I am afraid he must have mentally observed that he thought the Lord Chancellor worthy of better things.<lb/>
The Amendment of the noble Duke proposes to delete this Preamble. Of course it ought to be struck out. It is
<col>382</col>
perfectly ridiculous from beginning to end. It is not worthy of anything but ridicule and condemnation. But then comes this further question about this precious production. Is it worth while to strike it out? It is all of a piece with this Bill. Any one who reads this Bill and then reads the Preamble would probably say to himself, "The men who wrote this Bill are just the sort of people who would write a Preamble of this kind." I cannot find words strong enough to express my sense of the absurdity of this Preamble, but I ask the noble Duke, Is it worth while to strike this nonsense out? On the whole, if we are to look at it from a Party point of view, I should say, taking one thing with another, it is better to keep this trash in the Bill than to strike it out. Taking that view, I hope the noble Duke will not press his Amendment to a Division, though so far as the merits of the question are concerned I confess I entirely agree with him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00696"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: I do not profess to have more intelligence than anybody else, but I have not the smallest doubt in my own mind as to the origin of this Preamble, or how it got into the Bill. It is perfectly obvious to me that the Government made up their minds that it was expedient that provision should be made for regulating the relations between the two Houses of Parliament. In the original Bill the portion proposed to be omitted by the noble Duke did not appear. Thereupon, some members of the Government said, "What is the meaning of this? There is nothing about a Second Chamber in your Bill. It only deals with the relations between the two Houses. You must, have a Preamble of some kind dealing with the construction of a new Second Chamber." It is so obvious. That accounts, not only for the curious language of the Preamble, but also for the fact that it has no relation whatsoever to the rest of the Bill. I was about to make the same suggestion as did my noble friend, Lord Camperdown. What the noble Duke said was perfectly accurate. I do not think he exaggerated the case. The Preamble is illogical. It is unnecessary. As far as I can see it is serving no useful purpose except that it satisfies the consciences of the so-called Second Chamber members of the Government. But the point of the whole thing is, Is it worth making a fuss about I should like to
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0196"/>
<col>383</col>
support Lord Camperdown's suggestion. The Preamble need not be taken seriously, and nobody will care whether it was taken out or left in.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00697"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: It would be scarcely respectful if I did not say a few words with regard to the speech of my noble friend the Duke of Northumberland. I think he entirely made good his indictment of the Preamble. He said it was unusual to affix a Preamble of this kind to a Bill, and that count was admitted by the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Chancellor. Then my noble friend said that he believed the Preamble was out of order. I should have thought that it was certainly out of order to mention in a Bill dealing with one subject your intention of legislating upon another subject, although the two subjects may have some connection. I am sure my noble friend Lord Camperdown is right when he says that the grammar of the Preamble is more than suspect. I also agree with the noble Duke in holding that it would be most unreasonable that we should be regarded, by accepting this Preamble, as in any way pledging ourselves or pledging anyone else to legislation exactly corresponding with the principle of the first section of the Preamble&#x2014;I refer to the reference to a Second Chamber constituted on a popular basis, by which I suppose is meant a merely popular as distinguished from a partly hereditary basis.<lb/>
But, like my two noble friends who have spoken last, I regard the matter less seriously than does the noble Duke. After all, this Preamble has no enacting effect. It is a mere recital of the intentions and policy of His Majesty's Government, and I believe everyone is perfectly aware of the circumstances in which that recital was accepted and grafted on to the measure. We are not responsible for this Bill, nor are we responsible for the Preamble. We think the Bill a bad Bill, and the Preamble a bad Preamble. But there is one other point about the Preamble which, perhaps, has not been sufficiently noted. It does contain a definite pledge on the part of His Majesty's Government that they will&#x2014;and we know that they mean to do so at an early time&#x2014;produce a measure dealing with House of Lords reform. I am very anxious to hold
<col>384</col>
them to that pledge. Until we know what that measure is, we shall not be able to pass final judgment on their policy as a whole. Therefore I see some advantage in retaining these words in the Preamble because they embody a pledge to which we desire to hold noble Lords opposite.<lb/>
With regard to our own intentions as to House of Lords reform surely there need be no misapprehension, because we have embodied them in the Bill which has been read a second time by your Lordships' House. Therefore we are in no way, it seems to me, prejudiced if we allow the Preamble to stay where it is. In these circumstances I cannot help thinking that my two noble friends are right in believing that it is really not worth while to wreak our vengeance on the Preamble. We have made one or two serious suggestions for the improvement of the Bill, and I confess I should be sorry, particularly in a somewhat thin House, to strike this portion of it out. I hope, therefore, that my noble friend will not press his Amendment to a Division.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00698"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to address your Lordships again, but after the appeal which has just been made to me it would not be respectful if I did not say one word. I am very sorry, but I do not understand the argument. We are passing an Act of Parliament. We have not, as we might have done, ignored this measure altogether and taken no part in its amendment, leaving the entire responsibility to the Government. I do not know whether that would have been a satisfactory course or not. At any rate, the argument of the noble Marquess was that we are not responsible for the words of the Preamble or of the Bill. That might have been fitly argued and might have been upheld if we had ignored the Bill. But your Lordships have undertaken to amend the Bill. I cannot understand how we can make ourselves responsible for various amendments in a Bill of this kind and then when we come to the Preamble say, "Oh it is perfectly true there are things in the Preamble which we do not believe and which are contrary to our intention, but we are not responsible and we will leave them in." I would impress that upon your Lordships. If you pass this
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0197"/>
<col>385</col>
Preamble, particularly after you have undertaken to amend the Bill, you are responsible for saying that it is your intention to have an elective Second Chamber. The noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, said he was anxious to keep the Government to their pledge to deal with this question of a reformed House. I should have thought that after what has fallen from the Government Bench they were sufficiently pledged already, and I humbly submit that to put things with which you do not agree into an Act of Parliament is not a regular or proper way to pledge Governments. I am</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00745"><i>Certain false statements concerning a candidate to be an illegal practice. Injunction against person making false statement.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00746"><b>1.</b>&#x2014;(1) Any person who, or the directors of any body or association corporate which, before or during any municipal election, shall, for the purpose of affecting the return of any candidate at such election, make or publish any false statement of fact in relation to the personal character or conduct of such candidate shall be guilty of an illegal practice within the meaning of the provisions of the Municipal Elections Corrupt and Illegal Practices) Act, 1884, and shall be subject to all the penalties for and consequences of committing an illegal practice in the said Act mentioned, and the said Act shall be taken to lie amended as if the illegal practice defined by this Act had been contained therein.</p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00750"><member>LORD FARQUHAR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill was passed through your Lordships' House and sent to the House of Commons on February 23 last. As passed by the House of Lords it consisted of two clauses. The first clause applied to municipal elections the provisions of the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Act, 1895, which at present apply only to Parliamentary elections. The Bill received a Second Reading in the House of Commons without a Division, and was referred to a Standing Committee. Objection was taken by a member of the Committee to the form of Clause 1 as effecting legislation by reference to former Acts of Parliament. Thereupon by general consent the clause as set out at length in the Memorandum in the Bill was substituted for the clause as it originally stood. That is the Amendment which is before the House. It is an Amendment in form and not in substance, and probably the House will agree that it is an improvement to set out at length the full legislative effect of the Bill. It is hoped, therefore, that the House will agree with the Commons' Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

Two years ago your Lordships' House struck out the whole of the contents of a Bill which came from the Commons and put in at full length that which it was proposed to enact. I think that was a very good course, and it made clearer what it was desired to do. Now the House of Commons has done exactly the same thing, and equally wisely, with one of our Bills, and I think it is impossible not to commend the practice. I hope that it will be observed on both sides in future.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00779">[Lord BALFOUR of BURLEIGH in the Chair.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00780">Clause 1:</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00781" align="center"><i>Jurisdiction of Judges and Registrars of County Courts.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00782"><b>1.</b>&#x2014;(1) County Courts shall, save as hereinafter provided, have jurisdiction to hear and determine any action which can be commenced in the High Court, notwithstanding that the debt, demand, or damage claimed is not limited to one hundred pounds or under.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00783">(2) Where an action is commenced in a County Court which could not but for this section have been so commenced except by agreement of the parties, the action shall, if the defendant or one of the defendants makes an application for the purpose within such time and in such manner as may be prescribed by rules of the Supreme Court, be removed into the high Court and shall proceed in London or in a district registry as provided by such rules.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00784">(3) Nothing in this section shall extend the jurisdiction of County Courts as respects any action of ejectment, or in which the title to any corporeal or incorporeal hereditaments or to any toll, fair, market, or franchise is in question, or for any libel or slander, or for seduction or breach of promise of marriage, or as respects any action on a judgment in the High Court.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00785">(4) Nothing in this section shall extend the jurisdiction of County Courts as respects actions of a class for the time being assigned to the Chancery Division or the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division of the High Court, nor shall anything in this section affect any revenue proceeding or appeal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00786">(5) Where, in an action commenced in, or remitted to, a County Court, the defendant or one of the defendants counter-claims an amount of money not limited to one hundred pounds or under, and the plaintiff objects in writing in accordance with the provisions of section eighteen of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, 1884, the following provisions shall have effect:
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) The plaintiff may, in accordance with County Court rules, apply to the judge for an order refusing permission to the defendant to avail himself of the counter-claim, and if on such application the judge is of opinion that the counter-claim cannot be conveniently disposed of in the pending action, or ought not to be allowed, he may make an order refusing permission to the defendant to avail himself thereof.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) If no such application is made, or the judge refuses to make an order refusing such permission, the whole proceeding shall, in accordance with rules of the Supreme Court, be removed into the High Court, and shall proceed in London or in a district registry as provided by such rules.</li></ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00787">(6) Where any action or proceeding is, under this section, removed to the High Court, the record shall be transmitted by the registrar of the County Court to the proper officer of the High Court in manner prescribed by rules of the Supreme Court, and the action or proceeding shall thenceforth be continued and prosecuted in the High Court as if
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0203"/>
<col>397</col>
it had been originally commenced therein. The removal of any such action or proceeding shall not affect the validity of any order made or act done in the County Court prior to such removal, and any such order may be enforced by tie high Court as if it had been originally made therein, and the costs incurred prior to and of the removal shall be dealt with as the High Court or a judge thereof shall direct.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00788">(7) Section one hundred and sixteen of the County Courts Act, 1888 (hereinafter referred to as the principal Act), which relates to costs in actions brought in the High Court which could have been commenced in a County Court, shall not apply to my action brought in the High Court which could have been commenced in a county court by virtue of this section or by agreement, but not otherwise.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00789">(8) Section sixty-four of the principal Act, which confers jurisdiction on county courts by agreement of the parties to an action, shall not apply in the case of any action which may be commenced in a County Court under this section.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00790"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: I move to delete from the end of subsection (6) the words, "and the costs incurred prior to and of the removal shall be dealt with as the High Court or a Judge thereof shall direct." This is a small Amendment necessitated by the fact that the provision which it proposes to delete is really covered by Clause 12. If your Lordships will look at that clause you will find that the Court which finally disposes of the matter has the power to deal with those costs. That was not noticed at the time the Bill was first drafted, but the draftsman and those who have considered the matter, including myself, think that the words might be omitted from subsection (6) of this clause as they are covered by Clause 12.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00793">On Question, Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00794">On Question, That Clause 1, as amended, be agreed to,</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00795"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY said</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on this Motion I have to move that Clause 1 be omitted from the Bill. It is a clause which has been debated once before in your Lordships' House, and the small attendance this afternoon indicates, I regret to say, that the importance of the subject is not fully appreciated. I wish to
<col>398</col>
state my deliberate opinion that this clause, if passed, will cause serious injury to the general administration of justice in this country. There are, however, a great many clauses in the Bill which have my hearty support, but this clause, which in effect enacts that every proceeding shall begin in the County Court, would be to my mind most mischievous in its operation. It would be mischievous in more ways than one. It would be particularly hard on the class of person for whom the County Courts were originally intended&#x2014;namely, people of small means seeking redress in respect of small questions which might properly be left to the County Court.<lb/>
I feel the difficulty of arguing this question before a House which really is not familiar with the state of facts. From time to time the Legislature had added a great number of jurisdictions to the County Court, and although the Judges have most fairly and honestly tried to get through the work, a great number of small cases are from time to time delayed and cannot be carried through to a proper conclusion by reason of the great pressure on the County Courts. That pressure exists in a way which is very remarkable in one sense. Wherever there is a very efficient Judge&#x2014;and there are many, I may say&#x2014;he becomes as it were a favourite Judge, and his Court is overwhelmed with business. The Legislature, as I say, has thought fit to increase the jurisdiction of the County Courts. Of that I cannot complain, because the Legislature has done so and there it must remain; but this clause would further increase the number of cases to be taken in the County Court. I can only say that from all I hear it is not true that there is at present any delay in the superior Courts. The case as originally made out for some alteration of this sort was that the superior Courts had not the time necessary to try the cases, and that you ought to diminish the number of cases in the High Court by some sort of assistance. That case can no longer be made. The Legislature has thought right to add two more Judges to the Judicial staff, and I hear from the Lord Chief Justice and from everybody familiar with the facts that there is no such delay as was the subject of complaint before.<lb/>
But by this clause it is intended to increase the quantity of business in the County Courts. If I am wrong, my noble and
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0204"/>
<col>399</col>
learned friend the Lord Chancellor will correct me; but if that is not the intention, I fail to see what the object of the clause is. The County Court Judges have honestly tried to do what they can in overtaking their work, and many of them have sat until half-past ten o'clock at night hearing cases in order to get through their lists. County Court Judges have to fix their sittings at the different places on their circuit beforehand, in order that adequate notice may be given to the parties; and having fixed the days, they must get through their lists or adjourn cases, and it is these perpetual adjournments which inflict serious hardship and loss on the poorer litigants. I have in my hand a list of a large number of cases showing what the delay has been. On the last occasion when we were discussing this question the Lord Chancellor read&#x2014;I do not know where the statistics came from&#x2014;figures showing the number of hours during which County Court Judges sit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00796"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I quoted the average number of days a year on which they sit. The figures will be found in the Judicial Statistics published every year. The average number of days on which a County Court Judge sits is 153 each year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00797"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: I would point out that the only figures there given are as to the number of days on which the Judges sit. They are no doubt quite correct. But these Judges have circuits to cover. The time spent in travelling is not counted at all in the statistics, and from time to time they have considerable distances to cover. I think the Lord Chancellor, in the argument he founded upon those figures, was rather judging from his own experience of going from his own house to where he sits. These Judges have to travel considerable distances, and when they get there the two or three days fixed for the transaction of the business may, as is continually the case, prove not enough. Then what is the Judge to do? If he tries to get continuous sittings, the parties at the next place where he is due and to which they have gone with their advocates and witnesses have to be put off, and the expense is immediately made much greater for them than it originally was. But if the Judge adjourns the unfinished case, the witnesses, who are not necessarily in the immediate neighbourhood, and others have to be brought there again, and the result is
<col>400</col>
to inflict a considerable amount of suffering on the poorer class of litigants. That is a very great scandal, and I think we ought to prevent its occurring. I must say I do not know what is the object of insisting that every case should begin in the County Court.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00798"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: That is not the object of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00799"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: I will quote to your Lordships a few dates showing what has happened in regard to County Court cases. I will hand my noble and learned friend the list so that he can verify the statement, but I do not wish to read out either the names of the parties or the County Courts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00800"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I would ask my noble and learned friend whether he can state these cases on his own authority. I know that a number of cases were collected by an association connected with the law. They were statements of great grievances in the trial of cases, and they have nearly every one of them been exploded by subsequent repudiations by the parties concerned. When this matter was discussed before I asked my noble and learned friend if he would give us information of the cases. I am quite sure I could meet every one of them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00801"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My noble and learned friend is hardly serious when he asks me whether I can state these cases of my own knowledge. I will hand him the paper which I hold in my hand in order that he may have every opportunity of investigating whether the statements therein contained are accurate or not, but he would hardly expect me to say of my own personal knowledge whether A B was kept in the Isle of Wight six hours or not. I know nothing about the cases except what I am informed by those who have been careful in the collection of these statistics and whose statements I have every reason to believe are accurate. Here is one case&#x2014;a case of wrongful dismissal&#x2014;which lasted the whole of five days. Counsel states that they were obliged to go down from London on each occasion. The case started on December 1; it was adjourned until December 11; it was then adjourned until January 7, and again until January 16, and judgment was given on a subsequent date. Just observe. Five adjournments! The result of that,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0205"/>
<col>401</col>
of course, is that the expense, is repeated five times. Here is another case. The dates of the hearing were July 16, September 29, November 2, December 9, December 10, January 6, January 7, February 1, February 4, February 13, March 14, and April 15&#x2014;from July to April. And this in the quick Court for poor people! All these adjournments arose, as I have pointed out, from the crowding of the County Courts by these different cases.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00802"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Was the last case to which the noble and learned Earl referred a London case?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00803"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: Yes, a Clerkenwell case. But I assure your Lordships that this is by no means confined to London. Then I take a case of an action remitted from the High Court for trial to the County Court&#x2014;another of the forms in which the County Court has been overloaded. On February 5, the day fixed for the hearing, the parties, with their counsel, solicitors and witnesses, of whom there were eight or nine, attended at Waltham Abbey. At about 3 P.M. it became obvious that there was no probability of the case being reached, and upon application being made to him die Judge kindly granted a special day for the hearing in London. Accordingly, on February 22, the hearing began in London, and when the Judge rose at 4 P.M. the case was little, more than half way through. The Judge again gave a second special day. On Mardi 9 the hearing was resumed in London. Judgment, however, was reserved, and was delivered in London on April 1. These are not isolated cases by any means, and it appears to me that this is really defeating the whole object with which County Courts were set up. Lord Brougham's object was to confine the jurisdiction of County Courts much more than has since been the case. But be that as it may, the state of things at present creates continual annoyance and causes continual loss to small litigants, whose time is their money.<lb/>
There is another matter in the Bill which seems to me very relevant to this. I think the poorer classes of His Majesty's subjects are quite as much entitled to the learning and independence of Judges as the richer. Yet by one of the provisions of this Bill it is proposed to remit certain
<col>402</col>
cases to Registrars. These Registrars of County Courts may be solicitors or not; they may have no legal training at all. The proposal is that when the judge has no time to take these cases, or when there may be no particular reason why the Judge should take them, they should be taken by the Registrar. There are two objections to that. In the first place, the poorer subjects of His Majesty have the right to have their justice as good as the richer class of litigants; and, in the second place, Registrars are very often practising solicitors themselves. In my opinion it is not desirable that a local solicitor, who may have many connections in many ways with local interests, should decide these cases. The parties should have the advantage of a hearing by a perfectly independent Judge.<lb/>
I see no reason whatever, and I have never heard a reason assigned, why Clause 1 should remain in the Bill. I have no objection to the other clauses. On the contrary, I think some of them are very great improvements. But why the Lord Chancellor should insist on everything beginning in the County Court; I cannot make out. It seems to me to be a distrust of the Junior Bar, and although I quite agree that the Bar exists for the public and not the public for the Bar, yet I do think the institution itself is most valuable in the administration of justice, and I think the great injury that would be done to the profession of the Bar by the passing of this Bill would have its reflex operation on the public generally, and would very greatly impair the administration of justice. For these reasons, my Lords, I beg to move that Clause 1 be struck out of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00805"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a matter of regret that the House should be so thin to-night, but this Bill was down yesterday and I postponed it until to-day for the convenience of the noble and learned Earl, because I was very anxious that he should have an opportunity of presenting his views. It is difficult to explain a law reform to laymen, but I will endeavour to explain this proposal as simply as I can. In the first place, the noble and learned Earl is completely mistaken if he thinks that this clause provides that all actions shall commence in the County Court. It is nothing of the kind.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0206"/>
<col>403</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00806"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: Yes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00807"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I beg my noble and learned friend's pardon. The clause provides that County Courts shall, save as subsequently provided, have jurisdiction to hear and determine any action which can be commenced in the High Court notwithstanding that the debt, damage, or damage claimed is not limited to &#x00A3;100 or under. In other words, we say this&#x2014;not that every action shall commence in the County Court, but that if you like you can commence an action in the County Court, which is a very different proposition. Now what is the present state of the law, and how small, except from the one point of view last adverted to by the noble and learned Earl, is the change which we seek to make? Let me make it quite clear. At present the jurisdiction of the County Court is limited to cases under &#x00A3;100, although, if the parties consent, any case above &#x00A3;100 can be tried there. That is the existing law. We propose nothing more than this. Instead of requiring what parties in hostility will seldom agree to, a consent to try a case of upwards of &#x00A3;100 in the County Court; instead of saying that the plaintiff and defendant must first come to an agreement that the case shall be tried in the County Court, we say that the plaintiff may set it down for trial in the County Court subject to the absolute unqualified right of the defendant, if he dissents, to have the case removed at once, absolutely on his own right, to the High Court. That is the whole extent of the change.<lb/>
The reason for this change is very obvious. Cost is the curse of litigation. If I could do anything for the purpose of cheapening as well as simplifying litigation in this country I would willingly do it. The costs are very much greater in the High Court than in the County Court. I received yesterday a letter from one of the County Court Judges, in which he told me of many cases in. which people who were entitled to more than &#x00A3;100 dropped the extra sum in order to be able to bring their action in the County Court without the endless appeals and without the cost of kicking their heels about in the Assize Court or in London, which is prohibitive to people of limited means. My sole purpose and the sole effect of this clause is this. If the plaintiff and defendant agree beforehand, they can now have a case of upwards of
<col>404</col>
&#x00A3;100 tried in the County Court. I propose that the plaintiff shall be at liberty to begin in. the County Court, and that the defendant, if he does not like it, shall have the absolute right to remove the case into the High Court. That is the whole extent of this reform which the noble and learned Earl says will produce disastrous results.<lb/>
It is because I believe it is right and because it is bound up in the texture of this Bill that I say the clause is vital. Two years ago this House threw the clause out, at the instance of the noble and learned Earl, by a majority of five. Now what is the authority in support of this proposal to allow the plaintiff to begin in the County Court, leaving the defendant an absolute right to remove the case to the High Court? There was in the year 1879 a Bill brought before this House and referred to a Select Committee, which comprised Lord Cairns, Lord Selborne, Lord Hatherley, Lord Blackburn, and the noble Marquess the present Leader of the Opposition, although he may have altogether forgotten the circumstance. They reported the Bill to the House; and when we last discussed this Bill in Committee I gave your Lordships the reference to the number of that Bill and the year in which it was introduced in order that you might look it up. That Bill proposed exactly what I am proposing now. But it went further than I do, because I propose to limit this right. It is not to include cases of ejectment, actions for libel, and so forth, nor Chancery actions. Therefore I am more moderate than were Lord Cairns, Lord Selborne, Lord Hatherley, Lord Blackburn, and the noble Marquess opposite in the year 1879. I hope your Lordships will look that Bill up between now and Report and compare it with this Bill. If you do, you will see that I am more moderate than they were. This idea was also revived and reported upon in the year 1907 by the Committee of which my noble and learned friend Lord Gorell was Chairman. That Committee recommended it&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00812"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: There is considerable dissent in the Law Society.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00813"><sup>*</sup><member>The LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: The Law Society is in favour of it, and other law societies are in favour of it. Let me explain how it would work in the first instance. It is proposed that there shall be special Courts, special sittings so as to prevent the very delay which is now complained of&#x2014;that there should be a sort of circuit in the country where these eases should be tried, the places to be approved by the Lord Chancellor for the time being. Who are the objectors? My noble and learned friend says that the Bar objects. I hope riot. The Bar has always been a liberal profession all through the history of England. I am quite certain that the Bar itself&#x2014;I do not care whether its representatives on the Bar Council say one thing or another&#x2014;will not object to this. In the first place, it would be very wrong to allow private interests to interfere with public interests. But apart from that, this proposal is in the interests of the Bar. In the County Courts solicitors have a right of audience, but in the High Court the Bar alone has a right of audience. I know it has been said that the reason why some shortsighted members of the Bar object to this proposal is that they would lose the exclusive right of audience in cases above &#x00A3;100. That undoubtedly would be the result of this clause. I do not believe that the Bar take that line, and, as I say, this proposal would not even injure the Bar. I remember when I was starting at the Bar how glad I should have been of the opportunity of having County Court circuits with small work and an opportunity for young men who will attend to their profession and study it to make their way in the world. I have seen numbers of men losing heart at the Bar because they had not this opportunity in small cases of learning their profession. In all the County Court districts there would be circuits which these men could attend. Again, it is never worth the
<col>406</col>
while of solicitors in large practice to attend to these cases.<lb/>
I am told by the noble and learned Earl that there is pressure on the County Courts at present. It is very odd that I have never heard of it. I am responsible for the business of the County Courts, and I aver this, that during the time I have been Lord Chancellor I have not had complaints of pressure of work except from two County Court Judges&#x2014;only two out of the fifty-five&#x2014;and I have satisfied myself that in neither of those cases was there any ground for the complaint. The Judicial Statistics show the number of days on which each County Court Judge sits. The average is 153 days in the course of the year. Would any of us, would the noble Marquess opposite or any busy man grumble at 150 days' work out of 365? I wish I could get off with even 270 days. This objection is absolutely hollow. There is nothing in it. The noble and learned Earl referred to certain cases. I think I know where he got those cases. They are the eases which were made the subject of complaint at the Bar Council, but every one who followed the matter knows that no sooner were those cases stated than up rose a number of persons who said, "You are quite mistaken; that is not so." I know one case myself to which the noble and learned Earl referred. It was a case in a Loudon County Court which lasted twelve or fourteen days, and which probably ought to have been dealt with otherwise&#x2014;I think by reference to an official referee, for it was a very technical case. There must in every Court be cases which are wrongly so tried.<lb/>
But we are on the point of overwork. The contention was that this case extended over twelve months because the Judge had not sufficient time. I wrote to the Judge and asked him how many days he sat in the year, and he replied "170 days and a few days more for preparing cases." He had no travelling because he was a London Judge. That is the only one of the particular instances I happen to know, and if the others are like that I do not think they will carry very great weight with your Lordships. Out of the thousands and thousands of cases which are constantly being tried you will, of course, now and again find cases in which the Court has not been able to give the desired despatch;
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0208"/>
<col>407</col>
but where the logic comes in of urging cases of that kind as a reason against the proposal I am making in this clause, which is to allow a plaintiff to begin in the County Court subject to the right of removal, is more than I can understand. If any proper complaint is made of overwork and inability to discharge business, there is already power in the Lord Chancellor to appoint extra County Court Judges; but I do not think the case has arisen. It would obviously be my duty, or that of any one filling my position, if there was any pressure, to make the necessary provision by appointing sufficient County Court Judges to transact the business.<lb/>
One more point. The noble and learned Earl complained that our proposals with regard to the Registrar, who is nearly always an experienced solicitor, were unfair to poor people, for whose benefit Lord Brougham passed the County Court Act. But the fact is that there is now jurisdiction in the case of the Registrar to the extent of &#x00A3;2.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00814"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: By consent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00815"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Yes; &#x00A3;2 by consent to be tried before the Registrar. This dreadful Bill proposes that it should be increased to &#x00A3;5, by consent also, but any poor person who wishes to have his case tried before a Judge can have it so tried by refusing his consent to its being dealt with by the Registrar.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00816"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: That is not in this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00817"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Yes it is. Then see who these Registrars are and measure the weight of this objection. A little time ago the noble and learned Earl himself brought in a Bill which extended by consent the jurisdiction of Registrars from &#x00A3;2 to &#x00A3;5.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00818"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: That was by consent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00819"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Yes, by consent, and so it is in this Bill. Then the noble and learned Earl said that this jurisdiction should only be given to district Registrars or Registrars approved of by the Lord Chancellor. If I was pressed, rather than lose the Bill I would consent to that limitation. But, really and truly, who are these Registrars, who are trusted up to &#x00A3;2 and distrusted up to &#x00A3;5? In
<col>408</col>
Bankruptcy cases they have unlimited jurisdiction. In other cases also they have a large jurisdiction. And, after all, if you have the safeguard that the Registrar is not to try unless there is consent, where is the mischief? I pass from that subject. The Bill is full of provisions consequential or related to this clause. I have put this proposal forward to endeavour to give poor people a chance of cheap litigation. I restrain nobody. I only enable where there is consent. I give a little presumption in favour of the jurisdiction and no more, and I am very sorry that the clause is objected to by a great authority for whom I have such a sincere respect. All I can say is that I did not know before what grave consequences would follow from such a small cause as the change in this respect which I propose.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00820"><member>LORD ROBSON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor has stated that the change which he is proposing to make is a small change. It is, however, a significant change, and we have to deal not so much with the machinery of the change as with its effect and its result on the working of the Courts. My noble and learned friend says that all he is doing is to impose on the defendant in each action entered in the County Court the obligation of making an application to remove it to the High Court. The defendant, instead of merely indicating his dissent, will have in future to make a formal application involving costs. It may be a small matter, but it may result in a great removal of work from the High Court to the County Court. The object of the Bill is undoubtedly to bring about that transfer. Whether the machinery is adequate for the purpose or inadequate is a matter of argument. I think it will probably be inadequate.<lb/>
But the question for your Lordships to consider is whether or not the change, great or small, is in itself necessary and desirable for the public convenience. That is the point. It is a very narrow one, and in the very few observations with which I shall trouble your Lordships I shall confine myself to what I may call the purely businesslike aspect of it. I am not going to defend the Bar, much as I feel tempted to enter on that alluring theme. I do not think the Bar will be found, in this case or in any other, to range itself in a way adverse to the public interest.
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0209"/>
<col>409</col>
The Bar has always contained, not only a large number of law reformers, but very nearly all the law reformers. The interests of the Bar are somewhat divided on this question, but without touching the question of the Bar at all I will ask, Is there any case, so far as the High Court is concerned, to take that first, why its work should be removed to the inferior Court? A short time ago there was an excellent case for relieving the High Court in one way or another of the great strain of work placed upon it. But the Government in that instance, very happily, as I think, decided to do for the King's Bench Division what it had done some years before very effectively for the Chancery Division, and two new Judges were appointed. The result is that the work of the High Court is not only well in hand, but is proceeding with a degree of rapidity which is rare in the annals of our judicial administration. So far, therefore, as the High Court is concerned there is no reason at all why its work should be transferred to other, and possibly overworked, tribunals. But turn to the County Courts, and here one must be guided by the experience of those who are actually at work in those Courts. What is the state of business in the County Courts? To me it seems to be almost beyond a doubt that in the principal County Courts the work is beyond the proper convenience of the Court. There are, of course, many Courts that are lightly worked, but there are others that are overworked.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00821"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Will you give me your authority for that statement?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00822"><member>LORD ROBSON</member><membercontribution>: I will give instances in a minute which will show conclusively that there are County Courts that are overworked. My noble and learned friend said that County Court Judges sit on an average 153 days in the year. I should have thought that the controversies with which your Lordships and everybody have become familiar would have made us a little careful of the fallacies which lurk in averages. It is no consolation to a litigant who is enduring the inconvenience referred to by Lord Halsbury of not being able to get consecutive sittings for the hearing of his case to be told that he really has nothing to grumble about because in Devonshire and in Cornwall and in the rural districts of the Midlands the County Court judges are scarcely sitting at all. That is no consolation to him. It is un-
<col>410</col>
doubtedly true that some Courts are under-worked and some are overworked. That being so, I daresay you may get an average which may tell one way or another, but it will not help us to an appreciation of the real difficulty.<lb/>
Now what is the state of things in the overworked Courts? Let us look, as the noble and learned Earl opposite invited us to do, at the object of these Courts. The great law reformer to whom the noble and learned Earl referred, Lord Brougham, said he wanted to make justice pure, prompt, and cheap throughout the whole area of England. One cannot look at the cases set out in this document which I hold in my hand, issued by the Bar, without seeing that undoubtedly in many cases it is pure, prompt, and cheap, but I do not know that it is always satisfactory. What is this document, to which the noble and learned Earl opposite also referred? it contains statements made by twenty-seven barristers who were invited by the Bar Council to give them and the public the benefit of their personal experience in County Courts. I do not know that you can have better evidence in relation to a matter like this than these statements. Twenty-seven barristers are approached. They are not searched out by some eager litigant to give evidence favourable only to his own cause. They are gentlemen whose names can be given to the Lord Chancellor if he desires them, who speak from their own books, and who vouch for the authenticity and accuracy of the facts which they put into these statements. What do they say? Take the first. The case mentioned by the noble and learned Earl as being first on the list was a case of wrongful dismissal. It was a case involving character, and therefore it was fought strenuously and at length. A King's Counsel was sent down; and, by the way, that is one of the consequences of transferring jurisdiction from the High Court to the County Court. Cases may be of great importance though of small amount. It is stated that there were five adjournments of this case. Why? The reason is given in the next instance. There a barrister went down to a County Court which he mentions. He says&#x2014;
<quote>"We arrived at 10.40. There were five other counsel besides myself. We were all summoned for ten o'clock. There were 200 judgment summonses which lasted from 11 A.M. until about 3 P.M."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0210"/>
<col>411</col>
Those, by the way, are the persons for whom these Courts were constituted. I dare say they do not much appreciate the privilege, but it was for the poor debtor and the small creditor that the County Court was in the first instance formed.<lb/>
There were in this particular Court no fewer than 200 summonses against debtors on that day. Imagine what that means. Imagine the number of persons who, at the loss of a day's pay, are obliged to attend the Court and hang about its precincts for hours. But those cases must be disposed of. The Legislature in its wisdom has thought fit to add to County Court jurisdiction other cases which were proper for the High Court, at all events, which involved the employment of eminent Counsel. In this instance the important cases had to wait. You may say that at all events the judgment summonses were disposed of. They were. But look at the figures. Two hundred judgment summonses disposed of in four hours! That is fifty per hour. It is very nearly a case per minute. I have no doubt it was pure; it was certainly prompt, and I hope it was cheap, but I cannot help thinking that a little more time might have been given to those 200 judgment summonses. With the immense mass of litigation before the Judge, and with the heavy cases awaiting his attention, it is not difficult to imagine that even the most conscientious and careful judge may be somewhat unduly hustled. There happened on this day what might have been expected. The barrister whose statement I have quoted continues&#x2014;
<quote>"My case was called on at 5 P.M., and at 6.30 was adjourned for a fortnight, the other cases being all put off. Many of those cases were jury cases."</quote>
Can you conveniently and wisely combine in one Court&#x2014;because that is the real <i>crux</i> of the difficulty&#x2014;litigation like that of judgment summonses with the heavy litigation which you are now putting on County Courts?<lb/>
See what you have been doing in this direction for some years. I think it has been overdone. The County Court has been made the tribunal for all kinds of recent legislative measures&#x2014;the Workmen's Compensation Acts, the Agricultural Holdings Act, the Land Tenure Act, the Factory Acts in very large measure&#x2014;a great mass of litigation of that kind, part
<col>412</col>
of which is really administrative. All that has been put upon the County Courts, and more apparently is going to be put upon them. This is bound to produce, not perhaps always, not throughout the whole year, but it is bound to produce at times in certain Courts a congestion of work. You cannot get at that by averages. You can only get at it by the experience of those who have suffered from the congestion. A few heavy cases may throw out of gear the work of the Courts for a considerable time. In dealing with the litigation of the poor you ought to make sure that at all times they have a ready and cheap access to the tribunals of justice. These twenty-seven statements by barristers are, of course, as the noble and learned Earl said, much too long, though they are, happily, concise, to quote at any length or other than in the most general way. They were originally made with regard to the question as to whether or no divorce jurisdiction should be given to County Courts. One barrister says&#x2014;
<quote>"As far as the London Courts are concerned, I say without hesitation that they have already as much business as can be dealt with satisfactorily."</quote>
The noble and learned Earl mentioned the case at Waltham Abbey. It is a really instructive case. He mentioned the number of times that it came up for hearing. It was remitted from the High Court. It began on February 5, and judgment was delivered, after many adjournments, in London on April 1. It was a horse case, and I see that during all that time the horse was standing at liberty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00823"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: That was not the case I referred to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00824"><member>LORD ROBSON</member><membercontribution>: No, but I think one can gather the great inconvenience arising from such cases being tried in the County Court, where you cannot always get continuous sittings. Though there may be in the High Court delays in getting on the list, when you do get on you are sure of continuous sittings. But in the County Court you have great delays in getting on, and then you do not get continuous sittings. One barrister puts it in this way&#x2014;that the pint pot of the Courts is overflowing with a quart of litigation; and he adds that it is impossible to get a record of the cases settled at any sacrifice rather than incur the expense of adjournments.<lb/>
It was my duty as Attorney-General some time ago to make inquiry into the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0211"/>
<col>413</col>
state of business in the High Court, and I confess I was shocked to find, from counsel and litigants whose accuracy I could not possibly doubt, what a number of cases were settled because of the delay. I have heard hon. members in the other House say, "Do not be afraid of little arrears here and there; they are always cleated up." Yes, they are. You can always settle arrears. You can always get rid of an excess of business in the Law Courts. All you have to do is not to hear the eases. The parties cannot keep litigation hanging over their heads for ever, and they often come to a settlement, though at great sacrifice to those who probably have a perfectly just case. That is the kind of danger that happens. You get in the County Court the small work of the poor impeded and delayed, and therefore made more costly; and the larger cases are also delayed and made more costly, and frequently settled at a sacrifice of justice. The great point which these cases show is the disadvantage of not being able to get continuous sittings.<lb/>
Now my noble and learned friend says he will get continuous sittings. Under this Bill he is going to set up special sittings which may be continuous. What is the effect of that to be on the smaller work of the County Courts, and how can you be sure, with a County Court that has to move on circuit, that you will be able to keep to your special sittings? You may fix a two days' special sitting in one place and a two days' special sitting somewhere else; but you may be in the middle of a case in the first place at the end of the two days, but you must move on because you have all your people waiting in the next place. These barristers say that in spite of the disadvantages of the delays in getting on in the High Court, the great advantage of being able to get continuous sittings there makes up for any minor advantages that might attach to County Courts. Here are twenty-seven men of character and judgment and experience. They go, as they say, almost at random through their fee books to get a record of the adjournments and delays that they have had to experience, and they tell a story which shows that, in spite of what we hear about averages, in spite of generalities and statements which cannot be very precisely tested, there is a very unfortunate state of things in the busy County Courts, and it is the busy Courts
<col>414</col>
that you are going to overload. The overworked Courts are generally those which have the best Judges. They are the men who will have the greater work in future.<lb/>
I believe we shall have sooner or later to take in hand the question of improving and perhaps localising to a large extent the administration of justice in England. I am by no means sure that the old methods fairly worked out may not prove quite effective. I do not think the circuit system has really received a fair trial. My noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor referred to legal reforms. My experience of legal reforms was that of cutting down the Newcastle business from ten days to five, and when the number of cases had been diminished cutting down still further the number of days. There has been for years in the Judicial administration of England a refusal, I think a foolish refusal, of adequate facilities for the hearing of cases. I have seen it in the High Courts, I have seen it in the County Courts, and on circuit. We have undoubtedly done much to drive business from the Courts because we have not had, first, an adequate Judicial staff, and secondly, adequate local convenience. There are means of improving the administration of justice without adopting this method, which is to take from underworked High Courts work proper for them and put it on the shoulders of overworked County Courts, where it is not appropriate either to the machinery or the Judge.</membercontribution></p>

the Committee of 1879 and on the Bill introduced by Lord Cairns. It really is not. That was a Bill which allowed every kind of action to be commenced in the County Court. This is a Bill which only takes some of the King's Bench cases and says they may be commenced in the County Court. I ask, If this principle is right, why are Chancery cases not treated in the same way? We are trying in the King's Bench Division and in the Chancery Division cases of exactly the same kind constantly. They are heard in exactly the same way, except that in the Chancery Division there are seldom juries. But if it is to be a principle in our system that any case may be commenced in the County Court, I say it should be applied quite as much to Chancery cases as to King's Bench cases. That has a material bearing on some of the suggestions made by the Lord Chancellor.<lb/>
It is next said that this Bill is for the purpose of saving costs and to prevent poor litigants being bled. I should like to have heard some statistics in support of that statement. This clause would have the effect in certain Comity Courts of imposing upon a number of litigants great delays. Litigants who took advantage of this Bill would not have their cases heard on consecutive days, with the result that the costs would be increased. It is my opinion that the result of hearing this kind of ease in the County Court would be that hearings would be extended over a far longer time, instead of being heard consecutively from day to day as they would be on circuit or in London, with the result that the costs would be very much increased. Then the Lord Chancellor said there were now endless appeals. The effect of this Bill will be that there will be more appeals, because there is an additional appeal from the County Court. A case goes from the County Court to a Divisional Court, then to the Appeal Court, and, where that appeal is allowed, to the House of Lords. In this Bill there is to be an appeal on fact in cases above &#x00A3;100. At present there is no appeal on fact. That may be satisfactory or unsatisfactory, but the result will be that the number of appeals will be increased under this Bill and not decreased.<lb/>
The Lord Chancellor said, quite truly, that the average number of days on which a County Court Judge sits is between 150 and 160; but I say with very great
<col>416</col>
submission that the noble and learned Lord overlooks what the working of this Bill will be. It is in places like Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Leeds, Cardiff and Bristol where you have the most experienced County Court Judges. I know County Court Judges who are perfectly competent to try any case, and who are quite as competent to try a patent case as any Judge of the High Court; and there is no reason why a patent case should not be tried in the County Court. The Lord Chancellor says he proposes to have special sittings. I contend that if special sittings are taken they will strike at the root of the County Court system. I have communicated with several County Court Judges with reference to this Bill, and they tell me that their sittings are arranged for three and four months in advance. I am not now speaking of Judges who always sit in one place, but of Judges who go to our principal towns. The sittings of those Judges are arranged for months beforehand, and if special cases are to be taken they must be sandwiched in between the ordinary work arranged for; and if you have a case lasting five, six, or seven days, the result will be that you will have the ordinary sittings of the County Court postponed. Moreover, invite people to have cases to an unlimited amount tried in the County Court is contrary to our system. I respectfully say that it will not diminish cost. It will not diminish appeals. And if it is to be said that this reform is advocated because people are now bled in costs in the High Courts, that applies equally strongly to those cases which are now being heard in the Chancery Division, and you must, amend matters by stopping the causes which lead to increased cost if such exist. Therefore the first thing I have to say with reference to this provision is that von will find that it will work only in those places where there are experienced County Court Judges who have already ample work to do, and you will have the difficulty which is inseparable from our present system&#x2014;that you will not be able to avoid adjournments which involve great expense.<lb/>
I ask how it can be suggested, when you can in the High Court have these cases heard day by day without interruption and when you can on circuit have them heard day by day without interruption, that it is better to have a system
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0213"/>
<col>417</col>
whereby the hearing of these cases must be broken and must be interrupted? Then the Lord Chancellor said that he would appoint special Judges if necessary for the purpose of relieving the present County Court Judges. I object to the appointment of temporary or Deputy Judges. I do not believe in men being Judges one day and not Judges the next day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00828"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: What I said was that I would appoint as many permanent County Court Judges as were necessary. I may further add that not only I but my predecessor and all Chancellors have always been in the habit of appointing Deputy Judges on occasions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00829"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: I quite understand that that has been the practice. But this particular amendment of the law if it be right, which is to allow King's Bench actions to be tried in the County Court, can only be properly worked in the large towns by an addition to the County Court Judges, or by the appointment of Deputy Judges. I trust that as far as possible poor litigants will be allowed to have a permanent Judge to try their cases, not a man who is a Judge one day and goes back to the Bar the next. There is a proposal in the Bill to give County Court Judges more time by allowing, Registrars to try cases up to &#x00A3;5. I quite understand that my noble and learned friend means by consent, but I do not think the Bill says so. I think that under the Bill a plaintiff can bring a case up to &#x00A3;5, and the defendant has to remove it if he does not wish it to be dealt with by the Registrar.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00830"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: He has to object.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00831"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: The clause which deals with the extension of the jurisdiction of Registrars is Clause 5, subsection (1) of which runs&#x2014;
<quote>"Any action in a County Court for a debt or liquidated money demand not exceeding five pounds may be heard and determined by the Registrar, unless any party within such time and in such manner as may be prescribed gives notice requiring the case to be heard by the Judge of the Court."</quote>
That is exactly what I say. The plaintiff can bring any action for a debt or liquidated money demand not exceeding &#x00A3;5 to be determined by the Registrar, and the defendant has to say that he wishes the
<col>418</col>
case tried by the Judge. With the greatest respect to the Registrars, I submit that the principle of our County Court jurisdiction is that the poor litigant shall have his case decided by a competent Judge. The noble and learned Lord may think that it is merely a question of sentiment, but it is not. The poor man wishes his case to be decided by a Judge just as a criminal likes to be tried by a Judge rather than by a Commissioner. I hope my noble and learned friend does not sneer at that feeling. You may say that it does not matter whether the Registrar hears such a case or whether it goes before the County Court Judge, but there are many poor litigants who think that it does make a difference; and although it is a most laudable desire to cheapen litigation and make it more expeditious, it ought not to be done at the expense of the County Court system. I submit to your Lordships that the result of this particular amendment of the law will be that a number of cases which ought to be tried in the High Court and on circuit will be tried in the County Court, and I further submit that it is not the fact that they will be tried more cheaply or more expeditiously. I believe the expense will be greater owing to the number of adjournments which must be involved and the greater number of appeals.<lb/>
I really have to say something for the High Court of Judicature. I am sure my noble and learned friend does not mean to disparage the High Court, but he has said to-night things which will be understood as meaning that these cases can be just as well tried in the County Court as in the High Court. I do not think so. I speak at any rate with some experience in the matter. I do not consider that the trial of such cases in the County Court will be satisfactory. From the point of view of the Judge's note they will be most certainly not satisfactory. I have had hundreds of appeals before me from County Courts, and the difficulty has frequently been that the notes taken have not been sufficient to enable us to deal properly with the matter. If these cases are heard in the County Court they will either involve the Judge in much greater labour and deliberation than at present, or will be heard in a way which will not be satisfactory when it comes to the Court of Appeal. There will also be great congestion of business in the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0214"/>
<col>419</col>
Courts where these important cases are tried. I submit that the proper course would have been to increase the facilities for trial in the High Court and not persuade people to have High Court actions tried in the County Court. If it is said that at present there are cases being tried in the High Court which ought to be tried in the County Court and that thereby people are being involved in extra costs and delays, let us have information that will enable us to form an opinion upon that, but I must say it is contrary to my experience.<lb/>
The clause under discussion imposes no limit. Any action, whatever its amount, may be commenced in the County Court. It is not a small change. I agree with my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor that if it was merely a small matter it would not be worth debating; but I believe the practical result will be that both plaintiff and defendant will desire to have their case tried by a particular County Court Judge, who will try their case at the expense of the other litigants in this sense, that the cases of the other litigants will be delayed and the days which ought to be appropriated to the regular County Court business will be taken up by this other business. I am quite satisfied that the suggestion that King's Bench actions cannot be tried in the County Court without delay is well founded. It is very easy and very taking, and produces great effect outside, for the Lord Chancellor to talk about being here on behalf of the poor and to say that we are opposing him. But he has done nothing to show that the effect of the alterations would be to cheapen legislation or to lead to a more satisfactory administration of justice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00832"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I ask your Lordships' indulgence while I make a few observations upon this clause. This matter has been present to my mind now for some years, and I had the privilege of presiding over the Committee whose Report formed the basis of this Bill. I think I shall be able, therefore, to put some matters before your Lordships which have not up to the present received from those who oppose this clause adequate consideration. I wish to supplement, if I may, what my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor said about the change which it is sought to produce by this Bill. It is easy to speak, as some speakers have done, as if
<col>420</col>
this was in effect an attempt to compel people to go to the County Court. It is nothing of the kind. The present law, as laid down by the Act of 1888, is that persons may, by a signed consent, take any common law case into the County Court. They could do nothing more under this Bill, except that this Bill enables the persistent plaintiff to get over the difficulty which he experiences when he proceeds to ask the defendant to consent. Though it is not easy to get defendants to consent, they may be ready, when the case is once brought in the County Court, not to object to its being taken there.<lb/>
The first general observation I should like to make is this, that this being not a compulsory matter but a means for facilitating getting a case taken in the County Court unless the other side objects, there will be no congestion. If there were any danger of delay through congestion the parties would immediately decide not to go to the County Court but to begin the case in the High Court. Any idea of congestion would be at once got rid of by the parties not using the County Court. And if the plaintiff began his case in the County Court the defendant, if he thought he was going to incur more costs or experience snore inconvenience by the case being tried there, could remove the case to the High Court. I think that is a complete answer to the Lord Chief Justice when he suggests that there will be congestion and that this proposal will add to the difficulties which the County Courts already experience. It is suggested by the Lord Chief Justice that if this extension is right it ought to apply to Chancery proceedings. That is not really sound, if I may respectfully say so, because, although that was contemplated in Lord Cairns's Bill, Chancery proceedings generally involve a large amount of property, and people would not be disposed, I think, to bring such cases in a Court whose officers were not familiar with the forms involved in Chancery proceedings. That was the reason given to me by one of the Chancery Judges on the question of Chancery proceedings when I was presiding over the Committee. Another point that is forgotten is that in great centres of population, in Lancashire, for instance, there is a local Chancery Court&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00833"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: That is not a County Court.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0215"/>
<col>421</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00834"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: I agree, but there is a Court with unlimited jurisdiction in Lancashire. I venture to assert that the demand which has existed for this change is one which there is no prospect of meeting M the High Court. This proposal is not even so recent as the Lord Chancellor thought. He had probably forgotten that the proposal was first made by the celebrated Judicature Commission of 1870, whose labours resulted in the present Judicature Acts and the present constitution of the High Court. The majority of that Commission recommended precisely the same thing as the Lord Chancellor is recommending to-day. I have an extract from their Report before me. They say&#x2014;
<quote>"Subject to the power of transfer, these Courts [County Courts] should have unlimited jurisdiction."</quote>
The power of transfer, as far as I can follow it, was that if a &#x00A3;50 claim was brought the defendant should have the right of removal. So that for forty years this proposal has been before the country. It was also recommended by the Committee to which I have referred and over which I presided, and it is important to bear in mind that that Committee included one of the most experienced County Court Judges and also one of the most experienced County Court Registrars, the latter being an ex-president of the Law Society, both of whom were in favour of this proposal. That point seems to me of importance when your Lordships remember that the only objection we have heard to this clause to-day is that it will lead to congestion.<lb/>
My noble and learned friend Lord Robson mentioned a certain number of cases selected&#x2014;over how many nears and from how many cases I do not know&#x2014;by certain members of the Bar who object to this proposal. I have informed your Lordships that two of the most experienced persons you can find on a subject like this do not see any of these difficulties. I ask your Lordships to remember that if this proposal does lead to blocking of the Courts the parties will not go there. The plaintiff need not go there, and the defendant can remove the case. But, as I have said, there is no real reason to think that this congestion will occur. One word more about the Report of the Committee over whom I presided. There were nine members on that Committee. One dissented, four qualified their assent to the proposal, and
<col>422</col>
four were absolutely in favour of it. The four who qualified their assent were in favour of it if greater facilities were afforded by the High Court, but we have looked in vain from that time for such facilities as really meet the difficulties of this particular class of case. The only change that has been made has been to increase the Circuit facilities on the last place on the Assize.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00835"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: I am not aware of any suggestion which has been made which has not been carried out in the King's Bench Division.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00836"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: The suggestion in the Report of the Committee was that facilities should be given to enable people to get their cases tried more quickly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00837"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: I would point out that we have increased the Civil facilities at several towns in the Autumn Assize, and have recently taken further powers of doing so. We have readjusted the days, and given Manchester and Liverpool a practically continuous Civil Judge. We have given these facilities at all places where they are required.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00838"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: I admit that certain changes have been made in regard to the business at the last Assize towns on the circuit. But there are only two Assizes per annum at almost all these places. That is utterly out of date and unsatisfactory, and that is the reason why there is this demand for an increase in the powers of the County Court. The demand has been growing and is still growing, and unless this clause is adopted you will find it grow to a far more sweeping extent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00839"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble and learned Lord tell us the demand?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00840"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: I will deal with that point when I come to it. There is this further point, that this Bill has been before the country for a considerable time and that this clause, which is the only clause substantially objected to, has been considered by the law societies. These societies have had it fully before them, and I have myself seen the president and ex-president of the London Law Society, who have been in communication with all the other law societies in the country. A great variety of Amendments were suggested by those societies, all of
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0216"/>
<col>423</col>
which passed through my hands and were mostly put into the Bill before its recommitment. There has been no suggestion from first to last that this clause did not meet with the approval of all the societies in the country, and I believe I am correct in saving that it is approved by all the Chambers of Commerce.<lb/>
This proposal is made on the grounds of convenience and cost. With regard to convenience, can it be suggested in these days of the telephone, telegraph and rapid railway travelling that two Assizes a year in the great majority of the circuit towns in this country are adequate? It is true that cases can be heard more frequently in some of the big centres, but the great bulk of towns in the country get an Assize only twice a year. Is it reasonable that that should be the only facility in a country like this for getting cases of substance heard? By consent a larger number of cases every year are brought to the County Courts than are brought to the High Courts on Circuit. In 1905 there were 947 cases brought in the County Court by consent; in 1906, 961; in 1907, 724; and in 1908, 685. Those are cases over &#x00A3;100 brought by consent. The number of cases brought to the High Courts on Circuit were: in 1905, 751; in 1906, 620; in 1907, 580; and in 1908, 658. Those figures are not quite comparable, because the first figures are of the number of plaints issued and the second of cases tried; but I have searched in vain to find how many of the plaints issued in the County Courts were actually tried. But the fact remains that by consent a larger number of cases are brought every year to the County Courts than are actually disposed of in the High Courts on Circuit. What becomes, therefore, of the suggestion that the transference is to a Court already so much blocked?<lb/>
On the question of cost, I had placed before me for the purpose of the Divorce Commission a vast amount of evidence upon the respective costs of County Courts and High Courts. One witness gave the figures of 77 cases taxed by him as High Court Registrar in the north of England. He also filled the office of Registrar of the County Court, and had taxed 47 cases of the extended jurisdiction of the County Court, and I gathered from his evidence that substantially the class of case was the same as taken at the Assize. The result was very remarkable. The largest figure
<col>424</col>
of the cost in the High Court was &#x00A3;320 and the lowest &#x00A3;35, the average being &#x00A3;108. In regard to the County Court cases, the highest figure was &#x00A3;106 and the lowest &#x00A3;8, the average being &#x00A3;30. I venture to suggest that that is probably the true representation of the position with regard to the business of the two Courts, and you cannot wonder, if people can get their cases tried for &#x00A3;30, &#x00A3;40, or &#x00A3;50 instead of &#x00A3;120, &#x00A3;130, or &#x00A3;150, they are apt to seek the Court which is at their doors and where their cases can be heard so cheaply. Both in the matter of convenience and cost there is sufficient to explain why we find people consenting to go into the County Court.<lb/>
It is interesting to point out how much England is behind other countries in facilities for bringing cases rapidly, economically, and locally. I have taken the trouble to investigate the state of matters in France. In France there are 375 tribunals of the High Court covering the whole country, and in every one of those tribunals you can bring your suit, no matter how much is involved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00841"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: Does the noble and learned Lord recommend the judicial system of France to this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00842"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: No; but I recommend the facilities. In Germany there is a local High Court for every 250,000 of the population, and the result is that the parties can get their case always heard within not more than thirty miles from where they live. In Holland there are twenty-three local High Courts. I suggest that the first objection to the clause, which is that it will so block the Courts that poor people will be placed in a difficulty, overlooks the provision ill the Bill of extended powers to the Registrars. That has been somewhat flouted because it is said that poor persons have the right to have their cases heard by the Judge. So they have, and I was very strong on the Committee in suggesting that nothing should be done to take away from the poorest person the right to have his case tried by the Judge. Consequently the Registrar's powers only come in where the parties do not object. Judgment goes for the plaintiff in 98 per cent. of the cases under &#x00A3;3 in the County Court, and&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00843"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: This Bill does not touch those cases.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0217"/>
<col>425</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00844"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: It gives the Registrar, unless the parties object, power to deal with all that mass of work. It is really only a question of proof, and if this jurisdiction is given to Registrars by extending the amount to &#x00A3;5, you will cover the vast majority of cases that come to the County Court, and the Judge will have so much more time in which to do his work. The other point which has been misunderstood is this. The Bill contemplates that the Judge shall have power to have the larger work taken at central places, not merely on special days, but at special places. The great difficulty that County Court Judges meet with is that they have to go compulsorily to every one of the small places. There may be no work to do or very little work, or there may be a great amount of work; but if they found at any place where they are sitting that there is a substantial case to be heard, the particular proposals in this Bill will enable the Judges to say that the case ought to go to a central place. By the arrangements in this Bill there will be a large power of concentrating the work at various centres, thereby getting rid of the difficulties which arise in connection with adjournments, and enabling the decent work, as one might say, over &#x00A3;50 to be taken on continuous days at one place.<lb/>
There are other provisions in the Bill which deal with the saving of time. Small places need not be visited if there is no work, and in certain circumstances cases will be concentrated; and, lastly, the increase in the powers of Registrars will enable County Court Judges to have more time. There is another point under the consideration of His Majesty's Government&#x2014;I refer to the question of committals. If the view presented by a part of the Committee were to be carried into effect&#x2014;that committal for debt should in certain cases be abolished&#x2014;a vast mass of the work of County Court Judges would go. I venture to suggest that the only opposition to this clause is based on a few statistics collected by a certain number of persons over I do not know how long a period. Of course it is easy to find such statistics under the present system; but, even so, the number of cases mentioned is exceedingly small, considering the millions of cases taken in the County Courts. I submit that the various provisions in the Bill meet the objections that have been made, and that the proposal contained in this clause is one that ought to be adopted.<lb/>
<col>426</col>
I have been asked whether there was any demand. My answer is that I believe the whole of the law societies are in favour of this change, and they represent the business community in a large sense. I believe also that the whole of the Chambers of Commerce are in favour of it, and if your Lordships do not accept some such proposal as this it is my firm conviction that much more sweeping proposals will be brought forward. There is a demand in the country for local and cheap facilities. Is not that illustrated by the large amount of business which Parliament has put upon County Court Judges? I venture to suggest that this clause ought to pass, and I urge that your Lordships' House should assist in carrying through a reform which has been demanded during many years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00845"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the subject before your Lordships has been discussed so ably and so completely by the noble and learned Lords who have taken part in the debate that I do not for a moment wish to express any opinion of my own on the merits of the question, which is one with which I am quite incompetent to deal. But I must say, having listened very carefully to the whole of this discussion, that what has struck me most is the extreme difficulty in which members of your Lordships' House who, like myself, are laymen are placed in deciding which way to vote. There is unquestionably, as the noble and learned Lord who has just sat down has said, a strong feeling in the country, in commercial circles at any rate, in favour of greater and cheaper facilities for dealing with litigation locally. When I was President of the Board of Trade&#x2014;some time ago now&#x2014;I well remember that chambers of commerce were continually urging that there should be legislation in the direction of giving greater facilities for the hearing of cases locally, and I believe that feeling still continues.<lb/>
Everybody will sympathise, and I am sure my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury will sympathise as much as any one, with the demand in the country for cheaper and more easy justice. It is, I understand from the Lord Chancellor, in order to give some effect to that demand that he has introduced this measure which your Lordships are discussing to-day. The noble and learned Lord placed before us his arguments
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0218"/>
<col>427</col>
in favour of Clause 1, to which my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury has taken exception. I will only notice one of the remarks which the Lord Chancellor made. He told your Lordships that he regarded this clause as vital to the Bill, and I think I am right in my recollection that when a similar Bill was before your Lordships two years ago [July 26, 1909] and this clause was struck out on the motion of my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury the Lord Chancellor at once dropped the Bill. I have not heard from any noble and learned Lord in the course of this debate any objection to the other proposals in the Bill. In those circumstances I would venture to submit to your Lordships that it is really a matter for our consideration whether to-day we ought to come to a vote on the Amendment of my noble and learned friend behind me, much as I respect his high authority in these matters. Mitch as I respect that authority, I do question whether we ought to go to a vote to-day on his proposal, which would put an end to this Bill.<lb/>
What is the position? We have had a debate which I venture to say has left me in considerable doubt. I should very much like to have an opportunity of going over the report of that debate and weighing the arguments used on each side more than it is possible to do merely from listening to the debate. My noble and learned friend gave no notice of his intention to move the omission of this clause, and it was not anticipated, I suppose, by the great majority of your Lordships' House that such an important debate as this would come on to-day. Consequently we have a very thin House, too thin, I venture respectfully to suggest to your Lordships, to deal properly with so important a matter, and I would earnestly and respectfully ask my noble and learned friend whether he would not be content for the present with the debate which has taken place, and not press his Amendment now, but renew it, if he thinks fit, on the Report stage, by which date we shall have had time to consider the arguments on both sides, and be able to come to a more considered judgment upon the question. I venture to make this suggestion, being extremely desirous that no opportunity should be lost of attempting to bring to the people cheaper and more efficient means of obtaining justice than are available to-day.</membercontribution></p>
<col>428</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00846"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: I am not quite certain that I follow my noble friend's suggestion, but if it is that I should withdraw my Amendment for the present and renew it, if I think proper, on Report, I have no objection to that course. I quite agree that the House is a very thin one to decide upon so important a question raised without notice. It was, indeed, a surprise to me yesterday when I found this Bill on the Paper. I had been sitting all day judicially, and I found out quite accidentally that this particular Bill was on the Paper, and I asked my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor to postpone it until to-day, because I had none of the papers with me at the moment. If the understanding is that I withdraw the Amendment only until Report, I have not the least objection. I think it very reasonable that your Lordships should have more notice and be able to consider the matter more fully. Therefore I withdraw the Amendment now, but I wish to give very definite notice that I shall renew the matter on Report.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00867"><member>THE EARL OF DUNMORE</member><membercontribution>: I put forward this Amendment on behalf of the London County Council six weeks ago. Its object is to enlarge Clause 4 in order that the County Council as the lunacy authority may have power to make an application to the County Court Judge, in addition to the other authorities named in the clause. I might point out that lunatics when received into the county asylums are classified in the first instance as paupers. A lunatic would continue to be classified as a pauper as long as he was chargeable to the board of guardians even if he possessed property, and if the guardians were recouping themselves from that property and paying the cost of his maintenance to the visiting committee. Under Clause 4 as it stands Poor-law officials are empowered to make application to the County Court to appoint some one to administer the estate of a lunatic, but this provision does not extend to County Council officials. It is quite evident, therefore, that the effect of the clause would be this, that where a lunatic is classified as a pauper his estate would be administered through the medium of the board of guardians, and the man would continue to be classified as a pauper, although his estate might be amply sufficient to defray the whole cost of his maintenance. This Amendment proposes to remedy this by enabling County Council officials to make an application direct to the County Court Judge in order that where a lunatic has sufficient property to defray the cost of his maintenance he should not be classified as a pauper. The Amendment is a very simple one. It is non-controversial, and I move it entirely in the interests of the patients. I trust the noble and learned Lord will see his way to accept it.</membercontribution></p>

Under the Act of 1903 the limit was raised from &#x00A3;50 to &#x00A3;100. Now it is proposed to have special sittings, and at these special sittings, according to paragraph (1) of subsection (2), shall be tried all actions as to which jurisdiction is conferred on County Courts by the County Courts Act, 1903, or by this Bill, where the debt, demand, or damage claimed or counter-claimed exceeds &#x00A3;50. The result of that is that the existing law with regard to actions between &#x00A3;50 and &#x00A3;100 is altered, and they are to be tried at special sittings. I do not understand on what ground that change is made, because I do not know that there has been any difficulty in trying cases between &#x00A3;50 and &#x00A3;100 any more than lower amounts. Therefore I would like to know why those cases are to be taken out and sent to special sittings. The next paragraph in the same subsection gives power to try at such special sittings such other actions or matters triable in a County Court as may be prescribed by order of the Lord Chancellor. Would my noble and learned friend tell me what are the sort of actions he contemplates he should send for trial at special sittings? I do not quite see, if actions above &#x00A3;50 are to go to these special sittings, what are the other matters that can be sent there by the Lord Chancellor.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00899"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: The fact is, in order to prevent delay and to get a Bar together and in order to have a sort of small County Court Assize, we propose that there shall be special sittings set apart.

The first is cases between &#x00A3;50 and &#x00A3;100&#x2014;the extended jurisdiction conferred by the noble and learned Earl's Act of 1903. Second, any cases which become triable by virtue of this Bill&#x2014;that is, cases above &#x00A3;100 by consent.

It might be the existing equity jurisdiction, or the existing bankruptcy jurisdiction, or workmen's compensation trials&#x2014;that class of work.

The noble and learned Lord said: This Amendment is to enable the Registrar of the High Court to do what can at present only be done, I understand, by the Judge. There is a decision which I think is sufficient in point, to make it very doubtful whether under the words "ordered by the Court or a Judge," as to time, in consequence of the Judge being the only person who can certify for costs in the High Court, the time could be extended by a Master of the Supreme Court. The suggestion is to give the Master power to extend the time and give the plaintiff the costs unless the order is to the contrary. The insertion of this Amendment would enable the Master to extend the time and not necessitate proceedings before the Judge to do that. The idea is to let the Master deal with the matter as lie is the person who gives an order under Order XIV in the first instance, and therefore ought to have power to extend the time.</p>

The noble and learned Lord said: The object of this Amendment is to rectify a slight error which was caused by introducing an Amendment to the original clause. The original clause allowed of money being paid direct to a person instead of being paid into Court, and there are provisions requiring every judgment to be registered. If the money is paid direct to the party, it is not, strictly speaking, necessary to register. The clause provides that where money is directed to be so paid the judgment shall not be registered unless and until the party entitled to the benefit of the judgment gives notice to the Registrar that the same remains unsatisfied. When that provision in the clause was brought to the attention of some of those familiar with the working of these matters it was pointed out that that left the plaintiff the power to leave his judgment unregistered, and that it was not desirable, as registration was in the interests of the public, that that should be allowed. Therefore the proposal now is to leave out the words from "unless and until" to the end of the clause, and to insert the words standing in my name. That is to say, the clause as amended

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00977"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Report be now received.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00978">Moved, That the Report be now received.&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Morley of Blackburn.</i>)</p>
<col>442</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00979"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have put down several Amendments for the consideration of the House, but before approaching them in detail perhaps your Lordships will allow me, on the Motion that the Report of Amendments be now received, to make a few remarks on the situation in which we find ourselves. I think such a course may possibly tend to shorten the subsequent work of considering my Amendments in detail. This is practically our last opportunity of considering the form in winch this Bill should be sent back to the House of Commons. At this stage we can make further Amendments affecting the character and construction of the Bill, but after this stage the Third Reading does not admit of any substantial change being entertained. We are therefore now on what may be called the final stage of considering in what shape we shall send back this Bill to the House of Commons, and I need scarcely press upon your Lordships that those who desire to get substantial alterations in the Bill accepted elsewhere may well take this opportunity to consider how those alterations should be made as little objectionable as possible.<lb/>
This Bill was received by your Lordships in a remarkable manner. The question embodied in the Bill of a reconsideration of the relations between the two Houses of Parliament has been under consideration now for some time, and every one admits that the time has arrived when it is necessary to make substantial changes. More than that, the Bill itself in full detail was before the electors at the last election, and its meaning and consequences were pressed home on all sides for the consideration of the electorate. According to every test which is usual amongst us, two elections have approved of the principle of the Bill, during one of which the details of the Bill were before the electorate. The result of the two elections was substantially the same, and it was accepted that the mind of the nation had pronounced at least in favour of the principle of the Bill. Your Lordships so far recognised that as to pass the Second Reading without a Division. That being the case, it is not too much to expect that every attempt will be made to keep the character and the principle of the Bill as far as possible unchanged, and that some resentment might be caused, which your Lordships might be disposed to mollify and dissipate, if any appearance
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0226"/>
<col>443</col>
were made of making a complete and thorough change in the Bill.<lb/>
I think there has been apprehension elsewhere that more changes have been effected in the Bill than your Lordships have actually made. The changes are substantially one only, but it has an appearance which elsewhere has been exaggerated. What was the primary cause of inciting this discussion as to the relative powers of the two Houses? It arose out of the action of your Lordships' House&#x2014;I am sorry to have to refer to it again&#x2014;when two years since you rejected the Budget. It was a question of finance, the question closest to the minds of the House of Commons, and there can be no difference of opinion that the country at large decided in favour of the claim of the House of Commons. The claim of the House of Commons to have exclusive power over the finances of the country has been approved by the nation. Now, how has that claim been treated by the Amendment inserted in the Bill by your Lordships? Your Lordships have not been content to pass unchanged the first clause of the Bill which deals with financial measures. On the contrary, you altered it in a way so as to withdraw from the House of Commons the exclusive power which it claims. Those amongst your Lordships who were long in the House of Commons will know how keenly that will touch the feelings of members of that House. I think it is not impertinent to observe that the change made in the first clause of this Bill relative to the financial powers of the House of Commons was made by one of your Lordships&#x2014;the noble Earl on the Cross Benches, Lord Cromer&#x2014;to whom we all listen with the greatest deference and respect, but who will willingly allow that he has had no experience of the House of Commons so as to be in touch with it in regard to its claim to have authority in finance. And I would beg your Lordships to reconsider, even at this late moment, whether you could not usefully restore the first clause of the Bill to the shape in which it came up to us from the House of Commons. Your Lordships have yourselves fully acknowledged the right of the House of Commons to its claim over finance, but you object to that claim being extended to matters which are not financial. That is a danger to which you have been exposed in the past, and the clause in the Bill as it came up
<col>444</col>
from the House of Commons simply stated what was the practice in respect of finance before the year 1909. Questions as to whether a Bill was a Money Bill, and as to whether your Lordships interfered with the privileges of the other House in touching money clauses, were practically decided up to 1909 by the authority of Mr. Speaker, whom the House of Commons implicitly followed, and whose declarations your Lordships universally accepted. There can be no question before 1909 of the fact which I am repeating. I would therefore press on your Lordships the expediency of restoring this part of the Bill, before it goes back to the other House, to the shape in which it came to us from them, recognising and admitting the authority of Mr. Speaker as determining what are money matters, and leaving the action and the power of the House of Commons in respect to such matters absolutely undiminished.<lb/>
I do not wish to press this in detail, but I cannot help referring for one moment to the remarkable speech of Viscount Peel when we last had this Bill under discussion, in which he rehearsed the occasions on which he had had to deal with the relations between the two Houses in respect of supposed intrusion or real intrusion of your Lordships' action in what was the proper domain of the House of Commons, and explained how he had ruled upon them, the House of Commons accepting the ruling and your Lordships deferring to it. That is all that the first clause of the Bill as it originally stood established; and I would earnestly press on your Lordships whether it is not, even now, expedient to restore Clause I to the shape in which it first came up to this House. I would with extreme earnestness bring this before the minds of those who desire changes in the second clause with respect to the power of this House over matters of general legislation. If you want to keep open, I will not say the chance, but if you want to keep open the power of persisting in that Amendment, it would surely be advisable to give way where you must be conscious that in the end you will have to yield. If you are certain that in financial matters the House of Commons will insist on its rights, and you will not insist in objecting to the maintenance of those rights on the part of the House of Commons, would it not be wiser in respect of the interest of your
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0227"/>
<col>445</col>
powers in regard to general legislation to give way in the first instance?<lb/>
As to general legislation also, what was the position up till recently between the two Houses? It will be acknowledged that ever since 1832 what the nation manifested a clear determination to have, what the nation resolved upon, your Lordships accepted as necessary to be done; but that resolution had to be expressed always through the medium of a General Election. It came to this, that a General Election was necessary in order to bring about that expression of national feeling to which your Lordships profess, and honestly profess, you are always ready to submit. But that was a very awkward way of ascertaining the national mind, because you cannot, except on rare occasions, have a single issue decided at a General Election, and even if you have one issue decided you cannot carry the determination on that issue to other questions so as to declare with any weight and conviction that the determination of the one issue also gives the mind of the nation on others. This Bill as sent up from the House of Commons proposed, instead of referring all questions to a General Election, that when a matter is determined upon by the House of Commons in the commencement of its existence after a General Election and maintained for two years, there is an actual certainty that that represents the national mind. We shall always admit that it is a fair presumption that what the House of Commons after the first blush of a General Election decides and maintains for two years does approximately correspond with what is the national will.<lb/>
It is impossible to my mind to refuse the admission of this truth, that under the new conditions which would be set up by this Bill, supposing it became law, our traditions would be changed, our ways of action would be changed, our procedure in respect of consultation and deliberation would be changed, and the atmosphere generally of the political world would undergo a serious alteration. We all know how in the past changes of procedure, and apparently of procedure only, have brought about a change in the way of thinking in the House of Commons and in this House also, and if we establish as a new matter of procedure that what is determined upon in the House
<col>446</col>
of Commons in the first session of a Parliament and insisted upon for two years must prevail, I think we shall certainly lose during those two years the benefit of the consultation, the deliberation, the modifications which in past experience we have derived from delay under similar circumstances. Delay when it leads up to an uncertain General Election, when it cannot be peremptorily brought to an end, may well be productive of consequences which will not follow when the delay is for a fixed period after which the result is inevitable. Therefore I have myself supported, in voice at all events, the suggestion that on rare occasions and under closely-defined conditions and through the operation of a most responsible authority, an opportunity might well be given for matters of the highest moment to be referred, over the decision of the House of Commons even after two years of persistent declaration one way, to the determination of the popular will by way of the Referendum. The Amendments which I have put down are directed to making this reference available only on the rarest occasions on determination by an authority of the highest character, and again that it should be open equally to both sides. The action towards a Referendum might be set in motion by a requisition signed by 200 members of the House of Commons, thus allowing a minority in the other House to appeal against what night appear to be a perverse misrepresentation of the national will.<lb/>
We have appealed in vain to His Majesty's Government to entertain any suggestion of a reference beyond the House of Commons to what may be the will of the electorate at large. Yet we are encouraged not to give up hope that even at the last there may be a possibility, under the strictest possible conditions, of having such a Referendum. The Prime Minister, who was almost the first of our public men to suggest that the question of the Referendum was one that might be seriously considered by political persons, has again and again reserved the possibility, on rare and extreme occasions, of resorting to the Referendum, and the last word spoken on this subject by the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War reserved the same power, that on rare and special occasions and in respect to certain subjects of paramount importance it might be well to allow a Referendum.
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0228"/>
<col>447</col>
We are entitled to ask His Majesty's Government, if they object to what is proposed, to tell us how and when and under what conditions would they themselves allow the Referendum? Under what conditions, at the institution of what authority, or in what manner might the Referendum, which the Government now declare they will not look at, be entertained?<lb/>
It may be that the Prime Minister and possibly the Minister for War think that upon some Bill going through Parliament a clause might he attached to that Bill keeping it back from becoming law until it had been submitted to and approved by a popular vote. In other words, whilst they object to the principle of the Referendum being enshrined in a general law, they would not object to annexing it to some special measure which might be going through Parliament. If that is the suggestion of the Prime Minister and of the Secretary of State for War, if that is what they rely upon, I do not quite know whether to wonder more at the simplicity or at the subtlety of such a suggestion. It is hardly likely that a House of Commons bent upon supporting a Bill and carrying it through all its stages would at the same time add this clause to its provisions, unless, indeed, it is to be taken that there is such insincerity in that House that some Bill is being promoted apparently with great earnestness and full force of conviction yet to which the members are in their hearts opposed, and on which they wish to see a defeat in the country. I am puzzled by both of these hypotheses, and I think we are entitled to ask, if the Referendum is to be used in any way on supreme occasions, what is the nature of those occasions on which it may be used and how may it be employed?<lb/>
I will not refer to the special Amendments I have on the Paper more than to say this, that they reduce the Joint Committee from six to four, making it, I think, a very responsible and authoritative body. And whilst I am on that subject, perhaps I may refer to a question which was addressed to me when we were last considering this Bill by Lord Faber, who inquired whether I had realised what the power of the Speaker would be if the Committee were a Committee of four only, and the Speaker had a casting as well as an original vote. Yes, I had fully realised that power. I think that the Speaker,
<col>448</col>
if he carries one member of the Committee with him, should carry the day. I felt also that that was a suggestion which would not be regarded with an unfriendly eye in the other House of Parliament, because the practice of the House of Commons in respect to Private Bills is to refer them ordinarily to Committees of four, and give to the Chairman a casting vote as well as an original vote, so that they are quite familiar with this practice. It may be that everything is already settled, preordained, predoomed; that, indeed, there are men about us who at this moment are able to tell exactly what the remaining stages and ultimate fortune of this Bill will be as surely as if those stages had already been passed through. It may be that. I am wasting your Lordships' time. If so, I accept the responsibility. In dealing with these Amendments in detail I do press on your Lordships the considerations which I have ventured to offer.<lb/>
The claim for the passage of this Bill is that the mind of the nation must prevail, and that the mind of the nation is expressed in the House of Commons. It is the second proposition which we know is not always accurate, not always true. The mind of the nation is not always accurately expressed by the House of Commons, and the sense of conviction of the failure of the House of Commons occasionally&#x2014;I might say often&#x2014;to convey the mind of the nation, and of its untrustworthiness as expressing the mind of the nation, is a growing conviction. You hear it on all sides. You hear it not merely from Conservatives, you hear it from the most democratic quarters; and a similar feeling has been entertained in other democratic countries, and has resulted in action in consequence there. I admit that the Referendum has not been long before the public in this country, though the late Lord Salisbury some eighteen years ago said a word in favour of it, and the Prime Minister some eight or nine years ago spoke of it, and other men have spoken of it from time to time. Still, it may be that the Referendum will not now be entertained, but the thing upon which the strength of the claim for the Referendum stands&#x2014;namely, the conviction of the uncertain character of the House of Commons as a reflection of the national will&#x2014;remains and will remain, and it becomes greater with the giving of further power to the House of Commons.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0229"/>
<col>449</col>
When this Bill is made an Act it will become of transcendent importance that the House of Commons should be a real mirror of the mind of the nation, and our work should be to set to work to make it so in future. Whatever else comes out of our deliberations, I think there must come a practical resolve to take into consideration not merely the reform of this House but the reform of the House of Commons, so as to give to the other House some substantial reason for asserting the claim On which this Bill is founded. Burke gave to the House of Commons more than a century ago the title of being the express image of the nation. How far it is from being that now we all know. If no other result follows from these deliberations, I hope that at all events there will follow an earnest conviction of the necessity of taking the reform of the House of Commons in hand, so as to make its character such as it is claimed to be in this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

He spoke of our having assented to the Second Reading of this Bill as if that was conclusive proof that we had all assumed that the Bill was to pass. That is a great mistake. I can answer for myself and for a good many of my noble friends beside me that their object in voting, for the Second Reading was simply to have the opportunity of discussing at full length the different clauses of the Bill in Committee. So far from assenting to the principle of the Bill, I may say for my part&#x2014;I cannot speak so positively for others&#x2014;I would never have assented to the principle of the Bill, and I do not undertake to say now that I shall vote for the Third Reading.</membercontribution></p>

With all respect to the noble and learned Earl's experience, I do not think that such a case as that has ever happened.<lb/>
I turn for a moment or two to the speech of my noble friend behind me. I believe noble Lords in all parts of the House will agree that my noble friend Lord Courtney owed us no apology for making those observations. I listened to them, as we all did, with close attention, and I confess that I have very little to quarrel with my noble friend upon until he came to a certain practical suggestion. We on this Bench agree with my noble friend that the necessity for the Bill is admitted&#x2014;it is admitted partially by what offends the noble and learned Earl, the passing of the Second Reading. It cannot be denied that another of my noble friend's observations is perfectly good. He referred to the result of the General Election after the Parliament Bill in full detail had been before the electors. By far the most cogent part of my noble friend's speech&#x2014;I feel sure it must have been felt to be cogent even by noble Lords who detest this Bill&#x2014;was that in which he pointed out&#x2014;and it was a matter on which the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, had spoken&#x2014;that the very thing to provoke and irritate the House of Commons is the persistency of the. House of Lords, with no really good and sound object, in the claim to interfere with finance. Noble Lords opposite reproach us on this Bench with not being conciliatory and refusing concessions. Yet to insist on this claim, as you do under Lord Cromer's Amendment, is the very way to make an understanding impossible. All my noble friend's arguments on that head were as cogent as they could be. In effect, it comes to where the noble Viscount opposite left it the other day when he did not vote with his friends, but voted with his opponents. The noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, asked why you should interfere with the recognised position of Money Bills and demand a power for the House of Lords which has never vet been claimed by it. So far I go entirely with my noble friend.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0230"/>
<col>451</col>
There are now, since my noble friend has put his Amendments on the Paper, three schemes before the House. First, there is the scheme of the Bill. Secondly, there is that of Lord Lansdowne, winch in our view, as I have ventured to say since his scheme was propounded, is a traverse of the Bill. The third is Lord Courtney's proposal, which if he will allow me to say so, is a rather amphibious kind of scheme. He quarrels with some of the proceedings of the noble Marquess and of noble Lords opposite, and on the other hand he goes with the Government in very important particulars. For example, he replaces the first clause&#x2014;the Money Bill clause&#x2014;as it was originally proposed. What is the cardinal proposition we have to resist? It is the Amendment of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition. My noble friend behind me is for giving up the special exemptions&#x2014;the exemption of a Home Rule Bill or such a Bill&#x2014;from the operation of the Parliament Bill. But then my noble friend appears to find no fault with subsection (<i>c</i>) of the noble Marquess's proposal. Then my noble friend would omit from the Committee proposed by Lord Cromer and the noble Viscount opposite the Chairman of Ways and Means of the House of Commons and the Lord Chairman in your Lordships' House. I should have thought, with all deference to my noble friend and to the other persons proposed on this Committee, that that would be to omit the two men whose advice the Speaker would most like to have, and I should think the noble Viscount would agree with me there.<lb/>
Then, lastly, the Bill says that the Speaker of the House of Commons may, if he thinks fit, refer a given Bill to the Joint Committee to ascertain whether it does or does not raise an issue of great gravity; and, second, whether the opinion of the country has been effectively taken upon it. My noble friend proposes to make that compulsory&#x2014;that the Speaker <i>shall</i> refer to the Joint Committee the question whether a given Bill does or does not raise an issue of great gravity, and whether the opinion of the electorate has been ascertained. My noble friend adds a proposition which he has taken from the Reference to the People Bill introduced by Lord Balfour of Burleigh in March last, and which since then has been in a state of very suspended animation, if animation is the right word. My noble
<col>452</col>
friend borrows from that Bill the proposal that the Speaker shall be bound to call the Committee together and set them to work to settle this question if a Minister of the Crown requests him to do so, or if a Resolution of either House is passed calling for it, and he provides that a minority of 200 members of the House of Commons may make such a request. My noble friend is an expert in these matters, and I put this point, to him. Can we suppose that this House would let a Bill pass under Clause 2 without a Resolution&#x2014;I mean after it has gone through all its stages in the Lower House and been rejected here&#x2014;would they let it pass under Clause 2 without passing a Resolution calling upon the Joint Committee to set their powers in motion? Therefore I submit that my noble friend's proposal is, shall I say, nugatory?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00984"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend has not understood the proposition. I referred to the case of a Bill passed by both Houses. A minority in the House of Commons would still be able to make the recommendation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00985"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: Then. I have read the words wrongly. But that fact does not much affect the point. My noble friend's scheme, meritorious as the spirit of it may be, is not a scheme that we at all events can look upon with favour. Nor do I think it will be looked upon with favour elsewhere, because it includes an almost imperative recommendation of the Referendum. And then he proceeds&#x2014;shall I say somewhat coolly?&#x2014;to call upon us here to say what would be a good way of passing the Referendum. We are against it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00986"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: Not always.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00987"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: That may be. My noble friend quoted some sentences that fell from two important members of His Majesty's Government, but those words did not arise on any proposal now before the House. It would be fairer if my noble friend asked the noble Marquess opposite to tell us what the Referendum means and all the rest of my noble friend's catechism, because the noble Marquess has put the Referendum into the Bill. In a sentence almost as dubious as if it were a preamble, he says
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0231"/>
<col>453</col>
that if the Joint Committee think fit the issue is to be submitted to and approved by the electors "in manner to be hereafter provided by Act of Parliament." Why does not my noble friend ask the noble Marquess to tell us how? You have introduced a tremendous innovation in the Joint Committee. That Joint Committee you entrust with the power of deciding whether a question is of such magnitude as to make it proper to refer it to the constituencies. We naturally ask how this is to be done. There is no suggestion in the Bill as to how the machinery of the Referendum is to be adjusted for the purposes of the noble Marquess's Amendment. Therefore I think our withers are unwrung after my noble friend's catechism, though I am grateful to hint for the way in which he has expounded his views, and the spirit and temper, in which I beg earnestly to join him, in which he asks the House at this hour to consider the proposals and the arguments that will come before us this afternoon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00988"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have often observed that members of this House who have had the advantage of sitting in the other House are fond of telling us who have not had that advantage that our habits of debate are somewhat irregular and disorderly. I must confess that it seems to me that the conversation which has been taking place certainly daring the last twenty minutes has been of a most desultory and inconvenient description. I take no exception whatever to the introductory statement made by my noble friend Lord Courtney, but since he unfolded, as he was entitled to do, the general outline of his scheme we have been discussing <i>seriatim</i> the Amendments which are on the Paper, and which we shall have to discuss over again <i>seriatim</i> when we get further into the business of the evening. I certainly prefer to reserve what I have to say on the different Amendments&#x2014;and I have something to say upon them&#x2014;until we reach those Amendments.<lb/>
But I desire to enter a respectful protest against two statements which were made by the noble Viscount during the course of his speech. In the first place, he told the House that he conceived that by the insertion of certain Amendments in this Bill we had rendered it one of which,
<col>454</col>
in a general way, we were prepared to approve. Nothing could be further from the fact than that statement. We read the Bill a second time, reluctantly I admit, and we deemed it our duty during the Committee stage to make such Amendments as seemed to us essential in order to deal with some of its most objectionable features; but if every one of those Amendments was accepted we should still regard the Bill as a very dangerous measure and one of which we could not approve. We regard it, above all, not as a measure which would permanently take its place upon the Statute Book, but as admittedly&#x2014;and I think the admission is made on both sides of the House&#x2014;a provisional measure intended to deal with a temporary state of things. The other statement to which I take exception is the noble Viscount's assertion that we on this side desire to claim for your Lordships' House powers over finance which we had never ventured to claim before. That is not the case. We desire to prevent this House from being deprived of rights in the region of finance which we conceive to be ours and which, beyond all question, are taken from us in the most arbitrary manner by the Bill on the Table.<lb/>
Only one other point will I notice. The noble Viscount took me rather severely to task&#x2014;I do not exactly know how he introduced the subject into the course of his speech&#x2014;because I had moved an Amendment to the Bill which contemplated resort in certain circumstances to the Referendum, and he said with perfect truth that there is at the present moment no machinery for the Referendum in existence. But if the noble Viscount Will kindly recall what I said the other evening he will remember that I dealt fully with that point and that I called his attention to the fact that there were already two schemes for the machinery of the Referendum before your Lordships' House, and I added that if we received the slightest encouragement from noble Lords opposite we were prepared at two or three days' notice to lay a Bill On the Table containing our views as to what that machinery should be. I hope, my Lords, that we shall now be allowed to approach the discussion of the Amendments.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-00997"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord has moved to restore this Bill, so far as Money Bills are concerned, to the position in which it was when it was introduced, by substituting the Speaker for the Joint Committee to which your Lordships agreed. We have discussed this matter on two occasions already, and on both occasions your Lordships accepted the substitution of the Joint Committee for the Speaker, the second time without a Division. Therefore I hope I may be excused
<col>456</col>
if I do not repeat the arguments with which I troubled your Lordships on former occasions.<lb/>
But the noble Lord opposite has raised to-day two fresh arguments. He suggests that because the noble Viscount, Lord Peel, who addressed your Lordships the other clay with so much authority on this matter, had informed your Lordships that on the only two occasions on which he had to decide questions of privilege against the action of this House your Lordships had assented to his decision, it was therefore practically agreed that the Speaker was the proper tribunal to decide such questions; but the noble Lord entirely forgot that, even while he said that, Lord Peel expressed his own very strong opinion that the Speaker was not the proper tribunal on which to impose this duty. Further, I would entirely controvert the statement of the noble Lord opposite that it has been universally agreed that the decisions of the Speaker of the House of Commons in this matter are conclusive.<lb/>
I can refer to two occasions during the last few years, long after Lord Peel's Speakership, when certain decisions on the question of privilege were given by the Speaker of the House of Commons and were energetically protested against by your Lordships' House. The first case was in the year 1906 on the Irish Labourers Bill, when some change, made by your Lordships, I believe in the process of arbitration, was held by the Speaker of the day as possibly imposing some increased charge upon the ratepayers. Your Lordships protested against that view, and did not agree with the reasons which the House of Commons gave for considering it a question of privilege. Again, there was a very notable instance in the year 1908 upon the Old Age Pensions Bill. That was not a Money Bill; nobody will contend that it was; but, of course, it contained provisions with regard to the application of funds towards old-age pensions. Your Lordships made two Amendments, among others, in that Bill. The first was to decrease the period of imprisonment which disqualified a person from receiving a pension; the second was merely to substitute borough councils in London as the pension authority in place of the London County Council as proposed in the Bill. For some mysterious reason both of these Amendments were
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0233"/>
<col>457</col>
ruled by the Speaker to be questions of privilege, and were dissented from on that ground by the House of Commons. Your Lordships did not insist on your Amendments, but while accepting that position you protested most strongly by a special Resolution against the action of the House of Commons and expressed your opinion that it ought not to be taken as a precedent. Therefore I contend that the noble Lord opposite was entirely wrong in saying that the decisions of the Speaker had been universally accepted or, matters of finance. Of course, there are always two sides to a question of the kind. I must not be understood for a moment as saying that the Speaker of the day decided wrongly on those matters. I am not qualified to express an opinion; but it is the fact that your Lordships held a totally different view, and it is also the fact that it is now proposed to make the arbitrator deciding between the two Houses on disputed questions of this kind the Speaker of the House of Commons alone. I hope your Lordships will adhere to the Bill as it stands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00998"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I trust that Lord Courtney will acquit me of any want of courtesy if I do not go again into all the arguments in connection with this question. They have been thoroughly threshed out, and I do not think they need be repeated. But I do desire to make one remark on something which the noble Lord said. He said with truth that this proposal had been made by a member of your Lordships' House&#x2014;that is to say, myself&#x2014;who had no House of Commons experience. I am painfully aware of that, but I would. point out that this proposal has received very warm support from many of your Lordships who have had that experience; and although the noble Lord invoked Lord Peel's testimony in his favour, I think my proposal had the singular good fortune of being supported by Lord Peel, who can speak with greater authority on this subject than any one in the country. My only regret is that we cannot have the opinion of the noble Viscount's successor, the present Speaker of the House of Commons. That it is impossible to have I know, but if the Speaker could have given his opinion it would have been received with the utmost attention.<lb/>
Both Lord Courtney and the noble Viscount opposite proceeded on the assump-
<col>458</col>
tion that we propose to take away from the House of Commons the exclusive right to deal with finance. I know that is the way in which it will be represented in the country, but it is wholly incorrect. Let us come back to what we are really discussing. Is the Speaker to be the sole arbiter as to whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not, or is he to have a Committee joined with him to advise him? That is the sole question we are discussing. Our proposal is not only supported by noble Lords on this side of the House, but I certainly had imagined that there was a considerable section of the Liberal Party who entertained grave doubts as to whether the Speaker should be left with sole power. I therefore hope most earnestly that your Lordships will reject the Amendment and adhere to the Bill as it stands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-00999">On Question, Amendment negatived.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01000"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member> moved an Amendment to omit from subsection (2) the words "but if, in the opinion of the Joint Committee, the governing purpose of a Bill, or of any portion of a Bill, is such as to bring the Bill within the category of general legislation, the Bill, or such portion thereof as aforesaid, shall be subject to the provisions of Section 2 of this Act," and to insert&#x2014;"But if, in the opinion of the Joint Committee, the main governing purpose of a Bill imposing taxation, or of any portion of a Bill imposing taxation, is not purely financial in character, the Bill, or such portion thereof as aforesaid, shall be subject to the provisions of Section 2 of this Act."</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01001">The noble Earl said: It will be within your Lordships' recollection that when subsection (2) of Clause 1 was under consideration the Amendment as it now stands was passed, but on the distinct understanding that some further change would be made when we reached the Report stage. I hope that the Amendment which I now propose will at all events meet one of the objections raised by Lord St. Aldwyn. My noble friend said with perfect truth that the Amendment as originally drafted would enable Money Bills which dealt with loans to be referred to the Joint Committee, and I think he gave as illustrations Naval and Military Works Bills and the Uganda Railway Bill. It was never the intention either of myself
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0234"/>
<col>459</col>
or of those who have been co-operating with me in this measure that these matters should be brought within the cognisance of the Joint Committee. Those are Money Bills properly so called. They have always been in the exclusive province of the House of Commons, and there is no reason why they should not remain so. I hope the change now introduced will meet that objection. Your Lordships will observe that under the proposal now made the matters which are brought to the cognisance of the Joint Committee will be limited to Bills imposing taxation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01002">I pass on to the question of the necessity on occasion of referring Bills which impose taxation to the Joint Committee. Surely a provision of this sort is very necessary. I should like to remind your Lordships that we have to safeguard ourselves against two different forms of tacking. There is, first, the old form of tacking which has been called by noble Lords opposite "extraneous tacking," by which I understand the addition to a Money Bill of some matter which is entirely foreign to the immediate purpose of the Bill. And then there is the other, and as I venture to think much more dangerous, form of tacking, which has been called "moral tacking"&#x2014;that is, the endeavour to accomplish by a side wind in a Money Bill some important political and social change which ought to come in the category of general legislation. In the Resolution which your Lordships' House passed last November the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition safeguarded himself against both of these forms of tacking. That Resolution declared that&#x2014;
<quote>"the Lords are prepared to forego their Constitutional right to reject or amend Money Bills which are purely financial in character,"</quote>
thereby leaving it to be inferred that they were not prepared to forego their rights in regard to Bills which were not purely financial in character. In voting for this Amendment your Lordships will be doing nothing inconsistent with the Resolution passed last November.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01003">Noble Lords opposite virtually recognise that there is a defect in the Bill, and that an abusive use might be made of the powers which it is proposed to confer on the House of Commons. The noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War said, in the course of last week, that a definition
<col>460</col>
of tacking was difficult to give, but that it was clear there were things which came in the category of tacking. Then the noble Viscount said we could get at this by illustration. We can; and a good deal of illustration has been given during the course of this debate. But the noble Viscount went on to say "It is impossible to define tacking." Does not an admission of that sort in itself constitute a very scathing condemnation of bringing in a Bill of this sort at all? It amounts to this, that there is an admission of the evil but the English language is not flexible enough to provide a remedy. Other nations have solved these linguistic difficulties and why should not we? The reason is obvious. It is because under this Bill we are going to live under a hybrid Constitution unknown to any other country in the world. Our Constitution in the future is to be partly written and partly unwritten, and it appears to me that it will possess all the disadvantages and none of the advantages of both systems. All those portions which will give the most absolute and complete liberty to a Government which is daily becoming bureaucratic and a House of Commons which is daily becoming more caucus-ridden are to be written, but those portions which would provide checks on the democracy such as have been elsewhere considered necessary will be unwritten. Surely that can hardly be considered a satisfactory state of affairs. I venture to assert that it is not our business to find a remedy for this evil. Our business is to point out the defect, and if the defect is not denied it is for the authors of this Bill to find some remedy for it. As they cannot do so we must try our best to help them. It is no answer to my argument to say that this Bill will provide a remedy against the old form of tacking&#x2014;that is to say, extraneous tacking. That may or may not be the case; but we now have to deal with a situation which has been created by this Bill. Formerly there was a guarantee against moral tacking. It rested in the power which resided in your Lordships' House, but now that that is to be done away with I say something else ought to be substituted in its place.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01004">It has been stated in the course of this debate that every financial Bill that comes up from the House of Commons embodies some sort of policy. I agree, and I know it is very difficult to draw a distinctive frontier line between those
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0235"/>
<col>461</col>
matters which should be referred and which should not be referred to the Joint Committee. But I say that an attempt should be made to do this, and that the constitution of the Committee affords ample guarantee that the powers entrusted to them will not be abused. In practice they will bring into the category of Money Bills all such Bills as can reasonably be brought into that category, and, moreover, all Bills which according to ancient custom have always been brought into that category. But on the other hand they will have the power, when there is a manifest attempt to evade the Act of Parliament and to bring in some social and political change in the garb of a Money Bill, of allowing your Lordships to have a say in the matter. For these reasons I hope your Lordships will accept the Amendment which I now move.</p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01006"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Marquess reproached me just now, good naturedly enough, with speaking at too great length. I hope I shall not now be charged with being perfunctory if I say only a few words on the Amendment of my noble friend. He will be well aware that it is not from any want of respect for any course that commends itself to him. The only question to-day is how this Amendment which the noble Earl has just moved affects the Amendment inserted in Committee. The only difference that I can discover is that my noble friend's new Amendment is rather wider in language. It remains that if the main governing purpose of a Bill imposing taxation is not purely financial, then it is to be treated not as a Money Bill but as a Bill coming under Clause 2. My noble friend has altered his Amendment in consequence of what was said about loans and so forth by the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, and has confined it to Bills imposing taxation. In that I am sure the noble Earl has taken a wise course, but the difficulty we have in accepting my noble friend's Amendment is one of principle.<lb/>
<col>462</col>
I would ask my noble friend how anybody, how any board or committee, can decide what is the main governing purpose of a Bill. The question must be really one of the motives, intentions, purposes, and principles of those who introduce the measure. How is it in the power of any committee to decide the intentions, purposes, and so forth? If the committee looks at a Bill from a political point of view, they will decide on political grounds. In the Budget of 1909, along with certain financial provisions inserted only for raising revenue, were proposals which had a more general object, and the committee would have had to answer the question whether those social provisions did or did not destroy the financial essence of the Bill. How they could have found that out I am really at a loss to imagine. A non-political committee, an ideal committee such as my noble friend desires, would be bound to decide without material to decide upon except what they found in the Bill itself&#x2014;the internal evidence in the Bill itself. If it had nothing but provisions such as are mentioned in my noble friend's Amendment imposing taxation, they would obviously have to decide that it was a Money Bill. The alteration in the form of the Amendment makes no difference in our view. Has my noble friend considered that it is possible and not at all improbable that this Joint Committee might come to a conclusion that would impinge upon the undoubted money privileges of the House of Commons? That is a very serious contingency and one which might lead to an extremely critical and disagreeable situation. That is only a by-point against my noble friend's proposal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01007"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships will remember the difficulties that this House had to encounter in the years 1908 and 1909. In the year 1908 a more or less stringent Licensing Bill was sent up to this House, and, rightly or wrongly, your Lordships thought it an unjust Bill and threw it out. There was no difficulty in getting at the intention of the framers of that Bill. They went about the country and said that the Licensing Trade had been lashed with whips in 1908, but that in 1909 as regarded the Licensing Bill they would be whipped with scorpions. When the Budget of 1909 was introduced the Licensing Bill was added to it. Your Lordships did not, in the true sense of the word,

throw out that Budget. You threw out the Licensing Bill, which, entirely contrary to every rule of this Muse, had been tacked on to the Budget, and I venture to think that if in those days there had been a Joint Committee such as is now proposed that Committee would have said that the Licensing Bill could not be tacked on to the Budget.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>"If, in the opinion of the Joint Committee, the main governing purpose of a Bill imposing taxation, or of any portion of a Bill imposing taxation, is not purely financial in character &#x2026;"</quote>
If it is purely financial in character, then every member of this House admits that it is within the sphere of the House of Commons and the House of Commons alone. But if it is not purely financial in character, surely it ought to be stopped; or else you have what I understand even noble Lords opposite admit to be an invasion of the just privileges of this House.<lb/>
Lord Courtney, in his first speech, gave us to understand that the decision of the Speaker had always been accepted. That was proved by the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, not to have been the case. Admitting to the full that the other House of Parliament is to be supreme in matters of finance, is it not necessary that there
<col>464</col>
should be some definition of what pure finance means and some authority to decide whether any particular proposal comes fairly within that definition? What can be more fair than this, that if it is not purely financial in character it should come under the general provisions of Clause 2? If I understand rightly the object of the noble Earl, Lord Cromer, in moving this Amendment, it is to go more in the direction of the wishes of the Government than his original words did, and to make it perfectly clear that there is no intention on the part of this House to invade the just privileges of the other House.<lb/>
In the first speech which he made the noble Viscount used words to the effect that if such and such an Amendment were not withdrawn it would make an understanding impossible. I have not had the privilege of being present at all the debates on this important Bill, but I can truly state that I have read every word which has been reported. Those who are outside sometimes get even a more distinct view of what is going on than those who are engaged in the contest. When the noble Viscount says that if we do not do so and so it will make an understanding impossible, I should like to ask the Government whether they think that their conduct of the Bill, their answers to the Amendments and the arguments which have been made on this side, have been such as to encourage us to think that any understanding is possible? If there is one thing distinct to my mind in the whole procedure on this Bill, it has been the absolutely unyielding front on the part of noble Lords opposite; and it does not seem to me to come fairly from them to say that anything which has been said on this side of the House has been with any desire to make an arrangement impossible. Surely, if you are going to have any distinction between Bills which are financial and Bills which are not financial, you could not have a more favourable or reasonable set of expressions than those in this Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01011"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in order that I may account for the value which I attach to this Amendment, perhaps I may be permitted to recall the attention of your Lordships' House to an incident which occurred on June 29, when we were discussing an Amendment from the same source and somewhat similar in terms. My noble friend Lord Midleton, in the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0237"/>
<col>465</col>
course of that discussion, let fall the expression that the pretensions of the House of Commons in regard to privilege had increased, were increasing, and ought to be diminished. For that phrase my noble friend was gravely taken to task by the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, who was, by the way, then not on the Woolsack, but formed part of the trilingual combination of law and literature on the Government Front Bench. He told my noble friend that his remark precisely reflected the attitude which he (Lord Midleton) and his friends desired to persuade your Lordships to take with regard to this Bill, but the noble and learned Lord admitted that this is a Bill intended to increase the privilege and power of the House of Commons. He also said that privilege and finance were synonymous terms, and, further on, that finance was at the root of all government and controlled policy. Well, if finance is at the root of all government and controls policy, and one House alone is to have complete control of finance and all that appertains to it, that is single-Chamber government, and it was single-Chamber government exactly that the first clause of this Bill, as originally drafted, aimed at establishing.<lb/>
But, my Lords, the incident did not close there. After a few remarks from the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition the noble Earl on the Front Opposition Bench, Lord Selborne, pointed out to the Government that as Clause 1 was drafted a financial Bill might contain clauses practically involving the nationalisation of land, of railways, and, consequentially, of all other property and sources of production, and he asked the Government whether it was intended that the Second Chamber should have no control whatever over the House of Commons even if that House endeavoured to confiscate all the property in the country. I cannot say he got no answer, because he elicited the following, phrase, or a phrase to the following effect, from the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War. The noble Viscount said that the object of the Government and the object of the Bill was to stereotype the true sense of finance&#x2014;that was that the House of Commons was to have complete control. Yes, complete control of that finance which his colleague had just told us is "at the root of all government and controls policy."
<col>466</col>
I am afraid that the Amendment of the noble Earl will not extend very far in the direction at which he is aiming, but I certainly hope that the House will adopt and adhere to it, because if the Bill is to pass this Amendment is the only available alternative to absolute and naked single-Chamber government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01012"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think, one word of acknowledgment is due to the noble Earl on the Cross Benches for the pains which he has taken to frame this Amendment in terms approved certainly on this side of the House, and, it seems to me, in terms which might well be accepted even by noble Lords on the other side. He has, to begin with, considerably narrowed the scope of his Amendment. We thought that the noble Viscount who leads the House was under a slight misapprehension on that point. The new version of the Amendment gives it a very much narrower scope than the original version. The clause in the Bill mentions, I think, from fifteen to twenty different subjects, which are all included as subjects to be dealt with by Money Bills My noble friend has taken only one out of that long enumeration. He has taken measures dealing with the imposition of taxation, and the imposition of taxation alone. That is a considerable curtailment of the original scope of the clause.<lb/>
Then, with regard to the noble Earl's formula, his formula seems to be a considerable improvement on the original formula. He still depends upon what he describes as "the main governing purpose" of the Bill. We have repeatedly pointed out that those were the words used by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons, and I desire, at the risk of wearying your Lordships by repetition, to ask the noble Viscount whether he cannot give us this evening some explanation of that speech of the Prime Minister's upon which we rely, and from which we have taken the expression "main governing purpose." Let me remind the House that the Prime Minister spoke of Bills the substantial governing purpose of which was not financial, but some large or social policy, and then he went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"The criterion here is not whether an Amendment made by the House of Lords to a Bill is a technical infringement of the privileges of this House. An Amendment of that kind would not fall within our definition."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0238"/>
<col>467</col>
And he said further&#x2014;
<quote>"The test whether a Bill is a financial Bill or not is whether that is its main governing purpose."</quote>
I think it is quite clear that when the Prime Minister was using those words he was not thinking or talking of tacking in the narrowest sense of the term&#x2014;I mean that kind of tacking which consists in the addition to a Money Bill of provisions extraneous and not incidental to its financial purposes. Here are the two kinds of tacking described by the Prime Minister with utmost clearness. I want some noble Lord opposite to tell us what the Prime Minister meant by that distinction, or whether we are to understand that the Prime Minister did not really mean what he said; and if he did mean what he said, why the Amendment moved by my noble friend on the Cross Benches is considered as not giving effect to the Prime Minister's words.<lb/>
Then my noble friend in his new version says that if the main governing purpose of a Bill imposing taxation is not purely financial in character, the Bill may become, or the part of the Bill may become, a Clause 2 Bill. I am glad my noble friend has used the words "not purely financial in character," because your Lordships may remember that those were the words contained in the Resolution which your Lordships carried in the year 1910, and that Resolution was, I venture to think, so drawn as to make it clear that just as the Prime Minister had in his mind the two kinds of tacking of which I have spoken, so we had in our minds the two kinds of tacking covered by the Amendment of my noble friend, and desired to deal with them both.<lb/>
The noble Viscount dwelt, not for the first time, upon the insuperable difficulty of the task which we were going to impose upon this Joint Committee when we asked them to decide what is and what is not the main governing purpose of a Bill. He said, What can the Committee do? They have nothing before them but the Bill. They will have to limit their attention to the Bill itself and decide by internal evidence only whether it is a Money Bill or not. I am not at all sure that I should admit that the business of the Joint Committee would necessarily begin and end with the consideration of that which was contained within the four corners of a
<col>468</col>
Bill submitted to them. Let the House remember that we are setting up, not a Court of law, but a tribunal intended to deal in a Parliamentary spirit with these questions, and surely it would be competent for a tribunal of that kind to consider not only the actual text of the Bill, but the facts and the circumstances which surrounded its introduction.<lb/>
We attach very great importance to this Amendment, and I agree with what was said a moment ago by Lord Ebury. In our view this Amendment is a vital one. The danger which we desire to safeguard against is this, that if you have&#x2014;I will not use a stronger word&#x2014;a very enterprising Minister, assisted by an ingenious draftsman, it could be comparatively easy, without some safeguard of this kind, to draft a Bill which clearly came within the Prime Minister's definition, a Bill having the most far-reaching political and social consequences, and which vet, owing to the manner in which it had been drafted, would come within the comparatively strict terms of the Bill, and be taken away from the consideration of your Lordships' House. If the Bill, therefore, were to stand as framed by His Majesty's Government, this House would find itself at once warned off the whole vast field of legislation into which financial elements enter. Some of your Lordships will be better able to judge, but I believe that if we were excluded from that field we should be excluded from by far the greater part of the whole field of legislation, because in these day there is scarcely an important Bill which does not contain financial provisions of one kind or another. If that be done, it will then come to this, that we shall only have the very slender opportunities which we are allowed in regard to general legislation under the second clause, and we shall only be allowed to exercise those functions within a comparatively small fraction of the total field of legislation. That is for us a very serious matter, and as I said at first I think we owe a debt of gratitude to my noble friend for giving it so much attention.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01013"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: If I understood rightly, the noble Viscount said that this Joint Committee might come to some decision which might impinge on the privileges of the House of Commons.

<col>469</col>
the fifth clause of this Bill contains these words&#x2014;

I quite admit that, in spite of that clause, the Committee might come to a decision which would dissatisfy one or other Party in the House of Commons, but the noble Viscount must remember that the same might be said about anybody who goes to law. As a general rule either the plaintiff or the defendant is dissatisfied with the judgment, but really that is no argument against this proposal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01014"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess opposite made again the point about the two kinds of tacking. There is in your Lordship? Standing Orders, as a result of the Resolutions of the House, a fairly clear definition of what we have up to now understood by tacking. I agree, however, that there may be something outside that over which it is well that, there should be sufficient control to bring a case under Clause 2, and it was of that the Prime Minister was speaking when he used the words which the noble Marquess quoted. But it is plain that while it is right that under the guise of a Money Bill you should not set up something which is really quite different from a Money Bill, it is equally true that there is another difficulty which it is important to avoid, and that is hampering yourselves with regard to your Money Bills&#x2014;it may be the Budget Bill of the year&#x2014;by excluding from them important questions of policy. It may be that you want money, the governing reason being that you wish to build more ships. That is for the Executive of the day. It may also be that there is some clear part of the policy of the Executive which requires money to be raised for special purposes, or which requires that taxation should be imposed in a certain form in order to be fair.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01015"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: Naval Loans are expressly excluded.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01016"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I am not talking of Naval Loans. I am speaking of raising money for building ships. You might think of putting a penny on the Income Tax in order to build more ships, and that might be in the Budget Bill of the year.
<col>470</col>
Although the new words of my noble friend are better in some respects than the old words, yet to say that a Bill imposing taxation, or any portion of a Bill imposing taxation, the main governing purpose of which is not purely financial in character, is to come under Clause 2 might be construed to apply to the Budget Bill of the year, with the result that the finances of the year might be imperilled. We are of opinion that you should hold by broad and simple principles in these matters, and that the tacking referred to should be the tacking which has always been understood by tacking. It is impossible to give abstract definitions which will cover all the intermediate ground, and our view is that the broad principle that the raising of the money which the Executive Government requires should be left to the House of Commons ought to prevail, notwithstanding that it is impossible to say that very important questions of policy will not arise as regard the shape which it assumes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01017"><member>THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to refer at any length to the speech which has just been delivered by the noble Viscount opposite, but of all the instances be has given in the course of this debate I cannot think of a more unfortunate one than the one he gave just now as to Navy Estimates. The noble Viscount knows perfectly well that if money is wanted it is raised by the Budget, and if ships are to be built the money is provided for in the Estimates. I have never known of a ship being mentioned in connection with the Budget, and an instance more totally irrelevant than that put forward by the noble Viscount I cannot imagine.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01018"><member>LORD CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the point I wish to allude to is a different one from that of the noble Duke. Although the noble Viscount favoured us with a cloud of words lie really gave no answer to the question put by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition. He said that it was impossible to give a definition. The whole point of this Amendment is that the Prime Minister did give a definition, and the noble Earl, Lord Cromer, has practically taken the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of that definition and included it in the Amendment which he has put before the House. The Prime Minister's words have been quoted over

and over again, and I must apologise for quoting them once more. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"We are dealing here with Bills which are Finance Bills, and the test whether a Bill is a financial Bill or not is whether that is its main governing purpose."</quote>
Those are the precise words the noble Earl has put into his Amendment. Might I remind your Lordships that in the same speech at a later stage the Prime Minister used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"It may be a perfectly proper thing to tack what I may call political on to financial propositions, but a Bill of that character ought not to come under the exceptional machinery of this clause."</quote>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01030">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I was unavoidably prevented from moving this Amendment in Committee, and therefore I have brought it forward on the present occasion. Its object is simple. It is to ensure that after the passing of the Parliament Bill any Amendments inserted by your Lordships in subsequent Bills shall
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0241"/>
<col>473</col>
be fully considered by the House of Commons. Before dealing with the merits of the Amendment itself, I should like to take a point that perhaps will be raised by the noble Viscount the Leader of the House&#x2014;namely, that this is an attempt to interfere with the procedure of the House of Commons. I should like to call your Lordships' attention with regard to that to the last subsection of Clause 2 of this Bill, which says&#x2014;
<quote>"Provided that the House of Commons may, if they think fit, on the passage of such a Bill through the House In the second or third session, suggest any further amendments without inserting the amendments in the Bill, and any such suggested amendments shall be considered by the House of Lords."</quote>
The House of Commons, if they think fit, may direct your Lordships to consider certain Amendments, and your Lordships will then have to proceed to do so whether you wish it or not. If His Majesty's Government think that for the smooth wording of this Bill it is necessary that a clause of that kind should be inserted, it is not, I think, unfair to argue that it may help to make it smoother still if an Amendment such as I propose is inserted with the object of ensuring that Amendments which have been passed by your Lordships shall be considered in the House of Commons.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01031">I would recall to your Lordships what happened in the year 1906 with regard to the Education Bill. I suppose there never was a Bill more thoroughly considered with the object of securing a reasonable compromise than was that Bill. Every sentence was discussed, every clause carefully considered; day after day we sat here, and time after time we tramped through the Lobbies in favour of Amendments to improve the Bill. Yet when at last the Bill was returned to the House of Commons what happened? On the motion of the Minister in charge, the whole of the Amendments of your Lordships were disagreed to without any discussion and without any opportunity being given to the House of Commons to consider whether some of those Amendments in themselves might not have tended to improve the Bill. I cannot say that I blame the Government for having done that, because for tactical reasons it may have been a very good thing to do. His Majesty's Government at that time were not only engaged in passing measures but
<col>474</col>
were trying to pick a quarrel with this House&#x2014;as one of His Majesty's Ministers picturesquely and pithily expressed it, "to catch the rats in a trap." But circumstances have now changed; the rats have been caught in a trap, and we have the Bill before us showing what His Majesty's Government think should be the relations between the two Houses of Parliament. This Bill proposes that, for the time being at any rate, this House should be given power as a revising and advising Chamber. I venture to submit, therefore, that it is desirable that the advice which your Lordships give and the revision which you make of Bills should be considered, not by an arbitrary Minister of the Crown, but by the representatives of the people in the other House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01032">I appeal to the noble Viscount to give his careful consideration to this point. I am not particular about the exact words. I provide that every Amendment shall be considered, but it is more the spirit of the thing than the exact wording that I care about. I am anxious, if possible, that these matters should be fully considered, that the fact that this House is an advisory one should be recognised, and that when measures are returned with Amendments to the House of Commons they should not be treated with the contumely to which I have referred, and with which, if rumour speaks truly, the present Amendments of your Lordships are to be treated when this Bill is returned to another place. I hope the noble Viscount will recognise that this is not a root and branch Amendment that I am suggesting, but only a means of improving the procedure of carrying out the Bill.</p>

It is, of course, desirable that any deliberative legislative body should consider carefully, considerately, and respectfully any proposition that is brought before it from another body, of similar authority. But let me put a practical point to the noble Lord. Is it conceivable that this House
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0242"/>
<col>475</col>
is to pass a Statute telling the House of Commons how to manage its business? And with regard to serious consideration, is it certain that the consideration would be more serious and more deliberate if every Amendment was taken separately and. severally? I am not at all sure of that. But, apart from that, the objection to it is this, and I am sure every member of this House will appreciate it. We talked earlier this afternoon of proposals likely to irritate the House of Commons, and if this attitude were seriously taken by your Lordships' House&#x2014;that the House of Commons are to be told by Statute how they are to manage their proceedings&#x2014;I cannot conceive anything which would be more likely to give the House of Commons an excuse for irritation.

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01039">The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this Amendment I do not propose to detain the House more than a few minutes, because I have already explained the provisions of it at an earlier stage. Briefly stated, the position is as follows. If this Bill becomes law it is the general if not the universal opinion of everybody sitting upon this side of the House that your Lordships' House will be reduced to something little better than a debating society, and will be left with only one asset of any value at all&#x2014;namely, the power of delay&#x2014;but under the Bill as drafted by the Government there is no guarantee whatever that this safeguard will remain. Personally I am quite prepared to admit that I do not entertain any distrust of the three noble Lords opposite who are acting, if I may say so, in the capacity of a political Cerberus in guarding their Bill. These noble Lords, I am inclined to think, are discharging their duty without very much enthusiasm, and I feel perfectly certain in my own mind that they have not the smallest desire either to humiliate this House or to take any unfair advantage of this Bill supposing it becomes law. But on the other hand, it would be perfectly absurd and ludicrous to ignore the fact that there are in the House of Commons a number of gentlemen who openly proclaim themselves to be single-Chamber men, and if there is one prediction that can be made with any approach to certainty with regard to this Bill it is that if we put into force the statutory powers of delay which we are accorded under the Bill a demand, possibly an irresistible demand, will be at once made from quarters well known to noble Lords opposite for the abolition of this power of delay; and I submit, as I submitted the other day that this House has a clear right, supposing this Bill becomes law, to be protected against any action of that kind by interposing a General Election in

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01040">The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition made the remark the other day when I moved this Amendment that it was perfectly intolerable that any advantage should be taken of this Bill for the purpose of altering the machinery of the Bill itself, and my Amendment, not exactly in identical terms, was received by Lord Morley in a comparatively sympathetic spirit&#x2014;I might almost say in a markedly sympathetic spirit compared with the spirit in which he received other Amendments. The noble Viscount evidently found extreme difficulty in resisting it at all, and he committed himself to the view that it was not unjustified, and that it did? not contradict the fundamental principle of the Bill. Altogether the noble Viscount was so sympathetic and encouraging that my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition thereupon invited me to bring forward the Amendment on the Report stage, an invitation to which I have responded. Now, my Lords, whilst I am desirous personally of acknowledging the friendly and sympathetic spirit of the noble Viscount opposite, I do not entertain any very sanguine hopes that he is going to accept even this Amendment, because it appears to me that he, in common with the other two noble Lords who are in charge of this Bill, is bound by some mysterious punctilio to resist every Amendment that is proposed, whether it is important or unimportant or reasonable or unreasonable. At the same time, in spite of this unyielding front I have endeavoured to meet the objections of the noble Viscount to the best of my ability by altering the phraseology of my Amendment and endeavouring to make the object clear. My object, I repeat, is confined solely to endeavouring to secure the safeguard to which I have already alluded.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01041">The Amendment as it stands represents a desire upon my part that at all events the following should be secured to us&#x2014;namely, that with regard to rejections the period of three sessions shall not be interfered with, that the interval of two years shall equally not be interfered with, and that the duration of Parliament shall also not be interfered with, so that there shall be no opportunity of dealing with us in the way in which I have indicated unless a General Election has taken place
<col>478</col>
in the meanwhile. I do not know whether I have succeeded in my purpose. I always feel considerable doubt with regard to matters of this kind, and I am rather inclined to predict that with the ingenuity which characterises the old Parliamentary hand the noble Viscount opposite will not have very much difficulty in finding some word or words which will render it impossible to accept the Amendment. That at all events I am prepared for, but I do not altogether abandon a lingering hope that the noble Viscount will accept the principle of the Amendment, as to which I propose to say nothing more.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01042">Before I conclude I would like to take this opportunity of dispelling some remarkable delusions which have arisen since this Amendment appeared on the Paper, and which have invested it with possibly greater importance than it deserves. Some lynx-eyed and imaginative critics have discovered in this Amendment a sort of corrupt bargain between the two Front Benches for the purpose of mutually selling the pass. In times past I have myself ventured to accuse the Front Benches of acting in collusion, but so far as I know there is not on the present occasion any justification for any suggestion of the kind, and as far as I am concerned the occupants of the two Front Benches may leave the Amendment without a stain upon their characters. There is also another point I desire to make clear. This Amendment, although it was suggested to me by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, is an Amendment for which the Front Bench is not responsible. I put it down entirely upon my own responsibility.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01043"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I did not suggest it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01044"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: The only thing the noble Marquess had to do with it was to advise me in this House to bring it up again on Report. I do not know whether it is necessary for me to make the assertion, but in case any noble Lords on this side feel any doubt on the point I should like to assure them that I am not in the confidence of the Government, however strange it may appear to them. I wish that I was. I should like also to point out that though, as we all know, everybody who puts down an Amendment is usually enamoured of it almost to the point of infatuation, I have never felt so
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0244"/>
<col>479</col>
enamoured of this particular Amendment as to imagine that it constituted a key which would unlock the Constitutional difficulty, either by means of affording an adequate substitute for the Amendment of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition or even as suggesting a form of what is called compromise. A compromise is an arrangement under which both sides agree to give up something. But in this particular case there is no compromise suggested. All I ask for is that if the Government get their way upon a particular point they shall not utilise that fact for the purpose of getting something which they are not asking for at the present moment.<lb/>
In conclusion I may say that I only move this Amendment because it seems to me to be a perfectly just and fair and reasonable one, as was indeed admitted by the noble Viscount. It appears to me that it is one which the Government might assent to without loss of dignity and without the least inconsistency; and although I believe there are a number of noble Lords who, for some reason which is not plain to me, entertain a suspicion that if this Amendment were assented to it might tell to our disadvantage, I still hold to the opinion that it would be extremely valuable to us, and for that reason I respectfully commend it to the consideration of the House.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01046"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, if he will allow me to say so, seems to me to have made a very sensible speech. He talked, however, in a passing sentence about this House being reduced to little better than a mere debating Chamber. I would remind him, and perhaps console him by pointing
<col>480</col>
out that this House is only a debating Chamber now over most of the area of Government and foreign policy. It is quite true to say that it is only a debating Chamber now over the great area of public policy, as it will be when this Bill becomes law. The noble Lord spent not too much time in clearing his own character, if it needed it, of anything in the nature of subterranean compromise or compact with the Party on these Benches. I most emphatically and sincerely confirm that statement so far as I am acquainted with the facts. It is a great weakness in political reform to be always seeking for some sinister motive and some underground machination in the conduct of others. The noble Lord put an Amendment on the Paper last week when we were in Committee. I considered it, and, as he has truly said, I used not unfriendly, but rather sympathetic language about it. The noble Marquess who spoke after me was, I think, equally sympathetic, and certainly not more unfriendly than I was to the Amendment, and he recommended the noble Lord to endeavour, if he could, to meet, at the Report stage, the objections which I had raised to his proposal. I thought then that the noble Lord would find it impossible, in view of the Amendment of the noble Marquess, which was carried by so enormous a majority the other night, so to remodel his own Amendment as to make it possible for us to accept it. Therefore I was not suprised, when the Amendment appeared for the Report stage, to find that it was not one&#x2014;and I was sorry for it&#x2014;that the Government could accept. If he will allow me to say so, it would have been far better if the noble Lord, instead of putting in general words like "further limitation" and so forth, had abrogated the use of the Parliament Bill itself to alter its own provisions and had said that the Parliament Bill must not be altered in those particulars to which the House takes objection&#x2014;that the provision about the three Sessions or about the two years must not be altered; and he might, if he had thought fit, have said that the provision limiting the duration of Parliament to five years must not be altered. Those are the three great operative points in the Bill, and if the Bill is regarded as something in the nature of a compact between the House of Lords and the House of Commons, I can imagine something being said for a provision to prevent the machinery of the Act being used to alter
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0245"/>
<col>481</col>
the contents and provisions of the Act. But that is not the way the Amendment now stands. It is improved in this respect, that it is not so vague as the Amendment in Committee was, but it unquestionably and to my surprise carries with it subsection (<i>c</i>) of the noble Marquess's Amendment. I am surprised that the noble Lord should introduce that element, because your Lordships will remember that when the Bill of Lord Balfour of Burleigh was before the House the noble Lord, in characteristically straightforward and vehement language, as did the noble Earl, Lord Ancaster, entirely repudiated it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01047"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: Not with regard to disputes between the two Houses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01048"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I have the noble Lord's speech here, but I will not go into it. That was the impression he left upon my mind at the time, and I think his words confirm it. But be that as it may, the introduction of subsection (<i>c</i>)&#x2014;that is the reference to the Joint Committe of the question whether a Bill is of great gravity and so forth&#x2014;is a proposal which we cannot in any shape or form, directly or indirectly, entertain. There is another curious point in the noble Lord's Amendment. He leaves to the House of Lord's when they have rejected a Bill three times, the choice of a Referendum through the Joint Committee or a General Election. I submit to anybody acquainted with legislation or policy that the House of Commons could not accept a proposal which left this House the opportunity of pleasing themselves whether upon a given occasion they would insist on holding a Bill up until there had been a General Election, or whether they would proceed by way of a Referendum. That is an obvious defect in any proposal of this kind.<lb/>
There is another point that I ventured to raise in Committee. Let us suppose that a Bill is rejected by this House three times and passed three times by the other House, and that that Bill bad very speedily followed a General Election. Is it to be taken, as this Amendment would allow, that a Bill of that kind should be hung up until there had been another General Election or until there had been a Referendum, which I have always contended is tantamount to a General Election? Is that a rational proposal to put before a deliberative
<col>482</col>
body? I do not think it is. I pointed that out to the noble Lord on a previous occasion. I think it is an unanswerable difficulty, and I am sorry that he has not even attempted to deal with it. One other point about not altering the present Parliament Bill when it becomes an Act. I hinted at this on the previous occasion, and I return to it. Suppose there was a Lords Reform Bill on the Table, and suppose that that Bill contained a proviso for Joint Sessions, which is a conceivable thing. That Bill might come within the definition in the noble Lord's Amendment of a Bill further limiting the powers of this House. The Lords Reform Bill, for example, might provide that, instead of giving the House of Lords three chances of rejection, a Bill might become law by a majority vote in the Joint Session. In that case it might become law after one rejection, and both Parties might agree that it, was desirable that such a Bill should pass. But it would be necessary, in order that it; should go through, to alter the proviso which the noble Lord would have us introduce and enact. That is only one illustration. I could give more, but I have put the point, and I believe it is one which is thoroughly worthy of the consideration of those who are enamoured of this Amendment, and who may be angry with us because of that "mysterious punctilio" which the noble Lord referred to which makes us reject all Amendments. It is not punctilio and it is not mysterious&#x2014;but still, there it is.<lb/>
There is one other point in connection with this Amendment that I would like to make. It concerns what we have heard so much of to-night&#x2014;tacking in connection with Money Bills. I could imagine such a thing as tacking an Amendment to this Bill. It is rather an abstruse sort of point, but I would like, if the House will allow me, to put it on record, and I commend it to the noble Lord for his consideration if he goes forward with his project. Will the noble Lord find answers to the following two questions. Do you intend that this should apply to a Bill which only incidentally alters the provisions of this Act, as, for example, in the case of the Lords Reform Bill, to which I have just referred, which made provision for Joint Sessions and so forth? Is that what the noble Lord and those who sympathise with him intend, or do you only intend your Amendment to apply to a deliberate alteration of the Bill
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0246"/>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01050"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: It is not an easy point to put in a sentence or two, but it is a very important point which will be heard of later. In deliberating on all proposals of this kind, you have to consider whether you mean that you will not allow any of the provisions of the Parliament Bill to be meddled with, or whether you mean to limit your proposal only to cases where the cardinal and deliberate intention is to further limit the powers of this House. If the noble Lord proceeds with his Amendment I would commend that for his consideration. I have seen it observed, but it is entirely a delusion to suppose that the Bill will be immune from Conservative attack. It is quite obvious to everybody that if there be a case of Conservative attack, the Conservatives being in a majority in the House of Commons or being in control of Ministerial power, all that they have to do, if they want to amend or alter this Act&#x2014;it is the simplest thing in the world&#x2014;is to pass an ordinary Act of Parliament, without any reference whatever to the machinery of this Bill. I have kept you rather too long. I wish that I had been able to go further than I have done, but as it stands this Amendment is wholly inadmissible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01051"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: With the indulgence of the House perhaps I may explain that my sole object in moving this Amendment was to provide against this Bill being utilised for the purpose of cutting down the period of delay which is accorded to us under the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01052"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether I ought not to say one word, perhaps, in the guise of a witness to character. I desire to support what was said by Lord Newton towards the close of his speech when he told the House that the Amendment which he had moved was one for which the Front. Bench on this side had no responsibility. I understand that it had been suggested that there was some kind of conspiracy between my noble friend and myself. All I can say is that if I wanted what, I believe, is commonly called a "bonnet," I do not think I should have employed
<col>484</col>
my noble friend in that capacity. He seems to be made of stuff out of which "bonnets" are not usually manufactured. The Amendment of my noble friend really has no connection whatever, unless it be incidentally, with the Amendment which your Lordships accepted at my suggestion, and the idea of setting my noble friend's Amendment against mine was obviously an absurd idea. The fact is that my noble friend's Amendment was intended to prevent this Bill from being altered. My Amendment, on the contrary, was intended to alter the Bill very considerably. If we regarded this Bill as anything in the nature of a final compact, to use the noble Viscount's expression, it might be a very attractive thing to some of us to frame it in such a way as to prevent any alteration of the restrictions which are placed under the Bill upon your Lordships' House. But, as we have said again and again, we do not regard this Bill as anything in the nature of a final settlement; we look upon it only as a provisional measure intended to cover an interval which we are assured is to be a short one. I ask myself how my noble friend's Amendment would operate in that interval. Now I confess I do not think that the particular danger which he desires to guard against is one of which we need be, after all, so very apprehensive, because I cannot bring myself to conceive that within the next three years we shall find noble Lords opposite desiring to disturb that part of the Bill which deals with the privileges and opportunities which are to be left to your Lordships' House. Apart from this, if it were indeed the case that His Majesty's Government did desire to pass during the next two or three years any particularly subversive measure without touching the present Bill they would have ample time to do so, because, after all, the life of this Parliament will, I presume, endure until the end of the year 1915, and within that time they will have ample opportunities of passing their measures, if this Bill become law, without any further encroachment upon the rights, slender as they are, which this Bill preserves to your Lordships' House.<lb/>
The noble Viscount, I must say, raised several points in regard to the operation of the Amendment which seemed to me rather difficult to answer. I do not know whether my noble friend is prepared to answer them, but I confess that I am not,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0247"/>
<col>485</col>
at any rate at this moment. But the argument of the noble Viscount throughout was based upon one very important reservation&#x2014;a reservation which I think my noble friend must regard as greatly affecting his position with reference to the Amendment. What we understood the noble Viscount to say was that if my noble friend's Amendment had been one forbidding any alteration in the restriction placed upon the powers of your Lordships' House it would be differently regarded by His Majesty's Government from the present Amendment, because the present Amendment deals only with the question of the tightening of the restrictions to which we are to be subject. I think that was the noble Viscount's suggestion&#x2014;that if it had been a case not merely of tightening but also of relaxation of the restrictions, His Majesty's Government would have regarded the proposal in a somewhat different light.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01053"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: May I point out that it was a preliminary condition that it was confined to three points&#x2014;namely, the three sessions, the two years, and the duration of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01054"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble Viscount suggested, in regard to those three points, that if my noble friend's Amendment were so framed as to prevent any change in the Bill whether in the direction of tightening or relaxing the restrict ions which it imposes he would regard it in a different light. I am glad I did not misapprehend the noble Viscount. That alters the whole case, because I feel sure that what my noble friend desired was to prevent the limitations on this House being made stricter still. But supposing we find ourselves in power with what I suppose would be called a mandate from the people of this country, and supposing we desire to relax some of the restrictions upon your Lordships' House, then under the noble Viscount's proposal we should not be able to do so until after a second General Election. I do not think that would suit our book at all. It would place us in what the noble Viscount himself described the other evening as an absurd position. He will remember the speech, and I will not quote it to your Lordships. I rather hope, in these circumstances, that my noble friend will think twice before he presses his Amendment. Our desire is that our
<col>486</col>
Amendments to this Bill should be few in number, and that they should be of a kind which will really make the Bill less dangerous as we conceive it to the liberties of this House. I am reluctant to add another Amendment, that moved by my noble friend, particularly as I am not altogether convinced that it is one which would greatly improve our position under the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01055"><member>LORD MARCHAMLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Marquess says that he does not intend to support the Amendment moved from the Back Benches opposite, but if it goes to a Division I shall myself support it. So far as I can at present judge, I do not see any connection between the Amendment of the noble Lord opposite and the Amendment of the noble Marquess already incorporated in the Bill, except the words "referred to the Joint Committee." It seems to me that the purport and scope of this Amendment are entirely different from those of the Amendment of the noble Marquess. The noble Lord says that this Bill, establishes certain relations and working arrangements between the two Houses of Parliament, that noble Lords on his side of the House have a right to the complete establishment of those relations, that if they are willing to accept the Bill there ought to be some guarantee of finality in the matter, and that the provisions of the Bill itself ought not to be used in order to further curtail and clip the powers of this House as formulated in the Bill. If that be his view, I am entirely in accord with him. I think noble Lords on that side of the House have a right to claim, if the Bill becomes law, that it should not be used for further limiting the powers of this House and increasing those of the House of Commons. The Bill itself I think is a fair and proper one, but I do not think it ought to go further. I am of opinion that we on this side and noble Lords on the other side of the House should have some guarantee that the provisions of this Bill will not be used to further curtail your Lordships' powers unless the people at a General Election have given their assent to that curtailment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01056"><member>THE EARL OF ANCASTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I moved in Committee an Amendment very much of the same kind as that of my noble friend. The effect of that Amendment would have been to make it impossible to cut down the period of two
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0248"/>
<col>487</col>
years and the number of times a Bill had to pass the House of Commons. I rather gathered from the speech of the noble Viscount in Committee that if Lord Newton had moved an Amendment with the mere intention of stating that the suspensory period of two years should not be cut down he thought the Government would very likely have accepted it. They accepted an Amendment moved by another noble Lord to prevent the cutting down of the period of five years as the duration of Parliament, and it seems to me that the two things go together and have, as the noble Lord opposite said, very little to do with the Amendment of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition. It appears to me that this Amendment is a very important one. It only gives effect to the declaration of the Government that by this Parliament Bill there is to be a period of delay, and personally I can see no reason given by the noble Viscount for not embodying the Amendment in the Bill. I do not know whether it would be possible to move an Amendment to Lord Newton's Amendment, but it seems to me it would meet the case if the Amendment were to read as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"And provided also that if the Bill rejected by the House of Lords be a Bill to impose any further limitation on the powers of that House in relation to the rejection of Bills sent up to it by the House of Commons, such Bill shall not be subject to the provisions of this Act."</quote>

I do not see, therefore, how that is to fit in with this intervention of a requisition by 150 members of the House of Commons. It requires further drafting, and in the face of the opposition of the Government I do not think my noble friend can persist in it. Whether his proposition is a right one or not is a different question. As I understand, he wants a minority of the House of Commons to have power to bring Lord Lansdowne's Amendment into operation. My noble friend's object in his Amendment was to solve the question of deadlocks between the two Houses of Parliament.

The noble Viscount opposite, as your Lordships may remember, said in reply on that occasion that the Government preferred to have one formula applying both to what I may call the old form of Acts of Parliament&#x2014;namely, Acts passed by the two Houses&#x2014;and this new form of Act passed by the authority of one House only. The noble Viscount rather doubted whether I knew the difficulties of framing such an Amendment, and he said that the matter had been under the consideration of the Government for a long time and that they wished to consider the matter further. On that understanding I withdrew the Amendment, and I rather hoped that they would be successful in finding a formula such as they desired. I must admit that I was fully aware of the difficulty, and I believe it to be quite impossible to frame one formula which would correctly describe an Act of Parliament passed by the authority of one House and an Act of Parliament passed by the two Houses. But, of course, that was a matter for the Government. The Government have not put down any Amendment for this purpose, and therefore I suppose I may presume that they have found that the matter requires still further consideration. How much further consideration will it require? That is the question. This matter has been in their minds now for several months, and specially in their minds during the last week, and I think we should have been given some intimation when we are likely
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0250"/>
<col>491</col>
to obtain a result. In the absence of any step by the Government, I am afraid I must proceed with my Amendment as originally framed. If this formula is to be effective it must be enacted in this Bill, otherwise there will be only the old formula which says that Bills are enacted by and with the consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons. For your Lordships' protection, therefore, I put this forward in the mere cause of justice. It has nothing to do with the Bill itself; it merely provides that the Bill shall contain a formula which correctly describes the action of this House, with regard to Bills passed under it. I do not think that I need argue the question further to-day, seeing that I placed the case so fully before you on the last occasion.</p>

<title>PROTECTION OF ANIMALS BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01105" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01106">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01107"><member>LORD SAYE AND SELE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I need not weary your Lordships with a long speech in moving the Second Reading of this Bill. It is for the most part a consolidating Bill to obviate difficulties which have been experienced in administering the various Acts for the protection of animals from cruelty. The Bill has arrived from another place having met with practically no opposition there. The new provisions in the Bill which are not contained in previous Acts are as follows. The maximum penalty for cruelty is increased from &#x00A3;5 to &#x00A3;25, and the maximum imprisonment from three months to six months; power is given to a Court to order the destruction in certain circumstances of unfit animals; uniform conditions are laid down for the conduct of knacker's yards; provision is made that spring traps are to be visited at stated intervals; and there is an extension of the powers of the Board of Agriculture with respect to the making of Orders. That practically represents all the amendments that are introduced in this Bill save a few of a drafting and consequential nature. The Bill has, I understand, the full approval of the Board of Agriculture, and I may mention that it does not touch in any way either upon vivisection or upon sport. I beg to move the Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01108">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Saye and Sele</i>).</p>
<col>496</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01109"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has introduced a Bill containing eighteen clauses and occupying eleven pages, and he appears to think that it is a matter almost unworthy of any explanation at all. I venture to submit that the observations of the noble Lord are entirely inadequate. Personally I have not had any opportunity of considering the Bill. The noble Lord tells us that it is an amending Bill only, and that it has the approval of the Board of Agriculture. I do not see the noble Earl who represents the Board of Agriculture in his place. Unless the noble Lord is prepared to give some further explanation of this Bill, I propose to move that the debate be adjourned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01110"><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I ought to say one word on behalf of the Home Office with regard to this Bill. As the noble Lord who moved the Second Reading has stated, it is practically a consolidating Bill, with the exception of the provisions which he mentioned; and as such, of course, it will obviously be of great benefit, for it will be the means of consolidating in one Act nine, I think, existing minor Acts. The Home Office are in entire sympathy with the objects of the Bill, although, of course, they are not responsible for the drafting. At the same time in another place before the Committee stage the Home Office had some criticisms to make on certain of the new provisions in the Bill, principally those relating to arrest, and all their criticisms were met by Amendments which were made by the promoters of the Bill. I hope, therefore, that your Lordships will see your way to give a Second Reading to this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01111"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps the noble Lord will give us some explanation of the Bill. We have not had any from the noble Lord who moved the Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01112"><member>LORD SAYE AND SELE</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Lord will say what explanation he wants, I will endeavour to give it. I have stated what the amendments in the law are which the Bill proposes. As to the rest of its provisions, they simply consolidate other Acts and make the law simple. I do not know what further information the noble Lord wants.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0253"/>
<col>497</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01113"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I have no doubt the House will be in sympathy with the objects of this Bill, which are of a kind that commend themselves to all humanely-minded people; but I think the noble Lord who introduced it is hardly justified in presenting it to the House as a consolidation measure and nothing more, because by his own admission at several points it tightens up the law considerably. The scope of the Bill is immense. It deals with a great number of multifarious subjects. It touches the much vexed question of vivisection and the equally vexed question of stag-hunting. Then there are provisions for the regulation of knacker's yards, and with reference to the use of poisonous substances for destroying vermin&#x2014;a matter which has given rise. I believe, to considerable attention in Ireland. There are also provisions preventing the use of dogs for the purposes of draught, provisions relating to the inspection of traps, and a whole host of other intricate provisions of one kind or another.<lb/>
May I be allowed to express the hope that attention will be paid to the drafting of the Bill? It contains one or two most extraordinary provisions to which I should like to call attention for a moment. If your Lordships will look at the last subsection of Clause 10&#x2014;the clause dealing with injured animals&#x2014;you will see that the expression "animal" therein is to mean "any horse, mule, ass, bull, sheep, goat, or pig." But if you look a little further on you will find a fresh definition in Clause 14. This fresh definition says that the expression "animal" means "any domestic or captive animal." One would have thought that that was sufficient to cover the ground. But then comes a further paragraph explaining again that the expression "domestic animal" means "any horse, ass, mule, bull, sheep, pig, goat," and so on; and further on in the same clause one comes upon this extraordinary statement&#x2014;that the expression "bull" includes "any cow, bullock, heifer, calf, steer, or ox." One is quite prepared to find that the word "horse" is to include any mare or gelding, or that the word "sheep" is to include lamb, or that the word "goat" includes a kid, or that the word "dog" includes the female of the species; one might even tolerate the statement that the word "fowl" includes peacocks, swans, and pigeons; but when
<col>498</col>
you come to the climax, that the word "bull" is to include a cow, calf, or bullock, that seems to me to be definition run mad. But that is, after all, perhaps rather a trivial matter. I would like the noble Lord to tell us something if he can to-night about Clause 11, which deals with the powers of constables. Clause 11 apparently gives very wide powers to constables. and I rather think from what the noble Lord said that that is not mere consolidation but something new. Am I right?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01114"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: He does not know.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01115"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The clause as it stands says that&#x2014;
<quote>"A police constable may apprehend without warrant any person who he has reason to believe is guilty of an offence under this Act which is punishable by imprisonment without the option of a fine."</quote>
and a constable may do this&#x2014;
<quote>"upon his own view thereof or upon the complaint and information of any other person."</quote>
Will the noble Lord tell us what is meant by the expression, "any offence under this Act which is punishable by imprisonment without the option of a fine"? for I find throughout the Bill that the punishment awarded is almost invariably a fine. It is only in the clause dealing with cruelty to injured animals that in certain. cases a person convicted is liable to a fine not exceeding &#x00A3;25&#x2014;that we understand is new, the fine having been increased from &#x00A3;5 to &#x00A3;25&#x2014;or alternatively or in addition thereto to be imprisoned with or without hard labour for any term not exceeding six months. What we should like to know is whether these very extensive powers given to constables under Clause 11 are powers which can be exercised against any person who is suspected of any offence whatever under the second clause of the Bill. I hope the noble Lord will enlighten us upon that point, and if he is not able to do so this evening I would suggest that your Lordships might allow the Bill to have its Second Reading, but we certainly should be entitled to cross-examine the noble Lord somewhat severely on some of these points when we reach the Committee stage.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0009P0I0254"/>
<col>499</col>
in the introduction of two new Peers in your Lordships' House. I am very glad that the noble Marquess opposite has consented to the Bill being given a Second Reading. No doubt some of the clauses will require consideration. I would remind the House that this was brought in by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and though no doubt it may be amended in some small particulars, yet the object of the Bill is so good that I venture to hope the noble Marquess's suggestion will be agreed to and that my noble friend will be allowed to obtain the Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01117"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is one point in this Bill to which I desire to call your Lordships' attention. It has only been brought to my notice this morning, but it is a point which is relative to this discussion. Though this Bill is recommended to us as a consolidating Bill, it applies to Ireland and makes a very great change in the law in that country. I refer to subsection (<i>b</i>) of Clause 6, which makes it illegal to put down poison if there is any danger of access being had to that poison by any dog, cat, fowl, or other domestic animal. Occupiers of land in Ireland have very stringent powers in regard to putting down poison after advertising and complying with certain conditions, but I understand that this Bill would take away those powers. It is absolutely necessary in a grazing country like Ireland that this power should exist, and the lot of the Irish cattle-owner and sheep-owner would be almost impossible if this Bill were passed in its present form. As I understand, when the Bill was originally introduced in another place it contained a provision safeguarding the rights which are now enjoyed in Ireland, but that provision was struck out, in the absence, I believe, of Irish Members, on the motion of hon. gentlemen representing English constituencies. I have received representations from different parts of Ireland asking that consideration may be given to this point, with a view to an Amendment being made in your Lordships' House so as to restore the Bill to its original position in this respect. I have thought it well in view of the discussion that has taken place this afternoon, to mention this point as I know that several noble Lords from Ireland will interest themselves in the matter when the Bill reaches another stage.</membercontribution></p>
<col>500</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01118"><member>LORD SAYE AND SELE</member><membercontribution>: The provision to which the noble Earl has just referred was not in the Bill as it was introduced in the House of Commons, but an Amendment was inserted bringing in Ireland. With regard to the noble Marquess's question about police constables, I am afraid I have not sufficient legal knowledge to turn it up at a moment's notice, but my impression is that the provision regarding police constables which the noble Marquess read is exactly as it appears in the original Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01119"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships are well aware that the most dangerous description of a Bill is that it is a consolidation Bill unless it is very fully explained what changes the Bill proposes to make in the existing law. I did not hear very distinctly the answer which the noble Lord gave a moment ago to the noble Marquess. If I caught correctly his words, I understood him to say that the provision which is to be found in Clause 11 is to be found in the existing law. Is that so?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01120"><member>LORD SAYE AND SELE</member><membercontribution>: I believe that is so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01121"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: We were also told that the Bill has the full approval of the Board of Agriculture, but the President of the Board apparently does not know very much about the contents of the Bill. All he knows of this Bill, of which he is said so thoroughly to approve, is that its object is a good one; at least that is all he told us. But he added that no doubt with regard to details the Bill will require considerable alteration. I would ask the noble Earl whether he will make himself responsible for the necessary improvements in the drafting of the Bill, or otherwise whether be will be so good as to withhold his consent at the further stages. If what is meant is merely that the noble Earl personally has no objection to the provisions in the Bill, then I think it ought not to be said that the Bill has the full approval of the Board of Agriculture.<lb/>
There is another point, though I do not know that I am wise in alluding to it. It is stated that this Bill is not to apply to Scotland. It appears to have excited some commotion in Ireland, to which it is made to apply, and I suppose that Scotland
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0255"/>
<col>501</col>
on this occasion ought to be very thankful for small mercies and to congratulate itself on being omitted; but I should like to ask what is the reason for the Bill being made to apply to Ireland and not to Scotland. Is it that the law in Scotland is different? I should, like to have an answer to that question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01122"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I rise to make a suggestion by way of saving your Lordships' time. This is one of a class of Bills, of which we have known a great many, which are partly consolidation and partly other. As a general rule Parliament does not care to reconsider what is already part of the law unless there is reason to believe that the law has not worked properly. Therefore it is a pure waste of time for us to consider provisions which are already law, but there are no means on the face of this Bill of seeing what portion of it is part of the existing law and what is not. I have before suggested that it would shorten matters considerably if there was a difference in the type or some other indication in these Bills to show what is new and what is not new. I do not know whether I might make that suggestion again to the noble Lord in charge of this Bill and to the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01123"><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: With the leave of the House, I should like to tell the noble Earl who raised the question of Scotland that Scotland has been left out of the Bill owing to the difference in Scottish legal procedure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01124"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: This is no doubt, my Lords, a very valuable Bill. It has passed through the House of Commons, and. I shall be very pleased to do what I can to help my noble friend behind me in getting it through your Lordships' House. At the same time I should like to say, the House having been very good-natured to me personally in passing consolidation Bills, that I will pledge myself in regard to this Bill that no new matter shall be introduced. I understand that this is simply a Consolidation Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01125"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: No.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01126"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: We understand very differently; but I think it would be quite sufficient at this stage
<col>502</col>
if the noble Earl would be kind enough to assure the House that when the Bill comes before us in Committee there shall be an indication on the face of the Bill, either by a difference in the print or by a Memorandum or in some other way, as to what is new matter and what is purely consolidation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01127"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: That is what I meant to assure your Lordships, but I expressed myself badly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01128"><member>LORD SAYE AND SELE</member><membercontribution>: May I again state, for the information of noble Lords opposite, that the new matter in this Bill is as follows. The maximum penalty for cruelty is increased from &#x00A3;5 to &#x00A3;25, and the maximum imprisonment from three months to six months; power is given to a Court to order the destruction in certain circumstances of unfit animals; uniform conditions are laid down for the conduct of knacker's yards; provision is made that spring traps are to be visited at stated intervals; and there is an extension of the powers of the Board of Agriculture with respect to the making of Orders. I believe there is nothing further in this Bill that is not in old enactments and therefore the law of the land at this moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01129"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I would point out that the power which the noble Lord says is given to destroy animals is given, not to a Court, but to a constable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01130"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: I fully admit that Consolidation Bills containing new matter are Bills which require watching. I think it would be advisable if a Memorandum could be arranged before the Committee stage explaining clearly what is new in this Bill and what is purely consolidation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01131"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The noble and learned Lord's suggestion would meet our views entirely.

<title>INTESTATE HUSBAND'S ESTATE<lb/> (SCOTLAND) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01133" align="center">[SECOND READING]</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01134">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01135"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SOUTHWARK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have to ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading to this Bill, the object of which is the same as that of the measure which was passed in the year 1890 for the rest of the United Kingdom&#x2014;namely, to secure for the widow of an intestate husband who dies without issue the first &#x00A3;500 of the estate, and, in the event of the estate not yielding that amount, the whole of the estate. Under the existing law in Scotland half the estate under &#x00A3;500 goes to the widow and the other half to the next of kin. This Bill is of so simple a character that I do not think the House will desire to be troubled, with any lengthy observations upon it. What this Bill proposes has been in operation throughout the rest of the United Kingdom for the past 20 years. It has given universal satisfaction and has worked well, and the practical question arises, Why should not a Scottish widow be treated in this matter as well as an English or Irish widow? The Bill originated with an old Parliamentary friend of mine, Mr. Crombie, the late Member for Kincardineshire, and it has been passed through the House of Commons this year by Mr. J. McD. Henderson, the Member for West Aberdeenshire. It went through the other House without amendment, and I think I am right in saying that it has the approval of my noble friend the Secretary for Scotland.

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01175">The noble Duke said: My Lords, I rise to move the Amendment of which I have given notice, and I shall endeavour not to detain your Lordships longer than I can help upon a matter which is, of course, of a rather technical character. But I am afraid
<col>508</col>
I must spend sonic little time upon it, because it is necessary that I should put the whole case as distinctly as I can before you. To make a long story short, the Metropolitan Water Board propose to construct in the County of Middlesex two reservoirs of a very large size, and the method of construction is as follows. They intend to dig a ditch round these reservoirs&#x2014;a ditch which in its whole circumference will reach a length of five miles. They mean to dig this ditch right down to the London clay, which lies 110 feet in some places below the surface. They intend to fill these ditches with concrete and then to dig out the interior of the circle so formed and fill it with water and so make a reservoir. This form of construction is not a very common one, I believe, and the scale on which it is proposed to do it in this instance is absolutely unique. It is perfectly evident that if you dig a ditch 110 feet deep and five miles long you will infallibly tap the whole of the water which rests upon London clay upon the water bearing surface. While this ditch is being dug and these works are being carried out the Metropolitan Water Board will have to pump extensively, and the consequence of their pumping, as we apprehend, will be that they will deplete all the wells in the surrounding district.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01176">This is a populous district, full of small owners and occupiers who have wells, and we fear that the distress for water in consequence of the Board's operations will be very great. I can call in support of that statement no less weighty evidence than that of the Metropolitan Water Board's own engineer, Mr. W. B. Bryan, and with your Lordships' leave I will read some extracts from his evidence&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01177"><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;I think you told my friend Mr. Hutchinson this morning that during the time your trenches are open through the gravel to the London clay you will have pumping machinery here?</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01178"><i>A.</i>&#x2014;Yes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01179"><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;Is that liable to pump the water out of the surrounding gravel for a radius of some distance?</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01180"><i>A.</i>&#x2014;It is.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01181"><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;Are you aware that a large number of the houses in the village of Wraysbury are dependent to a great extent for their water supply on wells?</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01182"><i>A.</i>&#x2014;I gained that from some of the petitions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01183"><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;May I ask what you propose to do in view of that?</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01184"><i>A.</i>&#x2014;It is rather difficult to say what would be the best means, but I should think the putting down of a small temporary pumping station taking the water from the existing sources and laying some temporary pipes of supply.
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0259"/>
<col>509</col>
Then the engineer was asked whether there was anything of that sort in his Bill, and he replied "No." But he added that there were contingencies in the estimates which would cover that. Next he was asked whether that provision would be covered by the 10 per cent. contingencies, and he replied in the affirmative. He was then asked&#x2014;
<quote>"Is that the usual thing for the ten per cent. contingencies to cover?"</quote>
and he replied&#x2014;
<quote>"That will not be a large matter; it will be a very small matter indeed as compared with the cost of Reservoirs Nos. 1 and 2."</quote>
Therefore, my Lords, you will observe, first, that the depletion of water is admitted by the Water Board's engineer, and that the supply to make good that loss to these small well owners would, on the engineer's admission, involve a very small cost to the Board. Then the following questions were put to the Water Board's engineer&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01185"><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;Are you prepared, as engineer, to come under an obligation to supply water if these wells fail?</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01186"><i>A.</i>&#x2014;If it could be proved that these wells failed by reason of our works I think it would be fair that we should supply them with water.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01187"><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;But forgive me, you have just admitted to me that the water will be sucked out of the gravel for a very considerable area; many of these wells are within 200 yards of your works?</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01188"><i>A.</i>&#x2014;I have just stated that if that be proved, it would be fair that we should supply them in some form or another with an adequate water supply.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01189"><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;Then I may take it you will be prepared to insert some obligation in the Bill to that effect?</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01190"><i>A.</i>&#x2014;That would have to go through the solicitors and counsel for the Bill, but I have stated my opinion that it would be fair to do it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01191"><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;There is another point, of course. How is a cottager going to prove that damage has been done by your pumping? That is an expensive matter?</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01192"><i>A.</i>&#x2014;I am quite sure my Board would take a perfectly broad view of this matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01193"><i>Q.</i>&#x2014;Will you put a general obligation in the Bill?</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01194"><i>A.</i>&#x2014;I am quite sure if the wells were depleted we should supply an adequate quantity either to the cottager or to other property owners.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01195">I am afraid, my Lords, that the Board are taking rather a narrow view of the matter, and I appeal to the evidence of their own engineer to show three things&#x2014;first, that the pumping will deplete the water; secondly, that there is no difficulty whatever and no great expense in the Board's supplying the well owners with water; and, thirdly, that in his opinion it would be a fair thing to do it.</p>
<col>510</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01196">There is another circumstance which shows that there is a real necessity for some provision such as I have proposed. I refer to the fact that the Board have come to an agreement with a large landowner near by to give him exactly the same compensation which they have refused to these small owners. They have come to an agreement with Lord Fitzhardinge to compensate him for any water they may pump away from any wells on his estate in consequence of these works. I ask, Why is Lord Fitzhardinge to have a protection which the small owner or occupier who cannot afford to appear before the Committee is denied? But I ought to state that Lord Fitzhardinge did not appear before the Committee. This was a matter of private agreement between the promoters and Lord Fitzhardinge, but it shows that the promoters are willing to consider the case of the big landlord though they entirely ignore the position of the small owner and occupier.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01197">Now what are the objections to the clause which I propose to insert? So far as I have been able to ascertain, there are two main objections. One is a technical objection. It is that there is no precise precedent for the course which I am asking your Lordships to pursue in giving protection to these small owners. Underground water has been protected again and again in Private Bill after Private Bill, and provisions have been inserted for the protection of those who have the enjoyment of underground water. I have here a list of a dozen Bills each containing such a provision, but in most of those cases there is no provision for compensating the well owner during the construction of works. In a few cases, however, there is protection even during the construction of the works, but there is always protection for continuous damage; and one of the technical objections which the Board take, as I understand, to my proposal is that in this case there will be no continuing damage. They say that as soon as the concrete is filled in and the reservoirs made there will be no further depletion of the wells in the neighbourhood. That may be the case, but these works are going to take four years in construction. The damage done to a man who is dependent for his water supply upon a well in the neighbourhood will have to be endured for four years at least, and it may be longer, before his well would fill again. It does seem to me a very small point to take, that because in other instances there is continuing
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0260"/>
<col>511</col>
damage and that here there is not continuing damage, therefore a man is to have his wells depleted of water for four years or more without any remedy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01198">There is a further technical objection taken, and it is that in most cases compensation is given to individuals named. In this instance we ask for protection for all well owners within two miles of the reservoirs. Such a general protection has been given over and over again; but again the technical objection is taken that it has not been given in cases where the damage is not continuous. Then there is another objection&#x2014;it is the only objection with which I shall trouble your Lordships further&#x2014;and it is the objection upon which, as I understand, the Committee base their decision. I have already told your Lordships that underground water has over and over again been the subject of protection in Private Bills. But last year a Bill, as your Lordships are aware, was introduced called the Water Supplies Protection Bill, which was referred to a Joint Committee. That Joint Committee made a Report, and my noble friend Lord Kintore, who was chairman of the Committee who considered this Bill, said that in consequence of the nature of the Report of that Joint Committee he considered that protection should not be given to these small owners. I speak with great respect of anything which falls from my noble friend Lord Kintore. We all know that he has a great deal of experience of Private Bill Committees and that he gives much attention to these questions, but I humbly submit that he has entirely misunderstood the Report of this Joint Committee. I ask your Lordships' leave to read what my noble friend quoted from the Report of the Joint Committee, and I will then ask you whether, in your opinion, it bears the interpretation which he put upon it. The Joint Committee in their Report [Paragraph 3] said&#x2014;
<quote>"As regards the question of compensation, it is clear that to give a right to compensation for loss of subsoil water, even within the limitations proposed by the Bill, involves an important alteration of the general law, which, as it stands, recognises no property in underground water unless it is flowing in a known and definite channel. But as the law was settled before the conditions in which its equity is now challenged had come into being, it is urged on the Committee as reasonable and proper that the law should be now reconsidered in view of the altered circumstances of the present time."</quote>
<col>512</col>
And the Joint Committee go on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"On the evidence given before them the Committee are satisfied that serious damage has been done to private property in particular localities by the pumping operations of water authorities, and they think it not improbable that similar injury is also caused by collieries, breweries, railway companies, and similar agencies who, like water authorities, extract water from the subsoil, but unlike them, are under no statutory obligation as regards the use to which such water is put. It has been forcibly urged on the Committee that if it be fair and equitable to levy compensation, as the Bill proposes, from water undertakers for injury done by the abstraction of water from the subsoil of private property, then the application of the same rule or treatment to all other agencies or industries causing similar injury cannot be resisted. In other words, it is claimed that any such change in the law as the Bill proposes, should, if approved by Parliament, be made of general reciprocal application."</quote>
Then they go on to say&#x2014;and this is the part of the Joint Committee's Report, I understand, on which my noble friend Lord Kintore relies&#x2014;
<quote>"In these circumstances the Committee can go no further than to say that while they consider as worthy of notice the considerable body of evidence on their Minutes in favour of the principle of compensation for damage done by the abstraction of subsoil water, and while they also desire to draw attention to the evidence as to the difficulties to which it is alleged the general application of the principle of compensation would lead, they are unable to form a definite conclusion or make any recommendation on the subject (which is, indeed, of vast and far-reaching importance) without further careful and detailed inquiry. It is not only for this reason but for other reasons, to be presently mentioned, that they wish to repeat the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal contained in their third Report published in 1903&#x2014;that a comprehensive inquiry into the whole subject of surface and underground water supplies should be held before any legislative action is taken of the kind proposed in this Bill."</quote>
And then my noble friend Lord Kintore, having read that extract from the Report of the Joint Committee, said&#x2014;
<quote>"Those were, I think, wise words, and they cover the clauses you propose, and the Committee all think they should be refused."</quote>
It appears to me that my noble friend thinks that because the Joint Committee said they were not prepared with any general recommendations affecting the whole question of underground water, therefore they meant to say that no relief to any of those who enjoyed underground water should in future be given under any Private Bill until there had been a general inquiry. I cannot believe that to have been the intention of the Joint Committee. What must have been in their minds was this&#x2014;"We do not
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0261"/>
<col>513</col>
without more inquiry and more evidence see our way to lay down general principles with regard to underground water, and therefore, pending such further information, you must go on as you were before." And the situation which existed before was that each Committee on each Private Bill judged the case on its merits and gave protection for subsoil water when they thought the case demanded it. I admit that that is a happy-go-lucky way of dealing with this matter, but it is the only course open to us until there is sonic definite general rule laid down on the subject. In the case of Lord Fitzhardinge relief is given. The justice of the case is so patent that the promoters have given relief there. Therefore with all respect to the noble Earl I cannot think that your Lordships' House ought to support his contention, but, on the contrary, ought to say that until full inquiry has been carried out into all the circumstances Committees on Private Bills shall go on as before, judging each case on its merits and giving relief where they think relief should be given.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01199">Let me go back for a moment to the question of principle. We are told that there is no precise precedent for this clause. I have told your Lordships in what sense there is not a precise precedent. There is precise precedent for everything in this clause, but it cannot be found in one Bill. There is a precedent in the Barry Railway Bill, only that in that case it was in favour of a general owner and not in favour of a district. In various Bills precedents are to be found; and all you are asked to do to-day is, in a case where the justice of it demands, to so far establish a precedent as to combine what you find in various Acts and put it into this one Bill on this one occasion. I do not know why we should be so afraid of precedents if the justice of the case demands this protection. Committees upstairs make precedents every year. It is better that your Lordships' House should make precedents than that they should be made by Committees. Your Lordships have a growing practice now of sending Private Bills to Joint Committees. I know there is a great deal to be said for that course, but it has this disadvantage, that you have no reconsideration of points of this kind. It constantly happens that justice which cannot be obtained in one House is obtained in the other when Private Bills go before two Committees; but where a Bill is subjected to one inquiry only there is no redress of grievances supposing that Committee should
<col>514</col>
have omitted anything, unless your Lordships are willing to amend the Bill in this House on Third Reading and consent now and then to establish small precedents. I think I have said all I need say on this subject. I have endeavoured to put the case fairly before you, and I hope you will support the insertion of the new clause which I now move.</p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01202"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF KINTORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is never an easy task or a pleasant one for any one sitting on these Benches to have to ask your Lordships to refuse to agree to any Amendment proposed by the noble Duke. I can assure you that it certainly is no pleasant task for me, for my noble friend would be entirely right were he to claim me to be in large measure in sympathy with the general objects which I understand he intends his clause to serve. The noble Duke, I am glad to think, will find in this House and outside many ready to agree with him and me that some rights still attach to property, and that, where a property in private ownership is materially and permanently injured by the operations of a public authority carried on in the exercise of its powers, the owner should be compensated.<lb/>

Though technically this is a Private Bill, it is in fact a Bill of very considerable public interest, and it contains various proposals of equal public importance. As originally opened to the Joint Committee to whom your Lordships referred it for consideration it contained yet more. For example, it contained proposals the effect of which would have been to place the Metropolitan Water Board out of the reach and beyond the control of Parliament for some sixty or seventy years. During the first decade of that time the scenic beauties of the Thames from Staines past Runnymede and Magna Charta Island up to Old Windsor would have been irretrievably ruined, and, again, the liability of the riverside lands in the district to floods would in our judgment not have been appreciably lessened, while the new intake for the large further supply of water to London contemplated by the Bill was planned to be placed directly opposite to the Windsor sewage farm only separated from the river by a low and porous bank.<lb/>
Inclusive of a few days devoted to hearing the Thames Conservancy Bill, which was referred to the Joint Committee by the House of Commons, we sat altogether from the end of March till the beginning of June considering this Bill and the sixty-four petitions against it, and it must be a satisfaction to every member of the Committee, that, barring a single dissent early in our proceedings, all our decisions were come to unanimously, and further and of greater importance, that with the single exception of the case before the House at this moment our decisions have been accepted by all parties with a loyal determination, by working under them, to provide a supply of water admirable and adequate for twenty-five years and more, and still further to improve and add to that great work of river purification which has been carried on so well by the Thames Conservancy Board at great expense in the past.<lb/>
During the hearing a clause similar in effect if not identical in words was pressed for by the Middlesex County Council. It was argued that where the water level in any well in the county council's area was even temporarily lowered by the trenching, the Water Board should be held compelled to add water up to the deficiency. We were not of ourselves prepared in a Private Bill to take this new departure, involving such a large question of principle, so in the confident expectation that the matter would
<col>516</col>
be raised in one or other House of Parliament we decided as a Committee to take no action. The Motion of my noble friend, whose services both in Parliament and as an Alderman the Middlesex County Council are indeed fortunate to be able to rely upon, relieves us in that regard of any disappointment. The county council support the noble Duke in a Memorandum which I have seen, and I think I do it no injustice in saying that it endeavours to make three points. It says that it is now the settled practice of Parliament that water undertakers, when seeking fresh powers to construct new works, shall be put under obligation to make up in some form to owners of private wells in the vicinity any deficiency of water caused by the operations of the water undertakers; and in support of that assertion it quotes fourteen Acts of Parliament which have been passed between the years 1906 and last session. But, my Lords&#x2014;and I think the noble Duke, having looked into the matter, frankly admits this to be the case&#x2014;not one of those cited Acts is on all fours with this Bill. All of them are Acts sanctioning the sinking of new wells upon gathering ground of underground water already being drawn upon. As there exist no legal rights in underground water and as I believe it will pass the wit of man to devise enactments in regard to underground water which will in practice prove to be equitable all round, I think those compensation clauses were quite proper to be inserted. But this Bill has nothing to do with underground water. It relates entirely to surface water, to river water, proposed to be raised into reservoirs for storage and subsequent distribution. And, moreover, the pumping sanctioned in the Acts cited was intended to be permanent, and consequently any damage caused by the pumping would be permanent also, which is by no means the case here.</membercontribution></p>

<col>517</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01206"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF KINTORE</member><membercontribution>: Oh, yes. I think that clause was inserted to meet the case of a permanent supply being possibly severed by the driving of a tunnel. The Middlesex County Council next point in their Memorandum to the clause inserted for the protection of Lord Fitzhardinge. I pass that by because, as my noble friend admits, the clause was an agreed one and was attached to the Bill as a manuscript clause when first presented to the Committee. I come to the last point&#x2014;the reference to the extremely able and valuable Report of Lord MacDonnell's Joint Committee on the Water Supplies Protection Bill of last session. One of the three main objects of that Bill was to restrict the powers of authorised undertakers by rendering them liable for compensation for injury to private supplies due to their operations&#x2014;the very object of the noble Duke's clause. Lord Maconnell's Committee took a great deal of evidence on this point, and their Report, which as the noble Duke truly said weighed greatly with my Committee, contained these words&#x2014;
<quote>"The Committee wish to repeat the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal contained in their Third Report published in 1903, that a comprehensive inquiry into the whole subject of surface and underground water supplies should be held before any legislative action is taken of the kind proposed in this Bill."</quote>
With that Report before us we were confirmed in our opinion that it would be improper for us to allow compensation for which there was no exact precedent to be inserted before this House had been consulted and before inquiry into the whole question of water supply had been held. The necessity for such an inquiry is patent and admitted, and as one whose lot it has been to hear the evidence in connection with not a few Water Bills I would like without presumption and very earnestly to support that recommendation. The haphazard and arbitrary way in which local sources of supply are sometimes wasted, sometimes withheld from use, and sometimes appropriated for other and distant places without regard to the places from which the water is taken, is becoming an everyday experience of Parliamentary Committees. The time seen is to me to have more than arrived when such an inquiry ought to be held, and it is much to be hoped&#x2014;may I address this remark especially to my noble friend Lord Allendale?&#x2014;that the Local Government Board will be able to see their way to instigate such an inquiry at the
<col>518</col>
earliest moment, and if this discussion this afternoon in any way conduces to that inquiry being held I for one shall be well content.<lb/>
Holding the views I have mentioned, it was not, of course, necessary for the Committee to hear counsel for the Metropolitan Water Board in opposition to this proposal; but since the noble Duke gave notice of this new clause I have received from the Metropolitan Water Board some notes bearing on it with a covering letter. Your Lordships are always ready, indeed anxious, to hear both sides of a case before forming an opinion, and I would ask you with some confidence, more especially as I very infrequently intrude upon your Lordships' time, to give me three or four minutes more while I lay before the House the views of the Metropolitan Water Board. In reference to the cited cases in the Memorandum of the Middlesex County Council, the Metropolitan Water Board say&#x2014;
<quote>"The Water Acts quoted are Acts authorising the sinking of wells and the abstraction of water by pumping as a permanent means of supply, and any injury that might be caused under those Acts would be of a permanent nature. In the case of the Railway Acts referred to, the apprehended injury was also of a permanent nature."</quote>
They then go on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"The works to be authorised by the Board's New Works Bill, so far as they affect the present question, consist of reservoirs, and any subsoil water would only he temporarily interfered with during the limited period for which pumping would continue in the construction of the puddle trenches. The clause desired by the Middlesex County Council would impose upon the Metropolitan Water Board the expense of providing a permanent supply for merely a short temporary interference. The words 'reasonably incurred' would be no protection to the Board, for an arbitrator would very likely hold that the laying on of a supply from the nearest authorised undertakers was reasonable seeing that local supplies would or might be liable to depletion. There is no precedent for inserting such a clause in a Bill authorising the construction of reservoirs not connected with a pumping submits. The insertion of the clause is an endeavour to impose upon the Metropolitan Water Board the general principles involved in the Water Supplies (Protection) Bill which was considered last session by a Joint Committee presided over by Lord MacDonnell. These proposals, as that Joint Committee reported, would involve an important alteration of the general law of the land which should not be made without a comprehensive inquiry into the whole subject of surface and underground water supplies. It would be unfair to the Metropolitan Water Board and the other large corporations and water authorities who opposed the passing of that Bill now to insert a clause giving effect to these principles before such an inquiry has been held. The Board's evidence on the subject has not been heard, but the case would no doubt be quoted as a precedent for
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0264"/>
<col>519</col>
imposing the clause on water authorities in every similar Bill. The matter of the underground sources of supply was fully dealt with in Lord MacDonnell's Report, and pending the inquiry therein suggested no general compensation clause of the nature proposed should be imposed in a Private Bill without the promoters of such Bill having an opportunity of fully considering its effect and calling evidence before the Committee considering the Bill. The clause suggested by the Middlesex County Council is of very wide application and refers to the diminution of any supply of water not only to any well but to any borehole, pond, pool, spring, stream or watering place. Any pond, etc., whether actually used or not, might be claimed to be a potential 'source of supply,' and any lowering of its water level would apparently have to be met by the provision of a substituted supply which in most cases would probably have to be permanent."</quote>
Then the Board refer to the Fitzhardinge clause, and say&#x2014;
<quote>"The county council referred in the course of the proceedings before the Joint Committee, and refer again in their Memorandum, to the fact that in the clause contained in the Bill for the protection of Lord Fitzhardinge (Clause 30) the Board are required to give a new or additional supply in the event of Lord Fitzhardinge's existing supply being diminished. The circumstances in that case are, however, special, for Lord Fitzhardinge was able to convince the Board that there was a substantial risk of injury to his well owing to the obstruction in the flow of water which will be caused by the laying of a number of very large trunk mains in close proximity to it. The provision has no reference to any possible injury resulting front temporary pumping."</quote>
And the Water Board wind up by saying&#x2014;
<quote>"The matter is of such far-reaching importance that it should not be in any way prejudiced before it is fully inquired into and dealt with by general legislation applying to all water seeking undertakings, whether for public water supply or for railway or mining purposes."</quote>
Before I sit down I should like to be allowed to read the letter from the Metropolitan Water Board which covered these notes, and which is dated July 4. In it the Board say&#x2014;
<quote>"The Law and Parliamentary Committee of the Water Board have this morning given the most careful consideration to the clause which the Middlesex County Council desire to insert in this Bill. My Committee entertain the strongest view that the clause should not be inserted, inasmuch as it deals with a vital question of principle and proposes to alter the general law as to rights in underground water. It is understood that this important question is to be made the subject of a general Parliamentary inquiry on the lines indicated by Lord MacDonnell's Joint Committee of last session, and my Committee feel that it would be unjust in the extreme to impose this clause upon the Water Board until there has, at all events, been a reasonable opportunity for the general inquiry to be held. There is no doubt whatever that if the proposed clause be imposed upon a water undertaking of such first class
<col>520</col>
importance as that of the metropolis, it will attain great weight as a precedent, will go far to prejudice the question of the proposed inquiry, and thereby seriously damnify the water undertakings throughout the kingdom. The gravity of this injustice would be increased by the fact that the Middlesex County Council propose to insert the clause without affording the promoters the opportunity of calling evidence against it, for it will be remembered that your Lordships' Joint Committee struck out the proposed clause without hearing evidence against it. The Water Board are most willing to facilitate to the utmost a general inquiry into the whole question of compensation for interference with water rights, an inquiry at which the arguments for and against the whole question could be adequately dealt with, and the conclusions arrived at embodied in a model clause or Public Bill. They feel, however, that it would be a grave injustice to themselves and to others to prejudice the question by the insertion of a clause in the present private Bill, and on these grounds of high principle my committee feel that such legislation in the present Bill is open to the most grave objection."</quote>
Agreeing generally, as I do, with the terms of that letter, which seems to me to be clear and convincing, and subject to anything that the noble Lord who represents the Local Government Board or the Lord Chairman may desire to say, I should like to express the hope that my noble friend will rest satisfied with the discussion he has raised this afternoon and will not on this occasion press his proposal further.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01207"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is not, strictly speaking, a question arising on a Public Bill, but the question is one of such far-reaching importance and affects so many rights that it well deserves the attention it has received. No one could have listened to the noble Duke, who went very thoroughly into the circumstances of this case, without feeling that the point which he pressed is one which has too much in the past escaped attention, and the neglect of which has inflicted great hardship. In the law of this country there is no right to percolating water, and in the absence of such right there is no doubt that these great undertakings brought into operation with statutory powers have inflicted a great deal of hardship. On the other hand, it has been necessary to provide great masses of the public congregated in populous areas with a supply of water, and it has been impossible to get that supply without executing works which inflicted this kind of injury.<lb/>
Parliament is really placed in a dilemma. This is not, of course, a Bill for taking percolating water, but it is a Bill for
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0265"/>
<col>521</col>
making works which do to some extent temporarily affect the supply of percolating water, and the question is what is to be done? Parliament has to try to adjust the balance of convenience and inconvenience and to settle the matter in the general interest in the way that is least injurious. This is not a matter that can be dealt with according to any abstract principle. I doubt very much, if we had all the light that an inquiry might give&#x2014;and I am far from saying there ought not to be such an inquiry&#x2014;that we should be able to discover any principle to solve the concrete difficulties pointed out by the noble Duke. On the other hand, you have to remember that the Metropolitan Water Board has to supply the needs of this great metropolis, that it is urgently needed that a further supply of water should be got, and that that cannot be got under existing circumstances without inflicting considerable inconvenience, and, perhaps, a little injury. Parliament has taken the only course it could take. It referred the matter to a strong Committee presided over by the noble Earl who last addressed us, with instructions to do what is right in protecting, in all the cases where protection should be given, anything approaching to injury. I do not think the noble Duke would say himself that it would have been possible to cover every individual case.<lb/>
There must be some hardship in a case of this kind, but the necessities of the public are so great that you must make up your minds to face some hardship. The Committee took the general question and then the principal cases brought before them, and they have introduced a large series of protective clauses covering the ground to the utmost extent they reasonably could. Again I say there may be points in which the Bill could have gone further, but I doubt it very much, after looking at what has been done. What you have in substance is this&#x2014;not, as it emerged from the Committee, a Bill for abstracting percolating water, but a Bill for making works which are absolutely vital if a new supply of water is to be brought to London, and containing a series of protective clauses covering all the cases which the Joint Committee thought could be covered with a view to minimising the hardship to owners. Again I say to the noble Duke that I feel that probably there are cases which
<col>522</col>
the Committee have not been able to cover. You cannot cover all the cases unless you make the law different, and give some rights in percolating water. But there being no such legal rights it is impossible to devise any scheme which will prevent people suffering a certain amount of inconvenience.<lb/>
The only course you can take is to trust a Committee of this kind to do the best they can in putting in protective clauses. It is impossible to insert any general clause such as has been referred to without contravening the recommendations of Lord MacDonnell's Committee of last year. The result is that it seems to me, as far as I can judge, that you have got the best substitute that you could have in the clauses that are in the Bill. For my part I feel that if this Committee over which the noble Earl presided and which gave so much labour to this question has not done the best that could be done in the circumstances in which action was absolutely necessary, then there is no other course. I do not think that the clause suggested is one that can be supported either on grounds of law or in face of the recommendations to which your Lordships' attention has been called. If the recommendations of the Committee which had this question fully before them were departed from, we should be making a precedent and throwing the administration of this class of public business into a state of uncertainty which would make our later condition worse than the condition in which we now stand.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01208"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should not have intervened in this debate but for the fact that a decision for winch I was responsible is quoted as an indirect precedent for the Amendment asked for. With due respect to the noble and learned Viscount opposite and to the noble Earl, Lord Kintore, I entirely fail to see that they have answered one very crucial objection. The case is a fairly simple one. Here the Middlesex County Council come and ask for a very limited and for only a temporary protection, and the reply they get is that we are not going to give them the protection, however limited it may be, because there is no precise precedent for it. Everybody who has served as Chairman of a Private Bill Committee knows that whenever a thing of this kind is asked for he is always met by
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0266"/>
<col>523</col>
this question of precedent, and the question really turns upon the circumstances of the case.<lb/>
The point I wish to make is this, that in the course of the proceedings, as I think was pointed out by my noble friend the noble Duke beside me, it was admitted by the promoters of the Bill that the Middlesex County Council had a clear right to the limited protection to which I have just alluded. I should like to refer again to the evidence of the Water Board's engineer. The engineer admitted that if these people were going to suffer from the operations of the Metropolitan Water Board it was only fair and equitable that they should be compensated; and to the final question that was put to hint he replied:&#x2014;
<quote>"I am quite sure that if the wells were depleted we [the Metropolitan Water Board] would supply an adequate quantity either to the cottagers or to other property owners."</quote>
When the promoters' engineer gave an undertaking of that kind I have always understood that it was a thing winch was eventually insisted upon if the Bill was passed. In this particular case that does not appear to have been done, and I fail to see why.<lb/>
I should like to ask whether it is not possible to settle the question amicably now. If there is anybody here who represents the Metropolitan Water Board, all he has to do is to give an undertaking that the pledge given by the engineer will be carried out, and I imagine that the Bill would then pass without any further discussion or dispute. But the result of this discussion increases the conviction which I have always felt that in dealing with cases of this kind some more settled lines are distinctly advisable. I have myself frequently had considerable difficulty in endeavouring to decide points of this kind. As is obvious from the experience in regard to this particular Bill, the decision rests on the haphazard view which happens to be taken by the chairman, and it is clear, therefore, that these decisions must frequently conflict. I think it would be a desirable thing in the interests of Private Bill Committees if there were model clauses by which chairmen could be guided. But at the same time it seems to me an extreme hardship that, because there is no precedent and because there is no model clause,
<col>524</col>
these people who are going to suffer from the operation of this Bill should not be permitted the protection for which my noble friend asks. It seems to me their case is so clear that if my noble friend goes to a Division I shall certainly support him in the Lobby.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01209"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OF SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as reference has been made during the course of this discussion to the Report of the Joint Committee of which I had the honour to be chairman, perhaps your Lordships will allow me to make a few remarks on this subject. The Joint Committee was appointed to consider a Bill introduced into your Lordships' House by Lord Desborough. That Bill was largely promoted by owners of property, mostly in Hertfordshire, who complained that by the extension of the works of a water company, the name of which I forget for the moment, their property would be greatly damaged; and no doubt before the Committee a considerable volume of evidence was produced from which it might be inferred that the construction of waterworks and the sinking of wells in any great number does deplete the subsoil water supply of the neighbouring country and affects grazing and also the trees and other amenities of the locality.<lb/>
The members of the Committee generally were impressed with the feeling that there was a grievance which ought to be remedied if it could be remedied. At the same time they thought that the scheme of the promoters of the Bill was an extravagant one in so far that it went to alter the old common law of the country which allows no right of property in subsoil water unless that water runs in a clearly defined channel. The promoters of the Bill also desired to shift the burden of proof and to put on the water companies or other undertakers the duty of proving that no damage had been caused. Our inquiries proceeded a considerable way, and then we came to the conclusion that if any damage had to be compensated for it ought not to be on such a narrow inquiry as we alone were competent to institute. We came to the conclusion that it was not water companies alone who caused this abstraction of subsoil water, but that railway companies, breweries, and many other commercial undertakings also abstracted subsoil water and caused a considerable amount of damage.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0267"/>
<col>525</col>
In particular cases the parties interested have been able to come to an agreement with the company that wished to extend its wells, and no doubt compensation has been agreed upon in many cases. In one large case that came before us we found that compensation had been paid for a considerable tract of country. But we were unable to make up out minds that any such provision as the noble Duke has placed on the Paper could possibly be supported by the evidence before us. We were also strongly impressed with the view that the resources of subsoil water throughout the country were not being properly husbanded, and that rivers were subject to pollution. Great water companies marked out large claims throughout the country, spheres of influence, as it were, within which they objected to any sort of competition. The result was that growing towns were seriously interfered with, and on the whole it seemed to us that the case was one which called for a much wider inquiry than we were authorised to make. And might I take this opportunity of impressing upon your Lordships that it is a matter of extreme importance for the future of this country that this subject should be fully inquired into and a map of the subsoil water supply and other water supplies of England recorded, so that when any particular company desires to increase the sphere of its operations it may consult the map and know how it is to proceed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01210"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to speak with the greatest respect of the Joint Committee which sat on this Bill. What the noble and learned Viscount opposite said is perfectly true, that when you have appointed a strong Committee <i>prim&#x00E2; facie</i> you ought to have profound respect for the finding at which they arrive; but I shall say a word or two in a moment why I do not think that that view is necessarily antagonistic to the general line which the noble Duke has taken. But first of all I should like to call your Lordships' attention to this fact, which is my principal reason for venturing to intervene&#x2014;that this is part of a very big question which involves enormous hardship to a number of perfectly unoffending persons. I belong to the County of Hertfordshire, to which Lord MacDonnell referred, and which has suffered acutely under the necessary requirements of the metropolis for water. It is perfectly true, as the noble
<col>526</col>
and learned Viscount said, that this great city must be provided with water, but it is also true that immense hardship may be inflicted upon those areas from which the I water is drawn.<lb/>
We have suffered enormously in Hertfordshire. We have been involved in a sort of life and death struggle to maintain our water. Sometimes we have succeeded, sometimes we have failed, but I am certain we enjoy general sympathy in the efforts to which we have been put. It is not proposed here to prevent in any way the making of these great reservoirs, necessary as they are. There is no such question. The only point is whether it is just or unjust, if this great corporation, the Metropolitan Water Board, make these works, that they should give compensation for any injury they inflict in so doing. It is not a question of a very large sum of money, as I shall show directly. I have reason to think that those who will suffer are small people, and they are engaged in this great controversy with this rich, important, and influential corporation. They do not say "Stop the waterworks," but "Give us that little compensation due to us in consequence of the injury you inflict upon us." That, <i>prim&#x00E2; facie</i>, is all that is asked.<lb/>
The injustice to these people who lose their water is admitted by the noble and learned Viscount. It is admitted by the noble Lord who presided over the important Committee who considered it. It is admitted by everybody. The main reply to the demand for redress is, Wait, if you please, for the Report of an important I Commission which has not yet been appointed. As your Lordships know, we may wait till the Greek calends, or at least we may wait for a great number of years, before we get the Report of such a Commission. There is no sign of its being appointed. No doubt the inquiry will be a long one, and it will be a very long time before any Act of Parliament follows on the findings of that Commission. Meanwhile all these humble individuals as to whom the injustice is admitted by everybody are to go on suffering. I do not think that is just. The second answer is that there is no precedent for compensating people for a temporary injury. There are, it is said, precedents for compensation for a permanent injury but none for a temporary injury. I do not admit that. But, even so, that argument is worthless. The only difference
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0268"/>
<col>527</col>
between a temporary injury and a permanent injury is that the former is very much smaller. If injury is to be compensated for at all, there is no less reason why a temporary injury should be compensated for. It is a very much smaller matter it is perfectly true, but that is an argument on my side and not against me. There is to be no compensation unless there is loss. The loss would have to be shown before the compensation would become due.<lb/>
I turn to the Committee over which my noble friend Lord Kintore presided. The noble and learned Viscount said we must not fly in the face of the Report of that Committee; but we have had the opportunity of hearing the noble Earl who presided over that Committee, and what did he say? He said that the Committee did not like to enter upon a new departure, but were quite sure the point would be raised in one or other House of Parliament. In other words, my noble friend and his colleagues did not think, the matter being in a sense novel, that it was right for them to undertake the responsibility for a new departure. But they said it would, of course, be raised in one or other House of Parliament&#x2014;in other words, they left it to Parliament to correct any injustice in the decision to which they arrived. How, then, can it be said that in accepting the Committee's advice and undertaking the consideration of the matter we are flying in the face of the Report of that Committee? It is evident that they left the matter to us thinking they had not sufficient authority themselves to decide it. I said just now that if it was a new departure it was only very slightly novel. The noble and learned Viscount seemed to think that there was some difficulty in assessing the compensation. I do not think so. It is going to be done here in the case of Lord Fitzhardinge, and it was done in the case of several private owners in the Barry Railway Bill.<lb/>
The Barry Railway Act, by the way, is exceedingly in point. It is quite true that that is not an Act connected with a water company, but it is only incidental, as it were, that the question arises in connection with a water company's Bill in this instance. In the case of the Barry Bill it was the making of a tunnel, and the case of the making of a tunnel is very much on all fours with the making of a reservoir. In the Barry case certain owners represented that they were likely to lose a certain
<col>528</col>
amount of water, I believe through the construction of the tunnel, but at any rate in consequence of the tunnel, and they received compensation. There was no difficulty, and both Houses of Parliament passed the necessary Act to confirm that agreement. For these reasons we do think that your Lordships' House is called upon to decide on this matter. We think that to ask us to wait until a nebulous Royal Commission has decided the point is a not sufficient answer, and we ask, in the name of these comparatively poor landowners and occupiers who are in controversy with i an enormously powerful corporation, that the justice which your Lordships' House never refuses, and which cannot in the end come to any large sum, should be granted to them.</membercontribution></p>

My noble friend Lord Newton used a strong expression. He spoke of a pledge having been given by the Water Board's engineer in the witness chair that some such clause as this should be put in; but I think my noble friend will realise that his language is a little too strong, for in the quotation which the noble Duke read from the engineer's evidence it was quite clear that I when the engineer was asked whether he would agree to a clause to that effect being put in he referred the cross-examining counsel to the Board's counsel and solicitors, who obviously were the right people to be consulted.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01213"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: I have not got the evidence before me. I am merely speaking from my recollection of what was read by the noble Duke. As I have said, I do not wish to go into this matter in any detail, because the details have been placed before your Lordships in the speeches which have been made and in the Memoranda circulated. I have had the Memorandum of the Metropolitan Water Board and that of the Middlesex County
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0269"/>
<col>529</col>
Council before me for some time, and I have gone into them very carefully with my advisers, and the conclusion that I have come to is that the Memorandum of the Metropolitan Water Board is substantially accurate, but that there are considerable inaccuracies in the Memorandum which supports the case of the noble Duke, especially as regards precedents. I may say that we have interviewed the parties, and we have absolutely failed to get from them a single precedent on all fours with the case which the Middlesex County Council submit.<lb/>
The noble Duke laid stress on the Barry Act. I confess that I have not gone very carefully into the Barry Act, but I have looked through it and I cannot find an exact precedent for the clause which the noble Duke desires to insert in this Bill. Clause 33 in the Barry Act is obviously the clause which the noble Duke has in mind. That is a clause dealing, not with temporary pumping, but with permanent pumping. It was a clause inserted for the protection of a particular landowner in a particular case, and that is a thing very often done on merits. It is a different thing altogether from what your Lordships are asked to do this afternoon, which is to put in a general protection against any case that may possibly arise. The same argument holds good in the case of Lord Fitzhardinge. Lord Fitzhardinge's case, I am informed, is this. A number of very large trunk mains are to be laid close to an existing well, and obviously there is a danger of their doing that well permanent damage. That is the position of affairs, I understand, in which this protection has been given. Again, it has nothing to do with temporary pumping while the works necessary under the Bill are being carried out. In the case of this Bill the Middlesex County Council ask your Lordships to put in a protective clause for landowners, some of whom may be small but we have no reason to doubt that some may be big, but none of them thought fit to appear before the Committee.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01217"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: I have seen no list of the landowners affected, and neither party has produced one. As regards the other cases quoted in the Memorandum of the Middlesex County Council, they are all either cases of permanent injury to a water supply through permanent pumping or special cases like that of Lord Fitzhardinge. I was amused to see cases at Lincoln and Cambridge quoted. As far as I can make out, the principal case there for protection was a case of possible damage to roads and bridges, which I do not think can be claimed in support of the clause which the noble Duke has placed before us. I think it is admitted quite frankly that there is no exact precedent. I would point out that no case has been quoted which is at all near; and, as I say, in the course of <i>viv&#x00E2; voce</i> examination the Middlesex County Council have been unable to produce one as regards the general position that has been stated by Lord Kintore and other noble Lords. I do not close my eyes to the fact that general legislation may, perhaps, be, necessary in a case such as this. It may or it may not; but the fact remains that those of your Lordships who have had to consider such a matter under the guidance of Lord MacDonnell have come to the conclusion that there is not at present sufficient information before us to enable us to come to a definite decision. As I have said, it may be desirable to give general protection; but those who have been most closely into the matter do feel that there is not enough information before us to make up our mind. If your Lordships insert this clause this evening you will be taking a very strong step in the direction of making up the mind of Parliament, and I should regret very much if such a step were taken in view of the small amount of information at our hands.<lb/>
The noble Marquess says this is a small matter. I can assure him it is a very large and expensive matter. What has to happen? Under the clause the promoters will be liable for damage if there is any diminution of water anywhere within two miles of these two or three reservoirs.
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0270"/>
<col>531</col>
What does that mean? They would have, before beginning to dig their reservoirs, to take the level of every small pool in the district. They have no powers to do it. This clause generously gives them power to go and inspect once a claim has been made, but once a claim has been made it is assumed that damage has been done and that the water supply has fallen. No facility is given to the Water Board to make the inspections, but they would be necessary and would be a very expensive operation. Therefore do not let us imagine that this is a small matter. This is putting a very serious burden on the Metropolitan Water Board. I do not suggest that that is any final reason for not putting the burden upon them if it is necessary. I only mention it because it has been argued that this is a very small thing. In view, first, of the absence of precedents; secondly, in view of the fact that it would be a considerable step for Parliament to take in an alteration of the general law, an alteration that no one has made up his mind how to carry out if it is to be carried out; and, thirdly, in view of the fact that this is a clause asking for protection for people who have not thought it worth while to come themselves and ask for it&#x2014;I should for these reasons regret it if your Lordships reversed the decision of the Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01218"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should not have intervened in this debate but for the fact that I had to consider this question for more than thirty years at the Bar, and I have had, strangely enough, one or two cases since I have been on the Bench. What seems to be overlooked is that what is asked for here is not in respect of abstraction of water permanently when the works are made, but abstraction while the works are being constructed. I venture to say that in many Private Bills, where it was said that the making of a tunnel would drain wells until the tunnel was rendered watertight, a special clause was inserted in order to protect the people affected. I believe the Barry case was one, but others could be found.<lb/>
If the noble Duke's clause dealt with the case of water abstracted by reason of the existence of the reservoir I could not support the noble Duke. I agree
<col>532</col>
with the noble and learned Viscount opposite that there are many who think that our law has not been sufficiently careful of rights regarding underground water. My noble and learned friend Sir Edward Fry takes a strong view upon that. But I wish to deal only with this particular Amendment. These landowners do not say that when the reservoirs are constructed the result will be that their wells will be drained and that therefore they should receive compensation. As I have said, we could not in the present state of the law support that; but it is thought that in the course of the construction of the reservoirs the wells will be temporarily interfered with. They desire temporary protection, and if Private Acts are looked through I am confident it will be found that there are many precedents for compensation being allowed where wells are temporarily interfered with during the construction of works. I ask your Lordships to consider from a broad standpoint this particular claim. Having listened to this debate, I am satisfied that the claim of the noble Duke cannot be resisted upon the ground that there is anything in principle against it. It does not involve the considerations which Lord MacDonnell referred to&#x2014;namely, rights as to underground water. I believe that where it has been shown that in the course of the construction of works temporary damage would be done, whether it be to roads, to water courses, or in respect of subsidence or anything of the kind, special clauses for protection, have constantly been inserted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01219"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Metropolitan Water Board are, as your Lordships know, largely in touch with the London County Council, the interests of whose ratepayers are very much involved in the decision which may be come to tonight, and I wish to draw attention to one or two points on which the Water Board contest the figures which have been put before the House by the noble Duke. The noble Duke drew a picture of sufferings that might be involved through the construction of a trench which he said would be five miles long, and which would take, I think he said, four or five years to make, and which also would in certain cases go to a depth of 100 feet. The noble and learned Lord who has just spoken has cleared away to some extent the difficulty of inserting a clause to meet a
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0271"/>
<col>533</col>
temporary grievance. But the whole gist of the matter really lies in this&#x2014;whether the supply of water will be affected to the extent which the noble Duke believes. The information which I have is this. The trench will not take five years to make, but will be made in four or five months. The whole length will no doubt be four or five miles, but the system of construction will only involve about 100 yards of the trench bring open at one time. As each section is completed the previous section would be filled in, and therefore the water which had been abstracted would no longer be abstracted from that surface. What your Lordships are dealing with, therefore, is not a question of years but of months, and not a question of miles but of yards; and while no doubt such a case may occur as would involve tunnelling to a depth of 100 feet, the distance which the Metropolitan Water Board's engineers anticipate they will have to go down is about forty feet. Therefore the whole question is very much narrower in compass than the Middlesex County Council are inclined to fear. I thought I ought to mention these facts because they are some guidance as to the position m which we stand. The insertion of the proposed clause would put the Water Board as representing the ratepayers to a very heavy expense for a comparatively small difficulty and one which would be of a very much more temporary nature than the noble Duke imagines.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01220"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to ask whether it is not advisable to give more consideration to this question than is possible to-day. I understood the noble Lord behind me to say that it would be impossible for him to support any general clause giving compensation for permanent diminution of water, but that he was prepared to support a clause&#x2014;and he knew precedents&#x2014;giving compensation for temporary diminution of water during the construction of the works. It seems that something of that kind might be done without in any way trespassing on the recommendations of Lord MacDonnell and his Committee as regards permanent loss of subsoil water. In this Bill there is a clause giving to Lord Fitzhardinge compensation in a particular case where it is admitted that a temporary loss of water would be occasioned. Would it not be possible if this debate were adjourned for the Water Board, who, after
<col>534</col>
all, have not been directly represented in this discussion, to reconsider the subject from that point of view, and confer with the noble Duke behind me and those supporting him to see if some clause could not be framed which would extend to cases where it could be definitely shown that the same amount of injury might be done temporarily as in Lord Fitzhardinge's case, the same compensation which is already provided for in that particular instance? In order to raise the point I beg to move the adjournment of the debate.</membercontribution></p>

This is not a matter that could be disposed of quickly. To hold an inquiry such as the noble Viscount has suggested it would take weeks before the numerous parties interested could be brought together, and I understand this Bill presses. Speaking for myself, I have given reasons to show that I do not like the clause, but I would rather take this Bill, as it is an urgent Bill, with the clause in it than take it with the inquiry suggested by the noble Viscount. Like my noble and learned friend I have had some experience of what these inquiries are; they are most difficult things, because in these cases you are dealing with parties who have intangible rights, not legal rights. The reason for this Bill is so great that, speaking for myself, I must repeat that though I object to the clause I would rather have the Bill with the clause in it than lose the Bill through the adoption of the course proposed to be taken.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01237"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD EVERSLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in moving that the House do go into Committee on this Bill I wish to say a few words. In the first place, I desire to thank the noble and learned Lord, Lord Alverstone, for so kindly giving up so much of his valuable time to presiding over the Committee which considered this Bill, and for assisting me in passing it. The Committee were practically unanimous on the Bill with the exception of one single point. That was an Amendment moved by Lord Clifford of Chudleigh for the purpose of enabling landowners to affix to ways which they did not intend to dedicate to the public notices to that effect, such notices to be conclusive that no dedication was intended. I understand that Lord Clifford's intention is to enable landowners to continue the user by the public of ways of this kind without at the same time going through the formality of closing the path from time to time in order to prevent the right growing. In that view I entirely concur. At the same time there is some little doubt whether the Amendment does not go rather further than the noble Lord intended, and my noble and learned friend Lord Robson found some difficulty in the proviso on this point. I do not propose at the present stage to take any exception to it. I have no doubt the whole Bill will be very carefully considered by the Government draftsman in another place, and I hope it may turn out that the objections of my noble and learned friend are not serious, and that the Bill will pass in its present form. I merely think it desirable to say to-night that it may be necessary hereafter to make a small Amendment in this clause. At the same time I am in general sympathy with the view of the noble Lord (Lord Clifford) on the subject, and I hope it may be possible for the clause to be passed in its present shape.</membercontribution></p>

For instance, a tenant might wish to leave his holding and might set to work deliberately to deteriorate it, and then if the county council gave him notice he would be entitled to receive back the sums which he had paid to the recoupment account. I think this would be unfair on the county council and, moreover, I think it would be unfair to the successor of this tenant, because the successor would have a much shorter time to run, yet he would have to repay the whole of the loan in the smaller number of years, it is for that reason I propose to leave out these words.</membercontribution></p>

My reason for proposing this Amendment is that this matter really appeal's to me to be one which is personal to the tenant himself. If he has been called upon to repay instalments of principal, I think it is quite fair if he sees tit to pay the remaining instalments that he should be able to become the proprietor of the property. If that is to be a right, however, which he is to be able to pass on, I think it might involve some complication and might be rather unfair to the county council. I am particularly anxious to meet the case of what I think is an undoubted hardship to a tenant who is himself called upon to pay instalments of principal, and I think it should be in his power at any time to pay up the instalments and become the proprietor of the property. But I think it is questionable whether you ought to extend that benefit so as to enable this to become a right which he can leave to his representatives. It does not seem unfair at first sight that a man should be able to leave this to his representatives, but I think in all the circumstances of the case it is perhaps better that the tenant's right should be limited to himself.</membercontribution></p>

<title>DACOITY IN INDIA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01314"><member>LORD WYNFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope the noble Viscount the Leader of the House will, in the absence of the noble Earl the Secretary of State for India, be able to answer the Question which stands in my name on the Paper&#x2014;namely, whether it is a fact that on April 1 last, in the High Court at Calcutta, before the Chief Justice, 18 men who pleaded guilty to the charges of being members of a gang of dacoits, and of having committed a series of dacolties in the district of Khulna, were released on the suggestion of the Advocate-General, acting under instructions from the Government, and suffered no further penalty than being bound over to keep the peace; and, if so, what were the reasons for this decision, which has caused profound uneasiness in Bengal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01315"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the subject which the noble Lord has raised is one of some importance and interest. The facts are that on December 10, 1910, sixteen men were I committed by a magistrate in the Khulna I district in Bengal to take their trial before a special tribunal of the Calcutta High Court, under Section 400 of the Penal Code, on a charge of belonging to a gang of persons associated for the purpose of habitually o committing dacoity. The case was one of great complexity; the evidence was extremely voluminous, the proceedings in the lower Court, in which the parties were not represented by counsel, lasting nearly a month. Two hundred and forty-eight witnesses were examined, and a large number of documents were also examined. They were put in to prove the connection of the accused with six dacoities committed I in the district of Khulna and Jessore and I their association for the purpose of carrying out these dacoities at four places in the district, and at more than eleven places in the City of Calcutta.<lb/>
When these transactions took place I was acting Secretary of State, and therefore I am not dependent merely upon informa-
<col>546</col>
tion supplied for the purpose of answering the noble Lord's Question. After the committal of these 16 men, two others who had absconded were arrested and also committed. The High Court thus had before them 18 persons against whom 268 witnesses were to be brought up by the prosecution, while there was every probability of an equal number being called for the defence. Recent experience has shown that trials of this kind before a special tribunal, set up, as the noble Lord may know, by a special law, are apt to last several months, and there was a prospect of this trial continuing during the whole of the summer&#x2014;a state of things that would have created a very bad impression throughout, the country, where, as anybody may imagine, these trials produce constant and prolonged irritation. The result, moreover, would in any case have been uncertain, as the evidence of many of the witnesses had been given in the lower Court with extreme reluctance, and the issue depended to a large extent on the testimony of approvers, which is always of very doubtful value. When the case came before the High Court a <i>nolle prosequi</i> was entered by the Advocate-General in regard to one of the accused, who was thus acquitted, and the remaining seventeen pleaded "Guilty" Thereupon the Advocate-General, acting on the instructions of the Government, submitted to the Court that as the accused had been in custody for eight months, and had practically admitted their guilt, their release might be ordered as an act of clemency on the part of the Crown, on the condition that the accused would enter into recognizances to appear to receive sentence when called upon&#x2014;not merely, as I think the noble Lord's Question rather suggests, to keep the peace, but to come up for sentence when called upon. The youths who were thus provisionally released left the Court shouting "Long live the King Emperor," and on their return to their villages they were sent for with their friends and relations by an eminent Hindu gentleman, who gave them a severe lecture on loyalty and the necessity of turning over a new leaf, and it is believed that the people of their district will keep an eye on them and that the end of this transaction will be all that could be desired.<lb/>
I can only say, further, that in a case of a similar kind, that of the Howrah gang,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0278"/>
<col>547</col>
which was heard a little time before&#x2014;I mention this because the noble Lord may not be aware of it&#x2014;I was in constant correspondence with the Viceroy during the whole of that transaction, and I am in. strong agreement with him; and the complete failure of the Howrah gang ease is ample justification for the action taken in regard to the Khulna gang case. That is to say, there was a large number of prisoners, and all except a few&#x2014;two or three, I think&#x2014;were eventually acquitted by the High Court. The trial was long, there was great publicity and a good deal of irritation, but really there was no substantial advantage gained, and no case for punishment was believed to have been made out in the case of the majority of the accused. I hope that the noble Lord will believe that the Viceroy, Lord Hardinge, examined all these particulars himself, in concert with the Government of Bengal, and so far as I can understand it, at the time following the matter very carefully, the proceedings were thoroughly justified.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01316"><member>LORD WYNFORD</member><membercontribution>: I trust that I shall not be out of order in referring to the answer of the noble Viscount, and in asking for information on one further point. I had hoped that it would have been brought out in the reply. From what I have gathered and also from the answer just given by the noble Viscount, I am inclined to think that there was some sort of pre-arranged agreement&#x2014;I might almost call it collusion&#x2014;between the Executive and the Chief Justice previous to the prisoners pleading "Guilty." What I should like to ask the noble Viscount is whether he can assure me that in this case there was no such pre-arranged agreement; that there was no agreement that these prisoners should be released on condition that they pleaded guilty, because if there was such an agreement it surely forms a very dangerous precedent in the administration of the law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01317"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: I understand that a very eminent and entirely unsuspected lawyer did make a communication to these men. The whole of the transaction, including that, was entirely approved when it transpired, not only by the Viceroy himself but by the whole of his Council. That ought, I think, to convince the noble Lord that there
<col>548</col>
was nothing very sinister or perilous by way of precedent in what took place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01318"><member>LORD WYNFORD</member><membercontribution>: Surely it is very irregular for this sort of arrangement to be made before the trial actually took place. As I understand&#x2014;and the noble Viscount has not contradicted me&#x2014;there was some arrangement whereby these prisoners were actually promised release provided they pleaded guilty. May I ask the noble Viscount whether that was the case?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01319"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Lord is not satisfied with what I have said I think he had better put another Question on the Paper. This seems to me to be out of order.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MOROCCO.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01320"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member> rose to ask the Lord President of the Council whether he could lay on the Table copies of Treaties or extracts from Treaties embodying "our Treaty obligations to France" I in connection with Morocco.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01321">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am afraid, from what I understand, that my noble friend will not grant the Return which I am endeavouring to obtain from him. If the noble Viscount has arrived at an adverse decision perhaps he will allow me to make, just one or two observations to explain why he should reconsider that decision. I am told that it would be difficult to make this Return, in fact that it could not be made. The desire is that there should be laid before Parliament copies of Treaties or extracts from Treaties embodying our Treaty obligations to France in connection with Morocco. It is said they are difficult to extract. I have examined what appears to be the main part of our Treaty obligations, and it appears to me that it would be easy to give the Treaty between France and ourselves which was concluded when the noble Marquess opposite was Foreign Secretary. Only four clauses are concerned&#x2014;the second, fourth, seventh, and ninth; they are very simple clauses and could easily be put into a compact form. It is said that the Algerciras Act considerably affects those obligations, and that it is a voluminous document; but I do not think it has been established, or, at least, it is very doubtful, that there are any Treaty
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0279"/>
<col>549</col>
obligations in it towards Fiance involving us. But it is not of a very difficult character.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01322">I submit that it is not difficult to put before the country or Parliament in a simple form the Treaty obligations which are referred to. Indeed, a subsequent statement has been made which contradicts the one as to difficulty. It is said, "Oh, you can do it yourself. Any private person can get any of the documents, and can easily make the extracts." Then again, it is said that it has been done by the newspapers. The newspapers do perform a very useful public function when they give extracts from public documents so as to convey to the public their simple essence, but they do so on their own authority, and the extracts do not carry with them the authority which a Government communication would command. The great utility of such a Return as the one for which I ask would be that it would tend to the education of the public as to the character of our Treaty obligations with France in connection with Morocco, and the authority of a communication so put forward would be such as to conclude differences which might arise in similar documents in newspapers. We may be told that the differences arising out of the question of Morocco are, perhaps, passing away. There is great hope that they will be settled. I hope so too. But there is no reason to apprehend that the publication of this Paper would cause any delay in settling the questions which may have arisen and which may be under discussion by the respective Governments&#x2014;on the contrary, it may facilitate the settling of those questions. I press upon the noble Viscount the expediency of considering the granting of the request which I make to him.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01323"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY OF BLACKBURN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the concluding observation of my noble, friend takes us on to what is rather at the time, delicate ground, and I am sure he will excuse me if I do not touch that part of the question. It would be highly inconvenient, or might be. The answer to the Question on the Paper is this&#x2014;The Treaty obligations referred to are those contained in the Anglo-French Declaration of 1904, which was presented to Parliament in a very slender Blue
<col>550</col>
Book in the Treaty Series No. 6, 1905. This country is also, as my noble friend is perfectly well aware, one of the signatories to the General Act of the International Conference at Algeciras relating to the affairs of Morocco. The obligations under that Act are shared by all the other signatory Powers. The Act has just been laid before Parliament in the Treaty Series No. 4, 1907. If any member of this I House or any member of the public is interested, as he may well be, in the terms of our obligations to France, and the terms of our obligations under the Algeciras Act, along with the other signatory Powers, I think it is really very little trouble for him to turn over the pages of these two Blue Books&#x2014;barely Blue Books, and one of them of the most slender character. I would also point out that the clauses relating to our obligations to France concerning Morocco are rather involved, and a selection of them would not be so perfectly simple a transaction as my noble friend appears to think. He is quite right when he says that the public Press has already&#x2014;I have one before me now&#x2014;produced a sort of <i>pr&#x00E9;cis</i> of the effect of these two instruments, perfectly adequate&#x2014;a couple of columns intelligible to the plain man in the street. I hardly see I what is to be gained by governmental publication, and I may perhaps point out to my noble friend that, though I doubt if anything could be gained, the deliberate publication of selected extracts from these two important instruments at this moment might be open to a dubious and perhaps injurious construction. What may happen by-and-by I do not know, but I am afraid, for the present at all events, I must beg to be excused for not complying with my noble friend's wishes.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PUBLIC HEALTH (IRELAND) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01343" align="center">[SECOND READING].</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01344">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01345"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Lord Shaftesbury, in whose name this Bill stands and who is on duty at Holyrood Palace, has asked me to take charge of the Bill in his absence, and in moving the Second Reading I will explain its provisions in as few words as possible. It is a Bill to further amend the Public Health Acts relating to Ireland, and its object is to enable urban district-councils in Ireland, in addition to their existing powers, to make by-laws for the inspection of all meat intended to be sold within their district and also prohibiting the sale of meat within their district for human consumption except after inspection in accordance with the by-laws. The Bill consists of two clauses only, and is agreed to by all the Irish Members&#x2014;Unionists, Nationalists, and O'Brienites&#x2014;in the House of Commons.<lb/>
The urban district councils are the sanitary authorities in Ireland. Various Public Health Acts have been passed between the years 1878 and 1907 giving wide powers to those bodies, and the object of this Bill is to amplify those powers. The Bill allows urban district councils to control the smaller class of slaughter-houses, which are not conducted as they should be and require inspection. Some urban district councils have erected public slaughter-houses, and if this Bill becomes law it is felt that butchers will most likely use the public slaughter-houses. They have not done so hitherto, and the urban district councils in some cases have almost decided to give up the public slaughter-houses. As showing how useful public slaughter-houses are, I may mention that in Scotland 88 per cent. of the total urban population are provided with home-killed meat from slaughter-houses which are under public control.<lb/>
We are fighting tuberculosis in Ireland to the best of our ability, and we think it is our duty to see that properly slaughtered meat is provided for the people. Though if this Bill becomes law and meat is inspected at private slaughter-houses it may have the effect, as I have said, that butchers will use the public slaughter-
<col>554</col>
houses, it does not follow that urban district councils will prevent private slaughter-houses from being used. The district councils have to make by-laws under this Bill and those by-laws would have to go before the Local Government Board, and we have every confidence in Ireland that no by-law would be allowed by the Board which prevented a private slaughter-house from being used unless some public reason could be shown to justify the action of the urban district council in asking for such a by-law. It is not, as I have said, the object of this Bill to do away with private slaughterhouses, but to have them inspected and also the meat that is butchered in them. I only mention that because exception was taken to the Bill on this ground in the House of Commons. I have answered that point in the same way as it was answered in the other House, the answer there being regarded as perfectly satisfactory and the Bill being allowed to go through without amendment. I may add that twenty-one district councils have passed a Resolution in favour of the Bill I and asking the Chief Secretary to support it. I hope that in these circumstances your Lordships will grant the Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<title>LAND TRANSFER.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01349"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to ask my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack the Question of which I have given notice&#x2014;namely, whether he can give the House any information as to the steps which His Majesty's Government have in contemplation for utilising the labours of the Royal Commission on the Land Transfer Acts, and whether their recommendations for the improvement of the Land Registry will be carried out with a view to the extension of the system.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01350"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad this question has been put. The country is under a great debt of gratitude to the members of the Royal Commission who investigated this most intricate and, to laymen, unattractive subject. Their Report is of great value. I have already practically got into shape a Bill for the purpose of giving, in substance, effect to their recommendations, and I hope to submit it to my colleagues with a view to obtaining their approbation and having the question brought before Parliament as soon as possible. I think the noble and learned Earl desires that I should say, as I desire to say, a little in regard to the subject in general and the reasons which led to the appointment of the Royal Commission. Although comparatively few people take an interest in it, the subject is one of very great importance for many reasons. The present condition of the law in England as regards titles to landed property and the methods of transferring landed property, except where provision exists for the registration of title&#x2014;namely, in the County of London&#x2014;is really a scandal, and is almost unique for its obscurity and its cost.<lb/>
When a man wants to buy a piece of land, no matter how small, he must, personally or through his solicitor and at his own risk and expense, procure and examine all deeds, mortgages, and documents of that kind extending over a long period, ascertain dispositions by wills and settlements, and whether there has been payment or non-payment of duties, and so forth, so as to be practically safe in paying money for the purchase of land; and it does sometimes occur that after having done all that he finds himself still with a defective title. Further than that, often the purchaser's right to inves-
<col>556</col>
tigate a title is limited to twenty or thirty years by the condition of the sale, which still leaves a good deal of investigation to be done and does not give complete security. Besides it is found to lead to the costly employment of solicitors, and the costly reinvestigation of title on every transfer of land, whether mortgage, sale, or lease, on which money has to be laid out. Sometimes, of course, the investigation can be dispensed with, and sometimes the full solicitors' charges are not charged. These are the legal conditions of transfer of property in England, and I say it is almost a scandal to civilisation. It is impossible to say with precision what this system costs those who are interested in land, but it has been estimated by a very high authority that, quite apart from stamps, duties, or Government charges, the solicitor's costs and charges out of pocket for these transfers of landed property amount to &#x00A3;4,000,000 sterling a year, and I believe that this is within the mark. The people who suffer from this are primarily the landowners, and also the purchasers of land. It is a clog upon landed property, and falls especially hard on poor people who like to buy their houses or small pieces of land. It has, therefore, a direct bearing on the policy of both Parties in the State, who wish to encourage the acquisition of land by larger numbers of occupying owners.<lb/>
There are, moreover, dangers under the present system&#x2014;the loss of deeds, which may involve the loss of proofs of right to property; frauds by duplication of deeds, or forgery; and concealment of deeds so as to hide defects of title. Fraud and concealment can be prevented to a large extent, at all events, by the registration of deeds, but we have registration of deeds only in two counties in England; and registration of deeds would have little or no effect upon all the other evils to which I have adverted. One may well ask how it is that this absurdity has lasted so long. The reasons, I think, are the extreme complexity and technical character of this subject, so that public opinion cannot be intelligently brought to bear upon it; the enormous strength of the vested interests concerned in the maintenance of the present system; and the aversion to learning a new system and dislike of innovation which are fortunately or unfortunately characteristic of the legal profession.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0283"/>
<col>557</col>
For these evils there is not the least doubt a remedy could be provided. It is possible for the Government to set up a register all over England under which the actual ownership or right to possession can be recorded, together with all other rights attaching to the land, and the Government can offer to any purchaser a guarantee of the title which he acquires, so that either he will get the property with a good title or will be repaid the money which he has given on the faith of getting a good title. A system of this kind has been for a long time in force in Australia and in New Zealand, in which the same laws prevail as in this country, and also in the whole of Central Europe under different laws. After the first registration the expense of such a system is very small. When a purchaser acquires property under a registered title, as I say he can pay his money with absolute safety because the guarantee of the State is behind it. This has already been partially accomplished in a very small degree in England. I am not going to give your Lordships the history of the efforts that have been made in this direction. They began in 1857, and Lord Westbury, Lord Hatherley, Lord Selborne, Lord Cairns, and Lord Herschell have all taken part in the endeavour to pass Registration of Titles Bills and some of them have passed instalments in that direction.<lb/>
But the principal mover, the most-successful legislator, on this subject has been the noble and learned Earl, Lord Halsbury. The noble Earl began his efforts in 1887, and continued them down to 1897; and I am happy to think that in my position in the House of Commons during all that time I did my best to support and assist the passage of the proposals of the noble and learned Earl. In 1897 the noble Earl passed the Bill which is now applicable to the County of London, the effect of which was to institute registration of title compulsorily upon any transfer of land within the County of London and in any other county where the county council desired it. I am sorry to say that from the date of the passing of that Act the most strenuous resistance has been offered to it by the majority of the legal profession, principally supported by the Incorporated Law Society. The subject is one which laymen cannot understand without much study. No single county except London has asked
<col>558</col>
for this Act to be applied. I do not suggest for a moment that there has been any unworthy action or unworthy motive, but the solicitors who have to advise the county councils have almost invariably advised against an extension of the system. The result is that the clause requiring the consent of the county councils has killed the prospect of an extension of this most beneficial system.<lb/>
There is a regular literature upon the subject, making every kind of groundless objection to the system in the noble and learned Earl's Act, and there are constant efforts to prejudice it in the public mind. I may say, for example, that I have quite lately received from some of the borough councils in London a number of resolutions condemning the existence of the system of the registration of title in London and asking that it should be undone. If I thought that the members of the borough councils in London had studied the meaning of registration of title or familiarised themselves with the Act, I should, of course, pay attention to what they urged; but it is a great misfortune that important public bodies should be induced, without any inquiry, to commit themselves to opposition to a system which has been supported by so many very high authorities.<lb/>
These criticisms, misleading to the ignorant public, were so rife that it was thought desirable to appoint a Royal Commission for the purpose of considering the subject. I do not say for a moment that the system established under the Act of 1897 is not susceptible of improvement. The noble and learned Earl himself would, no doubt, be the first to admit that. He carried the Act in the face of great difficulty, and if the noble Earl's intentions had been observed a great deal of the difficulty, such as it is, that has arisen in the working of that Act would not have arisen at all. But the obstacles that were placed in the way&#x2014;I need not specify them as they are too technical to be appreciated&#x2014;by the limitations of the Act have given rise to some difficulties, and those difficulties have been considered by the Royal Commission. The Royal Commission was appointed at the request, I may say, of the Incorporated Law Society, doubtless in the hope that it would condemn the registration of title. On the contrary, my Lords, the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0284"/>
<col>559</col>
Report, which has now been published, approves the principle of registration of title, and it recommends the gradual extension of compulsory registration of title after sufficient experience has been obtained of its working, and under some amendments in technical and practical details. I hope that the result of these labours will not be thrown away, or that the Recommendations will be allowed to remain as a dead letter. I hope that I shall be able to present a Bill carrying them into effect in substance, and I hope it may also be found practicable&#x2014;although at present I cannot put this beyond an aspiration&#x2014;to reduce the expense to landowners in the initial stage of registration where alone the expense is complained of. Whether that will be done or not, the House will allow me to express my own personal and pious aspiration. I shall certainly do my best to suggest to my colleagues some such method if it is practicable.<lb/>
I have very little further to say, beyond this. I should like to appeal to laymen on all sides of politics who do not understand the details of this subject to recall one or two facts. Every man who has held the Great Seal during the last fifty or sixty years has been in favour of this system of registration of title. The only Lord Chancellor of whom no record remains as to his opinion is Lord Chelmsford, but there is no reason whatever to suppose that he was opposed to it. Every other Lord Chancellor since the time of Lord Westbury, and including Lord Westbury, has told the House and the country that this is practicable, and has endeavoured actively to further it. I think that this fact might well be considered by those who are invited by interested opposition to believe that what is practicable in Australia and New Zealand is impracticable in England under the same law. The present system is, to my mind, an oppressive tax on landed property&#x2014;as I have said, the solicitors' costs and charges for England alone amount to about &#x00A3;4,000,000 a year, whereas the Government stamps on dealings in land, which are often complained of, only amount to &#x00A3;1,000,000&#x2014;it is a hindrance in the development of land and of its acquisition by small people; it depresses the value of land by making it less disposable; and I hope we shall be accorded some measure of public support in doing our best to overcome the inveterate prepossessions of professional men.</membercontribution></p>
<col>560</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01351"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this subject is almost too technical to ask your Lordships' attention upon it at any length. But there is one proposition which everybody will understand and which is very simple in itself&#x2014;namely, whether when a title has been once examined and found to be a good title there should not be some finality about it. The great vice of the system hitherto is that there is no finality about it at all. On every change of ownership, on everything that necessitates an investigation of title, the whole thing has to be done over again, and the result is that the expense incurred is enormous.<lb/>
I do not suggest unworthy or improper motives on the part of the solicitors in respect of the fees they charge. If you make a thing a necessity to be done, you cannot complain that people who have to do it should charge for what they do. No doubt there are some charges which it is quite reasonable for solicitors to make. I remember receiving in the course of my investigations, a very serious complaint from an old lady, who complained bitterly of her solicitors' charges. Her complaint was not in respect of the extent of the particular charge so much as that the charge had been made at all. She said "I took the solicitor over my land and pointed out to him everything that was mine. I gave him all the information, and then he charged me for it." Whether she thought that this ought to have been its own reward and that it was a delightful occupation to walk over land with herself as principal witness in this way I do not know, but she was perfectly sincere in believing that it was a most unreasonable and improper thing for the solicitor to charge her, as she put it, for her own information. Of course, I have no sympathy with unreasonable objections of this sort. But can any one say that it is a reasonable thing that after a title had been investigated possibly over sixty years and found to be good the whole thing should be gone over again whenever the owner desired to sell or to alter his ownership for some reason, and that every marriage which had taken place in the time and every dealing with the property of any sort or kind should be gone into once more to see whether the title had been affected. It is obvious that some system by which you should arrive at a final determination whether or not such and
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0285"/>
<col>561</col>
such a title is good is what we ought to look for. I believe some such system is absolutely essential, and I entirely concur with what the Lord Chancellor has said about the scandal of allowing the present system to continue.<lb/>
I am afraid I must concur also with my noble and learned friend that there has been an unreasonable obstruction of the operation of the Act of 1897. I am not at all certain that I should not add something perhaps to what my noble and learned friend said, and say that I think that to some extent there has been an unreasonable charge of fees, owing to the effort on the part of those who are entrusted with the administration of this work that it should be self-supporting and that there should not be any application to the State. The Treasury, of course, are bound to look after the interests of the State; but I am afraid one of the difficulties has been that there has been an occasional overcharge in respect of large property. I do not think that in the case of smaller properties there has been any overcharge. That matter has been very fairly considered; but with regard to large properties, where it was thought, I suppose, that it was not unreasonable to charge a large fee, there has, I think, been some exaggeration in the amount charged. But whether that be so or not, and whether or not it is a desirable thing for the State to intervene and pay for this, there can be no doubt about the propriety of some such institution as has been established in the Land Registry. The acquisition of land for small holdings is a thing now greatly desired by both political Parties, and nothing could check that movement more than the cumbersomeness and cost of the present system. I am quite sure that under the guidance of my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack the system will be improved in pursuance of some of the recommendations of the Royal Commission, and I hope he will succeed in the end in crowning our labours, after a very, long struggle, by establishing a simpler and less expensive system.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01352"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to say a word or two in this discussion, having spent a good deal of my life in the practical dealing with this subject. I think the House is to be congratulated that my noble and learned friend on the
<col>562</col>
Woolsack and the noble and learned Earl opposite are agreed upon a great principle and in the feeling that the time has come when that principle may be brought into operation. There is a class, no doubt, who dislike change and have obstructed the attempt to bring it about. On the other hand, there are many eminent legal practitioners who have given the matter careful consideration and while most desirous to do the best in the public interest are greatly impressed by the difficulties surrounding the subject. What is easy in New Zealand and in Australia is difficult in an old country like this, where, to begin with, land is much more valuable and minute boundaries are very important and it is difficult to ascertain them with exactness. In the second place, the interests associated with land in England are so complicated, ranging from settlements to leases, that the problem of land transfer is a different problem, in degree at all events, from what it is in other places. The Royal Commission over which the noble Viscount opposite presided has done a great deal to clear up the difficulties, and, I hope, to map out a simple course for the future; but I should not like it to go forth that the only source of the difficulties met with in this case has been a desire to hinder and obstruct change. As I have said, there are many legal practitioners who have taken the deepest interest in this question and who have given their time and labour with a view to bringing about improvements in the system.<lb/>
I have known noble Lords in this House to take their title deeds to the Land Registry, and after a short interview the able officials of the Land Registry have investigated the title and given either a possessory or absolute title and the thing was done very easily. But every one has not the time or the inclination to do that, and consequently they employ a solicitor. The result is two bills of cost. That has tended, I think, to occasion a certain amount of criticism and misunderstanding about the system. I have no doubt that in course of time these things will be got right, but it is not altogether the simple matter that it appears at the outset. The Royal Commission have done a good deal to grapple with the problem, and I am glad to think that the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack will in a Bill get rid of some of the difficulties.
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0286"/>
<col>563</col>
I only rose for the purpose of pointing out that there has been a good deal of legitimate criticism about the first fruits of the new system. It is not easy to apply a new system to anything so complicated as English land rights, and there has naturally been a certain amount of disappointment. But I do not think that one should class all the criticism under one head, but should rather welcome the labours of those who may have been very critical, but who, by the evidence they have given and by the work they have put into it, have done a good deal to smooth the path of the reformer in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01353"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I had the honour to be Chairman of the Royal Commission which considered this subject, I may thank the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack for the reference he made to our labours, but I should like to say that if the Commission has had any success it is really due to the never-failing attention which was paid to the subject by the five legal gentlemen, four barristers and one solicitor&#x2014;gentlemen of the highest experience and standing in their profession&#x2014;who sat on the Commission and devoted the greatest thought to the whole matter. We were successful in arriving at a unanimous Report on this very complicated subject, and I sincerely hope that it may have assisted the noble and learned Lord in the Bill which I am glad to hear he proposes to introduce.<lb/>
I sympathise with what the noble and learned Viscount who has just sat down said. There has been, no doubt, unreasonable opposition on the part of solicitors, who feared interference with their professional work. They did not like the State stepping in as between them and their clients, and I suppose there has been dislike of a new system of land transfer to which they were not accustomed. But there have been other difficulties inherent in the nature of landed property itself. You cannot expect that under any conceivable system of registry of title land can be passed from hand to hand as simply as shares or stocks are transferred. That, I think, will be perfectly clear to anybody who has had to look into the subject. As it is, the certificates of title which have hitherto been given have often had such a complicated appearance that it was ex-
<col>564</col>
tremely difficult for a layman to understand them. This, however, I hope will be remedied in the future.<lb/>
There is another difficulty&#x2014;the question of cost. It must be remembered that most corporations or individuals who buy land in England do not buy it in order to sell. They buy it in order to hold, and probably at the time they have no expectation whatever that they will ever be called upon to part with it. Therefore if to the necessary expense of purchase you add fees for something which to them appears useless because they are satisfied with the title to the property which their solicitors advise them to take, they naturally rather shrink from registration. Then, again, there are many persons holding properties which have descended to them perhaps through successions of hundreds of years who know that they have a good holding title, at any rate, but who do not want their titles investigated by a public authority which they think may discover some kind of flaw in the title which they have never heard of themselves. There have been difficulties of this kind in the way of registration of title, not entirely, I think, due to the opposition of solicitors, which have to be considered in dealing with the subject.<lb/>
I have spoken of the expense. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack had to deal with this matter under new rules as to fees which he established in 1908, and he very wisely, if I may say so, lowered the fees on applications for absolute title. The great defect of the system hitherto has been that, as a rule, absolute title has not been given, only possessory title; and that is merely a certificate of the fact of a certain person being in possession at a particular moment, and does not clear the title before the date of registration at all, so that with every fresh transaction after the grant of possessory title it may be necessary to go into the whole history of the matter before the registration of the possessory title. What is wanted in this matter, as my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury has said, is finality. You want an absolute title which shall be indefeasible. If you give that you are giving something to a landowner which is worth having; but if you give him anything less, you cannot blame him if he does not care to pay for it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0287"/>
<col>565</col>
In the fee rules in 1908, to which I have referred, I think it was a misfortune that the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack increased the charges in the case of properties over &#x00A3;1,000 in value. He was obliged to do it, I suppose, because the law provides that the receipts from fees for registration shall pay the cost of the office. We have made certain recommendations upon that subject which the noble and learned Lord, I suppose, was not authorised to say much about to-day, but which, to my mind, are of the greatest importance in dealing with this matter. I suppose the justification of compulsory registration of title is that it is for the benefit of the community as a whole. There is no reason why you should compel a landowner to register merely for his own benefit. You want to establish registration of title in order that the purchase and sale of property may be cheap and easy, and that therefore the owners of property may be multiplied in the country. You ought, therefore, to be careful how you burden the existing owners of property with excessive fees, or even high fees, for registration of title. One thing was done in this matter which to my mind cannot be defended. When the Registry Office building in Lincoln's Inn Fields was put up some twelve years ago it cost, I think, &#x00A3;55,000 to build, but the land on which it stood cost &#x00A3;150,000; yet it has been provided that the whole of that sum of &#x00A3;205,000 shall be paid out of the receipts of the Registry Office in forty years. County councils which buy land for the purpose of small holdings are allowed to pay off the loan in eighty years, and it is perfectly clear that the provision to which I have referred was not fair upon the existing working of the Registry Office. I hope that may be remedied.<lb/>
I hope also that something may be done by the Government to utilise their new system of valuation of landed property, adopted under the Finance Act of 1910, so as to work it in with the registration of title. That is done in Germany, with the result that the fees charged to landowners for the registration of title are very small indeed. I commend that suggestion to the noble and learned Lord and his colleagues, because I am convinced that if a real attempt is made to work upon those lines you will go a long way towards getting rid of the present objection of
<col>566</col>
landowners to register their properties. And if the present system is amended in various points&#x2014;which I need not go into now because they are dealt with in our Report&#x2014;I cannot help thinking that it will be found to work so much more easily that even the solicitors themselves may be induced to look upon it as an advantage to their profession. It surely must be clear that if owing to the adoption of a good system of registry titles can be made really secure, and all dealings in land simplified, transactions will be encouraged, so that where a solicitor now has merely to carry through one case he may have to carry through half-a-dozen cases in the future, and by the multiplicity of transactions he may actually increase the receipts of his profession. I apologise for having detained your Lordships at such length, but as I devoted two years and a half to the investigation of this subject perhaps I may be excused.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01354"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: My Lords I quite agree that whatever difficulties have arisen have not been solely due to the resistance and opposition of solicitors, and I hope that they will assist in this reform. I must observe, however, in regard to what was said by the noble Viscount who has just sat down as to possessory title, that in the rules of 1908 I authorised the registrar to offer free of expense an absolute title where only a possessory title was asked for, and I am sorry to say that in a good many cases, notwithstanding that the offer of an absolute title was made without any charge, the solicitors concerned would not for their clients accept an absolute title with the benefit of State guarantee. I will now say a word about expense. I agree that this is a very important question. I cannot promise anything with regard to that, but the noble Viscount made a very fertile suggestion. It was this, that registration of title might be worked simultaneously with, and as part of, the system of valuation. In Germany registration of title, survey, and valuation of land are all worked together. I will certainly make the suggestion to those who are responsible for the finance of this country. I am quite sure that if they can they will endeavour to advance any good system of this kind; but I can say no more than that I will with great pleasure make the suggestion in the proper quarter. Indeed, I have already been considering it, although
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0288"/>
<col>567</col>
only from the legal point of view. I am very much obliged to the noble Viscount for what he has said, and I hope that his labours and those of his colleagues on the Royal Commission will prove to be of value to the country. In that case I am sure the noble Viscount will feel himself repaid for his great labour and trouble.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PARLIAMENT BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01404">Order of the day for the Third Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01405"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I suppose no important Government Bill before ever came to the stage of the Third Reading under more singular and remarkable circumstances. I am respectfully inviting your Lordships to give a Third Reading to the Parliament Bill which has been so changed&#x2014;I am not saying rightly or wrongly&#x2014;in its course through the Committee stage that it is our Bill, of course, no longer. And yet enough of our Bill survives, after all these operations in Committee, to excite the mortal dislike of noble Lords opposite, and to excite, also, a similar dislike among our small minority who sit behind me. That constitutes a very remarkable state of things.<lb/>
The Bill that is now before us is not the Bill that was submitted to the judgment of the country. It is not the Bill that was passed by a great majority in the House of Commons. It is not the Bill to which your Lordships were good enough to give a Second Reading without a Division. It is this transformed Bill which, in spite of all these mortal aversions on one side and the other, will, I hope and believe to-night receive the Third Reading, because, though it is so disliked in both its forms, we are all alive, on both sides, and must o be alive, to what would follow its rejection here to-night&#x2014;namely, a tremendous dislocation of Parliamentary business, great exasperation of Parliamentary and political opinion and temper, and the necessity of immediately setting to work, once more, to tread the same thankless and wearisome journey all over again.<lb/>
I will now try to tell your Lordships what the Bill, as it now stands, really is. It need not be a very long description. On November 23 last year the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition propounded and explained to the House a broad and comprehensive scheme of which he said&#x2014;
<quote>"It is the best substitute that we can find for the scheme provided in the Government Bill."</quote>
It was thus formally set forth as the official Opposition alternative to the Government policy; and it was perfectly
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0291"/>
<col>573</col>
well understood that in case the elections, then approaching, turned in favour of noble Lords opposite and they were to cross the floor of this House, they would be bound, and would willingly accept the obligation, to present and pass through this House a Bill modelled on the Resolution which the noble Marquess then proposed. What happened? Did the electors favour the policy of the Parliament Bill, or the policy of the noble Marquess set out in the comprehensive framework to which I have referred? I do not believe that any noble Lord who follows me in this debate will, for an instant, say that there was a majority in favour of the alternative policy and against the policy of the Parliament Bill. That being so, I think we had a right reasonably to expect that noble Lords opposite would follow the precedent which they had themselves set and prescribed, in terms, in the case of the memorable rejection of the Budget of 1909. What was the Motion on that occasion? It was that this House would not be justified in giving assent to the Finance Bill until it was submitted to the judgment of the country. I am not offering any remark upon that proceeding. But then, when the judgment of the country was ascertained, this House, in conformity to its sagacious traditions, set by many eminent Conservative leaders, accepted the verdict of the country as final and the Budget was passed.<lb/>
Now see what has happened here. You have had the same, sort of circumstances. There was an alternative scheme propounded by the noble Marquess to the Parliament Bill of the Government. The electors rejected the alternative scheme and accepted the Parliament Bill. And now, instead of following the precedent of January, 1910, and accepting the Parliament Bill which the country ratified, you have boldly taken that Bill out of our hands. That is what has been done by some, at all events, of your Amendments. I should have supposed, from the precedents of great Conservative leaders, that if noble Lords opposite found, at a critical moment, that they were bound to accept some change which was unpalatable and unwelcome to them, they would at least have said they would make as little change as they could and not as much change as they could. The present leaders of the Conservative Party have taken exactly the opposite line. Instead of making as little change as they could, in the cir-cumstances
<col>574</col>
cumstances produced by what they themselves had done in 1909 and 1910, they have made, not as little change as they could at a critical moment, but as much change as they could. During the French Revolution, if I may refer for a second to that, somebody said, "Why, in six years we have lived six centuries." I think anybody who looks at the position of things, say, 20 months ago, may exclaim "We have lived through the changes and proposals of change of 20 years." The noble Marquess said truly that the proposal of the Bill which has been read a second time would deal a death-blow to this House as it now exists. Well, I do not think it would be an exaggeration to say that the effect of one or two of the Amendments made in the Bill in the course of its going through Committee, while not a death-blow to the House of Commons&#x2014;that is a difficult House to kill&#x2014;would impair the authority, prestige, and powers of the House of Commons, And this change is made on a Bill which everybody understood&#x2014;I am sure I thought noble Lords opposite understood as thoroughly as we did&#x2014;was meant so to adjust the relations between the two Houses that the House of Commons should have its powers unimpaired, made clear and definite, and that your Lordships' power should be limited and also made definite.<lb/>
Now, broadly, what does the change amount to? The Bill that your Lordships read a second time retained the old practice and privileges of the House of Commons in regard to Money Bills, with the added abandonment of the right of rejecting Money Bills which your Lordships had practically conceded. But to-day the Bill takes away from the House of Commons the power of deciding what is and is not a Money Bill, and transfers that power from the House of Commons&#x2014;a power which it possesses now&#x2014;to a new tribunal. Under the second clause the Bill provided that if a Bill passed the House of Commons three times and was three times rejected in this House over a period of two years, that Bill became law in spite of its rejection by your Lordships' House. But now the Bill to which we are going, I hope, to give a Third Heading excludes from the operation of that clause a certain number of measures and insists upon their being passed away from Parliament by way of Referendum. That is an enormous change. The Government and the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0292"/>
<col>575</col>
supporters of the Bill hold by the principle of national opinion working through Parliamentary machinery. But you introduce a great innovating principle with most innovating machinery. You say that certain questions are only to be dealt with under the protection of safeguards, differing from such protection as is provided in ordinary legislation. I rather think subjects were mentioned by the noble Marquess in November, such as Tariff Reform, compulsory service, disestablishment of the Church&#x2014;of course, Home Rule, and, for all I know, other matters. Those were taken out of the operation of the Bill which was read a second time. But that is not all. In fact, that is less important than what I am now going to mention.<lb/>
The proposals in the Bill now set up a small tribunal&#x2014;Parliamentary, it is true&#x2014;which is to decide in each case whether a given Bill which has been read three times in the House of Commons, and rejected three times here, is a measure to call for special treatment. This Joint Committee, to decide whether a given measure is so great, so serious in its gravity, and moreover so little understood by the electors that there will be no assurance that they know what they are about and that they had studied the measure&#x2014;it is that tribunal which is to supersede the Ministers of the Crown, to oust tie Ministers of the Crown, to override and supersede and put away the House of Commons. It is to have the right of calling a Referendum into existence in reference to a given Bill. It has the right of doing what your Lordships no longer claim, in terms at all events&#x2014;the right of causing a Dissolution. Because, say what you will of a Referendum, I think most of us who have studied the working of a Referendum will agree that we shall be saved none of the troubles, expense, and turmoil of an election. This tribunal is not to consider what the House of Commons thinks, it is not to consider what the Ministers think, but it has to decide on any question referred; their decision in any question referred to them shall be final, and their conclusion for all purposes shall not be questioned in a Court of law.<lb/>
I saw that some writer in the Press looked upon that proposal as being as bad as the Venetian Council of Ten. I wish I knew more of the Venetian Council of
<col>576</col>
Ten than I do, but I am perfectly sure that to compare it with this tribunal which the noble Marquess is erecting is not entire nonsense. But, though it is not the Council of Ten, it is a most remarkable new organ and instrument of government to introduce into our old system here. I do not feel sure that in all the speeches that we heard from that Bench even those noble Lords who made those speeches had fully realised what an extraordinary piece of machinery this is. I put this to you with all respect and with no desire to say anything that would irritate anyone. Say what ill you please of the Parliament Bill, nobody will pretend that the change from an absolute to a suspensory Veto, which is the change proposed by the Parliament Bill&#x2014;and where there has been, let us mark, a large and sweeping opportunity for the full play both of Parliamentary and of general public opinion upon a given measure&#x2014;nobody will pretend that that change is comparable in its magnitude, in its risks, and in its I possible dangers to the death-blow, if I may so call it, which the noble Marquess's proposals would be to the prestige, the authority, and the responsibilities of the House of Commons.<lb/>
I suppose we have all asked ourselves very often during the last 20 months what the country probably expected&#x2014;what sort of steps towards a settlement the country probably expected. Roughly my own impression is that a great many expected that this House would accept the Parliament Bill. They did not look forward&#x2014;in my view; it may be wrong&#x2014;to all these tremendous operations of reconstruction. They certainly did not look forward in a serious and expectant frame of mind to a broad supersession of our Parliamentary system by a Referendum. What do they expect now? I dare say they are at this moment somewhat bewildered. I should think, if you asked the ordinary steady voter&#x2014;and I really do not much care on which side&#x2014;what he would think a fair way out of the present difficulties, he would say, "Well you had better try the Parliament Bill. It will be worked under a most vigilant supervision; it will be worked under hostile and unfriendly eyes; but try it." That is my rough-and-ready expectation of what I believe to exist in the mind of the ordinary and what I call steady voter.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0293"/>
<col>577</col>
It is true, if you like, that the consequences of the Parliament Bill may be grave, and they will be grave [Opposition cheers] but they are intended to b grave; but nobody with the shadow of a sense of responsibility can hide from himself, looking not merely at what may happen to-night but later, and later even than that&#x2014;later even than next week&#x2014;nobody with a sense of responsibility can hide from himself that the consequences of the rejection of this measure will be in themselves far more grave, be they what they may, than any consequences that I can imagine following from it&#x2014;grave, though I admit those consequences may possibly be. What I would desire would be that this inevitable Parliamentary and political operation should be carried through without anything like a social shock&#x2014;I do not mean a superficial shock, but a real and wide-reaching social shock.<lb/>
I have been exposed, and the Government have been exposed to a stereotyped kind of reproach that we have shown an obstinate and stubborn refusal to make any compromise. That is the ordinary view among noble Lords opposite, but let us look at it for a single moment. I put it in a very concrete shape indeed. Suppose a conference took place between leading men, responsible men, on the two sides. It is no doubt conceivable that the Ministerial negotiators might go a certain way towards meeting the views and appeasing the fears and apprehensions of noble Lords opposite in the harmless and comparatively secondary changes that have been made and proposed in the Bill as distinguished from others. Your Lordships are very angry with us for not conceding, but I have seen no sort of sign of any tiling like concessions from the noble Lords who sit; on the opposite Benches. It is unreasonable, you think, that we should be obdurate, but it is perfectly natural and in accordance with the fitness of things that the noble Marquess should be unyielding. I do not believe that the country would take that view at all; but, to be quite frank, I do not expect&#x2014;and I am sorry for it&#x2014;that if there were such a transaction as I am pointing to, the noble Marquess and his colleagues would throw overboard his excepted list, his proposal of the Joint Committee settling the matters of great gravity, and of the truly extraordinary powers given to the Joint Committee. But if you are going to talk of conces-
<col>578</col>
sions, if you are going to reproach us for not compromising, perhaps the noble Marquess will indicate to us where there might be a concession&#x2014;if not, at all events he might hold out the chance. Every rational politician would desire that the two political Parties should travel together, at any rate as far as ever they can, along I this very difficult and stony road; but this new transformed Bill, to which I hope the House will give a Third Reading to-night, interposes, I fear, a fatal barricade.<lb/>
I will not go over any of the ground again that has been well discussed in Committee. I can only say that those discussions in Committee struck me as fair and in excellent temper on both side, but it was a serious discussion directed, as I am bound to think and I regret to think, to most unfortunate ends. Surely all the turmoil and mischief, whatever else you may say of it, that followed the rejection of the Finance Bill in 1909 warns noble Lords opposite of the tremendous fallacy, the horrid fallacy, of supposing that because you believe you have a right, therefore it must be patriotic statesmanship to assert and exercise that right. History swarms with examples of the disaster and ruin that have followed that fallacy. I wish they would allow me to suggest, that they should put in gold letters over the room where the noble Marquess and his friends assemble the well known quotation&#x2014;"Things are what they are, and their consequences will be what they will be. Why, then, should we deceive ourselves? "I humbly and respectfully commend that piece of wisdom to the attention of noble Lords opposite.<lb/>
What you want in this crisis is not heroics and it is not logic. We are not afraid of either. We are capable, I dare I say of taking heroic action, and we will do the best we can to defend our action by logic; but this is not a case for noble Lords or people outside to say our right is so and so, and we are bound to vindicate it. In a phrase that fell the other day from the lips of the most rev. Primate in his supplications he asked for a renewal of the "Spirit of wisdom and government." That is what is wanted now amongst us all, and not logic and not heroics. I will only say this further&#x2014;to pass this Bill to-night and to allow the real Bill to pass by-and-by is not surrender to the

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01406">Moved, That the Bill be now read 3<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Morley.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01407"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is sometimes said that it is not a bad thing to see oneself as others see us, but I think we may well be rather slow to see ourselves on this side of the House exactly as the noble Viscount who has just sat down sees us. He has given an account of our dealings with this Bill which I can only describe as something like a parody of the proposals which we have made and as a violent exaggeration of the effects which those proposals are calculated to produce. What the noble Viscount in effect suggested to the House was that your Lordships, having decided to read this Bill a second time, had proceeded afterwards to transform&#x2014;I think that was the expression he used&#x2014;and to convert it into a Bill which was "our Bill" no longer. I am prepared to maintain that our treatment of the Bill has on the contrary been scrupulously correct and Constitutional, and I should like in the few words which I propose to address to the House to make my statement good with regard to each of the different stages through which the measure has passed since it came to this House.<lb/>
Your Lordships gave a Second Reading to this Bill, profoundly though most of you disliked it, for I conceive two reasons. We were all, or nearly all, of us committed to the view that some readjustment of the relations between the two Houses had become inevitable, and we were, therefore, ready to discuss any proposal which His Majesty's Ministers might desire to urge upon us for that purpose. Apart from that, I think, the noble Viscount is entirely warranted when he claims that we could not do otherwise than have regard to the fact that this Bill was before the country on the occasion of the election in December, 1910. We have, of course, never admitted that the Bill had been fully explained and discussed at that time, nor, again, do we admit that the verdict of the electorate was an entirely conclusive verdict with regard to everything that the Bill contained, because we know&#x2014;we have had it very recently admitted by noble Lords opposite&#x2014;that this Bill was by
<col>580</col>
no means the only matter before the electorate and that the election, according to their statement, turned also upon the question of Home Rule and upon other questions.<lb/>
I understand, however, that in the view of the noble Viscount the fact of our having given the Bill a Second Reading carried with it the obligation to pass the Bill through I the Committee stage virtually unaltered. I take it that he would have allowed us to correct a few inelegancies of drafting or anything of that kind, but so far as the main provisions of the Bill are concerned it is quite clear that he disputes altogether our right to deal with the Bill. We on the contrary maintain that it was our Constitutional right, our duty, to go through the Bill and to revise it, and to send it down to the House of Commons with such alterations as seem to us essential in order to remove its worst defects. We discharged ' that duty to the best of our abilities, quite unaided by anything that was done on the Benches opposite, and encountering an attitude of uncompromising resistance which, I must say, seemed to most of us wholly at variance with the expectations held out to us as to the manner in which the measure would be treated.<lb/>
Well, my Lords, is it the case, as the noble, Viscount has told us, that the Bill in its present form is virtually unrecognisable and, something wholly different from the Bill as it left the House of Commons? There are virtually two clauses only&#x2014;two clauses of primary importance&#x2014;in this Bill. There is the clause dealing with the rights of the House of Commons over finance, and there is the clause dealing with the rights of this House in regard to general legislation. It was over the claim of the House of Commons to deal with finance that this great controversy first arose. The noble Viscount very properly traced it back to the reservation of the Budget of 1909 by your Lordships. Now we have in effect conceded the principle of the first clause. Upon that clause, even with our Amendments, is writ large the supremacy of the House of Commons in matters of finance. We do not challenge it. We have, it is true, ventured to suggest a change in the words defining a Money Bill. What does our suggestion mean? We have suggested an alteration in the language of the Bill taken from the mouth of the Prime Minister himself, from a passage which we have again and again
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0295"/>
<col>581</col>
quoted, and which noble Lords opposite have entirely failed to explain away. The noble Viscount said just now that there had been no yielding on our part at any point. I think he is mistaken. Throughout the discussion of these Amendments we endeavoured, whenever our proposals Were taken exception to, to recast them in a shape which would remove those objections and meet the views of noble Lords opposite. This was conspicuously the case in regard to the Amendment of my noble friend Lord Cromer, which was completely recast in deference to what was said by the noble Viscount and others in reference to it. And let me say that if you have further criticism to offer we are even now ready to consider whether the language of that Amendment might not yet further be improved. Then we have left the Speaker in the clause in spite of the overwhelming arguments that were brought forward on this side of the House against imposing these new duties upon that distinguished official. I am sure the House has not forgotten the weighty observations of Lord Peel upon that subject. In spite of that, the Speaker remains in the clause, and all that we have done is to give him the assistance of a carefully-constituted Committee of high authority, of complete impartiality, to relieve him, who is, after all, an official of the House of Commons, from the responsibility of discharging single-handed this new and onerous duty of arbitrating between the two Houses of Parliament. Is there, then, in our treatment of the first clause, anything deserving of the description given by the noble Viscount? Yet I find the noble Viscount describing our changes in that clause as involving a death-blow to the prestige and the authority of the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01408"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: I did not mean to apply that to the Money Bill clause only, but to the whole operation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01409"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: At any rate, so far as the first clause is concerned, I hope the noble Viscount will not press his observation that anything that we have done can be legitimately interpreted as a death-blow to the prestige and authority of the House of Commons. We desire to take nothing from the House of Commons. We desire to assume nothing for ourselves except such powers over finance as we ought to possess, as we do possess, and as the Prime Minister himself admits we ought to possess.<lb/>
<col>582</col>
I pass to Clause 2. Our position with regard to Clause 2 is a somewhat different one. In the region of finance the members of this House are always regarded, and perhaps naturally, as being trespassers. Any interest that we take in financial questions, any desire that we evince to interfere in financial matters, is always resented as an encroachment upon the sphere of the House of Commons. But in the case of Clause 2 no such question arises. We are not dealing with finance at all. We are dealing with general legislation of which this House is every whit as much seized as the of her House of Parliament. The Constitutional powers which you are going to take away from this House under this clause are powers which have been exercised, which have been admitted to be Constitutional powers, and which, after all, are the solitary safeguard which the people of this country have against ill-considered and hasty legislation, pressed forward by an impetuous Minister, with an equally impetuous House of Commons at his back. This clause strips us, in regard to general legislation, of everything except the meagre opportunities afforded to us by a delay of two years. And yet that clause, in spite of; the noble Viscount's complaints, remains in the Bill, and that clause, despite anything we have done, will operate over by far the greater part of the whole area of general legislation.<lb/>
Now what are the reservations which your Lordships have asked permission to make? We suggest that legislation dealing with the Crown and the Protestant Succession should be dealt with exceptionally, and should not be undertaken without a reference to the people of this country. Is that a very serious encroachment? The noble Viscount told us, when he was dealing with this matter the other day, that in his view it was inconceivable that there should ever be a House of Commons less loyal to the Crown and the Protestant Succession than the present House of Commons&#x2014;I am not sure that he did not say than this House. Then if, as a measure of precaution, we press for this change, can the noble Viscount seriously contend that we are very materially altering the scope of the Government Bill?<lb/>
What is our second reservation? It is directed to prevent the present Government from tampering with the Union until the people of this country have had an
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0296"/>
<col>583</col>
opportunity of expressing their views upon the subject. The country has twice expressed its views in a very unambiguous manner. The noble Viscount, I think it was&#x2014;though it may have been one of his colleagues&#x2014;said the other day, "Oh, but the question of Home Rule is now looked upon in a very different light by the people of this country." Perhaps it is. All I can say is, if the people of this country have changed their minds give them an opportunity of telling you so. At any rate, do not, when this immense question comes up for decision for the third time, cheat the people of this country of the opportunities that they have had on former occasions of telling you whether they desire the change or not.<lb/>
I come to our third reservation, the reservation of capital questions in regard to which there is reason to believe that the opinion of the country has not been adequately ascertained. So far as I can make out, this proposal filled the mind of the noble Viscount with especial horror. To hear him speak, one would have thought that under our clause this House was claiming for itself the right of disposing of these reserved matters. It cannot be said too often that this House makes no claim of the kind. All that our clause contains is a proposal that if the Government of the day, or if either House of Parliament, or if the Speaker of the House of Commons has reason to believe that, in a grave case, the judgment of the people has not been ascertained, the Committee which we propose to set up should have the opportunity of investigating the matter, and, only if it is satisfied, of sending the issue for judgment, by a Referendum of the people. It is not this House which would decide. It is not the House of Commons which would decide. It is not the Speaker. It is the people of the country who, if there is a doubt, will have the last word in regard to such matters as these. Our proposal, expressed in a single sentence, comes really to this, that we desire that the Government of the day should not be able to do behind the back of the people what they could not do if it was done in the face of the people. That is all that this tribunal, which tills the mind of the noble Viscount with alarm is able to secure, and in our view, if the time has come for curtailing, as you propose to curtail, the rights and opportunities of this House, it is inevitable that as a safeguard you should introduce into your measure some precaution of this kind.<lb/>
<col>584</col>
Are these, then, such very unreasonable reservations? Do they deserve all the hard things that have been said of them by the noble Viscount? I should like to remind the noble Viscount that in the important Divisions which have taken place during the Committee stage of the Bill he has only found about thirty of his independent supporters to go into the Lobby with him in regard to these matters. Out of a total minority of forty-eight, I think between fifteen and twenty were official members of the Government, and I may say in passing that it will interest us extremely&#x2014;I do not know whether there is likely to be a Division to-night&#x2014;to see whether the noble Viscount's appeal, which we all noticed with a certain amount of sympathy, is responded to by his friends.<lb/>
Now we come to the Third Reading. I have heard not very well supported rumours of proposals for putting an end to the existence of the Bill at this stage. I can scarcely credit them. It seems to me that, having passed the Second Reading of the Bill, and having spent, as we did, a considerable amount of time in amending it, to interrupt our course at this stage and to put an end to the measure by rejecting it on the Third Reading would be a step which would render this House almost ridiculous in the eyes of the people of the country. The noble Viscount made, I thought, a somewhat singular suggestion to me in regard to our Amendments. He said very naturally that they varied in importance, and he asked. Cannot the noble Marquess indicate to us to-night whether he is prepared to make any concessions, and what kind of concessions those might be? A more extraordinary suggestion. I suppose, never has made. Surely, whatever opportunities there may be afterwards, and the noble Viscount knows better than I do whether there will be such opportunities, for considering whether any of these proposals of ours should be pressed or not for me or for any one else, on the occasion of the Third Reading, to announce that we were ready to throw overboard any part of the changes which we, have deliberately introduced into the Bill would be, to say the least of it, a very unusual Parliamentary man&#x0152;uvre. But I am quite ready to say one thing to the noble Viscount, and that is that in our view some, at all events, of the Amendments which we have introduced into the Bill are so essential that we should
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0297"/>
<col>585</col>
certainly not be prepared to recede from them in substance so long as we remain free agents. But we are ready to pursue this controversy upon Constitutional lines, and in that conciliatory spirit which the noble Viscount invited just now.<lb/>
May I be permitted in that spirit of conciliation to ask the Government to consider for a moment what is really the situation with regard to this group of Constitutional problems, of which we are discussing after all only a fragment this evening. The ultimate goal which you have in view on that side of the House, and which we have in view on this side, is a reasonable reconstitution of the House of Lords. And may I be permitted once again to remind noble Lords opposite that we have shown that we are in earnest in this matter by the introduction of the Bill to which the noble Viscount referred in his speech&#x2014;a contribution to the solution of the problem which seems to us, at any rate, very much more substantial and useful than the only contribution which, so far as I am aware, His Majesty's Government have made. I mean the meagre and nebulous reference to House of Lords reform which is to be found in the Preamble of the Parliament Bill. The noble Viscount will recollect that he himself described our Bill as a helpful contribution to the consideration of the subject. Then there is the question of the reform of procedure as between the two Houses. That matter has been constantly referred to during the course of these discussions, and we are all perfectly well aware that there are suggestions, useful suggestions, that have found favour on both sides of the House, suggestions for resort to conferences between the two Houses, for joint sittings, and finally for the Referendurn. The noble Viscount described the Referendum a moment ago as involving the broad supersession of the Parliamentary system, quite forgetting that the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, and many of the noble Viscount's colleagues, are perfectly prepared to accept the Referendum in special cases as a useful adjunct to the Parliamentary system.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01410"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Not to introduce it into the Constitution, but to allow it to be used in a special Act of Parliament dealing with a particular subject.

<col>586</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01411"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Surely the difference is only one of degree. I admit that the noble and learned Lord's dose of Referendum is a very homeopathic one, but what we care about is the principle of the Referendum, and whether it be employed in the manner suggested by the noble and learned Lord or in a more liberal manner is a question which may very well be discussed.<lb/>
Then finally, we have this Bill upon the Table upon which for the time you are concentrating your attention, wrongly we think, because we are persuaded that you should have begun at the other end and not begun where you actually have. But even with regard to this Bill, dangerous and bad as we think it, we have beyond all question gone a long way to meet you. If it is possible to slate these things in the shape of a fraction, I should have said we have gone five-sixths of the way to meet you under our proposals embodied in this Bill. At any rate we are convinced and shall remain convinced, that this Bill will leave this House in a shape in which it will or certainly ought sufficiently to serve your purpose, and in that shape we send the Bill down to the House of Commons, asking for it&#x2014;I do not know whether we shall ask successfully&#x2014;that it may be treated in accordance with the ordinary decencies of Parliamentary warfare. My Lords, we believe, that you have ready to your hand all the materials for an honourable settlement, and, therefore, it seems to us almost inconceivable that His Majesty's Government should prefer to resort to other methods, methods which have been condemned by statesmen of both great political Parties, and which seem detestable in the eyes of all right thinking men.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01412"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I ask leave to interpose a few words on this very grave occasion. It is proverbially difficult for those who are themselves engaged in important affairs to estimate aright the true proportion of the events in which they are taking part, but after making all allowance for that, I venture to believe that the next few days may loom large in the history of England. The historian who 100 years hence recounts what took place in the opening year of the reign of George V may have to regard these days as being among the most momentous in their issues of any which the Constitutional
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0298"/>
<col>587</col>
historian has to record. If that be so, it is eminently desirable that we who are making history should be sure that the country understands, if not in full detail, yet as clearly as may be, what are the actual points at issue, and where the fight is now being joined in these strenuous days by protagonists in the affairs of State.<lb/>
It may seem a strange and presumptuous assertion to make, but I make bold to say that the average elector up and down the country does not to-day realise with any approach to truth what are actually the points at variance. We have had in this House nine or ten days of high debate&#x2014;the noble Viscount who leads the House has referred in laudatory terms to the spirit and tone of those debates&#x2014;and on every day we have had, at the least, some speeches of great power, permanent interest and solid argument, but they have been very little before the minds of the people at large. Those who in the House of Commons or in the country outside follow our proceedings in a few of the great newspapers are, no doubt, privy to what has been happening, and have shown their interest in many ways; but I am persuaded that that is not the case with regard to the mass of the people outside that range. Our discussions have been weighty and important&#x2014;I can say it without affectation as I have taken no practical part in them&#x2014;but they have been very little noticed by people generally. It would be out of place to go now into the causes. Certainly I am not blaming journalists as such, for though it has other and higher functions, a newspaper is in the main a business concern, and gives its readers what its readers want. I have had the curiosity to turn up the files of the last few weeks of the newspapers on either side of polities that circulate most widely among the less leisured, the less literary, the less studious portion of the public. I looked specially to see what account was given of three speeches, those of Lord Courtney, Lord Peel, and Lord Weardale. None of those speeches were of the Party kind, which can be more or less taken for granted on such occasions. Each of them dealt carefully with the practical difficulties which might arise under the Parliament Bill as drawn up by the Government. I was prepared to find them reported briefly, but I was not prepared to find only a few lines given to such
<col>588</col>
speeches, while the descriptive accounts of the debate were such as to make one doubt whether the writers had really been present at all. I believe the outside apathy and listlessness at a great juncture in our history is in part due to the unfamiliarity of average men in an old Constitutional country with the study of Constitutional problems. They have been under the impression that these things, so to speak, take care of themselves, that they do not practically concern the individual in his daily life, or at all events that they do not press upon him or call for his immediate attention or consideration. I venture to think that before we are very many years older there will be a different view taken by the average elector about Constitutional questions. I think this unfamiliarity with the subject explains in part the apparent apathy with which a good many of these discussions have been received.<lb/>
That apathy is also partly due to the fact that the average elector is satisfied with the belief that the issue was decided at the last election, and that the question of victory or defeat upon the large principle which underlies this Bill was settled then. Ask the average voter in the tram-car or in the railway train and he will say that it is going to be decided in a week or two whether a House whose members sit simply by hereditary right is to be allowed to prevail over the elected representatives of the people, and is going to maintain its power to reject Budgets. Not only will you find such an opinion on the lips of the average man, but in the leading articles of the evening papers to-night you will probably find, though in more guarded or clouded language, the same sort of account given of what is happening. Now notice that that is simply a total misapprehension of the facts. The real fact is absolutely and entirely different, as the noble Marquess who has just spoken has made quite clear. Notwithstanding what Lord Morley said, it is certain that the big issue on which the opinion of the country was taken is no longer at stake. On those larger questions the House of Lords has, rightly or wrongly, fallen in with the views of the House of Commons, and has accepted what was, as I at least am ready to maintain, the verdict at the last General Election.<lb/>
The point now at issue is a different one. You can only get at it by comparing
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0299"/>
<col>589</col>
the Bill as it was introduced with the Bill as it is now. We have already been reminded by the leaders on either side of what from their point of view the differences are. I should myself put it that the Bill is altered by in the first place an attempt to make more explicit what is a Money Bill, and to prevent that indirect tacking to which reference was made in the House of Commons and here, the Speaker being helped by a Committee in deciding such questions. In the next place the Amendments enact that on certain great Constitutional questions the House of Commons shall not be able, until the country has been consulted, to overrule the reiterated objection of a reformed House of Lords, the appeal to the country being by the Referendum. The next is that the House of Commons shall similarly be restrained from independent or single-Chamber legislation on certain other issues of great gravity on which the opinion of the country has not been definitely ascertained. It is then provided that the advice or decision as to the need of submitting a matter to the country shall rest with a Joint Committee to be appointed in such a way as best to ensure impartiality.<lb/>
I have tried to express in a cold-blooded manner and as fairly as I can the changes which this House has suggested in the Bill. If that is a fair account of the Amendments, the issue now before Parliament is&#x2014;Can these changes in any form be accepted by those who are responsible for the original Bill? I do not argue at all whether they are good or bad proposals, but it does seem to me to be an unfair use of language to speak of these changes as "wrecking Amendments." The main principles of the Bill are untouched. There are suggested safeguards, suggested checks in the working out of these large principles. If the cheeks go too far, suggest modifications and let us hear how far in the way of check or curtailment of absolute one-Chamber freedom you are prepared to go. For example, in regard to the Joint Committee, the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, has said two or three times during these debates that he welcomed suggestions from any quarter as to how a Committee can be so constructed as to ensure impartiality. That is surely a moderate mode of suggestion, and to describe it as a wrecking Amendment would seem to, me to be a straining of words. Similarly, with regard to the Referendum,
<col>590</col>
there are many possible ways of varying the manner in which it is here suggested that the opinion of the country should be taken, and we have yet to learn that friendly suggestions would not be welcomed as to some better way of ascertaining the opinion of the people on questions on which they have not yet been adequately consulted.<lb/>
The debate throughout has been in one sense hampered and in another sense helped by constant references to Home Rule, and to the question whether or not the country was consulted about it. That was inevitable, because the Home Rule question is the chief object-lesson of difficulty raised by such a Bill as this. Home Rule may be right; it may be true to say that it would now be supported by former opponents, and many voters may have realised in December that Home Rule was involved in the Parliament Bill. Still, I seem to have recollections of phrases about the bogey of Home Rule, of the red herring of Home Rule, and so on, and the Government reminded us repeatedly that the real question before the country was the Parliament Bill and the powers of the House of Lords. Will anybody contend&#x2014;the noble Viscount has not contended&#x2014;that a specific or definite scheme of Home Rule was before the electorate in December? I do not mean a detailed Bill, but a specific and definite scheme in large outline. Obviously the House of Commons cannot beforehand submit to the country the details of a complex measure, but were even the large principles of the next Home Rule Bill before the country? I understood the noble Viscount to say the other day in reply to Lord Lansdowne, that "We wait to draw up our Bills till the time approaches for laying them on the Table." If it be true that the supporters of the Government and possibly even the Government themselves are absolutely unaware what the large provisions of the Home Rule Bill are, can any one say without an abuse of language that the Home Rule Bill was in its large principles before the country at the last election? We know nothing about retaining the Irish members at Westminster or about the financing of Ireland from England; and upon such questions as these it depends what Home Rule means, so widely apart are the different ways of dealing with the subject. It is surely a strain of language to say that the present House of Commons has authority to deal by itself with the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0300"/>
<col>591</col>
whole matter exactly as it likes without the intervention of this House. But I did not mean to enter on the Home Rule question.<lb/>
My one point is that the differences between Lords and Commons now turn mainly on the mode of safeguarding the working of this Bill from abuse. Nothing in the debates that we have listened to justifies us in doubting that these matters are capable of arrangement if there is good will on both sides. But if across the questions of statesmanship which we have to weigh there conies in the petty question&#x2014;petty in such a context&#x2014;of Party triumph or defeat, disaster must be the outcome whichever way the issue goes. There is always a peril for all of us that in hours of conflict and difficulty our treatment of great questions is unconsciously swayed by considerations which are quite alien to the large problem which is at stake. A master of contemporary thought some time ago read a paper on the way in which personal feelings or prejudices were apt to sway a man at times of great public crisis. He called it a matter of temper, "that weakness or defect which we know by the name of temper, whether irritable or querulous or acrimonious, or despondent and gloomy." The thought comes in, "You are out, we are in, and we mean to use the power of conquerors as we have the right and power to do. We will strain every Constitutional or unconstitutional right rather than spoil our triumph." It is the <i>vae victis</i> of old Rome, the "hands up" of South Africa. Disaster awaits the land or the Government or the Party so led. I feel that more deeply than I can say. Is a great element and factor in our national life to be mishandled in that way, contrary to every high tradition of English Constitutional history and progress? Is it not contrary to every high tradition of English Constitutional history and progress to deal with these things by a mere <i>coup de main?</i><lb/>
It is extraordinarily difficult now to see any waterway into a calm haven. Contrary to the rule of natural science heat in Parliamentary discussion induces hardening, and I imagine there is hardening on either side in more ways than one. Yet even now I dare not myself quite despair. I believe in the power of conference among men of good will. I have been rather surprised to hear so little reference made to the great speech in which Sir Henry Campbell-
<col>592</col>
Bannerman introduced his Resolution on this subject in 1907. If any of your Lordships will refer to that speech you will find frequent reference to the value of repeated conference. If men of responsibility will have courage to resist the thraldom either of Party temper or of a tyrannical group which subordinates the well-being of the country as a whole to the thought of its partisan ends, an outcome which would, if I may use the expression, "save the face" of both sides ought not to be unfindable.<lb/>
I am not in the secrets of either Front Bench, but if rumour, which is very often false, speaks truth for once, a mode of outcome, honourable to both sides and different from that which the Bill suggests, was on the verge of common acceptance among a good many leaders not so very long ago. The opportunity is still yours of shaking off the trammels which have hampered you, and of reaching a solution which shall genuinely effect the great change which the Government desires, and which the country has supported, and yet effect it in a manner which could be accepted, I will not say without dislike or apprehension, but without any sense of humiliation by those who are sitting opposite to the Government to-night. I noted the eloquent words in which the noble Viscount referred to the prayer of which I was allowed to be the mouthpiece in Westminster Abbey a week or two ago, that "the spirit of wisdom and government" might be given to our rulers wisely to govern the Kingdom. If that could yet he done our country would add another to the examples she has given to all lands of her power of settling a great and thorny question with mutual consideration and respect, with high public spirit, and with common sense.</membercontribution></p>

ness"; but on the difference that arose between the two Houses on the repeal of the Paper Duties the Chancellor of the Exchequer decided to introduce for the first time in our history a Budget which contained all the financial calculations and provisions of the year. That was a great innovation, and it ought to have been resisted, though since 1860 it has, I admit, been proceeded with in that form. The effect was that the House of Lords was deprived of any control over the finance of the year, of that control which undoubtedly it possessed by a Statute which I have quoted more than once&#x2014;the Statute of the 25th of Edward I. It was not a musty and unknown Statute, but one which was referred to in the Petition of Rights, where it was expressly recited as one of the Statutes guarding the liberties of the people. Therefore, do not let anybody suppose that it must be taken for granted, because for a long series of years this House did not exercise its power, that therefore we had superseded the Act of Parliament. I say in the presence of my noble and learned friend&#x2014;and I challenge a denial&#x2014;that the disappearance of an Act of Parliament by desuetude is unknown to the English law. Every Act of Parliament has a right to command the obedience of the subjects of this Realm, however old it may be, and the only mode of getting rid of it is to repeal it; and here now the attempt is being made to repeal this Statute.<lb/>
I want to say one word by way of protest, because I do not think we ought to admit, as some of us have admitted, that we have no right to deal with finance. If you refer to ancient practice and are so regardful of it that you will not interfere with it, then I ask, What are you doing now? Is this kind of legislation a showing of reverence for ancient practice? On the other hand, if we are to turn over a new leaf, to begin a new system of government and to have everything at large, what reason is there why Peers should not interfere in questions of finance? The Peers have to pay a good deal. I should like to have a calculation of how much of the Budget is made up of contributions from the Peerage. I snake this protest because I think that we are getting into the habit of taking things too much as a matter of course. I am not going to suggest that there should be any new legislation on the subject, but I absolutely deny that the Peers did any-

thing wrong, or that they were not perfectly within their rights, in what they did in 1909. They would have neglected their duty if they had not done what they did then. They took precautions that the country should be consulted before the extraordinary measures of finance which were then propounded were passed into law. After listening to the most rev. Primate cannot help feeling that your Lordships have an object-lesson of what single-Chamber government would be. We have seen the mode in which the highly-gifted and eloquent Peer before me (Viscount Morley) has treated our Amendments. What may we expect from those who are not so highly gifted and not so moderate as himself?<lb/>
I deprecate one observation of the noble Viscount. What did his language mean? Is it not from beginning to end a threat of what will happen if your Lordships' House does not submit to this Bill&#x2014;of the things that will follow, the terrible disturbances that will arise, and so on? It is veiled in quite decorous and Parliamentary language; but I want to tear that veil aside, and to see what is meant. Does it not mean that your Lordships are to be overwhelmed, with small respect to the Sovereign&#x2014;to whom, in my Parliamentary experience, it was rather indecorous to refer at all&#x2014;and without respect even to this extent, not that he has been consulted or will be consulted, but that it is a foregone conclusion? Some of those newspapers to which the right rev. Primate referred are sufficiently decent not to put it in plain terms, but they use such expressions as "it is surmised," "it is supposed," and so on, so as to conceal the grossness of the contemplated action. But it is suggested that His Majesty has been applied to, and has agreed to make as many Peers as will be necessary to force this Bill through the House. I want to deal plainly in this matter, and I say that that is a gross violation of Parliamentary decency. Everybody knows what has been said, and the allusion is enough; but let us, at all events, consider whether there is not something due to His Majesty, to whom we all profess loyalty.<lb/>
I deeply lament that the principle of heredity has been given up. I am not an ancient and bigoted old Tory who cannot recognise new things, but I think I could quote good authority why the principle should not be given up. Does any noble

Lord remember what Lord John Russell said on this subject? He said&#x2014;
<quote>"If the hereditary privileges of the Peers are overthrown the hereditary prerogatives of the Sovereign will also be sacrificed. 'Do not,' said an accomplished orator in the House of Commons many years ago, 'hang the Crown upon the peg of an exception' The Sovereign does not inherit wisdom any more than the Duke of Norfolk. Let me add what is, perhaps, the most important security of all. The prospect of any great democratic change would shake public credit and bring the nation to its senses; so that. I cannot say I feel any alarm lest events should lead to the abolition of the House of Lords, involving, as no doubt it would, the fall of the Monarchy."</quote>
It may be said that the House of Lords is not to be abolished. It may or may not be so in words, but it would be the same thing. You may not say that this House is abolished, but I should like to know what man, with the spirit of a man in his heart, would consent to sit in an Assembly mocking the actuality of debate when, at the end of it, he is obliged to submit to what the Minister for the time being thinks proper to dictate. I do not believe that any of your Lordships would consent to belong to such an Assembly as that.<lb/>
I will give the noble Viscount a little information. But for the existence of these Amendments which my noble friends have introduced I would myself have moved the rejection of the Bill on the Third Reading; and I can tell the noble Viscount now that unless these Amendments are accepted in substance, in meaning, and in operation I will myself never consent without a Division to the passing of this Bill. I do not believe the people of the country understand what is going on in Parliament. They do not know that the Constitution of the country is in peril. I doubt whether they would believe it if they were told. But the Constitution is in peril. The passing of this Bill un-amended would mean the destruction of the Constitution and threaten the destruction also of the liberties, aye, and the lives of His Majesty's subjects wherever they are. It is the most momentous piece of attempted legislation I have ever known in the course of my long life. I have been in politics more than sixty years, and I have never witnessed such an attempt to abolish the Second Chamber and to obtain supreme power, not so much for the House of Commons&#x2014;for it is idle to pretend that House is independent&#x2014;as for the Minister in power and the political caucus. It is not a question merely of Party division.
<col>596</col>
It is a question of life and death to the Constitution.<lb/>
This Bill is a bad Bill in every sense. It possesses every vice that a Bill could possess. It is unjust and oppressive. It is tainted with Party spirit&#x2014;I had almost said Party spite. One can hardly conceive that men familiar with Constitutional principles should have contrived such a mass of unconstitutional, bitter, and selfish proposals. Are we to submit everything now to the House of Commons in its present condition? Is the House of Commons in its present condition an independent body? Let any man who has views of his own in the House of Commons attempt to express them and see what will happen to him&#x2014;what has happened in our recent experience. I can only say that I regard the present situation as the most momentous that has arisen in the whole of my political life; and if an attempt is made to force this Bill through without the safeguards that my noble friend behind me has provided against injustice and tyranny, especially the tyranny of the political caucus, I should regard myself as a coward and unfit for the position I hold if I submitted to it without challenging a Division. I should certainly vote against the Bill, and in so voting I should believe that I was doing no trifling service and incurring no trifling obligation, but I should regard it as a duty, and a solemn duty, to God and to my country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01414"><member>THE EARL OF DURHAM</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very glad that I do not share all the misgivings of the noble and learned Earl who has just spoken. I am also glad that he has told us he does not intend to-night to force a Division, because in that case it would have been my duty to have supported His Majesty's Government. I am no enemy of the House of Lords even as it at present exists, and I am a strong believer in a Second Chamber. But we have to consider the present situation. It rests with your Lordships and not with His Majesty's Government whether we are to have a political crisis of the most serious and painful kind. In this year of all years I should have thought we would all have tried, if possible, to avoid what would be a national disaster and disgrace and certainly a mockery to our recent loyal declarations.<lb/>
We have to decide now, not what the House of Lords has done in the past or
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0303"/>
<col>597</col>
any question as to its faults or virtues, but whether or not the Parliament Bill shall receive a Third Reading. I think it is absolutely necessary, in the interests of the House of Lords itself, that you should give this Bill a Third Reading. As I have said, I am no enemy of the House of Lords. I should like very much to see your Lordships' House strengthened by some fresh Constitutional measure. But if there is a Division to-night I shall vote for this Bill. I will explain later why I voted the other day against the noble Marquess's Amendments. Some of my noble friends told me they were surprised and shocked at my action. I hope they have recovered from their surpise and are not still suffering from shock. After all, my Lords, this Bill is the result of some five years of somewhat barren conflict between the two political Parties in the State; and I much regret that the House of Lords has forced upon a Liberal Government the necessity of bringing in a Bill to enable them to carry on the business of the country. I cannot blame any Government, a Liberal Government or any other, which says, "We cannot carry on the business of this country unless we are safeguarded from capricious interruption of our work and our duties." They naturally would claim such safeguards. If there were a managing partner in some business who had a junior partner hostile to him, who could at any moment interrupt and stop his operations, would that managing partner long remain in his position? I am afraid he would soon resign; and, my Lords, if you wish the present Government to resign, what Government, I wonder, will you find to take its place? For my part, I am afraid, unhappily, I cannot think of a better one.<lb/>
I would like to refer to the Amendments which the noble Marquess moved and carried in Committee. I hope, in doing so, that I may be allowed to express my admiration of the speech he made on that occasion. In tact, demeanour, courtesy, and dignity it was the best speech I ever heard; and yet the very next day I read in a Radical newspaper that the noble Marquess had uttered "bitter invective" against His Majesty's Government. In a crisis I do not trust newspapers or extremists. I would much rather rely on the commonsense opinion of both Parties in the State. It is for that reason that I hope we shall hear, perhaps not to-night but in the near future, that His Majesty's Government are going
<col>598</col>
to be conciliatory in this matter. The noble Marquess challenged them, and said that so far all the concessions had been offered from the Opposition Benches. I can hardly agree with the noble Marquess there; but I do confess I should be glad to hear that His Majesty's Government can see their way to consider the noble Marquess's Amendments carefully, and perhaps separate portions of those Amendments and state what they could accept and what in their opinion would be fatal to the Bill. The noble Marquess's wishes as regards the Crown and the Protestant Succession must meet with the approval of every loyalist. I can conceive of no objection to them. The Home Rule question, of course, is a different matter. Although I have not the alarm on that subject that some noble Lords feel, I think that when a Home Rule Bill is produced the real difficulties of His Majesty's Government will commence. There are other portions of the noble Marquess's Amendment, however, which I confess I do not like, and that is the reason I voted against it.<lb/>
I quite agree with the noble Viscount in his opposition to the Referendum. I think it is a matter which requires far more consideration by the country than it has received up to the present. I also object to giving to the House of Lords the power of referring some of the Bills to which the noble Marquess referred, and which might seem to be of importance, to the proposed Joint Committee, and, through them, to a Referendum. If you consider the matter impartially it comes to this, that it is to be in the power of noble Lords opposite to make almost any Bill one of paramount importance by offering determined resistance to it. If you absolutely refuse to accept a Bill from a Liberal Government, you might make that Bill in the eyes of the Joint Committee of such importance that they would send it to the country by means of a Referendum. So that it would really be in the power of the opponents of the Liberal Government, under Lord Lansdowne's Amendment, to resist legislation and force an appeal to the country whenever they wished. That I cannot support as a member of the Liberal Party, though by no means a partisan of the present Government. In my opinion this Parliament Bill is not so dangerously revolutionary as some people represent. I certainly cannot regard the noble Viscount in charge of the Bill as a bloodthirsty revolutionist, and I do not
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0304"/>
<col>599</col>
detect, looking upon the noble Lords who support him, that lean and hungry look which betokens dangerous men. I can only hope that this Bill, which is in a measure a temporary one, will not be used bitterly and tyrannically by His Majesty's Government. I cannot conceive that any English Government would be so forgetful of the interests of the country as to put such a Bill into operation in a tyrannical manner. At the same time, no Government with a sense of dignity could consent to conduct the business of the country subject to the approval of the Opposition in the House of Lords.<lb/>
I think, further, that it was a mistake on the part of the noble Marquess and others opposite to analyse the Division List upon the Lansdowne Amendment. Forty-six Liberal Peers voted, of whom I was one. It is quite legitimate criticism to twit the Government with the paucity of their supporters, but you invite retaliation, and I would like to ask the noble Marquess whether he could analyse quite satisfactorily the composition of Ins own supporters. The noble Marquess brought in a scheme for the reconstruction of the House of Lords. It was introduced under what I might call pro-consular patronage, and amongst the provisions in that Bill specially supported by Lord Curzon and Lord Selborne was the proposal that Peers should possess certain qualifications to enable them to sit and vote in this House. As Ministers have been twitted with the composition of their minority on the noble Marquess's Amendment, I should rather like to ask, What of the composition of the majority? Can the noble Marquess go to the country and defend the majority by which he carried his Amendment? He would be obliged to admit that he and other noble Lords on the Front Opposition Bench had declared that most of the noble Lords who constituted that majority were not qualified to sit in a reformed House of Lords. What weight in the country could the names of the noble Lords who supported the noble Marquess have under those conditions? The noble Marquess has given away the whole case by proposing to sweep away many members of the House of Lords in the reformed Second Chamber and by at the same time using the enormous majority of the existing House of Lords to thwart the Government Bill.<lb/>
<col>600</col>
I have no desire to say anything hostile or controversial. My sympathies are far more with noble Lords opposite than with the Government over this Bill. At the same time I do plead for calm consideration of this Bill, and I would ask the noble Marquess to consider before the Bill is sent back to the House of Lords whether it is not possible for him to drop some portion of his Amendment. I do not know whether His Majesty's Government would meet him half-way. That is no affair of mine; I am not in their secrets. I have only risen to-night to ask noble Lords on both sides of the House whether we cannot get through this crisis with as little bitterness and friction as possible. In my opinion it will be a serious misfortune for the House of Lords if the Third Reading of this Bill is not carried now, and also if the Bill is not accepted by your Lordships when it is again sent up by the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01415"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who has just sat down will, I am sure, not contradict me when I say that he and I have been very intimate friends from our earliest days. He mentioned that a good many of his friends had looked askance at his voting in support of His Majesty's Government against the Amendment of my noble friend behind me. No one looked more askance at his so voting than I did. I will tell the noble Earl why. The noble Earl left his Party and joined us in 1886 on the question of Home Rule, and he and I worked together in the County of Durham for the Unionist cause. Therefore I thought my noble friend would at any rate have supported the Amendment of the noble Marquess inasmuch as that Amendment was drawn in order to shield the country from Home Rule. As Home Rule was to my mind the most important part of that Amendment, I withdrew the Amendment that stood in my name, which safeguarded us from Home Rule without au appeal first being made to the country. It is quite possible that my Amendment would not have been in order. I accordingly withdrew it, and I and my noble friends behind me from Ireland devoted our speeches to that part of the noble Marquess's Amendment which dealt with the question of Home Rule; and I do not think any one will contradict me when I say that we who represent Irish Unionists in this House dealt very fully with that question.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0305"/>
<col>601</col>
I made a long speech on the subject myself, in which I asked various questions of His Majesty's Government when portraying the dangers that I thought would ensue if Home Rule were granted. I asked the Government how they proposed to maintain the present prosperity of Ireland when a Home Rule Parliament was established, and no one contradicted me when I said, that Ireland was never more prosperous that it is at the present moment. We have always asserted, and we assert again, that a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland will mean ruin, bankruptcy, and, in all probability, civil war. I pointed that out on the last occasion, and I asked if capital were withdrawn from Ireland how His Majesty's Government proposed to maintain the present prosperity of that country. I hope I shall get an answer to that question. I should like to know who is going to follow me, as it is very difficult to get answers from noble Lords opposite. I have asked the question before but leave been unable to extract any reply. To have this important matter of Home Rule, for which this measure is brought forward, carried through your Lordships' House without any answer to the dangers that I have pointed out is to my mind absolutely without precedent. Do you intend to smash the Constitution at the dictates of Mr. Redmond? You propose to bring ruin and bankruptcy to Ireland, and when we from Ireland bring this matter to your Lordships' attention not a single member on the Front Bench opposite takes the slightest notice of our remarks. We have but one conclusion to draw from that&#x2014;either that noble Lords opposite and the Government cannot dispute our statements, or else they dare not do so for fear of displeasing the noun who makes them toe the line; that is, their real leader Mr. Redmond.<lb/>
Now I wish to say a few words to the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack. He will remember that when he was speaking on the Second Reading of this measure he drew attention to the speech I made on that occasion. From what he said he seemed to consider that I put forward more than anything else the question of Home Rule. The noble and learned Lord then stated that he considered that the antagonism to Home Rule was weakening, and that there was not the same opposition to Home Rule at the present time as there was in the year 1893. I drew attention
<col>602</col>
in the speech I made on the Amendment of my noble friend behind me to that statement of the noble and learned Lord, whose absence from the debate on that day I thought at the time was very remarkable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01416"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I express my great regret to the noble Marquess if I in any way disappointed him by not being present. But on that day I was obliged to devote no less than twelve hours to dealing with an accumulation of arrears of work which demanded my attention and could not be postponed, and I was at work in my room from early in the morning until late at night on that particular day. I need not say that I would leave been only too pleased to have been here had it been possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01417"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: I am sure the noble and learned Lord with his usual courtesy will forgive me for having referred to the matter, and perhaps he will not mind if I address the same remarks to him now as I addressed to noble Lords opposite on that occasion. I pointed out then, and I point out again, that although the antagonism to Home Rule is not quite so apparent now as it was in 1893 owing to a new generation leaving arisen which wants educating with regard to the dangers of Home Rule, there is still a deep-rooted objection to it throughout the country; and if the time ever comes when a Home Rule Bill is introduced into Parliament the Government, notwithstanding their talk of the "Home Rule bogey" and their idea that the opposition to Home Rule is dead, will have the rudest awakening that any Government ever lead. I have recently visited the North of Ireland, and was present at the greatest demonstration I have even seen of any sort or kind. I refer to the demonstration which took place at Belfast on July 12 last. I was present at the great march past in 1886, when Lord Randolph Churchill was a leading spirit in Irish affairs, and I was present at the great march past Mr. Balloter in 1893; but, important as those great gatherings were, they sink into insignificance when compared with the great demonstration of July 12 last. I only wish that your Lordships could have been present, and, more than all, that the members of the House of Commons could leave been there. They would then have realised that, so far from there being apathy with regard to the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0306"/>
<col>603</col>
question of Home Rule, Ulster was up and determined. Ulster has shown by its meetings and the resolutions it has passed that it will not have Home Rule.<lb/>
Let me describe what I saw. I saw in Belfast a gathering of upwards of 200,000 people, and in other parts of Ulster large demonstrations were held varying in numbers up to as many as 30,000 people, and at each of those meetings a resolution was passed calling upon their leaders to adopt all necessary measures for resisting any Home Rule Government that might be forced upon His Majesty's loyal subjects in Ireland, and solemnly assuring their leaders that they would stand by them loyally in any action they might have to take and in any danger they might have to face. My Lords, I have spent a long period of my political life in the North of Ireland, and I can tell your Lordships that those men are neither braggarts nor boasters. They are determined that they will not have Home Rule, and speaking as one who has seen those great demonstrations in Ulster and who knows the feeling of the country there I warn your Lordships that if a Home Rule Parliament is established on College Green the most serious consequences will follow. I remember Lord Randolph Churchill's well-known saying&#x2014;
<quote>"Ulster will fight, and Ulster will be right."</quote>
A truer sentiment was never uttered. Ireland does not possess a more law-abiding subject than myself. When I went to Ireland in the year 1886 as Lord Lieutenant there existed there a condition approaching to anarchy, but in three years, by enforcing the law, we restored order, and it would be the saddest day for me as an Ulsterman if I saw lawlessness again taking place in the province which I love. But if a Home Rule Parliament is established on College Green there will be not only lawlessness and disorder, but bloodshed; and if blood is shed it will be upon the heads of His Majesty's Government. I say that with a full sense of responsibility.<lb/>
I have merely risen to warn His Majesty's Government that if they establish a Parliament on College Green they will ruin Ireland, bring it to bankruptcy, and in all probability create civil war. And why do they propose this? Not because a great many of the supporters of the Government want Home Rule. They were careful to keep Home Rule in the background at the
<col>604</col>
last General Election, and if the Government had had a majority independent of the Irish Party I am confident that we should never have heard of Home Rule at all. But they have to toe the line to Mr. Redmond, and obey his orders. It is because North of Ireland people feel that they would not obey the orders of Mr. Redmond, or of the Nationalist Party, or of a Hibernian Parliament on College Green, that they are determined, if the worst comes to the worst, to fight in order to protect their rights and liberties, civil and religious; and, speaking on behalf of the loyalist Unionist population of Ireland, I beg His Majesty's Government to consider very seriously before they refuse to accept the Amendment of my noble friend behind me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01418"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it certainly is neither my business nor my province to reply to any of the questions that my noble friends behind me have asked His Majesty's Government, and I have no desire to do so. But I might be allowed to remind the House that I, too, have the honour and privilege of corning from Ireland, and with regard to the opinions expressed by my noble friends behind me as to Home Rule I utterly and entirely differ I from them. At the same time&#x2014;it may sound paradoxical&#x2014;I sincerely hope, though I am afraid the hope does not rest upon very solid ground, that the Bill will find its way on to the Statute Book substantially in the amended condition in which it is in your Lordships' House now. I confess I was astonished to hear the noble Viscount opposite, in moving the Third Reading, describe the Bill as having been so completely changed as to be practically a different Bill and not the Government Bill at all. Surely, my Lords, His Majesty's Government have got the Bill in its entirety? There have been additions made to which they take objection, but they have the Bill without anything subtracted from it. They have it absolutely in its entirety, and, amended as it is, it satisfies, as far as I can see, all the demands His Majesty's Government have made and all the requirements of the case.<lb/>
This Bill, as we all know, is a temporary measure&#x2014;an expedient to enable His Majesty's Government to carry on the business of the country. What are the alleged difficulties that the Government have had to contend with? If I may put it in this way, What are the counts of the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0307"/>
<col>605</col>
indictment against this House? Apart from all the rubbish that was put forward at the last two General Elections, the two real counts were that this House had invaded the privilege of the House of Commons, by referring the Budget to the people, and that this House, being so largely Conservative, consistently refused to pass Liberal legislation. Surely as regards Money Bills His Majesty's Government have got in the Bill as now amended all they ask for? This House relinquishes all power to deal with Money Bills. That is what His Majesty's Government desired, and what His Majesty's Government have now got. It is perfectly true that the Opposition have said that some safeguard must be introduced against tacking direct and indirect, and that some authority must be set up to decide whether or not a Bill is a <i>bona fide</i> Money Bill, and His Majesty's Government agree to that. The two Parties are absolutely in accord as to the necessity of setting up some authority to decide that question. The only difference, therefore, lies in this&#x2014;there is a difference of opinion as to how that authority should be constituted. His Majesty's Government propose that the Speaker of the House of Commons, an official whose duty, I might say whose primary duty, it is to uphold the privilege of the House of Commons, should be the arbiter in a case of dispute between the two Houses on a matter of privilege. The Opposition propose a Joint Committee. The noble Viscount opposite denounced that Committee as a complete innovation. Bat is it not equally totally new to impose on the Speaker of the House of Commons the duty, not of giving his opinion as to a matter affecting the privileges of the House of Commons, but of giving a final judicial judgment as to whether a certain action on the part of this House is an infringement of the privileges of the House of Commons? It is noble Lords opposite who are guilty, if anybody is guilty, of innovations, and they surely must not complain if in order to make sonic of them as innocuous as possible an innovation, such as the constitution of this Committee, is proposed on this side of the House. I do not press that matter. My point is that it is absolutely unthinkable that a great crisis, with all the consequences that may ensue, should be forced on the country upon such a comparatively trivial matter as the exact constitution of the authority which is to decide what is and what is not a Money Bill. His Majesty's Government have really got all for which
<col>606</col>
they asked, for as regards Money Bills this House relinquishes its rights.<lb/>
Now as to the other count of the indictment&#x2014;that this House invariably rejects Liberal legislation, and that His Majesty's Ministers, having during their somewhat long wanderings in the wilderness accumulated a great mass of legislative proposals, do not find that they have a fair and reasonable opportunity of placing them upon the Statute Book. I submit the Government cannot make good their case. It would require the fingers of many hands to count the Radical measures passed. Half the fingers of one hand would suffice to count the Radical Bills rejected. But let that pass. Assume the complaint to be justifiable. Have you not got all you want in that respect also? You complain of this House rejecting your measures. Under the Bill as amended this House can no longer reject your measures. You can pass over the heads of this House every Bill of yours that this House has ever rejected, and any new Bill on any and every subject without the assent of this House, and I cannot conceive what His Majesty's Government require more than the absolute satisfaction of the demands that they themselves have made. They complain of the operation of the Veto of this louse. This House has, temporarily at any rate, put aside the Veto. It is perfectly true that the Amendment of the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, reserves certain matters for the judgment of the people. What are those matters? They are questions connected with the Crown and the Protestant Succession. You can pass measures affecting the Crown and the Protestant Succession if you want to over the heads of this House, but the Amendment says that you shall not pass them without the consent of the people. I need not argue that point except to say this, that the only reason His Majesty's Government have adduced or can adduce against that part of the Amendment is that it is impossible to suppose that this Ministry or any Ministry would wish to interfere with the Crown or the Protestant Succession. I dare say that is so; but at the same time this House cannot in a matter of this gravity consider personal characteristics of Ministers. It is impossible to imagine that His Majesty's Government will really seriously object to that part of the Amendment which reserves to the judgment of the people
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0308"/>
<col>607</col>
any question relating to the Monarchy or the Protestant Succession.<lb/>
The other questions which are reserved to the people are the setting up of Statutory Parliaments in the United Kingdom with legislative functions. Under this Bill as it stands amended you could pass any Home Rule Bill for England, Ireland, Scotland, or Wales, and set up any body you please with whatever administrative functions you please over the heads of this House and without consulting the people, and all that the Amendment of the noble Marquess says is that if you desire to set up Statutory Parliaments with legislative functions the opinion of the people must be asked. I cannot understand what real objection His Majesty's Government can have to that part of the Amendment either. The House will understand that there is no question of the merits or demerits of Home Rule involved. My noble friend Lord Londonderry did go into the demerits of Home Rule and its possible effects. I do not propose to follow him, because that is not the question before the House, further than to say this. I disagree with every word my noble friends from Ireland said on the subject in Committee. With the facts staring them in the face I cannot understand how they can argue that Ireland has prospered under the Union, or that the administration of Ireland is, economically or in any other respect, satisfactory. Nor can I conceive how any man can be blind to the fact that the root of all the troubles besetting us lies in the impossibility of Parliament dealing with all the business that comes before it; and that in devolution the only possible cure for congestion is to be found. I would beg the House to remember also that there is no question involved as to the rights and powers that this House ought to have to ultimately reject a Home Rule Bill. The whole question around which really the trouble is centred and out of which the quarrel arises is the very simple question whether so great an organic change as would be involved in setting up a Parliament in Dublin with legislative and administrative functions ought or ought not to be submitted to the judgment of the people. His Majesty's Government, as I understand, say it is not necessary, because the people of the country knew perfectly well that Home Rule formed part of the general programme of the Govern-
<col>608</col>
ment and that having been returned to power at two General Elections they clearly have a right to deal with the Home Rule question in any way they please. But, my Lords, what kind of Home Rule? Home Rule is a most indefinite and elastic term. It may mean anything and it may mean almost nothing. Only noble Lords opposite have the slightest idea of what they mean by Home Rule. If a Bill had been debated in Parliament and was therefore before the country, or if definite Resolutions on which a Bill was to be founded had been before the country, I could understand there being sonic strength in the arguments of noble Lords opposite that the result of the last two elections gave them practically a mandate to carry Home Rule. But there is not an elector in the country who has the faintest idea of what you mean by Home Rule; and surely to say that because you have been returned to power after two General Elections&#x2014;in which about a dozen questions were involved, and in which, as we all know perfectly well, the electors swallowed some half-dozen questions they did not like at all in order to get the other half-dozen which they earnestly desired, and which elections every one must admit turned principally on the Constitutional question and the relations between the two Houses&#x2014;you have therefore a right to bring in and pass without consulting the people any measure of Home Rule of any sort or kind you like, is pushing the theory of representative government almost to an absurdity.<lb/>
Then as to the Referendum. I wish the Referendum did form a part of our Constitutional outfit. As a matter of fact the Referendum has only been referred to to meet the requirements of this temporary Bill. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack does not object to a Referendum if introduced in a Bill for a defined specific purpose. I wish he would bring in a short Bill for the purpose of using the Referendum for solving this very question which is now agitating the two Houses, and which is the real root of the trouble between us. I wish he would ask the people of this country the simple question whether they think that the question of setting up a Statutory Parliament in Ireland should or should not be submitted to them. That would settle the whole matter. The demands of His Majesty's Government as regards the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0309"/>
<col>609</col>
rejection of Liberal measures in this House and the exercise of your Lordships' Veto have been met. The Veto is gone, and the demands of the allies of His Majesty's Government, the official Nationalist Party in the House of Commons, have been met also. They have over and over again said that the only obstacle in the way of Home Rule is the Veto of the House of Lords. Well, the Veto of the House of Lords is set aside. Therefore not only should His Majesty's Government be satisfied, but the Nationalist Party in the House of Commons should be satisfied also.<lb/>
I confess I cannot see why His Majesty's Government should be so reluctant to submit this question of Home Rule to the judgment of the people. His Majesty's Government say that a great change has conic over the spirit of the people in regard to Home Rule. I quite agree. A great and salutary change of opinion has manifested itself in spice of all obstacles in Ireland, and has reflected itself upon public opinion in Great Britain. I feel convinced in my own mind that if a sound and wise Home Rule measure were submitted to the electorate they would approve of it and accept it, and I do not know why His Majesty's Government should be so reluctant to consult the people with regard to it, unless it is that perhaps my faith is a little more robust than theirs on the subject. His Majesty's Government say they are satisfied that the majority of the electors of this country would accept a Home Rule Bill. The Nationalist Party in the House of Commons are of the same way of thinking. In a letter which I saw in <i>The Times</i> yesterday Mr. Redmond, speaking for his Party, said&#x2014;
<quote>"I am quite convinced that Home Rule for Ireland has at its back the goodwill of the overwhelming majority of the British people."</quote>
If Mr. Redmond and the Nationalist Party are absolutely convinced that the overwhelming majority of the electors of Great Britain are in favour of Home Rule, and if His Majesty's Government are convinced also, as they say they are, that the great majority of the electors in Great Britain are in favour of Home Rule, then why in the name of commonsense should they object so strongly to asking the people the direct question and so settling the matter? I would ask noble Lords opposite to consider this in connection with a remark made by my noble friend Lord Londonderry
<col>610</col>
in Committee on this Bill. My noble friend was arguing in favour of asking the, opinion of the people on this subject, and he said that if an appeal was made to the people and the people were in favour of it, although he and his friends believed that Home Rule would be fatal to Ireland, they would only have one thing to do&#x2014;bow to the will of the people,. That was a most important, and, I think, wise and statesmanlike and eminently Constitutional pronouncement. You are perfectly convinced that the great bulk of the electors would approve of your Home Rule Bill; Mr. Redmond is absolutely convinced that the overwhelming majority of the British people would approve of your Home Rule Bill; and my noble friend behind me, speaking for the most strenuous opponents of Home Rule, says that if the people approve of your. Bill they will make the best of what they consider a bad job and cease from their objections and accept it. That is the situation, and there you have, as it seems to me, all the elements necessary for an amicable and final settlement, and why the opportunity of an amicable and final settlement should be lost I cannot conceive.<lb/>
I think His Majesty's Government have made a great tactical mistake. My noble friend behind me has taken up a much stronger position than he occupied before, if he will forgive me for saying so, upon Home Rule. I do not think its opponents can make a strong case at all; but in shifting his ground completely and taking up the line, not that the opponents of Home Rule will oppose Home Rule of any kind to the bitter end but only until they know that the will of the people is in favour of it, my noble friend Lord Londonderry has taken up a very much stronger position, and one which will give the opponents of Home Rule a great advantage which I deplore. I do not wish to weary the House by talking about Home Rule, or giving my reasons for being a Home Ruler. I will only say that I believe it to be absolutely necessary, not only for the welfare of Ireland but for Great Britain and the British Empire. But to be beneficial it must be subject to certain conditions. It must, of course, be a workable scheme in itself. It must be generally acquiesced in&#x2014;I do not say generally approved of, as that, perhaps, is impossible to expect&#x2014;but acquiesced in as, it may be, a necessary evil. It must
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0310"/>
<col>611</col>
be framed on federal lines, and the Constitutional question must be settled before it or along with it. The power to a Home Rule Parliament must, of course, be a delegated power. A statutory Parliament using delegated powers, unless those powers are derived from a stable and central authority, would not have a chance of carrying on its business successfully. Any number of examples can be adduced where federation and delegation have worked admirably, but federation has always been to or delegation from a strong central authority, and if a statutory Parliament in Ireland is ever to have fair play and a chance of success it must derive its power from and be under the supremacy of a strong and stable central form of government here. In any reconstitution of your Lordships' House a strong Second Chamber is absolutely essential. It is essential to any scheme of Home Rule. I do not believe in trying to frame a Constitution for Ireland out of the wreckage of the British Constitution. I do not believe that a statutory Parliament in Ireland would have a chance of carrying on its business if it was under the authority of a Parliament in such a state of chaos as the Parliament of this country is now in. I am, perhaps, singular in those ideas&#x2014;I am sure I am singular in this House&#x2014;but I can assure His Majesty's Government that I am not singular in holding those views as far as Ireland is concerned. I can assure the Government that the vast majority of the people of Ireland would infinitely rejoice if any means could be found whereby these inseparable questions of Home Rule on federal lines and the settlement of the Constitutional question here could be raised above the burden and heat of Party politics, and could be settled as such pave questions ought to be settled, coolly, dispassionately, and by way of conference, compromise, and methods leading to common consent.<lb/>
I have tried to give your Lordships as shortly as I can the reasons why, not in spite of the fact that I am an ardent Home Ruler but because I am an ardent Home Ruler, I approve of the Bill as amended and hope it may take its place on the Statute Book in very much the same shape as it is in now. I am quite sure that your Lordships' House in doing what it has done in the way of amending the Bill is justified by the circumstances of the case, and that the whole duty and object of the House or
<col>612</col>
of any similar legislative body is to see that the will of the people shall prevail. It is absurd to pretend that the present Ministry, or any Ministry, are gifted with such infallible insight, as to be able to know what the will of the people is about any Bill that has not been definitely before them; and although this House has gone dangerously near unconstitutional lines, I think justifiably, in putting aside the Constitutional check which it has exercised and ought to exercise, I say that if it consented to abolish all checks, to make Ministers absolutely supreme, and not to insist that the people should have Constitutional means of expressing their opinion on matters of vital interest to the country, it would be guilty of a grave dereliction of duty which I do not believe the country would ever condone.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01419"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as some impression seems to have prevailed, perhaps on account of something I may have said in the Committee stage of this Bill, that I was going to ask your Lordships to reject the Bill on the Third Reading, I would like to take this opportunity of telling noble Lords opposite that for the present, at any rate, they need not be afraid, and that the measure, for the moment only, is in comparatively smooth water. I say this because there has evidently been a considerable searching of heart in the Radical camp in the last two or three days and in that agreeable and refined Press identified with the Party of noble Lords opposite. Listen to the <i>Star</i>&#x2014;
<quote>"It is rather a grotesque bit of irony that Lord Morley should be forced to beg Liberal Peers to save the Bill from Lord Lansdowne's rag tag and bobtail."</quote>
Other newspapers as well have been good enough to suggest that I was going to move the rejection of the Bill on Third Reading, and though I wish entirely to associate myself with everything Lord Halsbury said, I do not propose to take that course.<lb/>
I must say that when the noble Viscount opposite painted in such gloomy terms the formidable consequences that would ensue from the rejection of the Bill it became very tempting indeed to move its rejection. He did not say to whom the consequences would be formidable, and whether or not he was really thinking of himself and his Party in the position of George Stephenson's cow that got in front
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0311"/>
<col>613</col>
of a railway train I am sure I cannot say. But for the present we will leave the consequences to take care of themselves; we shall have an opportunity of discussing them at a later stage when the Bill comes back from the House of Commons. I would gladly have supported the rejection of this Bill on Second Reading and I took the opportunity of telling your Lordships that extremely interesting piece of news at the time, but other counsels prevailed and it was agreed to proceed to the Committee stage. Two Amendments were put down to the Bill&#x2014;one proposed by the noble Marquess and the other by myself. I will not be guilty of the impertinence of comparing the relative value of those two Amendments. I may be allowed to retain my own opinion with regard to that. But after the exceedingly generous way&#x2014;too generous in my view&#x2014;in which the noble Marquess drafted his Amendment I cannot follow the statement of the noble Viscount opposite that there has been no disposition to yield on the part of the noble Marquess. I am not finding fault with the Government's attitude of no compromise. It is the only thing about the Radical Party that I thoroughly respect. They do not give way, and they do not attempt, outwardly at any rate, to alter their views to suit their critics, or to whittle away any part of their policy in order to gain the votes of those who disagree with them. I deplore the tendency to look at the British Constitution after the manner of a valetudinarian and to be constantly feeling its pulse and examining its tongue. I think the vitality of the Constitution will survive the attentions of the doctors who are trying to do so much for it at the present moment.<lb/>
I will not now enter into the wisdom or propriety of altering the Bill in Committee, but I may be permitted to say that the process has given noble Lords opposite an opportunity of criticising our proposals instead of defending their own. I have not heard in these debates at any stage of this Bill any satisfactory defence of the proposition that the British House of Lords ought to have less power than the Second Chambers of all other civilised countries. I do not believe there is an answer, but if there is I should be very happy to hear noble Lords opposite give us one. They wrap up their proposals in speeches destined to show how exceed-
<col>614</col>
ingly moderate the Bill really is. Lord Durham, in the speech which he delivered just now, spoke in that strain. It is very much the same frame of mind as an Oriental potentate adopted towards one of his victims whom he had condemned to be executed. He informed him that the State executioner performed his duties with such consummate skill and such an exhibition of art that to have one's head cut off by him was really more of an honour and a pleasure than otherwise. When the victim laid his head on the block the executioner made some preliminary flourishes with his sword and retired. The victim then asked when the execution was going to begin, and he was informed, "If you will just shake your head you will find it is all right," and when he did so it fell to the floor, so skilfully and painlessly had the operation been carried out. That, my Lords, is the sort of painless execution that is proposed by the noble Viscount under this Bill.<lb/>
Another argument that has been hinted at, sometimes on this side of the House, not as a reason for accepting the Bill but as a reason why legislation of some kind is necessary, is that the people of this country at the last two General Elections decided, according to the view of noble Lords opposite, in favour of the Parliament Bill, and, according to the view of other noble Lords, that some alteration in the Constitution is required. I will not deal with the latter view. But with regard to the Parliament Bill, this Bill is a totally different class of measure from any other measure which is capable of being judged by the ordinary rules of Party politics, such as a Budget, or a measure for national defence, or the whole category of measures for the social welfare of the people. This Bill may justly, without any rhetoric, be described as a revolution. I think it was rhetorical to describe the Budget of 1909 as a revolution. But this Bill is absolutely a revolution in terms. I believe my definition will be accepted by noble Lords opposite just, as much as by anybody else. It is a revolution to effect by main force a radical change in the Constitution of the country when at least half the people are strongly opposed to it; and you ought only to be allowed to effect your purpose of bringing about this revolution by main force. We on this side have extreme reluctance to consent to it, and I say we have neither the right nor
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0312"/>
<col>615</col>
the power as trustees of the British Constitution to compromise in any single particular with regard to this Bill. We think that the whole essence of this revolution, if you intend to bring it about, is that you ought to be compelled to bring it about by main force&#x2014;it may be by the creation of Peers, which is just as much main force as if you did it by ships and men and guns, or as if you brought into this House a regiment of Guards to sweep out noble Lords who sit on this side.<lb/>
With regard to the Third Reading, I shall be sorry in a sense when this Bill has left the House of Lords and we have no longer control of it. At the same time I am not going to oppose the Third Reading, but I want to make my position clear. I am only withholding opposition to the Third Reading on the distinct understanding that the essence and substance of the noble Marquess's Amendment to Clause 2 is the irreducible minimum which we can possibly accept on this side of the House. We will not consent to any arrangement of any kind conceivable by which that Amendment would be whittled away in any sense whatever; and we would be absolutely failing in our duty to the people of this country if we did not insist, no matter what the consequences may be, on the retention of this Amendment to the bitter end.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01420"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I quite agree with what Lord Willoughby de Broke has said with regard to his not moving the rejection of the Bill on Third Reading on the strict conditions which he has mentioned. I am entirely with him, and I think many others are with him there also. But I rise principally to refer to the speech made by the noble Earl, Lord Dunraven. He has every right as an Irishman to speak as he did, but he said that he differed from his noble friends behind him on the question of Home Rule and yet hoped the Bill would pass as amended. I must ask him why he comes and tells us this on the Third Reading of the Bill, and why he did not come during the Committee stage and help us with his opinions in the debates on the different Amendments that were put forward, especially the noble Marquess's. He says it depends entirely upon what sort of Home Rule we are to have. I can only say this, that we do not want any sort of Home Rule at all in
<col>616</col>
Ireland, nor do we want any form of Devolution either. I was glad to hear, however, that the noble Earl approves of the Referendum with regard to Home Rule. We are in complete agreement with him there. But the Government do not wish for a Referendum, because they are pledged to the Nationalist Party to grant Home Rule under this Bill whether it be a sound or wise measure or otherwise.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl said he hoped there would be an amicable and a final settlement with regard to Home Rule. I cannot see how you can have an amicable or a final settlement of Home Rule on any lines whatever. If the matter was left to the Referendum and it was fully assured to go to the country and we could explain what Home Rule was when we had the Bill before us, I should be prepared to give way if the decision of the country went against us; but till that time comes I do not think there is the least likelihood of there being an amicable or a final settlement of Home Rule. The noble Earl said also that the opponents could not make a strong case against Home Rule, and he went on to say that Home Rule was absolutely necessary for the welfare of Ireland. I ask the noble Earl, What about the financial part? He and I fought together on the question of the financial relations between the two countries, and as has been said the difficulties of the Government will commence when they bring in a Home Rule Bill. The real difficulty that will face the Government will be the question of finance. They know that as well as I do. I regret that the Committee which was appointed has not yet reported. As I said before, we are still in the dark with reference to that Committee. Lord Dunraven said there should be a strong Constitution in this country coupled with Home Rule. But what do the Nationalist Party care about a strong Constitution in this country? They do not care for a strong Constitution. All they want is Home Rule for Ireland according to their lights, and the Constitution of this country may go into St. George's Channel for all they care. We do not want any sort of Home Rule whatsoever in Ireland, and much less any form of Devolution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01421"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AVEBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not approach this question in any Party spirit. I look upon this Bill as a plain man of business, and I ask myself, Is it going
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0313"/>
<col>617</col>
to be for the advantage of the country to pass it? I feel strongly that when the history of this campaign comes to be written the verdict will be that no case has been made out for such a fundamental change in the Constitution of the country. To listen to noble Lords opposite one would think that no Liberal legislation had been passed by this House. On the contrary, the present Government have passed more Bills than any other Government in the same time. Out of over 250 Bills, there have been only four postponed. The first of these has since been passed. The second was introduced into the Budget, and the other two were dropped because, I suppose, they did not receive the support of the country. In the course of the debates in Committee I challenged noble Lords opposite to produce a single case in which your Lordships' House had insisted on your Veto in opposition to the wishes of the country. The noble Earl Lord Russell, said lie would give us an instance, and he referred to the Reform Bill of 1832. Even if that had been a case in point, I think that if he could not produce a single instance except one that happened eighty years ago it was a strong confirmation of the argument I used. But the illustration was not in point, and the noble Earl did not show so much knowledge of English history as I should have expected from one of the Russell family, because, after all, though your Lordships' predecessors did their best to defeat that Bill, they still finally passed it.<lb/>
Then I ask myself, How is it that so many of our countrymen are prejudiced against the House of Lords? In my judgment it is to a very great extent because the Government and their supporters have embarked on a campaign of calumny and misrepresentation against this House. If a tenth part of what has been said were true, the case would, I admit, have been serious. But it is not true. I do not include in that indictment noble Lords opposite who have spoken much more moderately and courteously than some of their colleagues, although I think they have in many cases greatly exaggerated their case, as the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, did in his speech this afternoon. But I have here a whole sheaf of potations from Ministers' speeches attacking this House in most unmeasured terms. I think, however, that at this period of the evening I shall best consult your Lordships'
<col>618</col>
wishes by not reading them. I should, however, like to read one quotation from a speech by the Chancellor of the Exchequer at Llanelly on December 22, 1909. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"I am a Welshman, and when I go to the House of Lords sometimes and stand by the Throne listening to questions affecting my fellow-country-men being scoffed at, my blood boils within me. Remember this, Wales is only a laughing stock in the eyes of the house of Lords."</quote>
Could there be a greater misrepresentation than that? I should like to know of any case in which your Lordships have scoffed at Wales or the Welsh people. I will undertake to say that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would not be able to produce a single case of the kind. But, unfortunately, Liberal Ministers go about the country setting rich against poor, North against South, England and Scotland against Ireland, and Wales against all, as far as they can possibly do so; and it was to a great extent on these misrepresentations of your Lordships' House that the result of the last Election depended. But although misrepresentation may succeed for a time, truth will prevail in the long run, and I have no doubt that the time will come when the country will do justice to your Lordships' House.<lb/>
Before I sit clown I should like to say a few words on the question of finance, because on that point I cannot go so far as my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition in this House. We hear a great deal about the privilege of the House of Commons with regard to finance, but I venture to think that it is a misnomer. It is founded On a Resolution of the House of Commons passed in 1678, but I believe I am correct in saying that that was never agreed to by your Lordships' House. So that it is not a question of a privilege but a claim. No doubt the House of Commons in matters of finance must be the predominant partner, but policy and finance are so closely interwoven, as we have already seen in these debates, that if we give up our power over finance altogether it will be a very serious matter for the country. There are a considerable number of countries under single-Chamber government, but their finances are in no case in a satisfactory condition. Among those engaged in trade and commerce there are very grave apprehensions in this country in regard to what would be the result of handing finance over to a single Chamber. I believe that in expressing that opinion I shall be supported
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0314"/>
<col>619</col>
by the overwhelming majority of the business men of this country. They feel great objection to this Bill, and I believe that those who constitute the educated classes in this country are also opposed to the Bill. But as Lecky said some time ago&#x2014;
<quote>"It is curious to find in modern England that extreme enthusiasm for education is combined with an utter disregard for the opinions of the educated part of the community."</quote>
I suppose this Bill will now pass. But I cannot think, as the most rev. Primate pointed out in his impressive and admirable speech this afternoon, that our countrymen generally realise the extreme gravity of the change that is being effected, and I cannot believe that this Bill, even if it be now passed, is destined to become a permanent part of our Constitution.</membercontribution></p>

<title>SMALL HOLDINGS AND ALLOTMENTS<lb/> BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01499">Order of the Day for the House to be put into Committee, read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01500">Moved, That the House do now resolve itself into Committee.&#x2014;(<i>Earl Carrington.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01501"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on the Motion to go into Committee on this Bill I desire to put a question to the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture. Your Lordships may remember that on the Second Reading I criticised the Bill as an infringement of the Act of 1908. That Act was passed to give county councils compulsory powers to acquire land from large farms in order to make small holdings, but a provision was added that holdings of fifty acres or less in extent should be excluded and that county councils should not have power to take them. This Bill proposes to alter that entirely and to allow small holdings of any size to be taken by county councils. The noble Earl did not answer fully my criticisms on that point but stated that there had been instances where individuals had broken up farms of certain sizes and distributed the land amongst various relatives with the object of evading the provisions of the Act. I said at the time that I did not think a sufficient case had been made out for breaking into the Act of 1908 in the way proposed. Other noble Lords put questions to the noble Earl on the same point, and the noble Earl concluded the debate by saying&#x2014;
<quote>"I shall be prepared, of course, to substantiate my claim. I had a great, many other instances to give, but I did not wish to weary the House. I will do my best to adduce categorical cases, because the only object of this Bill is to remedy these cases of hardship."</quote>
I should like to ask the noble Earl whether he has since inquired into the matter and whether he can give us the categorical cases to which he referred in justification of this measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01502"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Marquess for raising this question, because it gives me an opportunity of stating my position as regards this Bill before we go into Committee. I am sure it is the desire of all of us on both sides of the House that the subsection in question, which provided that no holding of fifty
<col>630</col>
acres or less in extent should be authorised by an Order under the Act to be acquired compulsorily for the purposes of small holdings and allotments, should work as was originally intended. I brought forward on the Second Reading an instance where the Act had been deliberately evaded by a person cutting up a large farm into small portions of under fifty acres and then letting them nominally to different people, the farm continuing to be cultivated by the same person, and I promised that I would do my best to bring other cases before your Lordships at a future stage. The case in Buckinghamshire, to which I referred, was a flagrant case. I have done the best I could to obtain information about other cases; but the House will see that as the procedure is <i>ultra vires</i> we are the last people to whom such cases would be referred. That they do exist there is no doubt, but we should be the last persons who would be able to obtain information direct.<lb/>
My object&#x2014;and I am sure it is the object of noble Lords opposite&#x2014;is simply to protect <i>bona fide</i> small holders in their occupations. That was the sole reason why I brought forward the Bill. As I said before, we have had three main difficulties. There was the question of by-takes&#x2014;that was the first difficulty&#x2014;in which a coach-and-four was driven through the Act. Then there was the question of the occupier, and we also had the difficulty of the subdivision to which the noble Marquess referred. But I do think, on reflection, that perhaps this Bill as originally introduced by myself went too far. My advisers thought it was the best way of dealing with the subject, but when it was inquired into and debated I recognised that perhaps the Bill might have been misunderstood. It might&#x2014;I do not say it would&#x2014;cause difficulties to a very worthy class of persons, and reasonable doubts were expressed that the rights of small holders might be jeopardised. I see that there are three or four Amendments on the Paper this afternoon. Those Amendments, I am certain, have been brought forward in the same spirit as that in which I introduced the Bill, and I want to be permitted to receive them in exactly the same spirit in which they are offered. I hope these few introductory remarks will be satisfactory to the noble Marquess, who has the same cause at heart as I have myself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01503"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when this Bill was last before the House I
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0320"/>
<col>631</col>
ventured to say that I opposed it because I felt that the small holders throughout the country who now enjoy the protection which the Act gives them ought not to be deprived of that protection because of an isolated case of evasion in Buckinghamshire. The noble Earl met that by saying he had a number of other cases with which he had not troubled the House. The noble Earl has now been challenged to produce those cases, but he has not up to the present moment added a single case to the isolated case which he gave us on the former occasion. He has, moreover, admitted that the Bill goes a great deal further even than the necessities of the case require, and that, in fact, the Bill is a bad Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01504"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: No, no.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01505"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: Well, a Bill that goes beyond the necessities of the case cannot be a good Bill. Whether that is so or not, I do not think the noble Earl has made out any case for this Bill. Therefore, speaking for myself, I shall certainly oppose the Bill unless there is a good deal more to be said for it than has been said already.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01506"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl has so frankly admitted that he was misled as to the facts of the case that I am sure we on this side would be reluctant to press him too hardly. But I am extremely glad that the matter was taken up as it was, because this really is an object-lesson to us. It shows how a Bill of this kind can be put forward upon charges which I must say were of a somewhat odious nature, and which appear to be entirely without foundation. The House will remember that the noble Earl told us on the Second Reading that there had been a number of cases where the Act had been evaded by means of bogus sub-division. He mentioned the case in Buckinghamshire, and assured us that he was aware that a number of other cases were in existence. It now turns out that not a single other case can be produced, and the basis on which this Bill was brought forward crumbles away altogether. I think the noble Earl ought to be grateful to us for having put the matter in its full light before the House, and we shall now be able to discuss the Bill in Committee with some knowledge of the actual facts of the case.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01514">The noble Duke said: I am very much encouraged by what fell from the noble Earl just now to hope that he will be willing to accept my Amendment, because he told us that all he wanted was to do that which the original Act intended to carry out. Now the original Act defended the position of the landowner as well as that of the small occupier, but the Bill which is now before us does nothing of the kind, nor, as far as I have been able to follow it, does the Amendment standing on the Paper in the name of the noble Earl (Lord Carrington). I have drafted my Amendment in the hope that it might do something, although I am afraid it is not a complete protection, towards protecting not only the occupier but also the landowner, and in saying this I should like to emphasise what it is that we want to protect both the landowner and the occupier from. There is a strong desire on the part of county councils to multiply the number of small holdings, and where they, knowing the local circumstances, find it difficult to do so, the Board of Agriculture puts every kind of pressure upon them to exert themselves to discover people who want small holdings and then to discover small holdings for those people. Cases where the landowner has abused his power&#x2014;if abuse of power it be, and I use the expression for the moment because that is the view which the noble Earl takes of the proceeding&#x2014;have dwindled to next to nothing. I do not think I need add anything after what has fallen from the noble Marquess on the Front Opposition Bench with regard to this point, except to
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0321"/>
<col>633</col>
say that it seems to me very novel and rather disgraceful that a Minister of the Crown should come forward and tell us that there is a state of things serious enough to require legislation and then to tell us that the state of things is such that it cannot possibly come to his knowledge. Therefore it is only supposition and hearsay that we have to go upon. I have never before heard a Minister of the Crown submit a Bill with such a recommendation. Consequently it seems to me all the more necessary that we should guard against the innumerable cases of hardship that would accrue under this Bill owing to the pressure put upon county councils and the activities of county councils themselves in this matter.</p>

I was glad to hear the noble Duke say that it was the desire of county councils to multiply small holdings and allotments, and I would take this opportunity of thanking the noble Duke for the assistance he has given to my Department in connection with farms in Northumberland which he has been good enough to offer for small holdings. But I must take exception to the language he used when he said that my action in coming forward with this Bill was disgraceful. What I said was that a coach-and-four had been driven through the Act to my certain knowledge. I quoted to the House one case, and I stated that I believed there were many similar cases in the country. Perhaps I ought not to have said that. It was, however, my firm belief, and I have no doubt in my own mind that other similar cases do exist though I confess I am not able to bring them before the House.<lb/>
<col>634</col>
There is no doubt that subsection (3) of Section 41 of the Act of 1908, which subsection I desire to repeal by this Bill, has proved an obstacle in three respects which were not anticipated. The first obstacle is this&#x2014;it prevents the acquisition of the small by-takes held in conjunction with large farms under separate tenancies. Secondly, it prevents the acquisition of small holdings and allotments held by tenants under notice to quit where such acquisition is desirable to protect such tenants from disturbance. Lastly, it enables landowners to evade the operations of the Act by the division of a large farm into several small holdings under fifty acres still cultivated by the one farmer. I have given an instance where that has been done, and I think we ought to make it impossible for a sub-division to be made in those circumstances.<lb/>
The noble Duke's Amendment is not very easy to understand. I will state what I understand it to be, and the noble Duke will correct me if I am wrong. I understand it to be this, that so long as the occupier at the time of the sub-division remains in occupation of any part of the original big farm the county council can make use of the compulsory powers to acquire his holding or any portion of the holding, but the instant that that man dies or gives up his farm or goes out of his holding the powers of the county council lapse, and none of the lettings of fifty acres on any farm, some of which may be bogus, can be interfered with. I really do not think that that would be a very desirable Amendment to put into my Bill, bad as my noble friend below the Gangway (Lord Heneage) was good enough to describe it. I quite agree that the object which the noble Duke has in view is a good one, but it seems to me a very ineffective way of dealing with one only of the three defects which I think I have the sympathy of the House in trying to remedy.<lb/>
What we wish to make plain is this. If a man cultivates fifty acres or less, I think the House will agree that he is entitled to protection from compulsory acquisition; but if he cultivates more than fifty acres he is not entitled to that protection, and to endeavour to make that as plain as I possibly can I have withdrawn my original proposal and in substitution for it I have an Amendment on the Paper which I will explain when it comes to my turn to move

it. Lord Clinton has put down an Amendment to my Amendment, and I would be prepared to accept the noble Lord's Amendment with a slight modification. I sincerely hope, if I have made myself intelligible, that the noble Duke opposite will not press his Amendment. If he does it will entirely wreck my hope of settling this vexed question. I respectfully hope, as I have said, that the noble Duke will not press his Amendment, but will allow the House to consider my Amendment in conjunction with Lord Clinton's Amendment, which as I have indicated I shall be happy to some extent to accept.</membercontribution></p>

I am considerably disappointed at that. I read out to the House a little while ago the promise of the noble Earl that he would produce to the House categorical cases to justify this Bill, but he has not produced a single additional case. I venture to say that if the noble Earl had told us on the Second Reading that he had only the one case, the case in Buckinghamshire, to produce, your Lordships would not have given a Second Reading to the Bill. There are a great number of small holders who view this Bill with apprehension. They have relied on the security of subsection (3) which was moved by Mr. Harcourt. They now recognise, however, that the Board of Agriculture, with an officiousness which was unnecessary, has appointed a number of highly-paid officials to, as was vulgarly said by one member of His Majesty's Government, "ginger" county councils in this matter. Before your Lordships agree to pass this measure as it stands we ought to have some assurance that these small holders will not be ill-treated.</membercontribution></p>

In answer to Lord Heneage I can say that the Amendment standing in my name is worded in the best possible language that a very eminent member of the legal profession could put together to prevent a repetition of the difficulties to which I have referred. If the noble Duke will very generously not press his Amendment, then we shall be able to get on to my Amendment.

<quote>"No holding of fifty acres or less in extent or any part of such holding shall be authorised by an Order under this Act to be acquired compulsorily for the purpose of small holdings and allotments."</quote>
There is nothing there about value. It is purely area. The noble Earl wants to repeal that subsection, and in place of it he now proposes in the Amendment standing in his name on the Paper that the limit should be fifty acres, as is already the fact, and "where it exceeds that area if the annual value thereof for the purposes of Income Tax does not exceed &#x00A3;50." That addition may be perfectly right, but does the noble Earl mean to give value as a test as well as area? And how far does he mean to go towards meeting the views of Lord Clinton, who would allow an individual to occupy two holdings provided that taken together they were not more than 75 acres in area or more than &#x00A3;75 in value? I confess I am not quite convinced that there is any need for legislation at all.</membercontribution></p>

There has been considerable difficulty experienced in drawing up this Amendment, and it is possible that it does not cover the whole ground. I am not sure that any Amendment which could be drawn would adequately protect owner and occupier from hardship. It has really been proved that there is no reason at all for this Bill, and I hope it will be rejected. The noble Earl stated that we all have the same object in view, but he has never said one word about protecting the owner of the property as distinguished from the occupier.

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01530"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: We are still somewhat puzzled as to the policy of the noble Earl. Let me remind the House what the condition of the present law is. Under the present law the holder of a farm under fifty acres in extent is immune from all interference by the Small Holdings Commissioners. The noble Earl does not wish to disturb that arrangement, but he introduced a Bill the avowed intention of which was to throw these small holdings open so that the small holder would no longer enjoy that immunity and might have a part of his small holding taken away from him in order to create a small holding for someone else. But now I understand that the noble Earl is ready to abandon his original proposal. Now his intention is not to deprive a small owner of his immunity but to increase that immunity, because if the Income Tax valuation of his holding happens to be less than &#x00A3;50 he gets a second dose of protection. The noble Earl appears now in a very different r&#x00F4;le from that in which he appeared when he presented this Bill to the House, and we want to be quite clear that we are under no misapprehension on that point.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01531"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: We understood that this Bill was introduced to meet a largo number of cases of evasion, but those cases have now been boiled down to the single case in Buckinghamshire. As the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition said, the noble Earl began by proposing to do away altogether with the immunity which small holders enjoy. He now proposes to increase it. May I ask him what would happen in regard to the odious case in Buckinghamshire? In fact, the noble Earl has really boxed the compass, and I submit to your Lordships that this Bill ought not to proceed. The noble Earl has abandoned his case altogether and taken up quite a different case. The moment we on this side of the House saw this Bill we asked ourselves why in the world the Government proposed to do away with the exemption which they had so carefully given in their Act. They now propose to increase the immunity. Surely the noble Earl must see the absurdity of this proposal, and he must not be at all surprised if at some future stage of the Bill a Motion is made to stop the Bill, because it is quite patent that this legislation as now proposed is merely for the purpose of saving the noble Earl's face and for no other purpose whatsoever.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01532"><member>LORD CLINTON</member> moved to amend Earl Carrington's Amendment by omitting the words at the end after "50 acres" and inserting "in one holding, or 75 acres in two or more holdings; nor where they exceed those areas if the annual value for purposes of Income Tax does not exceed &#x00A3;50 or &#x00A3;75 respectively."</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01533">The noble Lord said: The noble Earl has told us that under his Amendment every small holder of fifty acres will be quite as safe as he was before, but I am very doubtful if that will be the result of his Amendment. If your Lordships will read it carefully, you will see that it provides that an Order for the compulsory acquisition of land under the Act shall not authorise the council to acquire or extinguish the interest of any person in land comprised in the Order and cultivated by him if the total area, including such land cultivated by him, does not exceed fifty acres, and so on. But while that Order may not be put in force against him, yet there is nothing to prevent the Order
<col>640</col>
being made. Apparently an Order can be made for the compulsory purchase of the I small holding, and it is quite obvious that if the holding has been compulsorily purchased and the council or the Commissioners or whoever it may be get into possession of the land they will exercise full right of ownership over the land and get rid of the tenant. If a county council have a passionate desire for a piece of land it is obvious that they will use their compulsory powers under this Amendment to acquire the land, and having got it into their own hands will split it up for small holdings. We really ought to go back to the older exemption which kepi the small holder safe. I heard with pleasure the statement of the noble Earl that he is willing to accept some part of the Amendment standing in my name on the Paper, but that does not wholly do away with my objection to the noble Earl's Amendment as it is drawn, because I still say that it does take away the proper exemption from the small holder which it was the policy of the Act which the noble Earl himself passed to give him. Under the noble Earl's Amendment that protection is very largely taken away. I suggest that we should put in the extra exemption suggested in my Amendment so as to protect the small holder who is progressing and probably on the up grade. As I say, I am glad that the noble Earl will accept my Amendment, but at the same time I object to his Amendment as it stands because it does take away from the small holder the protection which the Act originally gave him.</p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01551">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01552"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have to explain to your Lordships briefly why this Bill is introduced. The subject is no new one. It has been under consideration for a long time by the Defence Committee, and the Bill is their work arrived at after consultation with the naval and military authorities and with the legal advisers of the Crown. It is a Bill that has been
<col>642</col>
prepared alter a good deal of deliberation. Its purpose is to strengthen the law for dealing with the violation of obligations with regard to official secrets and with espionage generally. It is a Bill that applies to our own countrymen as well as to strangers, and its purpose is not to enact any large body of new restrictions, but to make more effective the law as it was intended to be made by the Official Secrets Act of 1889.<lb/>
The main change which the Bill makes is a change in procedure. In order to convict any one under the Official Secrets Act, 1889, it is necessary to prove a purpose of wrongfully obtaining information. If a man is found in the middle of fortifications he may say he strayed in in the dark or was only there by accident. You have to prove that he was there for the purpose of wrongfully obtaining information, and that is difficult to prove. This Bill adopts a method for which there is a precedent and which is much more effective. We still, of course, keep the criminal purpose, but the criminal purpose under this Bill is any purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State, and if a person is in a place where <i>prim&#x00E2; facie</i> his presence is prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State, he has to satisfy the jury that his purpose was a right one. That, as I have said, is nothing new. It is a section taken from the Prevention of Crimes Act, 1871. Under that section certain classes of offenders have to justify themselves when their character and conduct raise suspicion.<lb/>
I will give one or two instances showing what our difficulties have been. Not many months ago we found in the middle of the fortifications at Dover an intelligent stranger, who explained his presence by saying that he was there to hear the singing of the birds. He gave the explanation rather hastily, because it was mid-winter. Then there was another case, in which somebody was found looking at the emplacement of guns in a battery at Lough Foyle, and he declared that he was there for the purpose of paying a call upon somebody. Then there was another case of a man who was sketching fortifications. He ran away, but was caught. The case was one which attracted attention at the time, but our means of proving his purpose were extremely inadequate. Again, we have found photographers taking
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0326"/>
<col>643</col>
photographs of things of which they ought not to be taking photographs, and they said they were merely taking photographs of an interesting object. There have been cases in which we have found people close to magazines&#x2014;very convenient targets for dropping explosives from above. There, again, they have claimed to be there by accident, and because the burden of proving that there was a purpose of wrongfully obtaining information lay upon us we could not prosecute with any hope of success, though in most cases we were convinced that there were good grounds to prosecute.<lb/>
Now under this Bill what has to be shown is that there was a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State, and if your Lordships will look at Clause 1, subsection (2), you will see that it is enacted that a person's motive may be inferred if from the circumstances of the case or his conduct or his known character he may be taken to have been there to no good purpose. Of course, he has the opportunity of clearing his character in the fullest way, but the circumstances are such as to throw the burden of proof on him. That is the main provision of the Bill. The other provisions are shortly these. Under the Official Secrets Act the places which were barred from public access were but few. For instance, it may be just as important that strangers should not go into a private dockyard where a Government warship is being built as it is that they should not go into a Government dockyard; and there are many other places which have grown up in importance in the last twenty years which were not covered by the limited descriptions in the Act of 1889. Therefore it is proposed to widen the definition of these places and to give the Secretary of State the power&#x2014;a power which will only be exercised in time of emergency&#x2014;to prescribe other places. There is a provision in the Official Secrets Act of 1889 which we keep&#x2014;the provision that you cannot prosecute without the assent of the Attorney-General. That provision was construed to mean that you could not arrest without the fiat of the Attorney-General. The result was that many of these persons with whom we wished to interfere were a long way off before any warrant could be obtained for their arrest. Therefore there is a provision in this Bill analogous to that which exists in the
<col>644</col>
present law in the case of all felonies. Then there is also a power of searching, which is essential. I think I have now told your Lordships the extra provisions except one, and that is that harbouring spies is made an offence, and that is necessary for concrete reasons.<lb/>
As I have said, the Bill is not directed against anybody in particular, but applies to our own people as well as to people of other nations. If I were asked whether there is much espionage in this country I should say that foreign Governments direct espionage in this way very little indeed; but I do believe that a great many zealous people of all nationalities are anxious to obtain information by which they may recommend themselves to their Governments, and that there is a great temptation to people with expert knowledge to acquire this information. I have certain knowledge of persons&#x2014;who may have done it, and probably did do it, in an entirely private capacity&#x2014;making maps which they ought not to have made, and it is not desirable that that power should remain unchecked. This Bill is a carefully considered attempt to deal with the subject on an official footing. I hope it is a Bill which will commend itself to your Lordships as not being brought in through any excess of caution, but merely one which marks the stage in these things which, with the necessary evolution of matters, we have now reached.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01554"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is now twenty-two years ago since the late Mr. Stanhope pressed the original Official Secrets Bill upon the attention of Parliament, and I remember that grave apprehensions were then expressed that the Bill had been drawn too severely and would bring too many people within its clutches; but, as the noble Viscount has said, it has been proved that there was no ground for that apprehension. There is no real difficulty in preserving official secrets if you know and fix your mind on the fact that they are desired by somebody else and determine to preserve them by the exercise of all possible care. The Brennan torpedo, for which a large sum was given by our Government about the time that the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0327"/>
<col>645</col>
Official Secrets Act was passed, did, I believe, remain a secret for a long period of years, and certainly the advantage which we expected from it we had the monoply of during that period. But our difficulty always has been that our officials are inclined to take things very easily. There is of course no difficulty with regard to special questions on which the minds of the military and naval authorities are so set that every officer is aware of the danger that would be incurred in letting the secret out of his possession, but practically almost all other questions are open.<lb/>
The noble Viscount has given some instances, and I will state one which perhaps he does not know, and I will give him the names privately if he desires them. An officer of very high rank told me some little time ago that he had taken two young officers in his command and said to them, "There is a particular fortress. Go in plain clothes and bring me back sketches of every place where there is a gun in that fortress. I will give you, to be used at the last moment when you are being hailed into custody, this safe conduct pass to explain what you are doing and that you are doing it by my orders." In a week they returned with the disposition of every gun in that fortress, having had no credentials with them except that they spoke English glibly&#x2014;and such men could, of course, be obtained by any foreign Power. I think, therefore, that this Bill which is not an extension of powers but merely the adoption of existing powers with the necessary amendments to make those powers effective is urgently needed. On the other hand, I do think that our military and naval authorities must take care that the sort of openings and undue confidence which we have shown in the past are not allowed in the future. I congratulate the noble Viscount on having taken up this subject. It is always difficult for anybody in his position who is not a lawyer to feel sure that he is not asking for something which those who have to administer the law may feel to be unduly burdensome and dangerous to the; public interest. The noble and learned Viscount has taken advantage of his own knowledge to fill up most necessary gaps, and I can only say from my own experience that I feel this Bill is urgently needed in the interests of the country.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01555"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having had a great deal to do with the drafting of the original Act, I should like to say that it was pointed out at the time that there were several gaps not properly stopped but it was thought that we had better see the working of the Act before any Amendments were made. I was Attorney-General for several years after the Act was passed, and I should like to endorse what has been said as to the extreme difficulties we experienced in instituting prosecutions. Consequently I am very glad that the noble Viscount has brought in this Bill. There are, however, one or two matters in the Bill to which I hope the noble Viscount will pay attention before the next stage. I would call his attention, first, to the words "known character as proved" in subsection (2) of Clause 1. It is opening the door of criminal law for which some justification will be required. It is quite true that when people are found under certain circumstances their previous record as actually proved can, under the Prevention of Crimes Act, be given in evidence; but I have never known any Act to go so far as to say that a man's known character may be proved and I am afraid that in the working of the Bill this will create difficulties. I think the words will be found too wide unless some indication is given. The only other point I wish to raise is with regard to Clause 3. I think the definition of "place" will require a little more careful consideration. I think it will be found from some points of view very narrow. I may add that I shall be glad at any time to discuss these points with the noble and learned Viscount.</membercontribution></p>

Too many people in this country appear to consider that preparation for war is a mere question of payment of money. There are many other preparations necessary. A recent occurrence near Portsmouth has shown that it is quite clear that our law needs strengthening. As far as I have been able, to ascertain, the codes of other countries as regards spying are far more severe than ours.<lb/>
I regret that His Majesty's Government do not appear to be taking any steps towards bringing in a Bill to prevent the dissemination of news during war or
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0328"/>
<col>647</col>
emergency. I have no doubt that when war is once declared a most stringent Bill will be brought in and passed; but inasmuch as naval surprise in time of peace or during the first week of a war is the greatest danger to which we are exposed it would be much wiser to pass such a Bill in a time of profound peace and give the Government the power of bringing it into action by an Order in Council. If the noble Viscount cannot give it now, I should like an assurance before going into Committee that the captains of our gunnery, torpedo, and submarine and wireless establishments have been consulted. If they have not yet been consulted, there will be time enough to consult them before taking the Committee stage and of embodying their suggestions if thought proper in the Bill.<lb/>
I wish also to call attention to the wording of paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) of Clause 1. It might be argued before a Justice of the Peace not learned in the Jaw that as we are at peace with all the world we have no "enemies," and that an accused person would therefore be entitled to an acquittal. The wording of those paragraphs should, I think, be altered by substituting the words "foreign Power" for the word "enemy" in a drafting Amendment. I hope that the noble Viscount will proceed with the Bill, and that it will receive a good reception in another place.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01569">The noble and learned Earl said: My Lords, I appreciate the difficulty that a great many of your Lordships are in in having to discuss this Bill without sufficient information from those who are familiar,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0329"/>
<col>649</col>
not only with the law, but with the administration of the law, and I think those noble Lords who are members of the profession to which I have the honour to belong would do well if they would give us the result of their experience. Happily I think I may say that this Bill is beyond the reach of Party controversy; and I would equally welcome from the other side of the House information on the subject. It is not desirable that we should again discuss this matter at great length, and I will, therefore, put the broad points as shortly as I can before your Lordships.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01570">My first broad point is that County Courts are already too crowded, and that the effect has been to crowd out the small people for whose sake the County Courts were originally instituted. On the last occasion a most valuable piece of information was given to your Lordships by an ex-Attorney-General (Lord Robson), and I would desire no better advocate than himself of the view that I take. I believe his experience is the experience of almost everybody in the County Courts. On the last occasion that this matter was before your Lordships my noble and learned friend Lord Gorell mentioned that this Bill was the outcome of a Report of a body of Commissioners in the year 1872. My noble and learned friend mentioned one or two great names as recommending this change, but I do not think he sufficiently distinguished between those who approved of it and those who did not.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01571"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: My noble and learned friend is under a misapprehension. I mentioned no names at all.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01573"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: If the noble and learned Earl will refer to the Official Report he will see that I mentioned no names at all. I merely mentioned that a majority of the Commissioners were in favour of the Report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01574"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: I am now told that it was the Lord Chancellor who mentioned the names. Whoever it was, I am bound to say that it would have been as well to have mentioned the names of those who disagreed. Among those were
<col>650</col>
Lord Cairns, Lord Penzance, Chief Justice Erle, Mr. Justice Blackburn, and the then Attorney-General, Mr. R. P. Collier. They all disagreed, and gave reasons for their disagreement. Some of those reasons, I think, are very relevant. Lord Penzance wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"I am entirely opposed to the substitution of Registrars for County Court Judges in the hearing of contentious cases, however small the amount in dispute. &#x2026; The economy to be effected by these changes would not, in my opinion, prove great in the end, and would be too dearly purchased by lowering the standard of Judicial excellence."</quote>
The authority of Lord Penzance is somewhat high. Mr. Justice Blackburn wrote&#x2014;
<quote>"I have great doubts as to the expediency of establishing any such intermediate class of Courts at all. I attach much importance to the keeping up of the great central Bar of England. The only real practical check on the Judges is the habitual respect which they all pay to what is called 'the opinion of the profession,' and the same powerful body forms, as I think, the real and the principal check on the abuse of patronage by the Government."</quote>
Sir Robert Collier, afterwards Lord Monkswell, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The County Courts were established as Courts for the trial of small causes, and as such have been successful; if they be raised to a position intermediate between superior and inferior Courts and be entrusted with the trial of a large number of important causes in substitution for the Courts of Assize, I doubt the continuance of their success. I think that their jurisdiction has already been extended somewhat too far, and that it at the least deserves consideration whether under an improved circuit system some portion of that jurisdiction might not, be conveniently re-transferred to the superior Courts."</quote>
I have other authorities, but I do not want to pursue this. I may add that I had a very large practice in the County Courts and know of what I am speaking, and I would be glad if any lawyer familiar with the County Courts would give your Lordships such information on the subject as he possesses.<lb/>
Consider what it is proposed to do. You are about to add to the jurisdiction of the County Court every ease of litigation in the State. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack says, "Yes, but the defendant can have the case removed to the High Court if he desires." There comes in the vice of costs, which largely depend upon these interlocutory proceedings. Does anybody believe that a person who is sued in the County Court will himself apply to have the case removed to the High
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0330"/>
<col>651</col>
Court? He will go to an attorney, whose advice will cost him money. That is one of the difficulties. Then the noble and learned Lord pointed out that anybody could bring a case of the kind in question in the County Court by consent, but he added that it was necessary that there should be a little pressure. The object of this Clause is to force upon litigants something which you cannot get them voluntarily to do, and to then place upon the defendant the obligation of objecting and having the case transferred to the High Court. Then the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack adds a provision which would enhance to an infinite degree the amount of costs and delay, because one of the sources of difficulty is as everybody knows the number of appeals. The noble and learned Lord now opens the door to the whole inquiry being taken over again, for he proposes to enact in this clause that there shall be a right of appeal upon questions of fact in cases above &#x00A3;50. It appears to me that if you want to destroy the system of County Courts you could not go a greater way in that direction than by passing this provision. At present when once you have the facts found by the County Court Judge they are, as it were, facts found by an arbitrator; you cannot go behind. Now it is proposed to give a right of appeal upon questions of fact in all cases above &#x00A3;50, and we know how considerable is their number. I protest against that very much.<lb/>
I dare say your Lordships hardly know the class of work that is done by a County Court Judge, and it was upon that point that what the late Attorney-General (Lord Robson) pointed out when this Bill was last before us was so useful. He referred to a case where the time of the County Court Judge was occupied until 3 o'clock in the afternoon hearing judgment summonses. Now do your Lordships know what that means? It means an examination into the pecuniary resources of every man who was summoned before him, into how much the people earned, and how much they could afford to pay. In view of the, nature of the work which County Court Judges have to do, to force every other kind of litigation into the County Court seems to me a monstrous abuse. This clause would prove a destruction to the Junior Bar, and besides that it would, in my i opinion, entirely destroy the real purpose for which County Courts were instituted.<lb/>
<col>652</col>
It has become quite a common thing for a County Court case to be adjourned over and over again. In saying that, I must allude to one observation made by Lord Gorell. He referred to the statistics that had been collected, and I think he was a little hard upon those who had supplied those statistics. They were I collected, I think, at the instance of a Commission appointed in connection with the proposal to confer upon County Courts jurisdiction in regard to divorce. Lord I Gorell presided over that Commission, and perhaps his tendency towards this may have been a little tinged by his desire to show that County Courts were efficient to be entrusted with divorce jurisdiction. However that may be, those statistics were given by gentlemen who had no interest whatever one way or the other. The information was given to the best of their belief, and they are entitled to have the evidence which they gave at the instance of the Commissioners treated with respect and treated as if it was accurate, as I believe it to be. I do not wish to argue this matter over again as it has been several times before your Lordships. I therefore conclude by moving the Amendment standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01575">Amendment moved&#x2014;
<quote>"To leave out Clause 1."&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Halsbury.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01576"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall not venture to trouble your Lordships with a speech at any length because I spoke on this subject very fully a short time back, but I should like to summarise quite shortly what I conceive to be the real position of this matter. May I say at once, with regard to the statistics to which the noble and learned Earl has referred, that I have never questioned their accuracy for one moment. They were supplied for the purpose of the Divorce Commission to show what was the state of business in the County Courts.<lb/>
The summary of what I should like to say about this clause is this. In substance it only changes consent into want of objection, which gets over difficulties where people are asked to consent who do not like to consent to anything in law. If a case is started against them and they are asked to consider whether it is easier, cheaper and more convenient to try it in the County Court, they have to face the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0331"/>
<col>653</col>
question of transferring it to the High Court if they object to its being taken in the County Court. There will be no additional expense necessarily than if the suit had been entered in the first instance in the High Court. Next, this proposal has been before the country for a very long time. As to the Report of the Judicature Commissioners of 1872, to which reference has been made, the noble and learned Earl is quite correct in saying that there were five or six objectors. But the fact remains that there were eighteen signatories on the other side. I do not propose to mention names, because all that it came to was that a majority decided to report in favour of a proposal practically on the same lines as the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack has put into this Bill. It is also important to remember this. I stated on the last occasion that this clause met with favour from the various law societies in the country. Since then I have received a communication from the secretary of the Law Society which practically amounts to saying that it meets with the approval of the Law Society and, what is perhaps more important still, of all the provincial law societies in the country.<lb/>
The next point is this. The real objection to this clause is the block which it is suggested it will create in the County Courts. The noble and learned Earl has suggested that the experience of those engaged in the County Courts should be brought forward on this point. I have received a communication from Sir Mackenzie Chalmers. He was on the Committee over which I presided, and he was for twelve years County Court Judge at Birmingham. He had also had other Judicial experience, for he was a Commissioner of Assize, and I think he held a Colonial Judgeship for some time. At any rate for twelve years he held the position of County Court Judge at Birmingham. He found exactly the difficulty which is set forth in the reports of the gentlemen who furnished the statistics to the Bar Council and he instances exactly the kind of thing that happened and which I venture to suggest is met by this Bill. When he went to Birmingham, one of the largest County Courts in the country, ho, found a case which had to be adjourned and the result was that eight months went by before it was finished. He thought that a great scandal, and he did exactly what this Bill if carried would bring about. He
<col>654</col>
proceeded at once to institute for the heavy cases a counsels' list and set apart a week for it, and by giving a week in each month he was able, without any interference with the ordinary work of the Court, to dispose of all the substantial business which the Court had before it. Clause 7 of this Bill is drawn for the special purpose of meeting the difficulty of the heavier class of work being brought to these Courts, and it provides machinery by which substantial cases shall be taken at special sittings for the purpose of getting rid of the block referred to. And if at the larger centres where the Judge is continuosly sitting that can be done, the only difficulty to consider is what is to happen in the smaller places. The answer to that is again suggested in this Bill. It is that cases which are of substance shall not be taken necessarily at each tiny County Court, which only requires a visit of a day once a month, but shall be concentrated at the nearest county centre so that the Judge can there make a list which will enable him to deal with that class of case; and if that is done the difficulty of blocking and the danger of expense and adjournments of cases will be got rid of. That, it seems to me, is the answer to the whole of the statistics which have been put forward on this point. There ought not necessarily to be any great difficulty in the concentration of this work; and I think, with all respect to those who take a contrary view, it would be an immense advantage to the Bar. They would be able to concentrate their energies at one spot, and convenience would be immensely increased to all parties.<lb/>
I wish to say that I was in error on the last occasion when I said that the only changes that had been made lately in regard to the High Court were at the last places on circuit. I was not aware that an Order in Council had been passed a day or two before I spoke which made changes of a substantial character advantageous to the general administration of the circuit system. What I was aiming at was that, although I firmly believe that the Lord Chief Justice and those who assist him are ready to make every change which can be made to work the circuit system as it stands properly, an adequate change is not possible while the present system endures on its present footing. As far back as 1892 the Judges of the King's Bench Division recommended that the fifty-six places, I think it is, at which Assizes are
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0332"/>
<col>655</col>
held for civil business all over the country should be concentrated in eighteen. Local opinion was against that, and nothing was done. In 1896 a further attempt was made and some changes were brought about, though they did not amount to very much. And in the Report which my Committee prepared on this question we expressed the opinion that the circuit system should be entirely remodelled, that the principle of the concentration of civil business should be applied, and that so far as possible, having regard to the convenience of access afforded by railway communication, civil cases should be grouped at suitable centres. And we pointed out that this would have the effect of giving almost continuous sittings locally at those centres. That is a suggestion which cannot be met by preserving civil Assizes at places where the work is trifling. If that is not done it seems to me that the proposal as to County Courts would be a great advantage, because it would enable these eases to be brought fairly continuously and at much less expense. Therefore I venture to suggest that this clause would be an advisable one to pass, and that the difficulties where they exist are got rid of by the provisions to be found in the later part of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01577"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ROBSON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad that the noble and learned Earl opposite has drawn attention to the fact that this is in no sense a Party measure. I am not ashamed to confess that by conviction and habit I am accustomed to obey Party calk, but this is a matter within my own personal knowledge as to which I have a strong sense of responsibility, and I feel bound to give such assistance as I can to your Lordships in dealing with a matter of this kind.<lb/>
We have to consider this matter from two aspects, as to one of which little need be said. The Bill proposes to transfer a large quantity of business from the High Court to the inferior Court. As far as the High Court is concerned, no one has suggested that there is the slightest necessity for any transfer of business. Owing to the increased Judicial staff the High i Court is able to get through its business with expedition. That is the state of things in the High Court from which this work is proposed to be taken. Now look at the state of things in the County Courts, to which the work is proposed to be trans-
<col>656</col>
ferred. That was the main subject of discussion when your Lordships dealt with this Bill in Committee. There was then produced a body of evidence on this point which has been rather obscurely referred to to-day. Reference has been made to a statement issued by a number of barristers at the request of the Bar Council. The suggestion having been made that jurisdiction in divorce proceedings should be given to County Courts, my noble and learned friend Lord Gorell asked the Bar Council to collect for him statements as to how far the state of business in the County Courts would admit of this increase of jurisdiction.<lb/>
What the Bar Council did was to approach twenty-eight barristers having County Court practice and ask them to give their own personal experience, collected from their fee books, and to state what they thought of the proposal to increase the jurisdiction of the County Courts. As my noble and learned friend has stated, the statements made by these gentlemen have not been impeached. They cannot be impeached. They are accounts of specific cases with specific dates, and the time over which the cases ranged is given in each particular case. These twenty-eight barristers have shown how in each of the cases mentioned there was delay, costs, trouble and inconvenience owing to cases suitable for the High Court being taken in these small debt Courts for which their machinery and time are not adequate. My noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury has said that these statements were not interested statements on the part of the Bar. I would go further. Not only were these gentlemen not making their statements from interested motives but they were making them against their own interests, for they were. County Court practitioners and the more business the County Court had the better it would be for them. The proposal to allow divorce proceedings in the County Court was professionally to their benefit; but the whole twenty-eight of them to a man pointed out, in the most explicit and careful way, what the result has been of the many recent increases of County Court jurisdiction. Their experience is unanimous.<lb/>
I mentioned the other day the evidence of the first two, and I took them simply because they were the first two. One of those instances contained the experience
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0333"/>
<col>657</col>
to which the noble and learned Karl opposite has referred, where a batch of counsel with heavy cases proper to the High Court were kept waiting while 200 judgment summonses were being tried. Those summonses were dealt with with great rapidity&#x2014;at the rate of fifty per hour, or nearly one a minute&#x2014;and then at three o'clock one counsel's case was taken and at six o'clock was adjourned, and the hearing extended over three or four successive days. As I have said I took the first two cases when I addressed your Lordships last upon this subject. I will take the last two on this occasion. One barrister says&#x2014;
<quote>"My experience in the County Courts in and about London is that there is great congestion and considerable delay. Rarely is a case heard on the original return day, while a case of any magnitude has to be taken piecemeal. The County Court Judge's engagements on his circuit preclude him taking a lengthy case <i>de die in diem.</i> In a fairly recent case in which I was engaged we spent one day without being reached, and five subsequent days were given to the case by way of special sittings prolonged over a period of six weeks."</quote>
And here is the final case. The barrister states that the case was down for hearing at the County Court on a particular circuit on November 28, 1908. It was not reached. He then goes through a series of dates which end in judgment being delivered on October 11, 1909. It is beyond all doubt that the primary purpose of the County Courts, which is to give to the poorer classes in this country a rapid and cheap means for the settlement of their disputes for small amounts, is already being adversely affected by the enormous mass of work which has been thrown on the County Courts. Therefore the proposal to take work from the not overworked High Court and throw it upon the very heavily overworked County Court in particular districts is not exactly what strikes me as a model law reform.<lb/>
What is the difference which Clause 1 makes? Many of your Lordships might think from the course which this debate has taken that this is a clause to enable persons to have their cases tried in County Courts who are not able at present to have their cases so tried. That is not the object of this clause. At present County Courts have full jurisdiction up to &#x00A3;100, and beyond &#x00A3;100 they have unlimited jurisdiction by consent. Now how is consent signified? It is signified by a mere letter. The plaintiff before putting his case down
<col>658</col>
writes to the defendant and says, "I am going to sue you. You have to be sued somewhere. Will you take it in the County Court?" The defendant says "Yes" or "No" to that, and the matter is ended. But under this clause the defendant is not asked for his consent beforehand. The plaintiff is permitted, I might almost say invited, to put down his case in the County Court&#x2014;the writ is cheaper and the practice would become common&#x2014;and then instead of the jurisdiction of the Court depending on the defendant giving his assent, the Court has only jurisdiction where the defendant does not dissent.<lb/>
You might say that that is so small a matter as not to be worth troubling about. But the defendant is not allowed to intimate his dissent by merely writing a letter. He is compelled under this clause to go into the High Court at once and to make in the High Court, or in some district registry of the High Court, an application to have his case transferred&#x2014;a purely superfluous interlocutory proceeding, and precisely the class of proceeding which law reformers are anxious to get rid of. He is thereupon as I have said, compelled to make an application to have the case removed, and such application the High Court must grant. It is a purely superfluous, expensive and unnecessary proceeding to put upon the defendant in order that he may be discouraged from entering the Court which exists for the purpose of trying his case. And notice this also. His lawyer is obliged to be put into operation at once, because the application has to be made in accordance with rules of the Supreme Court within so many days and in a manner to be prescribed. And if the defendant fails to obey these rules then he is compelled to have the case tried in a Court to which he does not wish the case to go.<lb/>
It is suggested that the defendant would only want to get into the High Court for the purposes of delay. The defendant who desires delay is not afraid of extra interlocutory proceedings. He will take them gladly. That is not the defendant you would hurt by this Bill, but the defendant who seriously and honestly wants to have his case tried in the High Court. He is the man who will find it inconvenient, expensive and troublesome to have this extra interlocutory proceeding
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0334"/>
<col>659</col>
unnecessarily put upon him. A man who has an important case which may involve his fortune or his character wants to go to the High Court where he can get the case fully tried, or it may be a case involving the technique of his trade or business. He would naturally desire to have the case tried in a Court where he could get continuous sittings, and not in a Court where he was badgered by judgment summonses one day and workmen's compensation cases the next. The plaintiff may have a very different wish. He may prefer a Court where the justice is not only summary but very unsatisfactory. Plaintiffs get a great advantage in English Courts of Justice. They get the first word and the last word. The defendant's lot in an English Law suit is not a happy one, and the defendant is far more interested in the excellence of the tribunal than is the plaintiff. He wants a Judge who can keep his mind open, and that is not such a common faculty as is generally supposed. By this clause the defendant is to have put upon him this absolutely superfluous proceeding for the purpose of preventing him from getting his case heard in the High Court. *It is true that the law societies, which are composed of solicitors, are not unwilling to have the business of the High Court transferred to the tribunals in their own localities, but their evidence must be weighed a little, and I am not aware that they have more than expressed their own opinion. My noble and learned friend has an excellent provision in this Bill for special sittings. I do not, however, think that they will cure the evil. But still it is a good provision. The law societies, however, do not approve of special sittings and have expressed their disapproval.<lb/>
There has been a good deal of discussion on the Report of the Judicature Commissioners of 1872. I would like to take the Report of the Committee appointed by the Lord Chancellor to inquire into certain matters of County Court procedure and presided over with such distinction by Lord Gorell. It is dated 1909, and this is the last Report, according to Lord Gorell's statement, on which this Bill is founded. Lord Gorell told us on the last occasion that he thought those who were opposed to this clause had not given that Report adequate consideration. I am prepared to base my case upon this Report. There is a little inconsistency between the premise and the conclusion which not infrequently
<col>660</col>
happens. The Report begins with a long list of Acts which have increased the jurisdiction of, and thrown extra burdens upon, County Courts The list contains something like seventy Acts. Then under the heading "Effect of in crease of work and added duties" I find this passage&#x2014;
<quote>"It is not surprising to find that, with the increase in the ordinary work and the numerous duties cast upon the County Court Judges in many Courts, the amount of work to be done has reached a point at which the strength of the Courts as a whole is heavily taxed to cope with it, and the information which the Committee has been able to obtain shows clearly that attempts to try cases of any length have frequently resulted in serious inconvenience and waste of money."</quote>
The statements get stronger as material accumulates. On page 15 the Committee say&#x2014;
<quote>"It must be observed that the vast mass of the work of the County Courts has been, and is, the enforcing of the payment of small debts and claims; that, no more work should be placed on these Courts which would interfere with their primary and most important duty; that almost all their work is in eases which are either without any defence or without any substantial defence, and that a very simple and inexpensive procedure, such as prevails in the County Courts, is absolutely necessary for such cases, whereas cases in which there is any real contest usually require procedure of a more formal character."</quote>
Then the Committee submit this conclusion&#x2014;
<quote>"The County Courts, with the mass of small cases which are brought in them, must continue to dispose of the poor man's cases, This is their primary business, and the statistics above given show how us population increases the work of these Courts also increases, and may be expected to continue to increase. It is essential that that work should not be interfered with by attempts to deal to any serious extent with larger cases taking up much longer time in hearing, when the Courts which were originally constituted only as small debt Courts hare already had added to their primary duties a quantity of other work and have their time practically fully taken up. As it is, the Committee understand that great inconvenience and waste of time and expense are occasioned by cases in which there is any lengthy contest, as the small debt cases must be disposed of at once, and parties in contested cases may or may not have their cases reached and disposed of on the day fixed, or may have costly and inconvenient adjournments."</quote>
Then a little lower down the Committee say&#x2014;
<quote>"The conditions under which a local Judge must work in a Court with a district which is necessarily limited in order to deal with the aforesaid primary business of the Court, are not likely to make such
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0335"/>
<col>661</col>
a Court prove a satisfactory tribunal for the trial of cases of legal difficulty or of importance. In most cases he is out of touch with the other Judges and leaders of the legal profession, without opportunities of discussing legal cases with them, will not have any, or hardly any, opportunity of hearing cases argued by eminent counsel, and, as a rule, has not an adequate library with books or works of authority at hand."</quote>
Again they say&#x2014;
<quote>"We are strongly of opinion that the true remedy to be sought for is not by encouraging litigants to contest their cases in Courts which were not intended to deal with these cases, and must for the reasons already given find difficulties, and be at a disadvantage in attempting to do so, but to provide that completely adequate facilities should be given by the High Court for disposing of every case which it is reasonable should be both commenced and continued in it."</quote>
Those are the opinions of the Committee, and I am glad to think they are the opinions of Lord Grorell and of Sir Mackenzie Chalmers. But what was the recommendation which the Committee made? And I ask your Lordships to notice the difference between the Committee's recommendation and Clause 1 of this Bill. In this Report it was not suggested that the defendant should be driven to make this unnecessary interlocutory application. What was suggested was that the plaintiff might be empowered to issue a plaint in the County Court, but that the defendant should have an absolute right, to be indicated to him in the plaint&#x2014;there is nothing of that sort in this Bill&#x2014;to have the case removed to and tried in the High Court, and to effect this all he had to do was to give notice thereof to the Registrar of the County Court out of which the plaint was issued. So that in their recommendation the Committee keep as nearly as possible to the letter. There would be no necessity for the defendant to make an application to the High Court. He could send a letter to the Registrar of the County Court to say that he was not entering an appearance in the County Court. But instead of that we have in the clause this interlocutory application, which casts upon the defendant an unnecessary burden, and a burden which I really think under all the circumstances can scarcely be called quite fair to him.<lb/>
It is only Clause 1 to which we object. We have no objection at all to the rest of the Bill. I think no case whatever has been made out for this clause. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack said on
<col>662</col>
the last occasion on which we discussed this subject that the average sittings of County Court Judges numbered 153 days in the year. I pointed out at the time that there are, of course, many underworked Courts. Courts in rural districts are underworked; Courts in districts where the Judges do not happen to have found favour with the business community are underworked; but that is not so in the large and important centres. Moreover, County Court Judges have to do a great deal of travelling. A County Court Judge often leaves home at six o'clock in the morning to travel to his Court and gets home late at night. A man cannot keep that up every day in the week. These are considerations which I invite your Lordships to take into account in dealing with this clause. As I have said, if this clause is deleted there is no reason why the rest of the Bill should not have a safe and easy passage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01578"><member>LORD MERSEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I say a few words about Clause 1? It is the only clause in the Bill to which any real objection can be taken, and I will state what I understand the effect of that clause to be. Hitherto the jurisdiction of the County Court has properly been limited to comparatively small cases. Clause 1 of this Bill opens the doors of those Courts to all actions whatever the amount involved may be. I am going to say nothing as to the block which such an introduction of new work into the County Courts would cause. It is sufficient to remind your Lordships that the County Courts were originally instituted, and in my opinion are still intended, for the cheap, satisfactory, and speedy disposal of poor men's cases. I turn to the particular provision in this clause. The Lord Chancellor on the last occasion, if I may say so, quite accurately stated that the clause gave to a defendant who was brought into the County Court an opportunity of at once taking the case out of that Court, for he could by an intimation to the plaintiff claim to have his case tried in the superior Court. So he could. But in my opinion that protection, if it can be called a protection, is quite illusory. I will tell your Lordships what in my opinion would happen, and I speak from considerable experience. The plaintiff is represented by an advocate-solicitor in the County Court district out of which the Summons is issued. The solicitor for the defendant&#x2014;a defendant
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0336"/>
<col>663</col>
who probably also resides in that district&#x2014;is himself practising in the district and in that County Court. It is to the interests of both the solicitor for the plaintiff and the solicitor for the defendant that the case should be retained in the Court in which they practise. The lay defendant will never know that he has an opportunity of having his case removed from the County Court into the High Court. It is not to the interests of his solicitor that it should be removed, and the result will be that the so-called protection will be illusory and the defendant will know nothing of it. That is all I have to say about this matter. I think the Bill in other respects a most excellent measure; but I do hope that this driving of large cases into the County Court against, as I believe, the will of defendants, will not take place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01579"><member>LORD ALVERSTONE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I argued this matter at length the other day and I only rise on the present occasion to make one or two observations on points which are really new. I must first be allowed to make a correction, although there bus been a slight withdrawal by Lord Gorell to-day of the statement which went out with the great weight of his authority as to the reluctance of the King's Bench Judges to meet the necessities that had arisen. The noble and learned Lord stated that nothing had been done except altering some dates at the last places of Assize. On the contrary, we have arranged for extra civil assistance at a large number of places on circuit. The point I make is that the proper place for the trial of these cases is the High Court. Nobody suggests that they ought not to be tried by a Judge of the High Court, by juries of the High Court, and with the advantage of the Bar of the High Court. I respectfully submit that no case has been made out for taking King's Bench actions, and King's Bench actions alone, and sending them to be tried in the County Court. If the circuit system requires alteration and amendment, by all means let us have legislation to alter it. But the circuit system stands, and there is no reason why a poor person in the | North or in the West should be deprived of the opportunity of having the advantage of a High Court Judge going down and trying his case at his own door. I submit that no case has been made out for this special and sudden interference with the jurisdiction of the Court of King's Bench. The more I think over this proposal and
<col>664</col>
the more I learn from all parts of the country the feeling regarding it, the more I am satisfied that this clause ought not to stand in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01580"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (LORD LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this discussion, apart from the speech of Lord Gorell, shows once more how lawyers are against law reform. I remember that the same dreadful forecasts were indulged in with regard to the Criminal Appeal Bill when it was before your Lordships, but that Act had not been a week in operation when it was proved to be a great success, as would this Bill also. We have heard a speech lasting three-quarters of an hour from Lord Robson, but if I may have six or seven minutes I will endeavour to put my reasons before the House for asking you to allow this Bill to become law.<lb/>
The clause in question, as has already been explained, means nothing beyond this&#x2014;that if a plaintiff likes he can begin his case in the County Court, but that if the other side desire to do so they can remove the case to the High Court by an application provided for by a rule of Court. A letter would suffice; the defendant could remove the case to the High Court, and the arguments about interlocutory proceedings are all stuff and nonsense. I ask, Who is in favour of this clause? The Judicial Commissioners of 1872 were in favour of it. Lord Cairns, Lord Selborne, Lord Hatherley, Lord Blackburn, were all in favour of it. The Committee over which my noble and learned friend Lord Gorell presided were in favour of it. The law societies are in favour of it. I have received many letters from chambers of commerce and other commercial bodies all in favour of it. And why? For this reason, that it means cheap justice. I do not complain of the justice administered in the High Court, but it is a very expensive luxury. You may have &#x00A3;150 or &#x00A3;200 to sue for, or even a larger sum; but it is an expensive luxury to have the case tried in the High Court. The costs are treble in the High Court. Cheapness is all that I want to secure, and I know very well that the commercial community and the solicitors are in favour of this clause. In fact, the only people against this clause are the Bar Council, but I think none of those eminent lawyers would pretend to have any personal knowledge of the County Courts. All they do is to quote the statements of
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0337"/>
<col>665</col>
twenty seven barristers, who are not named, and whose opinions were collected by the Bar Council in reference to another matter&#x2014;namely, divorce business.<lb/>
It is said that business in the County Courts is congested. That is the sole argument that there is. I say that the County Courts are not congested. It is part of my duty as Lord Chancellor to look after the business of the County Courts and to inquire into complaints of congestion of business there. I have had complaints from time to time since I have been Chancellor, and my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury in his time no doubt received complaints. Population shifts or increases and one County Court gets more congested with business than another, or the County Court is not judiciously managed and the business gets mixed up. As I say, some complaints in this respect have been made to me, but they have been few. There is one before me at the present moment with which I shall deal in due time. If all this knowledge and information about congestion would come to anybody, would it not come to me? Of course, I would be the very first person to hear of it, because it is part of my duty under the Act of Parliament to rearrange and reorganise the County Courts when such rearrangement or reorganisation is required. The congestion spoken of is this, that too many cases are put in one day's list, that there are different classes of cases put in the same list, the long and the short together. The remedy is to put different cases in different lists and take a few more days to try them. The average work done by County Court Judges is 153 days in a year&#x2014;that is all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01581"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: Actually sitting.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01582"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Yes, actually sitting. You may have to add a few days in the year for travelling. Will any one suggest that there ought to be added more than eight or ten days for travelling? Why they all live in their counties and have the easiest time in the way of days of work that you could have. I have come across a County Court Judge who sat 170 days in a year and made a grievance of it. But no County Court Judges except two in this country have ever complained to me of excessive work.
<col>666</col>
Those two cases I investigated, and there was nothing in them. What is the proper remedy? This congestion is mere fancy. I say there is no County Court in the country&#x2014;I suspend judgment as to one case now before me&#x2014;in which it would not be perfectly easy, by adding a few days sittings a year, to make the whole thing work. I ask your Lordships, Are you prepared to lay down for County Court Judges that their critics can speak of congestion when they have an average of 153 days, and when nobody is able to quote a case of a single County Court Judge who sits for more than 170 days in the year? Surely we have not become such a degenerate and effeminate race that we cannot do a little more work than that!<lb/>
What is the real reason of this opposition as to which we have heard such clouds of words repeated over and over again and dealing with technicalities which your Lordships cannot be expected to understand, and which to my mind are more appropriate to pleadings in a County Court than to speeches in the High Court of Parliament? The real reason is that the Bar have the sole audience in the High Court and no solicitor can plead. But in the County Courts the Bar are confronted with the competition of solicitors. I should greatly regret if the putting of work into the County Courts had the result of injuring my own profession; but I know it would not. There would be more work to do in the County Courts, and the High Court would be left more free to do really important business which is required of a Court of greater authority and with the highest training. That is the bottom of this opposition. It is an interested professional opposition, and I feel it my duty to say so. I ask your Lordships to treat this matter as you think fit, and I will respectfully bow to your decision.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01583"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure your Lordships will not suspect me of any intention to inflict upon the House arguments of my own with regard to the legal aspect of this matter, but I do not like to give a silent vote if we are indeed to divide on the Amendment of the noble and learned Earl. This clause has been for some time in suspense before your Lordships' House, and I can say honestly that it has been to me a kind of nightmare that I should be called upon as
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0338"/>
<col>667</col>
a layman to decide between the high legal authorities who are ranged on either side in this controversy. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack was good enough to remind me the other day that I had had the honour of serving, I think in 1879, upon a Select Committee of this House on which many illustrious members of the legal profession also served. I must apologise to the noble and learned Lord, but I have to admit that my memory is a blank upon the subject, and I am perhaps not altogether surprised at that because I find that the Select Committee in question only sat for one day, and I have been quite unable to find any trace of the proceedings which took place. The noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack is quite right, however, in saying that the result of our investigations was to report a Bill which I believe was more stringent than that now upon the Table. But, my Lords, thirty-two long years have passed since the proceedings of that Select Committee, and I may say, in passing, that it does occur to me that if the matter was quite obvious and plain sailing it is rather remarkable that during those thirty-two years nothing should apparently have happened in the direction which was then suggested.<lb/>
What can we laymen take note of in regard to this matter? In the first place, I think it is generally conceded that the Bill is a good and useful Bill. I think my noble and learned friend (Lord Halsbury) said that at any rate the greater part of it has his hearty support. It is a Bill which obviously represents a great expenditure of time and trouble, and most of us would, I conceive, desire that it should take its place upon the Statute Book. Then we also note that there is a considerable amount of concurrence as to the objects with which the first clause which we are now considering has been framed. It has been defended as an attempt to cheapen litigation in the interests of those poorer litigants who, as has been said, are bled by heavy costs and whose grievance we should all desire to mitigate. But we find diametrically opposite opinions as to whether the clause will or will not produce the desired effect. It is held, I understand, by my noble and learned friend and by others to whose authority we cannot be impervious, that the Bill, far from producing the results anticipated by its authors, will produce results of an entirely different character.<lb/>
<col>668</col>
In these circumstances I admit that it would have been a great relief to many of us if the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack had been content to take his Bill without the first clause. But I gather from what happened with regard to this Bill two years ago and from the noble and learned Lord's language this evening that nothing is further from his intention than to abandon the clause. May I also say, in passing, that there is a reason&#x2014;I do not know whether it is entitled to any weight&#x2014;which might lead some of us to desire to suspend our judgment with regard to this clause. It is the case that a Royal Commission presided over by Lord Gorell is at this moment inquiring into the whole question of divorce and matrimonial causes. Unless I am wrong, that Commission arose from a Resolution in this House, moved, I think, by the noble and learned Lord himself (Lord Gorell), in favour of conferring upon County Courts jurisdiction in regard to divorce. It is, therefore, it seems to me at least conceivable that the result of the Report of that Commission may be to throw upon the County Courts new and additional work, and if that be so, might it not be desirable and prudent to allow this question of extending the jurisdiction of the Courts and the question of their staffing to stand over until the Report of the Royal Commission is before us? I confess that I say that really because I am anxious to find a pretext for not being called upon to vote "Yes" or "No" on the Amendment of my noble and learned friend. If, however, the Lord Chancellor does adhere to his clause and if my noble and learned friend behind me insists upon his Amendment, I feel that, in view of the great division of authority upon the subject and the doubts whether this clause really will effect the purpose which its authors have in view, I should not be justified in giving my vote for a proposal which would impose new duties upon already overburdened tribunals. For that reason if my noble and learned friend goes to a Division I shall, though I admit not without misgiving and doubt, feel it my duty to vote with him.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01604"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD GORELL</member> had three Amendments to this clause. He first moved to omit from subsection (1) the words "notwithstanding anything in Section 25 of the principal Act" and to insert "if a solicitor." The noble and learned Lord said: Clause 20 gives rise to considerable difficulty. I have been studying it for some time and am not sure in some respects what its effect will be. The Amendments which I propose are substantially to leave the position as it is at present until it has been further considered, with this one exception of the Lord Chancellor's power of appointment. The clause deals with the appointment of Registrars. There are three lots of Registrars in the country. There is the County Court Registrar, who must be a solicitor of five years' standing and is appointed by the County Court Judge with the approval of the Lord Chancellor. The second set of Registrars are the High Court Registrars, and they
<col>672</col>
may be appointed from three or four different classes of people, but I believe as a matter of fact the High Court District Registrars are practically appointed from the County Court Registrars. But there is a further provision that if the nature and the amount of business show that it is expedient to appoint, a person not so qualified, the Lord Chancellor may, with the concurrence of the Treasury, appoint a solicitor of live years' standing. The Lord Chancellor, in effect, has practically to appoint the County Court Registrar and does so in nearly all cases. Then there are the third class of Registrars&#x2014;the District Registrars of the Probate Court. The Probate Court has forty Registries throughout the country, and according to the Statute of 1857 the District Registrars are to be appointed from advocates, barristers, proctors, solicitors, and, under another Act, from clerks of the principal Probate Registry who have been clerks for five years. The result is that there are three different sets of Registrars; and in some cases difficulties, I think, will arise if this provision is adopted. I will point out one. A Probate Registrar in the country may now be appointed a High Court District Registrar, and that has been done at Manchester and Liverpool with advantage so as to combine the offices, and he may be and is in one of those cases a solicitor and in the other he was a clerk from the Probate Registry. This clause as it stands would to a certain extent prevent the power to amalgamate the offices of the District Probate Registry with the High Court District Registry. That power to consolidate seems to me to be affected by the provisions of this clause. The second effect is this. County Court Registrars are all solicitors at present, and the High Court District Registrars are solicitors, or may be appointed, as I have said, from the Probate Registry. This clause opens the power of appointment to persons who may be Masters of the Supreme Court, and that includes the Bar. I should be glad to see the appointment entirely open to both branches of the profession, though it may meet with opposition, but I cannot see how this clause would work out having regard to the points I have mentioned. There might be a chance of giving rise to difficulties, and therefore I think the better course would be to consider the position of these three different sets rather more fully and carefully in some subsequent Bill.</p>

ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I could not ask your Lordships to read this Bill a second time at this hour were it not that an identical Bill has been in the last two or three years twice passed by your Lordships' House with the assent of His Majesty's Government, and has only failed to receive the consideration of the House of Commons through want of time. The Bill is word for word the same Bill that passed your Lordships' House last year. Its object is to facilitate the formation of new bishoprics by substituting another procedure for the existing system, by which separate Bills are necessary with the creation of every fresh Bishopric or even an alteration of boundaries. The procedure proposed to be substituted is that of an Order in Council. It would be made on the recommendation of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, who would first obtain the assent of the Archbishop of the Province and the Bishop of the Diocese and satisfy themselves that sufficient income was provided for the new Bishopric, no part of such income being allowed to be provided from their common fund. The Order in Council would then have to be approved by the Government of the day and to lie on the Table of both Houses for thirty days, and if objection was taken to it by either House it would not become law, but if no such objection was taken it would obtain the force of law. There are three new bishoprics, I believe, already provided for so far as funds are concerned which might be created within a comparatively short time if this Bill became law&#x2014;the Bishopric of Sheffield, to relieve the enormous diocese of Yorkshire, and the five Bishoprics for Norfolk, Essex, Suffolk, Cambridge and Huntingdon, Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire to relieve the present dioceses of St. Albans, Norwich, and Ely.

<title>MERCHANT SEAFARERS AS WITNESSES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01647"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member> rose to call the attention of His Majesty's Government to the extraordinary disabilities under which merchant seafarers labour in respect (1) to detention ashore and resulting enforced
<col>680</col>
unemployment for the purpose of giving evidence at Board of Trade inquiries into shipping casualties in which they may in no way be involved; (2) to detention ashore and loss of employment when summoned to serve on juries; and (3) to loss of employment caused by their compulsory detention when subp&#x0153;naed to give evidence at Police Court and Assize trials dealing with criminal offences on British merchant vessels; and to ask whether His Majesty's Government will now give serious consideration to these grave hardships with a view to taking the necessary steps for either furnishing special relief to merchant seamen in these several cases or otherwise ensuring that in those cases where this is found impossible some adequate compensation for great loss sustained in the public interest will be payable to those concerned.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01648">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I will not detain your Lordships more than a few minutes, because I understand that the answer I am to receive will be to some extent a satisfactory one. But I would like to make perfectly clear to your Lordships the very real grievance of which the captains and officers of the merchant service complain. Nearly all the causes of detention mentioned in my Question mean a loss of employment, and it is a very great hardship where a man has worked his way up to be captain and is in command of a vessel, that, through no fault of his own, he should be deprived of that command and either have to spend a long period in unemployment on shore or else take a position as mate or second mate; and as the commands in the merchant service are to some extent limited, it may be a good number of years before that man could get command of a vessel again. I know that my noble friend Lord Herschell understands these matters as well as I do myself, and that he sympathises with the hardship which captains and officers have to suffer under the present state of the law.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01649">This question is a peculiar one in a way, for it does not deal with one public Department but with two or three. The first part of the question as to detention for Board of Trade inquiries will, of course, be dealt with by the Board of Trade; the second part&#x2014;detention for serving on juries&#x2014;I fancy I am right in saying comes under the Lord Chancellor's department; and the third part&#x2014;detention as a witness in a Police Court and at Assize trials&#x2014;is dealt with by the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0345"/>
<col>681</col>
Home Office. My suggestion was that this grievance might be met by taking the evidence of captains and officers on depositions or by commission, but I have heard from the Home Office that so far as the part of the question goes with which they are concerned they have no power either to take depositions or to take evidence on commission, and that the best remedy in order to give the relief sought would be to pass some short Act for that purpose. But the case of Board of Trade inquiries is slightly different. Those courts are not courts of law but courts of inquiry, and I have been informed that perhaps in that case depositions could be taken. I will read a short extract from a letter which will serve as an illustration of what happens at present&#x2014;
<quote>"I joined here on Thursday the 18th instant, and two hours before sailing the Board of Trade man came on board and served a summons on me to appear at a Board of Trade inquiry at Cardiff on Tuesday the 23rd, held to investigate into the misconduct of the second officer on the last voyage. I had to leave my ship and go ashore again, and yesterday&#x2014;the 26th&#x2014;the Board of Trade told me that there is going to be no inquiry as the man has gone to sea again. My pay front them has therefore been stopped, and my services are no longer required. They have given me three days' pay and now they say they have finished with me. I do not know whether I have any claim legally, but I am sure you will agree that I have been very badly treated. They took me away from my ship and it may be years before I shall get the chance of serving again as first mate on a ship trading regularly to my home."</quote>
In the latter part of my Question I have mentioned pecuniary compensation, but that is not the sole thing that captains and officers of the merchant service desire. What they desire is that they should not be kept ashore for any of these causes and thereby lose their berths. Compensation, as I need not point out to your Lordships, would be very hard to assess. Take the case of the writer of the letter I have just read. To obtain a position as officer on a ship trading to a man's home is a privilege that is very highly sought after in the merchant service, and many officers would be content to receive much smaller remuneration in order to be able to enjoy that privilege.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01650">I now come to the next case, that of being detained to serve on juries. I think that case ought not to be at all a difficult one to deal with, for already there are a certain number of seafarers, such as pilots, &amp;c., who are exempt from service on juries. As they are exempted I cannot see any reason why captains and officers of vessels
<col>682</col>
who are in active employment should not also be granted exemption from serving on juries. If His Majesty's Government are good enough to bring forward any measure to grant the relief for which the captains and officers ask, I hope they will be a little more expeditious about it than they have been in regard to the Bill dealing with uncertificated officers in British merchant ships. We were told on March 21 by the noble Lord who then represented the Board of Trade that that Bill had been drafted, but we have not heard a single word about it since. I beg to put the Question that stands in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01651"><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the question which the noble Lord has raised is certainly one of interest, and I feel sure that any proposal for mitigating hardships which may fall upon such a body of men as the mercantile community in general must command a measure of sympathy from all of your Lordships. The question, however, is rather a complicated one. I will deal first with the first portion of the noble Lord's Question, which is as to detention ashore for the purpose of giving evidence at Board of Trade inquiries resulting in enforced unemployment. The noble Lord suggested that depositions might be made use of. The existing state of the regulations is as follows. Depositions are used upon formal investigations into shipping casualties under two authorities. Section 691 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, provides that whenever in the course of any legal proceeding instituted in any part of His Majesty's Dominions before any Judge or magistrate or before any person authorised to receive evidence, the testimony of any witness is required in relation to the subject-matter of that proceeding, then upon due proof, if the proceeding is instituted in the United Kingdom that the witness cannot be found in that kingdom, or if in any British possession that he cannot be found in that possession, any deposition that the witness may have previously made on oath in relation to the same subject-matter before any justice or magistrate in His Majesty's Dominions, or any British Consular Officer elsewhere, shall be admissible in evidence, provided that&#x2014;(<i>a</i>) if the deposition was made in the United Kingdom it shall not be admissible in any proceeding instituted in the United Kingdom; and (<i>b</i>) if the deposition was made in any British possession it shall not be admissible in any proceeding instituted in
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0346"/>
<col>683</col>
that British possession; and (<i>c</i>) if the proceeding is criminal it shall not be admissible unless it was made in the presence of the person accused. Under this authority in cases of inquiry into missing vessels we obtain depositions from abroad. They relate to such matters as loading and stowage of cargo, draught of water, manning and general trim and condition of the ship and her equipment at the time she last left port. The matter contained in these depositions does not affect certificates, and most frequently these depositions are taken in the case of missing ships.<lb/>
The second authority is under the Rules. Rule 8 of the Shipping Casualties and Appeals and Rehearings Rules, 1907, under the heading of "Evidence" provides that affidavits and statutory declarations may, by permission of the Judge and saving all just exceptions, be used as evidence at the hearing. Under this Rule we hand into Court depositions of lighthouse-keepers and that class of witness, and they are generally accepted by persons against whom a charge is made as coming from impartial people, most of the evidence being taken from records. Another class of evidence by depositions would be that of the officers of another ship who last sighted a missing vessel or actually saw a ship go down without being able to speak as to the cause of the casualty. But in the bulk of inquiries witnesses who are detained are essential witnesses whose oral evidence, whether for or against an officer, cannot be dispensed with, because if the evidence is against the officer, that officer's representative in Court would be the first to object to the deposition being read, and the Court would doubtless refuse to allow it to be road on the ground that there was no opportunity of cross-examining the deponent. Even if the deposition was in favour of an officer and we let the deponent go, we cannot compel the. Court to receive the deposition, though as a rule the Court would be inclined to allow it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01652"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord is dealing now only with Board of Trade inquiries?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01653"><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: Yes. The officer's representative might well make a grievance that the Court had not before it <i>in propri&#x00E2; person&#x00E2;</i> a witness so favourable to his client, a mere deposition not carrying nearly so much weight as oral testimony. The inevitable result would be that when-
<col>684</col>
ever a witness made a deposition against an officer and he was allowed to go, that deposition would be ruled out on objection taken by the officer's representative, while as a rule depositions in favour of an officer would, if the Court raised no objection, be allowed to go in. Every effort is made to let witnesses go if there is reasonable ground for thinking that their evidence is not absolutely essential&#x2014;<i>i.e.,</i> if others can speak to the same facts&#x2014;but it is dangerous to relax the general rule that it is better to keep a witness than let him go. In some cases before an inquiry can be ordered many of the witnesses have scattered, and very often those we can detain represent the minimum of those we want.<lb/>
In wreck inquiries the object is to bring the inquiry on for hearing as soon as possible after a wreck or casualty is reported, and assuming that all the essential evidence available is in the United Kingdom depositions and statements are taken as soon as possible after the casualty, and preparation is made for holding the inquiry as quickly as can be. But to prevent seamen shipping again to sea it is necessary to detain them from the very moment they have made their depositions or given their statements, so as to ensure their presence at the inquiry. There is a scale of allowance to men who are detained, but that, of course, does not affect the question of the subsequent loss of employment which they may suffer after the inquiry. The scale of allowance to which I have referred is paid to them day by day unless they are actually in the employ of and being paid by the owners, which not infrequently happens when they are of use to their employers on shore. But even in the case of wreck inquiries, which, as I have said, are held as soon as possible, no exception is taken to a witness shipping for a short voyage in the coasting or home trade if it is ascertained that it is practically certain that he will be back in time for the inquiry, and in the case of those inquiries which cannot be held for a long time owing to the fact that evidence has to be obtained from abroad&#x2014;and this not infrequently happens&#x2014;witnesses are constantly allowed to ship for two or three months voyages on their undertaking to acquaint the Local Receiver of Wreck of their return; and wherever representation is made before an inquiry takes place that detention until the inquiry is held in any particular case may mean serious loss of employment or the loss of permanent employment, every care is
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0347"/>
<col>685</col>
taken to examine the man's evidence to see whether it is essential or can be corroborated by someone else with a view to releasing him from attendance.<lb/>
But in considering this question there are two points which should not be lost sight of. The first is that these wreck inquiries undoubtedly do contribute and have contributed in a marked degree to the interest of the shipping fraternity in general. A great deal of very useful information has been got from these inquiries which has contributed materially to greater safety. Secondly, we must be careful that in our desire to exempt certain officers of the mercantile marine from the hardships of detention as witnesses we do not thereby inflict hardship upon the officers whose conduct is called in question. An officer who gives evidence to-day which is of the greatest importance, even essential, to clear the character of another officer whose conduct is called in question, may himself later on be in the position of the officer whose conduct is called in question. I think, therefore, that as regards the question of depositions it is very difficult to do more than say that if, as soon as the inquiry is ordered, a witness can satisfactorily prove to the Board that hardship will result from his detention, then&#x2014;while, of course, the Board cannot absolutely promise that they will exempt him from attendance&#x2014;they will do their utmost to exempt him if by any possibility his evidence can be dispensed with without injustice being done to the interests of the inquiry. I am afraid that on this particular point I have not been able to give very much satisfaction to the noble Lord, but perhaps I may, before leaving this part of the question in reference to Board of Trade inquiries, state that with regard to compensation the scale has been found to work very well&#x2014;that is, compensation during detention until the end of the inquiry.<lb/>
But as regards giving compensation after the inquiry has ceased, a general rule has been made that no compensation can be given in those cases. But last year the Board of Trade took steps to ascertain how far the loss which results to officers detained to give evidence at wreck inquiries could be met by insurance, and they discovered that it was possible to insure officers for a premium of &#x00A3;1 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per cent., or for half that sum for &#x00A3;50, or 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for &#x00A3;25, and in each case this would be paid for detention without proof of loss.</membercontribution></p>
<col>686</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01654"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member><membercontribution>: Am I to understand that the Board of Trade will pay this insurance?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01655"><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: I did not say that. The Board of Trade have discovered that it is possible to insure officers at this rate, and they have brought the matter to the notice of the principal associations of officers and it is under their consideration. With regard to the second portion of the noble Lord's Question relating to detention on shore and loss of employment when summoned to serve on juries, this is a matter which concerns the Home Office. It is, however, the fact that they have received very few complaints with regard to the detention of seamen on shore for service on juries, but they fully recognise that seamen are in a different position from people on shore in this matter, as by being detained they may lose, not one or two days' employment, but the opportunity of securing employment for a whole voyage.<lb/>
The whole question of jury service requires overhauling in view of the many admitted difficulties and inconsistencies of the present system. The Home Secretary has already drawn attention to the matter in the House of Commons and has promised an inquiry. The position of seamen with regard to jury service is a question which could very properly be included in such an inquiry, and when the inquiry is instituted the position of seamen will be carefully considered. As regards the third portion of the Question I am afraid I am not able to give very much satisfaction to the noble Lord, because my remarks as to depositions apply equally in this case as they do in the case of wrecks. Here, again, very few complaints have been received. At the same time the special position of seamen as witnesses in criminal prosecutions has been recognised for many years. For instance, under the regulations made by the Secretary of State under the Criminal Justice Administration Act governing the allowances payable to prosecutors and witnesses special provision is made for seamen, and the amount actually and reasonably incurred for their maintenance during detention on shore may be allowed.<lb/>
The Home Office are always ready&#x2014;and this remark applies equally to the Board of Trade&#x2014;in spite of the hard-and-fast rule which exists as to compensation, to give consideration to any cases of special
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0348"/>
<col>687</col>
hardship. I may say that quite recently the attention of the Home Secretary was drawn to the case of the captain of a ship who had lost his position owing to being kept on shore to give evidence at the Assizes, and on representation being made to the Treasury substantial compensation was actually awarded; and compensation has been awarded in similar cases of great hardship by the Board of Trade. I hope the noble Lord will realise that both of these Departments are anxious, wherever it may be possible, to mitigate any hardship which may fall upon the people in whose favour the noble Lord speaks. They are exceedingly anxious to do everything they can in the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01656"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD ELLENBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I maintain that jury service is an exceedingly unfair and unjust burden to put on seafaring men. It would not be difficult to draw up a Bill exempting them, in the same manner that pilots are exempted. As a matter of fact, a seafaring man does not really reside in the home which throws upon him the obligation of serving on juries. He provides a home for his wife and family, and if during the intervals when he is home from a voyage he is called upon to serve on a jury he may lose his appointment and suffer great hardship in consequence. The laws of this country are made by people who live on land, and as minorities must suffer those who follow the nomad life of the sea have suffered in consequence; but I think all fair-minded people are of opinion that such suffering on the part of minorities should be reduced as much as possible.<lb/>
As regards Board of Trade inquiries, it is true, of course, that evidence on deposition which has not withstood proper examination has by no means the strength of evidence that is given in Court. Therefore I think it would be difficult to draw up a Bill to prevent detention of officers and men in these cases that would in any way meet the justice of the situation without jeopardising others at the inquiries which take place. The Board of Trade do not see their way to draw up such a Bill. I would suggest to my noble friend that he should, in conjunction with the Imperial Merchant Service Guild, endeavour to draw up a Bill containing suitable clauses to deal with this matter. Of course they would have to get the advice of experts, and I dare say the Board of Trade might be inclined to assist them.<lb/>
<col>688</col>
I hope some alteration will be made in the law as to compensation, making the compensation more liberal. I am speaking not only in the interests of mercantile marine officers, but in the interests also of the men before the mast, who frequently get detained to give evidence in various cases and thereby lose their employment. I hope the Board of Trade will continue to study this question, and that by next year they will be able to do something, and that at any rate they will bring in a Bill to relieve seamen from the obligation of serving on juries.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PUBLIC HEALTH (IRELAND) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01657">Order of the Day for the Third Reading, read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01658">Moved, That the Bill be now read 3<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Shaftesbury.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01659"><member>LORD HAVERSHAM</member><membercontribution>: On the Motion for the Third Reading I should like to ask why this Bill, which is a very important one as it affects the inspection of meat for human consumption, is made optional and not compulsory. It is left entirely to the urban district councils in each district in Ireland to decide for themselves whether or not they will make these by-laws. I have some suspicion that this Bill would not have been introduced unless there had been considerable lathes on the part of these authorities in making provision for general slaughterhouses. Therefore I do not think the matter should be left optional. In England in similar cases we are under the most stringent regulations. For instance, in my own neighbourhood there have been two outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, and the consequence is that not a single animal can be moved from any of our farms without the permission of the President of the Board of Agriculture. That is putting the thing as it appears to me on a proper compulsory footing, and I cannot see what confidence the noble Earl can have that under this optional Bill urban district councils in Ireland will exert themselves to make these by-laws and carry them out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01660"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid we always do things differently in Ireland. I understand that this matter was thoroughly thrashed out in the other House, and it was agreed that for the

present at any rate the matter should be optional upon these urban district councils. I imagine that if the Bill is found not to operate in a satisfactory manner a further Bill will be introduced to make it compulsory.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01661"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: As I had the honour of moving the Second Reading of this Bill in the absence of the noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury, perhaps I may say one or two words. With regard to the case of foot-and-mouth disease to which the noble Lord opposite referred, I am certain that if there was foot-and-mouth disease in Ireland our Board of Agriculture would act in exactly the same drastic manner. As to making the Bill compulsory, the noble Earl has pointed out that we do things rather differently in Ireland. Had this Bill been made compulsory there might have been some difficulty in getting it through the House of Commons. We trust that the urban district councils will carry out the Bill, and I have every confidence that they will because in Ireland we are fighting tuberculosis very zealously and there is a strong public opinion on the matter which, I think, will assist in this Bill being efficiently carried out.</membercontribution></p>

<title>LOSSES ON SMALL HOLDINGS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01663"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF NORTHBROOK</member> rose to ask the President of the Board of Agriculture whether his attention has been called to the serious loss sustained by certain tenants of small holdings provided by the Hampshire County Council under the Small Holdings Act, 1908; whether he is aware that the loss to the tenants owing to a storm which occurred in May last amounts practically to an entire year's rent of the holdings; whether under these circumstances there is any power on the part of the county council to make any remission or reduction of rent to the tenants who have so suffered, or whether, in the event of any such tenant being unable to pay the full rent of his small holding, the county council will be compelled by law to take proceedings for the recovery of the rent in order to protect the county ratepayers as far as possible against a loss in respect of any such small holdings; and whether the Board of Agriculture has any power under the Small Holdings Act, 1908, to make any contribution towards compensating tenants who have sustained the losses referred to.</p>
<col>690</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01664">The noble Earl said: My Lords, before asking the noble Earl the Question which stands in my name I wish to explain to your Lordships the circumstances which have led to difficulties with regard to certain tenants under the Hampshire County Council. My object in putting this Question is to obtain from the President of the Board of Agriculture an authoritative statement as to the powers which county councils legally possess of granting assistance in this and similar cases, and how far county councils would be justified in making use of those powers with respect to the obligation that is put upon them of seeing that in the creation of small holdings no loss shall fall upon the ratepayers. The story I have to tell is not a very long one, and I venture to think it is not altogether an uninstructive one. In the year 1909 the Small Holdings Committee to whom the county council of Hampshire delegated their powers considered that it was desirable, in order to provide land for certain applicants in the south-eastern part of the county to purchase a farm which had been offered to them. This farm consisted of 120 acres. It was favourably situated and the soil was suitable for market gardening, and being within eight miles of Portsmouth and of Gosport it had accessible markets for the produce of the small holders.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01665">A scheme was accordingly submitted to the Board of Agriculture and approved by them, and the farm was eventually purchased by the county council at the price of &#x00A3;5,600. We have also spent &#x00A3;73 on redeeming the Land Tax and &#x00A3;75 on repairs and adaptation, and we are spending a further &#x00A3;420 in erecting two cottages on the farm which are now in course of construction. Subsequently a scheme for the adaptation and division of the land was submitted to the Board and approved by them, and the rent to be paid for the farm amounted to &#x00A3;311 17<i>s.,</i> or an average of &#x00A3;2 12<i>s.</i> per acre over the whole of the farm. A certain number of tenants were found who were willing to accept the land on those terms, and they entered into occupation of the farm at Michaelmas, 1909. I think your Lordships will see that from the suitability of the land this farm seemed admirably adapted for the purpose for which it was acquired. The rent, I admit, was a full one, but that, I think, must inevitably be the case when local authorities acquire land which they subsequently let to small holders. I can only
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0350"/>
<col>691</col>
say that the rent that was put upon the land was the lowest possible rent that would recoup the county council for the expenses which they had incurred.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01666">These tenants entered on the holdings with, I think, every prospect of success. I regret to say, however, that that has not been realised, and the purchase of this farm has been found to be satisfactory neither to the county council nor to the tenants. In the first year, unfortunately, swine fever broke out on the farm and forty pigs, the property of our tenants, were slaughtered, and although the tenants received compensation for those pigs they lost what is most valuable to those who grow market garden stuff, the manure which is necessary for maintaining the fertility of the soil. And then, although they did not have a bad season, the price of market garden produce was so low that in many cases it did not pay the small holders to send the stuff into the market. One tenant after a short experience gave up the land. Another of our tenants, who held rather a large holding, at the end of last year became bankrupt and thereby involved the County Council in a loss of &#x00A3;120, half of which, I trust, we shall succeed in obtaining from the Board of Agriculture through the good offices of my noble friend the President. The other tenants carried on through the year and paid their rent, and in May of last year it appeared that they had got through their difficulties of the preceding year and had every prospect of a good season.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01667">But I am sorry to say that this was not to be. For on May 23 last a storm of exceptional violence visited that district and it so happened that the full brunt of this storm, which I believe was in the nature of a cloud break or waterspout, was unfortunately poured on the land in the occupation of our tenants. I received a report from the small holdings officer as to the great amount of damage that had been done. I took the earliest opportunity of myself inspecting the farm, and. if I had not seen it with my own eyes I really could hardly have believed that forty minutes' rain could have wrought such havoc. The crops were washed out of the ground, and the cabbages at the bottom of the hill were smothered and entirely covered over with potatoes and other crops which had been washed down from above. On the top of the hill the soil had been entirely washed away; all
<col>692</col>
the poultry on the farm had been drowned; the gravel of the roads had been washed over the fields and a great part of the manurial value had been washed out of the ground. So violent was the downpour that it washed a plough a distance of 120 yards down the hill, and on the line of railway that runs at the bottom of the farm the train was stopped for a considerable time. I immediately instructed the small holdings officer to go into the question of the amount of loss which these small holders had sustained, and he has estimated the damage at &#x00A3;366, which, as your Lordships will observe, is considerably more than twelve months' rent of the farm.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01668">I should like to say one word about the tenants on this land. They are&#x2014;and I include the man who unfortunately went bankrupt&#x2014;hardworking, industrious men with considerable experience and knowledge of market gardening, but like, I fear, a large number of small tenants under county councils, they have a very limited amount of capital. County councils are frequently accused of having little sympathy with applicants for small holdings and of exaggerating the amount of capital necessary to enable a man to take a small holding. I think those criticisms come from those who have not had much practical experience in regard to land. I can only speak from my own experience in my own county, but can honestly say that I do not think we are liable to that charge. On the contrary, I should say that if Small Holdings Committees are to be blamed at all it is rather for stretching a point in favour of the applicants and in many cases putting men on the land who have not sufficient capital to stand two or three bad seasons.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01669">These unfortunate tenants of ours, owing to this storm, have lost a considerable part of the small capital which they put on the land, and it would appear to be almost impossible for them to pay, certainly to pay in full, the rent that becomes due at Michaelmas next. The question then arises, What are the Small Holdings Committee to do? I understand that the Board of Agriculture have no power to grant any assistance to these men from the Small Holdings Fund, and I take it that the county council would have no right to make any grant or loan to them. Therefore the question remains, What powers have the county council through their Small Holdings Committee of remitting the rent, or at any rate some
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0351"/>
<col>693</col>
portion of the rent, that will become due in a short time? I may say that the Small Holdings Committee, and I as chairman, feel a responsibility in this case in having put the men on the land, and therefore we desire to treat them with every possible consideration. At the same time we have to bear in mind the obligation that we have to the ratepayers in the matter. We have to remember that Mr. Harcourt, when he introduced this Bill in the House of Commons, stated that no part of the payment of rent was to fall on the rates. Lord Robson, who was then a Law Officer of the Crown, stated in the House of Commons that in his opinion the rates were most carefully guarded in this respect by the Act; and I observe that in the last Report of the Small Holdings Commissioners it is stated that county councils are bound to see that the creation of holdings does not result in a loss which will fall on the rates. Therefore our position with regard to these tenants appears to me to present considerable difficulties.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01670">I have seen it stated&#x2014;I do not know whether the President of the Board of Agriculture agrees&#x2014;that county councils should act towards their tenants in the same way that a just and liberal landlord would treat his tenants in similar circumstances. It is hardly necessary for me to point out to your Lordships that there is a vast difference between the position of an individual landowner and the position of a local authority which holds land as trustee of the ratepayers. The individual landlord, of course, if he so wishes, can deal most liberally with his tenants. He can make them an advance of money by loan, he can remit part of their rent, or reduce their rent permanently at his own expense. But county councils are in a perfectly different position and possess no similar powers; and I do not think it will be contended, however much the county council may sympathise with men in this position, that they have any right whatever to exercise their benevolence by putting their hands into the pockets of the ratepayers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01671">Then I know we may be told that this is an exceptional case and therefore may be treated in an exceptional manner. I do trust it is an exceptional case. But there are many other circumstances which are not exceptional and of which we have all
<col>694</col>
had experience, such as the failure of crops through bad weather, or the loss of animals in consequence of disease, which may easily put county council tenants in precisely as difficult a financial position as our tenants find themselves in at the present moment. I should like to know what county councils are to do when they find that their tenants are unable to pay their rent through no fault of their own. Landlords have in the past behaved very generously to tenants in those circumstances, but I should like to know what the view of the Board of Agriculture is as to what county councils should do in similar circumstances. Are county councils to insist on the payment of the rent, and, if the tenants are unable to pay, to put them out of the land? And are they to put on the land other applicants who they have on their books and who possess a little capital? Or, on the other hand, are they to act the benevolent landlord at the expense of the ratepayers? I can only say that if the Board of Agriculture favour the latter view the ratepayers of the country should recognise that sooner or later&#x2014;I think it may be rather sooner than later&#x2014;they will have out of the rates to produce money m order to keep these small tenants on the land.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01672">These are questions of considerable importance to county councils, to the ratepayers whom they represent, and to the tenants who occupy the land. I hope that my noble friend will be able to tell me what the Small Holdings Committee of the Hampshire County Council ought to do in the circumstances which I have endeavoured to describe with regard to these tenants; and I should be grateful to him if he would go rather further than that, and indicate what he considers the general principles should be on which county councils should deal with those cases of tenants who, through no fault of their own, find themselves unable to pay the rents when they become due. I beg to ask the noble Earl the Question that stands in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01673"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was somewhat comforted by the conclusion of the noble Earl's speech. He began by asking me what would be the powers of county councils in certain circumstances, and then he went onto describe a most lamentable catastrophe that had happened to a farm which he described as admirably suited for the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0352"/>
<col>695</col>
purpose of small holdings. The tenants on this farm seem to be persecuted by misfortune. They lost their pigs the first year. In the second year one of their number went bankrupt, though I do not think that is a solitary incident either in the case of a small farmer or a large farmer. The noble Earl stated that the rest were doing fairly well, and he paid them no doubt a just compliment in saying that they were a hard-working and industrious body of men, the unfortunate man who went bankrupt included. Then he went on to tell us that small holders would not be able to stand three or four bad seasons. I should think very likely not. I do not know many farmers who could. If a man has three or four bad seasons running, it must necessarily cripple him to some extent. The noble Earl went on to say that the storm to which he referred destroyed this farm, and he also mentioned his own personal responsibility in having put these persons on the land. I think every fair-minded man would acquit him of any responsibility on that score, as no one could possibly have foreseen such a calamity as a deluge of such violence as to wash a plough 120 yards and to wash away the soil of the farm. I think the case is a very exceptional and a very sad one, and I believe that such a thing will not easily happen again in England whatever may happen in Australia and other countries where they are exposed to devastation by floods.<lb/>
The noble Earl asked me whether there was any power on the part of county councils to make a remission or reduction of rent to tenants who suffer in this way. The noble Earl knows as well as I do that under the Act there are no funds out of which the Board can help these tenants. As regards the remission or reduction of rent the position I am informed on the best authority is that the county council can use their discretion as to the time which should be allowed for payment by those from whom payment may reasonably be expected in course of time, but they are not entitled out of the rates to assist their tenants by contributing in any way towards making up their loss. I think everybody will agree with that. If I had tried to insert any such provision in the Small Holdings Bill, there would have been no earthly chance of my ever seeing a Bill of that sort on the Statute Book. Then the noble Earl asked me what the general principles are. In some cases&#x2014;I hope not in many&#x2014;the
<col>696</col>
county council may find that the finances of their tenants are exhausted, and that recovery of the rent is impracticable. In such cases, they might accept a surrender of the tenancy, and if the tenant, by the assistance of his friends or of any enactment that we may hereafter pass, can obtain the necessary capital to start a fresh tenancy, the council might then help the industrious and hard-working man by reletting the holding to him at a fair rent, having regard to any injury that might have been done to the land in such an exceptional case as the noble Earl has laid before the House. As the Board of Agriculture approved of the scheme tinder which these holdings were provided, it is possible that the Board will have to share with the county council their loss under the scheme, and if the council act on the lines suggested the Board will, of course, most readily and liberally accept any liability that might arise by such action. As I have already privately informed the noble Earl, everybody must consider this an exceptional case, one of real hardship and one in which I firmly believe not only the public but the House of Lords will be glad to assist.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01682"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the House is indebted to my noble friend for the extremely interesting account which he has given us of this episode in the history of what may prove to be a typical case of small holdings. It is, of course, perfectly true, as the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture has told us, that this catastrophe was an exceptional one. I suppose there are many chances to one against a similar cloud-burst taking place in the centre of a patch of allotments; but, as my noble friend truly said, it is not only these exceptional risks which small holders have to run. There are the everyday risks of country life with which we are all familiar&#x2014;epidemics of disease such as swine fever, which the noble Earl particularly mentioned, and which sometimes play havoc amongst allotment holders. Then you may have two or three bad seasons following. I think the noble Earl said it was inconceivable that there should be such a succession of bad seasons. At any rate we can carry our minds hack to a succession of bad seasons in the seventies, when half the farmers in the country would have gone bankrupt if they and their landlords had not stood shoulder to shoulder and made arrangements for tiding over the crisis.<lb/>
What is important is that we have elicited distinctly from the noble Earl that in cases of this kind the only thing which
<col>698</col>
the county council can do is to give time to the tenants who have sustained these losses, although I think he indicated that to some extent the Board of Agriculture was prepared to share the loss with the county councils. I think that is a new development. I do not remember having been told of it before. But the moral, I think, of the whole affair is to enforce what so many of us have ventured to urge from this side of the House. We are in no way hostile to the policy of small holdings, but what we do desire is that that policy should be pursued with the greatest caution possible, and, above all, that men should be chosen who are known to have at any rate a moderate amount of capital with which to work their holdings. But if the kind of policy which I understand the noble Earl advocates of creating small holdings indiscriminately all over the country and in defiance of the better judgment of the county councils who really know what the local circumstances are is pursued I am afraid you will find that the county councils will be saddled with a large number of tenants with perhaps not too much knowledge and with not nearly enough capital, who on the first touch of misfortune will go bankrupt, involving a serious loss to the ratepayers, and possibly, as we now understand, to the taxpayers as well. I am therefore glad that my noble friend has laid this matter fully before the House.</membercontribution></p>

I was not given any explanation why the Government adopted such a <i>non possumus</i> action in regard to this matter. Perhaps the noble Viscount will be able to give me some reason now.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01688"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid I cannot acid anything in substance to what has already been said on this subject by my noble friend behind me. I quite understand the interest that Lord Lamington takes in this matter. He and I were concerned at the same time in Indian administration. But I do rather wonder that he should think it necessary to raise the question in the form he does, because he is really well aware&#x2014;nobody in England is better aware than he is&#x2014;of the line of policy which, wisely or unwisely, His Majesty's Government determined to adopt at the time when Lord Lamington was Governor of Bombay. That policy has up to this point worked most successfully. I am not sure that we were fortunate enough to have the approval of the noble Lord, but he will be glad to know that in our view and in the view of the Government of India to-day&#x2014;though perhaps less so at the time&#x2014;and in the opinion of my noble friend Lord Crewe, that policy has thoroughly justified itself. It is part of that policy, as the noble Lord well knows, that we should avoid entangling ourselves in any responsibility in that wild region the <i>Hinterland</i> of Aden. That was the old policy. Then, for good reasons or bad, the Government of which Lord Curzon was at the head in India took another view. Then we reverted to the older view; and it was part of that policy that we should not entangle ourselves in any responsibility by anything like railway construction, nor should we encourage other people to entangle themselves, and us consequentially, in any such responsibilities. I do not believe that I can add anything to the general line of argument with which my
<col>700</col>
noble friend is thoroughly familiar. It is true that the Turkish authorities are encouraging surveys in their own territories&#x2014;that is to say, in the territory north of the line which was drawn and accepted at the time when my noble friend was Governor of Bombay; but that is no reason at all for our encouraging British subjects or any others in making lines to meet the Turkish line if it is ever constructed. So long as the Turkish line does not violate the line of demarcation settled at the time I am referring to, it cannot be to our interests to permit those for whom we should be ultimately responsible to embark in railway construction. The noble Lord asks for reasons. Those are the reasons. They are plain, and they lie on the surface of the policy which has been adopted, and we see no reason whatever to go back upon them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01689"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: I wish to thank the noble Viscount for his courteous reply. Though I was aware that those circumstances then dictated his policy, still I maintain that the Government cannot for ever take up a dog-in-the-manger attitude and say, "We are not going to do anything ourselves and we are not going to let anybody else do anything." You cannot suppose that you are for ever to prevent a district over which you have assumed some responsibility being opened up and developed in a way in keeping with ordinary civilisation. I believe there have been railway projects put before the Government of India or the Government of Bombay for the purpose of opening up the Aden <i>Hinterland.</i> The responsibility to be assumed by His Majesty's Government would not be pecuniary. It would only be, I presume, in the keeping of good order. I think the noble Viscount exaggerates the character of any disorder that is likely to take place in the Aden <i>Hinterland.</i> The people there are not warlike. Their actual warfare consists of a few people out of each village getting behind rocks and trees and taking pot-shots at their opponents. Possibly a few people are killed, but after a week or two of these operations the war is over. I submit that we cannot for ever assume this <i>non possumus</i> attitude of not allowing the country to be developed by other people. The Government, as I say, would incur no responsibility except that of keeping order, which is a risk of the most remote kind.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THRIFT AND CREDIT SOCIETIES BILL.<lb/> [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01690" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01691">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01692"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, your Lordships were kind enough last session to refer to a Select Committee a Bill dealing with the subject-matter of the Bill of which I am moving the Second Reading. Ample evidence was heard by that Committee from all those best qualified to speak on the subject. Their Report is now in your Lordships' hands, and it is upon that Report and the recommendations contained therein that this Bill has been drafted. I may say that I should have introduced this Bill long ago had I not been led to understand that the Government had the matter in hand and were shortly going to make a move in this direction with the idea of introducing a Bill which I hoped would meet the requirements indicated in my Bill of last year. We waited some time, and our powers of waiting being exhausted I thought there was no better course to pursue than to proceed with this Bill independent of any Government measure, and I think there is ample justification for this procedure from the fact that the Government Bill has only just been brought in. And now that we have seen it in print we find that its operations are confined entirely to England, and that the other parts of the United Kingdom, where an amendment of the law is urgently required, are left out altogether. I do not wish to discuss the Government Bill to-day. It would be premature to do so, and there will be opportunities for criticism when that Bill comes up for Second Reading. But I should like to hazard this opinion, an opinion in which I hope the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture will concur&#x2014;namely, that there is nothing in these two Bills to make them run counter one to the other. There is nothing in them to clash, and if both Bills become law those who are interested in setting up these thrift and credit societies will have the choice of two systems, both of which I believe are sound, and in every way I think it would be an advantage to have the two systems. But, of course, the noble Earl will forgive me if I say that I prefer the existing machinery and this Bill which proposes to improve upon it.<lb/>
<col>702</col>
I will first explain what are the needs which this Bill is intended to meet, and then I propose to show how the Bill meets them. But I would like first to say that this Bill does not seek for powers to set up or establish thrift and credit societies. There is apt to be a little confusion on this point. These powers have existed for a great many years past. The Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, as far back as 1894, hearing of the success of these small agricultural banks on the Continent&#x2014;which banks were created for the purpose of undermining the power and tyranny of the usurer and moneylender&#x2014;made a special study of the systems in vogue on the Continent and finally the Raffeissen system was selected. I do not wish to enlarge upon the reasons for which that system was chosen. There is not time to go into it now. Nor do I wish to weary your Lordships by going into the different systems that exist on the Continent. Suffice it for me to say that the Raffeissen system is the most popular of all, and under that system a number of poor men, powerless to offer individually any degree of security to a banker or a capitalist, join together and create by union greater credit than they could offer individually. The Raffeissen system having been selected by the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, it was found necessary to register these societies under the Friendly Societies Act, and powers were given for this purpose by the Treasury in the year 1898, and the machinery was further greased and helped along in 1899 by the Act introduced and passed by Sir Horace Plunkett. So you will observe that the machinery for setting up these thrift and credit societies has been in existence for many years past, and is applied to the whole of the United Kingdom. This Bill is to improve the existing machinery, to make it more elastic, and we propose to do this upon the lines recommended in the Report of the Select Committee of last year.<lb/>
The needs which this Bill is intended to meet are shortly these. First of all, incorporation. When these thrift and credit societies are registered under the Friendly Societies Act they have, not being incorporated societies, to act through trustees. They cannot sue or be sued, and this is a very cumbersome and tiresome procedure. Under the Indian Act, passed by Lord Curzon in 1904 when he was Viceroy of India to enable thrift and credit banks to exist in India, these banks become <i>ipso</i>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0356"/>
<col>703</col>
<i>facto</i> incorporated societies, and wherever there is machinery set up in the different parts of the Indian Empire for providing these societies they are always <i>ipso facto</i> incorporated societies. We only claim for the United Kingdom the privilege which exists in India. I do not think there is any really valid objection to incorporation being granted to these societies. You will find that the Select Committee, in Paragraph 9 of their Report, unanimously recommend that these societies should have incorporation so as to enable them to sue and be sued and to hold property in their registered names. Provision is made in Clause 3 of this Bill to meet this requirement. Clause 4 is a necessary corollary to Clause 3.<lb/>
Having dealt with the need of incorporation we come to trading. We ask that trading powers should be granted to these thrift and credit societies, which at present are restricted entirely to banking business. Unless power is given to trade there is no alternative but to form a separate society under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, which does give power to trade. This is also a rather cumbersome and troublesome procedure. The whole success of the cooperative movement depends upon getting men voluntarily to combine, and when you have got them to combine you should not surround them with niceties of law. They find it almost impossible to understand why they can act under one Act&#x2014;namely, the Friendly Societies Act&#x2014;and then in order to do something else have to study the Industrial and Provident Societies Act. Then it is asked why cannot two societies be formed in the same district, one for banking purposes and the other for trading purposes. In the backward and poorer districts of Ireland it is found sometimes impossible to get more than one efficient committee or set of officers; to find two would be impossible. So we suggest that the committee should be entrusted not only with banking powers but also with trading powers.<lb/>
I know there is great diversity of opinion on this question. The Select Committee of your Lordships' House went most thoroughly into the question, and weighed most carefully all the evidence they could get on the point. Amongst others we had the evidence of Sir George Murray, whose severance from the Treasury I am sure your Lordships all regret. Sir George Murray stated that he saw no fundamental objection
<col>704</col>
to permitting thrift banks to be carried on together with trading&#x2014;of course subject to certain safeguards; and the safeguards he suggested were that you would have to restrict very closely the area in which these unlimited societies act, and that the question of unlimited liability would have to be thoroughly safeguarded also. We propose to do both of these things in this Bill. You will see in Clause 5 that rules are provided for restricting the area in which these societies can operate, and subsection (<i>a</i>) says that the rules of a thrift and credit society shall provide that it shall carry on business only within such area as may be specified in the rules, not exceeding ten miles from the registered office of the bank. We also suggest that separate accounts shall be kept of trading transactions. I think there is no real cause for alarm with regard to these trading powers.<lb/>
Then comes the need of setting up central societies. Having encouraged individuals to co-operate and form small societies of their own, you have to go a step further and get those societies when they are formed to federate into a central society. This is done in all co-operative movements, and we suggest that it should be done in the thrift and credit co-operative movement. In this case the central society has certain functions allotted to it which are clearly set out in the Bill. If your Lordships will look at Clause 7 you will find that the central society has for its object the receipt of deposits and the creation of funds to be lent out to thrift and credit societies, and generally to assist the working and development of such societies; and the thrift and credit societies may hold shares and make deposits in and become members of such central society. There is provision for a certain amount of inspection and auditing of the accounts of these societies. This is a point to which I know Lord Welby attaches great importance, and rightly so. He may not be satisfied with the provisions in the Bill to meet this point, and, if so, no doubt he will offer criticisms and I hope suggestions on the point. At the same time I think that we must be careful not to have too rigid a system of inspection with regard to these societies or an undue amount of interference on the part of the Government or anybody else which would be inclined to be looked upon with suspicion by the members of the society. I hope and believe the Bill does make good and sufficient provision for the auditing of the accounts of these
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0357"/>
<col>705</col>
societies. Those are the three needs which this Bill is framed to meet.<lb/>
All the other clauses are fairly straight. forward. Clause 10 deals with the liability of past members of a society at the dissolution of the society, and Clause 11 is to prevent a contingeney which might occur&#x2014;namely, a society might be set up and reserve funds got together simply for the purpose, when there is a good surplus fund available, of breaking up the society and sharing out alike. Therefore it is necessary to put in a provision that upon the dissolution of a thrift and credit society such funds should be devoted to an object of public utility in the area in which the society carried on its business. In suggesting central societies I would like to make it quite clear that those engaged in the banking business need take no umbrage in this matter. Indeed this proposal ought to facilitate the banking system. One of the most important banks in Germany has intimate relations and has come to a regular arrangement with two great cooperative unions, of which the Raffeissen Union is one, and I think the central societies might be a stepping stone between the small village credit societies and the banking system of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01693">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Shaftesbury.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01694"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think anybody would complain of the noble Earl for introducing a Bill on a subject of which he is undoubtedly the pioneer in your Lordships' House. On the contrary, everybody who takes an interest in credit societies&#x2014;and I believe their name is legion on both sides of the House&#x2014;would congratulate him on having done so, and perhaps I may be allowed to congratulate him also on the lucid and plain manner in which he explained his somewhat intricate Bill. The noble Earl said that he had been waiting a long time for a Bill to come from this side of the House, and that he thought it his duty not to delay bringing his Bill forward any longer. I might say, in explanation of the apparent delay on our part, that it has been our object in all our land legislation not to rush it hastily before the public, but to try to build it up stone by stone and brick by brick and place it on an economic basis. We try to make it safe and practical, and we try to make it self-paying. That is the reason why, in a complex matter of this sort, we thought it right to consider the
<col>706</col>
question very carefully before venturing to submit a Bill of this importance to your Lordships.<lb/>
The noble Earl said he thought there was nothing in his Bill which ran counter to the Bill which I shall have the honour to ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading to on Tuesday next. I will not go into that. But I hope your Lordships will extend favourable consideration to my Bill, as the subject is of such importance that the Leader of the Opposition has himself asked the Government to grant facilities for its passage through both Houses. The noble Earl's Bill and my own Bill will both be of great use and assistance to those small holders who have been under discussion this afternoon on the Question put by Lord Northbrook, and perhaps I may be pardoned for saying one word on that subject. One would think, from what has been said on the opposite Benches, that small holdings were a new discovery. People ask, What in the name of fortune is to happen if these small holders are subject to bad seasons? It seems to be thought that small holdings are something new in England. On the contrary, before our Act was ever thought of there were a quarter of a million small holdings, 6,000 of which exist in Hampshire alone. In my wildest dreams I never could have hoped that I would get 6,000 small holdings in Hampshire during the two and a half years in which the Act has been in operation. Yet there are all these lamentations and prognostications of ruin! The great majority of the 6,000 small holders in Hampshire have gone through the bad times mentioned by Lord Lansdowne in the seventies and eighties. They have gone through the cattle plague and the outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, and are still in existence at this moment. These croakings are really very far-fetched, and it is as well for the people of England to know that there is nothing new in the system of small holdings. They have existed for years and years and have been able to pay their way, and there is no reason to suppose that the new small holdings will be in any way less successful or less a boon than were the small holdings in days gone by.<lb/>
Lord Shaftesbury in his Bill proposes that these societies should be started subject to what I think may be described as a rigid set of rules. If you look at pages 1 and 2 of the Bill you will see that the rules of
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0358"/>
<col>707</col>
a thrift and credit society shall provide quite a number of things&#x2014;from paragraph (<i>a</i>) to paragraph (<i>j</i>). The noble Earl apparently contemplates that these societies should obtain money from a central authority registered under the Companies Consolidation Act, 1908. I venture to suggest to the noble Earl, as our experience is so very limited at the present time, whether it would not be better to avoid being so precise at the beginning. Would it not be better to allow plenty of latitude and allow these societies to develop naturally and in the way that is most suited to British conditions as experience may show? I quite agree that the noble Earl's Bill applies to Ireland and Scotland, and that my own Bill applies to England alone.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01695"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl is mistaken in thinking that my Bill lays down a hard-and-fast rule that these banks are to obtain their money from the central society. Clause 7 only gives power to the central society to set up reserve funds, but there are many other ways in which thrift and credit societies could obtain working expenses, and probably the last persons they would go to would be the central society.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01696"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: The rules I was referring to are in Clause 5. I was not referring to the rules in Clause 7. One considerable advantage that this country possesses over other countries is in our great banking system, and I hardly think the noble Earl quite recognised that fact so as to utilise it as far as possible. One way, I think, in which his object might be attained would be by securing the confidence of the existing banking system by providing for a more independent audit, and one on which the banks could independently rely. By the noble Earl's Bill the audit of all these societies is to be made by some person connected with the society and not by an independent person. Then we hope to secure their co-operation by framing rules so as to satisfy the legitimate requirements of bankers. I think the most important thing which is left out of the noble Earl's Bill is that the Government should take some active part in the formation of such societies. I am all against, and never would have anything to do with, these great schemes of dipping one's hands into the pockets of the public Treasury and bringing out tens of millions for experimental objects, however good those objects may be; but I think that the Board of
<col>708</col>
Agriculture should take an active part in the formation of these societies by paying the preliminary expenses, so as to provide them with a secretary, set them on their legs and help them through the most critical part of their life&#x2014;that would be, of course, when they were first being formed. Perhaps the House would agree that the best coarse would be to proceed with the Government's Bill with its financial provisions first, and incorporate in it any provision from the noble Earl's Bill which it might; be desired to include. I venture to throw out that suggestion to the noble Earl. I need hardly repeat how very much we on this side of the House welcome his having brought forward a Bill on this most important subject, and we do not propose to offer any opposition to the Second Reading. We heartily welcome it as far as it goes as an earnest of the desire to come to some decision on a great policy which both sides of the House have at heart.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01697"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WELBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very glad that the noble Earl has brought this measure to the Second Reading. I think, considering the time that the Bill has been before the House and the fact that it has been submitted to a carefully chosen Select Committee, it is very undesirable that there should be ally further delay in getting the opinion of this and the other House of Parliament upon the important provisions embraced within it. My noble friend below me (Lord Carrington) remarked on what he considered the rigid provisions of this Bill. I have looked carefully through these provisions, and I am afraid I cannot altogether agree with him. I think the provisions are in themselves not over-rigid, but such as are calculated to maintain and promote the credit of the banks established under them. My noble friend appears to think that these banks may interfere, or perhaps I should say be unpopular, with the ordinary banks of the country. The real fact is that the great stream of credit can never reach these small persons in villages, people who want a loan of a few pounds, and who have not enough credit of their own. One great merit in this Bill to my mind is the manner in which it encourages that spirit of self-help which has developed itself of late in Ireland. The noble Earl's Bill provides that districts should be formed and that the societies established in those districts should be limited to carrying on their business within
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0359"/>
<col>709</col>
those areas. The consequence is that all the members of the societies will be well known to each other, and I lay immense stress on the fact that they will be able to gauge the real credit of the humblest member of the society who comes to them for a loan. The loan so granted is one that could never be granted by a bank. No joint stock bank could go into an inquiry as to the credit of these humble persons.<lb/>
We must all have been struck by the very great progress that has been made in Ireland within the last thirteen or fourteen years. The idea of co-operation has really taken root in Ireland, and the number of societies already created by the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society is remarkable. There have been established 357 dairy societies, 106 agricultural societies, and 268 of these credit societies, turning over between them a sum of between &#x00A3;2,000,000 and &#x00A3;3,000,000. I believe that the benefit which this system of co-operation is having in Ireland will be very much increased by the passing of this Bill. The Bill as the noble Earl introduced it last year was very carefully considered by Lord Mersey's Committee. That Committee carefully considered whether it was safe to allow these thrift and credit banks also to undertake cooperative trading. One of the great objects of the whole system of co-operation is that the bodies with whom money is deposited, who collect money for the purpose of making these loans, should have as many advantages as possible towards increasing those deposits; and it was conclusively proved before the Committee that trading co-operation, under certain proper limitations, might safely be entrusted to societies in small districts, especially when it was coupled with the condition that trading should only be carried on with the members of the society. I think, with the safeguards provided in the Bill, the power of trading might be extended to these banks, though I know that as a general rule it is not considered desirable that trading and banking should go together.<lb/>
This country is exceedingly behindhand in this question of co-operation. We have only to look abroad to see what an enormous extension of co-operative trading has taken place. I believe there are no fewer than 17,000 of these trading societies in Germany. The great central Bank of Prussia, which was established almost on purpose to act
<col>710</col>
as a central bank to the societies throughout the country, has an enormous capital and turnover. If you turn to France you find very much the same state of things. The Bank of France is obliged to lend &#x00A3;4,000,000 free of interest to the societies which carry out loans of this kind, and almost wherever you turn you find credit societies of this kind advancing small loans to humble agriculturists who cannot get the advantage of banking accounts or that acquaintance with bankers which would enable them to obtain small loans. I should like to see the same facilities extended throughout the agricultural districts of this country.<lb/>
The audit question has been alluded to. I am not satisfied with the provision on that subject in this Bill. I need not allude to it now, because that is essentially a question for Committee, and it is one on which I feel certain the House would desire that proper precautions should be taken. One point I hope will not be lost sight of in connection with these measures. In Ireland the progress that has been made has been based on self-help almost entirely, and I look upon the progress which has been made there as one of the most promising signs of the times. I therefore trust that this Bill, and supplementary measures if necessary, may find favour with your Lordships and the other House of Parliament, in order that the principle of thrift and co-operation may be more fully availed of.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01698"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: There is only one word I wish to say in reply to the observations of the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture. I would point out that the Bill permits outsiders to be elected by the societies for the purpose of inspection. And with regard to the noble Earl's criticism that it would be better to bring the Government into this Bill, I would remind him that the principle is to try and drive home to the people of this country the value of self-help and not to encourage them to look to the Government for everything.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01721"><member>THE EARL OF CROMER</member><membercontribution>: I do not rise in any way to oppose this Clause., but merely to remove any possible misapprehension that might arise as to the probable application of paragraph (<i>e</i>). It might be thought at first sight that physiologists who engaged in experiments on living animals would be liable to prosecution to a greater extent than the present law admits. That view, however, would be erroneous, for this subsection must be taken in connection with subsection (3) of this clause which expressly exempts from the operation of the Bill all operations conducted under the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876. That Act admits of experiments being conducted on living animals under certain conditions. In these circumstances I should like to say, as President of the Research Defence Society, that that society is generally in entire accord with the objects which the Bill seeks to attain. Indeed, many of the members of that society are also members of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and welcome any attempts made to stop wanton cruelty. I may say I think that the promoters of this Bill have exercised a very wise discretion in leaving the vivisection question alone. Your Lordships are probably aware that a Commission has been sitting for some four or five years on that subject, and it would be manifestly undesirable to deal with a highly controversial matter of this sort until that Commission has sent in its Report. I should here like to express my earnest hope that that Report will not be very
<col>714</col>
much longer delayed. A year ago I asked the noble Earl, Lord Beauchamp, a question on the subject, and he told me that he would do his best to hasten the publication of the Report.

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01766">The noble Lord said: This subsection was in the Bill as originally introduced in he House of Commons, but was struck out on the Motion of an English Member, here happening to be no Irish Members present. It is almost word for word the same as the proviso in Clause 2 f the Poisoned Flesh Prohibition Act of 1864, 27 and 28 Vic., c. 115. That Act is repealed by this Bill, and therefore it is necessary to insert this subsection to give Irish farmers the same over of protecting their stock as they had under the previous Act. The proposed withdrawal of this power has been received with absolute consternation in Ireland, and any one who knows that country is not surprised at it. The country is infested with wandering dogs of one description or another. Every occupier, even the smallest cottager, keeps a dog, with what object nobody can ascertain, hey are of no use whatever, but the dog tax being only 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in Ireland they continue to be kept. These dogs fill up their time in the day by barking after every one who is driving or riding on the roads, and at night by roaming over the country for miles seeking what icy can devour. They are never tied up except when the owners know that land in the locality is poisoned.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01767">To show the feeling that exists in Ireland on the subject I will read a resolution passed by the Agricultural Committee
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0364"/>
<col>719</col>
of the Armagh County Council and also by the Armagh Board of Guardians. There would have been, I have no doubt, many similar resolutions adopted by other bodies: if time had permitted it. The resolution to which I have referred runs as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"That the attention of all Irish Members o Parliament lie drawn to the Protection of Animals Bill which has been read a third time in the House of Commons, and to the Amendment inserted at the instance of Mr. Ashley, which will prevent owners and occupiers of land in Ireland from laying down poisonous matter after a warning notice has been posted and the local constabulary informed. There are few Irish farmers who have not suffered through having their sheep and lamb worried at night, by dogs, and if they are prohibited from protecting themselves by laying down poison, not only will the loss be much greater, but farmers in many districts will be obliged to cease keeping sheep. We therefore appeal to all Irish Members of Parliament to use their influence to prevent the Amendment, in question from becoming law."</quote>
I have also received the following letter from the Secretary of the Dublin Farmers' Association&#x2014;
<quote>"My Lord, I understand that it is your Lordship's kind intention to move an Amendment in Committee to that clause of the Animals Protection Bill which aims at depriving Irish farmers of the liberty to poison their lands, which is the principal means at their disposal to protect their flocks from the depredations of straying dogs. My Committee and I feel sure all Irish farmers will feel grateful for your Lordship's sympathetic interest in getting this threatened grievance averted. The heavy Losses annually inflicted by canine marauders constitute one of the most serious disabilities under which the sheep breeding industry suffers, and should your Lordship desire to be furnished with some specific information as to the extent of these losses I shall be quite ready to supply same."</quote>
Unfortunately as the Committee stage of this Bill was originally put down for last Tuesday, I had not sufficient time to obtain this specific information; but a letter which appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> a few days ago gives an instance of what takes place. The writer says&#x2014;
<quote>"Would you allow me space to enter a protest against the law being changed, which allows farmers in Ireland to put out poison on their lands after proper notices have been posted on the lands and served on the police? Not long ago I had a valuable flock of brood ewes, which were attacked by dogs at night, and two of them killed. I complained to the police, who I found were unable to help me. On the other hand, I was informed that if I shot these dogs I would be liable to prosecution or an action for damages. I watched at night, but though the dogs came and rushed the sheep out of my fields I was unable to identify them, and to catch them was quite impossible. Next night they came again and hunted one of the sheep into some bushes, in which it was held by the head. The dogs ate off all the hind quarters and part of the back while it was alive, and what was left by the dogs was alive the following morning when I found
<col>720</col>
it. I then cut up and poisoned the pieces of this sheep, and next day I had two immense brutes dead in the field. Nobody about this district could identify them, and the owner has never been known. I lost a good many of these ewes during THE lambing season from the result of the hunting, and their sufferings were very great."</quote>
Apart from the serious loss suffered by farmers, the question of humanity also comes in. This Bill is for the protection of animals, and surely the unfortunate sheep are quite as much entitled to protection as the dogs which worry them. I therefore beg to move; the insertion of the new subsection standing in my name.</p>

Under the recent Act all small holdings were protected from compulsory acquisition&#x2014;that is to say, where a landowner or his predecessors had established small holdings upon the estate the county council could not come down upon that property and say that they wished to compulsorily acquire those small holdings. Now the noble Earl has brought in an amending Bill which, after certain experiences in Committee to which I shall not refer, has emerged in this form&#x2014;that only
<col>722</col>
the interest of the cultivator in the small holdings is to be protected. So far the noble Earl has modified his original proposal. But the interest of the owner in the small holdings is not to be protected. I do not ay that it is very likely, on the face of it, that a county council would wish compulsorily to acquire a small holding from which they could not disturb the occupier, but they might wish to do it having regard to the general policy which they were carrying out in the district. I do not think that your Lordships would desire to encourage the interference of county councils in the ownership of small holdings any more than in the occupation of small holdings. It may be a good plan, but we have had no argument from the noble Earl why this distinction should be made. The facts upon which the noble Earl has gone, are, we know, extremely exiguous. Indeed, there was only one particular instance which he was able to give us. What he has now to establish is the distinction between ownership and occupation. If he is willing to protect the occupier, why is he not willing to protect the owner as well?</membercontribution></p>

<title>PRIVATE BILLS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01836"><sup>*</sup><member>THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES (THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to move the Motion that stands in my name. The first group of these Amendments to the Standing Orders is rendered necessary by the adoption, which is commencing to be widespread, of the trolley vehicle system. There have been a number of Bills before your Lordships' Rouse this session, following on, I think, two Bills which received the Royal Assent last year, and it is in order to bring Bills dealing with this subject under the operation of the Standing Orders that the first group of Amendments is necessary. The second addition to the Standing Orders that will result if your Lordships pass this Motion will be found in the new Standing Order which deals with accommodation and service for workmen in cases of works of considerable magnitude. This Standing Order is the result of negotiation with the Government Department concerned and with the authorities in another place, and I am glad to understand that the President of the Local Government Board intends to move a similar Amendment in the Standing Orders of the other House. The last point dealt with is the amendment of Standing Order No. 113. The words to be added enact that no tramway shall be authorised to be made across any railway on the level. I think I can claim that the merits of that provision explain and justify the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<title>AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND INSURANCE<lb/> SOCIETIES BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01865" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01866">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01867"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES (EARL CARRINGTON)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the object of the Bill which I have the honour to ask your Lordships to read a second time is to promote the formation and extension of agricultural credit and insurance societies. It is recognised on all hands that there is a necessity for some such legislation, and in framing this Bill we have had two main objects in view. Tile first is this. In view of our limited experience in this country we have thought it necessary not to attempt to frame any very precise code of rules, such as were adumbrated in Lord Shaftesbury's Bill which was read a second time last week, as to the working and constitution of these societies. Secondly, we have tried to frame the Bill, and I hope we have to some extent succeeded, so as to secure what is an absolute necessity&#x2014;the confidence and co-operation of the leading bankers of this country.<lb/>
I will now briefly explain the main provisions of the Bill. If your Lordships will look at Clause 1 you will see that, as it is most important that the Board of Agriculture should take an active part in the formation of these societies, we propose to pay the preliminary expenses, not exactly in the same way but on the same lines as in the Small Holdings Act, so as to enable the societies to run alone and to put them, as it were, on their legs; but it must not for one moment be supposed that the Board of Agriculture in any way intend to dispense with voluntary help. On the contrary, we
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0371"/>
<col>733</col>
want as far as possible to enlist it; but having done so much towards bringing the new system of small holdings into existence, we feel that it is our duty to secure for the present small holders all possible means by which they may be able to achieve the success which noble Lords on both sides of the House so earnestly desire.<lb/>
The societies may at present register under two Acts of Parliament. They can register under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act of 1893, which, as your Lordships are aware, permits limited liability, and also under the Friendly Societies Act of 1896, which permits unlimited liability. We propose to enable societies to register either with unlimited liability or with liability limited by guarantee. These are very complicated Acts. I have tried to make our intention intelligible, but I will explain again that our intention is to allow these small holdings societies to be registered under both Acts either with unlimited liability or with liability limited by guarantee. A man would guarantee so much, and his liability would be limited to the amount that he had guaranteed.<lb/>
The word "guarantees" brings me to the next point, and that is that we hope and believe that we shall have no necessity to ask for State guarantees. We are very strong on that point, as all our land legislation has been attempted to be made as self-supporting as possible; and as your Lordships know from the debates that have taken place within the last few weeks, we have resolutely set our face against any schemes, however good the results might be, if they necessitated the dipping of hands into the public purse to carry out those experiments. But the initial difficulties in the formation of these societies are very great. I will mention one or two. There are difficulties in regard to the framing and registering of the rules and the appointment of a secretary, and a secretary is an absolute necessity before these societies can properly run alone. There is also the difficulty of hiring a room or an office for holding meetings to explain the objects of these societies to the agricultural population, and also the expenses of management. Therefore to meet these difficulties and these necessary expenses we propose that a grant should be made out of the Small Holdings Account. That Account was originally granted to me for contingencies of various
<col>734</col>
descriptions in connection with the formation of small holdings. Between three and four years ago I was given &#x00A3;100,000, and I think there is at least &#x00A3;40,000 of that money still available out of the original grant, and it might be expended for this purpose. I think this will meet the difficulty which I suppose induced Lord Mersey's Committee to approve of the combination of trading and banking with unlimited liability which is adumbrated in the Report signed by the noble and learned Lord. As I have said before, that is a combination which I do not think for one moment would meet with approval in the banking world.<lb/>
In Clause 2, subsection (1), paragraph (<i>b</i>) we provide that the accounts of the society shall be audited by a person nominated by the Board. To those words we attach great importance. It is considered an essential point, and I think your Lordships will agree that there should be a very strict and proper audit of the accounts of these societies. That is, of course, considered an essential point by the great banking interest if they are in any way to help the scheme. I think I have now explained the main provisions of the Bill. Its object is to secure sums as working capital for agriculturists of small means, from whom up to the present moment all assistance has been withheld. We propose to secure these sums as working capital for productive purposes, and for productive purposes only. It cannot be too clearly explained that this Bill is not introduced in any way to enable farmers or others to purchase land. The object of the Bill is to foster agricultural co-operative credit and insurance, and to utilise the existing agencies and authorities, educational and otherwise, and to prevent the overlapping that at present exists. The object is also to provide for the expense of forming societies, for auditing their accounts, and for the organisation of accredited societies by properly trained men. That is one of the great difficulties at the present time. We have not men properly trained for this work. This must be done cautiously, for if the wrong sort of persons are sent helter skelter over England to assist in the formation of these societies the result will be very different from what we hope for and have every reason to anticipate under the Bill.<lb/>
Some people are contending in the newspapers that this Bill is only a skeleton, but

I repeat that our land policy is to go step by step and to build up stone by stone and brick by brick. Our endeavour all the way through has been not to dip our hands deep into the public purse, but to see that our land legislation is practical, economical, and self-supporting. I am not asking for any large sum of money for an experiment, however good that experiment may be. I am trying to initiate by degrees a system which will be financially sound, and, I hope, approved of by the great banking houses and acceptable to the hard-working small holders, whom it is the object of both sides to assist. I beg to move that this Bill be read a second time.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01869"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD FABER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened with great interest to the words which fell from the noble Earl, and with all the more interest because the noble Earl was good enough to allow a group of bankers, of whom I happened to be the chairman, to have a conversation with him on certain features of this Bill. I said then, and I say now, that bankers are very willing indeed to find help for large and small farmers and for these credit societies if it is a proper business proposition. They look first of all and last of all to that. I have heard the proposition put forward that if a man has nothing and ten such men, each of them having nothing, are banded together and become a society, those ten men are more worthy of credit than the one; but I have never been able to see how ten men who have nothing could be more trustworthy than one man who has nothing. That, at all events, would not be a business proposition. As regards the audit of the accounts I think that is an important matter, and so far as that goes, if we can be of any assistance to the noble Earl in lending him trained men for auditing the accounts of the societies we will do so gladly.<lb/>
It has been said up and down the country that bankers have not been sufficiently liberal in the past to big farmers, and perhaps more especially to small farmers. That is very easy to say, but let us analyse it, remembering the fact, first of all, that banks have large sums of money deposited with them by their customers and the public, and that their first care must be to see that those funds are not placed in any jeopardy
<col>736</col>
by what I may call bad banking. I speak in this matter from ray own personal experience, and I will take you back to the year 1872. During the twenty years previous to 1872 farmers had been exceedingly good customers of bankers. They had got into the confidence of bankers, who let them have what they wanted and they never had any reason to regret it. But in the year 1875 there happened to farmers what happens constantly to whole groups of trades. Somehow or other the farming interest collapsed and land values collapsed, and bankers had to face considerable losses&#x2014;losses which a good many of them remember even to this day. What the cause of that sudden collapse was I know not, but looking back I think there were several causes. One cause was the state of luxury in which farmers had come to live, more luxury than the circumstances warranted, and they did not work as hard as they should have done. Then, again, we had disastrous wet seasons, and above all we had the great oncoming of the Western States of America, and wheat was literally shovelled over to the Continent of Europe and to this country. Consequently the price of wheat fell, and that injured the farmers as well. That lasted from 1875 to 1900 and perhaps later.<lb/>
But of recent years farmers seem to me to be doing better. They are paying more attention to their business and prices are better, and, after all, I suppose population has been increasing faster than the wheat lands have come under cultivation. That, too, has helped farmers. I repeat that the bankers are ready to be of use to the farmers of this country. I do not speak in a political or philanthropic sense, but as a business man. If the propositions which you put before us are reasonably sound and if they will not endanger the safety which we are obliged to accord to our depositors, then we will vote for them with both hands; and as far as I am concerned I support the Second Reading of this Bill, which I think is a very fair and prudent one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01870"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise to make any severe criticism on the merits of the noble Earl's proposal. He has heard from a noble Lord eminently qualified to speak words of considerable approval of the Second Reading of this Bill. But what I did rise just to note is the serenity with which the noble Earl and
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0373"/>
<col>737</col>
his Department carry on their business, as if there was no great cataclysm of crisis going on at the same time. No one reading the draft of the noble Earl's Bill would believe that the main subject of discussion throughout the country is the invasion by the Lords of the financial privileges of the House of Commons. Yet when we read this Bill it appears to be a breach of privilege from one end of it to the other, and it is very interesting as showing how different the practice of the Government is from their theory.<lb/>
In Clause 2 it is proposed that your Lordships should enact that certain grants should be made out of the Small Holdings Account. Now that account is a pure taxpayers' account. Even if it were a ratepayers' account that would not make any difference in the rigid theory which is prescribed by the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack. But I believe it is a taxpayers' account, and yet we are asked by His Majesty's Government, without the benefit of italics, to vote with great solemnity for certain heavy obligations being thrown on the taxpayers of the country by the anachronism in which I have the honour to speak at this moment. And when I go on and read Clause 3 I am so shocked that I hardly dare remind your Lordships of the fact that we are positively asked to pass a provision in which certain expenses are to be met out of "moneys provided by Parliament." That, of course, we all know is the consecrated phrase meaning the Appropriation Act. So that your Lordships are almost asked to initiate an Appropriation Act in this House. Perhaps this little experience may convince noble Lords opposite how absurd are the exaggerations of the financial privileges of the House of Commons which they habitually push upon us. If we had submitted any such proposal as this in the course of Amendments in your Lordships' House, we should have been held up throughout the length and breadth of the country as invading the privileges of the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01871"><member>THE EARL OF MAYO</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not rise to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill, but the noble Earl the President of the Board of Agriculture said that his Board were going to initiate these credit and insurance societies, and I wish to

say that we have found in Ireland that it is much better that the farmers themselves should first form the societies and then that the Department should help them. For myself I believe greatly in self-help. Then the noble Earl spoke about sending people helter skelter over England to promote the formation of these societies. I do not know about helter skelter, but he will certainly have to send people down to explain the whole scheme and ask the farmers to come forward and establish these credit societies. In my opinion the noble Earl is beginning at the wrong end. I think the small holders themselves should be asked to start the societies, and if the Board of Agriculture found them going on well they might step in and help them. I regret that the proposal in this Bill does not commence with self-help. It commences with help from a Government Department, which, as I say, we in Ireland do not think is the right way to begin.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01877"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid that this Bill may be open to some of the criticisms which the noble Marquess opposite poured out upon its predecessor, for it is a Bill which proposes to appoint more Judges and to pay for them. But, unfortunately, it is never wholly possible to separate money from policy. That is a thesis of which we have had illustration in the last few weeks in the course of debate, and a thesis which has
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0374"/>
<col>739</col>
led no doubt to many views being expressed; but there has never been any reason why we in this House should not have amicable conversations on matters which touch finance, provided they are in the nature of conversations undertaken for the purpose of illustrating policy. I have another apology to make. This Bill is not one which, strictly speaking, concerns the War Department. It belongs to the Department of the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack, but although he takes the deepest interest in the Bill he has asked me to introduce it, partly because I was with him present at the Imperial Conference, partly because the subject is one in which I have taken great interest for many years, and partly because I have recently been sitting in the Judicial Committee and when at the Bar I had a long experience of these matters.<lb/>
We think that the problem of how to put the appellate jurisdiction of the Empire on a proper footing will never be adequately solved until there is a real Supreme Court of Appeal for the Empire. At present the appellate jurisdiction is divided between this House and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, or rather the Privy Council itself on the Report of the Judicial Committee, and there has been a feeling for a long time that we are reaching a period when a real Imperial Court of Appeal would be more truly in accord with the Constitution of the Empire. That is our view, but it is one thing to have that view and to be able to eat the cherry all at one bite. Before the jurisdiction of this House can be touched Constitutional questions must be discussed. In the course of the debate on the Reconstitution Bill the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition, and, I think, other speakers&#x2014;Lord Rosebery notably&#x2014;expressed the view that there was no reason why the Law Lords who represent the appellate side should sit in this House. I think that view was received with a good deal of dissent. But many held the view that the time has come when a Supreme Appeal Court for the Empire is a possible thing. That view is taken in the Dominions. It was considered at the Imperial Conference on a Resolution brought up from New Zealand, and it was also supported in another Resolution from Australia. But until the constitution of this House is generally dealt with a convenient opportunity does not appear to offer for separating
<col>740</col>
what is certainly an important feature of the existence of this House, and therefore we have devoted ourselves to producing the substance and laying the foundations without going the full length.<lb/>
What we propose to do is to lay the foundations for what is virtually and in substance a single Court of Appeal for the whole Empire, although it will sit under two forms&#x2014;at times as the Court of Appeal of your Lordships' House and at other times as the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. At the present time the appellate business of the Empire consists of two parts&#x2014;the appeals that come from the United Kingdom, which form the greater part of the business and number, I think, over 100 in each year, and the appeals from the Dominions, the Crown Colonies, and the Channel Islands, which form an important but a smaller part of the business. In the year 1910 there were seventy-eight of these appeals. Of these more than half came from India and of the remainder rather more than half came from Canada, the rest being from the remaining parts of the Empire. Your Lordships will see what enormous variety is there presented. I remember once, in a period of three weeks at the Bar, arguing a series of appeals which illustrated the extraordinary character of the business which comes before the supreme tribunal for the rest of the Empire. The first appeal came from Burma; the next came from New Zealand, and dealt with the customs of the Maoris; the third case was from Quebec, and dealt with the old French law; then there was a Roman Dutch appeal from the Cape; an appeal from the Channel Islands; one from Malta; another from Australia; and we finished up by returning to an Indian case&#x2014;an appeal from the High Court of Bombay. That is what is going on for more than half the year in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and it is enough to mention those cases to show what an important Court it is and what high quality is required in the Judges.<lb/>
An interesting question to the historian is how the appellate jurisdiction for the United Kingdom came to be separated from that for the remainder of the Empire. By a process analogous to the process by which the House of Commons secured control of finance at the expense of this House, only put into force in a still more
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0375"/>
<col>741</col>
drastic fashion, this House has gradually acquired complete control of the appellate administration of justice. That is the case in regard to the United Kingdom, but the jurisdiction of the King in Council remains for the rest of the Empire. Consequently you now have nominally two tribunals. They are quite distinct, but in the main the Judges are the same in both. The nucleus of the Judges are the four regular Law Lords who sit here, the Lord Chancellor, the ex-Lord Chancellor&#x2014;a very distinguished figure at the present time&#x2014;and such other members of your Lordships' House as are qualified by having occupied high judicial office to sit in the Judicial Committee. All those are eligible; but in addition, under statutory powers, there are several members of the Judicial Committee who are not members of the House of Lords. There are two Indian ex-Judges who sit practically only on Indian Appeals, and there are the Chief Justices from most of the Dominions who can come specially and sit every now and again on appeals from the Dominions. That is a process which has been put only to a very inconsiderable degree in force, with this exception, that Lord de Villiers, the Chief Justice of South Africa, has sat frequently in the Judicial Committee. The two Courts thus divided consist mainly of the nucleus&#x2014;the Law Lords and the Lord Chancellor&#x2014;who sit chiefly in this House; and such as can be spared from that nucleus, strengthened and reinforced by the others of whom I have spoken, sit in the Judicial Committee. The result is that there has been dissatisfaction for a long time past. If the House of Lords is sitting in its legal capacity in strength it is not always possible to detach a very full Court for the Judicial Committee. The noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack exercises great care in that regard, but it is sometimes impossible to secure that the decision of five Judges sitting in a Dominion Court of Appeal shall not be reversed by three or four Judges sitting here, and the result has led to a good deal of misunderstanding.<lb/>
In this state of things the matter was brought before the recent Imperial Conference. Those of your Lordships who wish to refer to the discussions will find them at page 213 of the Minutes of Proceedings, June 12, and again at page 431, June 20; and you will find at page 236 of the supplementary volume, which contains the
<col>742</col>
documents laid before the Conference, what was actually agreed to. At first New Zealand proposed that every Dominion should have a Judge of its own on the Judicial Committee, but it was pointed out that some of the Dominions had only one or two appeals a year, and for them to spend &#x00A3;5,000 or &#x00A3;6,000 a year on keeping a Judge here would be absurd. That was unanimously dropped. But it was agreed that the Chief Justices or other eminent members of the Bench in those Dominions and the Colonies might well be summoned when there were questions which had to be decided of a character in which local assistance was specially desirable. For instance, New Zealand laws and customs relating to the Maoris seem to make it desirable that there should be someone present familiar with their code of law. That was one of the matters on which the Conference came to an agreement.<lb/>
Finally eight propositions were agreed to by the Conference. I will read them&#x2014;
<ol><li>"1. At present, the House of Lords is the Supreme Court of Appeal for the United Kingdom, and the King in Council (in effect the Judicial Committee) is the Supreme Court of Appeal for the rest of the Empire.</li>
<li>2. It is proposed to take a first step towards combining these Courts into a Supreme Court of Appeal for the Empire, and towards strengthening them by adding to the number of Judges composing them.</li>
<li>3. The scheme is that the Home Government should add two selected Judges to the Lords of Appeal. There would then be six Law Lords devoting their whole time to sitting in the two Courts.</li>
<li>4. In addition, the Lord Chancellor would. as now, preside whenever he is present, and all who are now qualified to sit in either the House of Lords or the Judicial Committee would be able so sit as now.</li>
<li>5. In this way the appeals of the United Kingdom and of the rest of the Empire respectively would be heard by the same Judges who hear them now, with the addition of two Law Lords to both Courts, but the two Courts would both be branches of the Imperial Court of Appeal."</li></ol>
That is foreshadowing a further and formal step which remains to be taken&#x2014;
<quote>"6. Except where it is necessary that the House of Lords and the Judicial Committee shall sit simultaneously it is contemplated that the Court shall sit in full strength first at the one and then at the other."</quote>
The judicial sittings of this House and the sittings of the Judicial Committee take place simultaneously. The result is that it is not possible in either to command that strength which the great appellate tribunal of the Empire, perhaps the most remarkable
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0376"/>
<col>743</col>
tribunal and with the most extensive jurisdiction that has ever been known, should possess. It seems wrong that such a tribunal should be condemned to sit in part of its strength, and therefore what is proposed is that the tribunal should sit in its full strength first in the one place and then in the other by an arrangement of the sittings. That will not require to be mathematically carried out, because in the case of Indian appeals two ex-Indian Judges sit. on the Judicial Committee, and when they are there you will not require such a strong body of other Judges on the Committee. But in the main the proposal of the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack is that the whole strength of the Court should always be commanded, so that the appellate business of the Empire should be held with great power. Your Lordships will see how easy it will be under that arrangement to declare the one Court sitting under its two forms to be a Court that is henceforth to sit under one form&#x2014;the Supreme Court of Appeal for the Empire. The other two proposals were&#x2014;
<quote>"7. It will be necessary that the conditions and method of appeal from different parts of the Empire shall be suited to the local requirements, and it is not practicable to attain uniformity in these respects, at all events at first. But as the Judges will be almost entirely the same for all kinds of appeals, it seems probable that a greater degree of uniformity may be reached. and possibly in time all differences may be effaced.</quote>
<quote>8. It is further proposed that, in accordance with the wishes expressed by the Dominion Representatives, the practice of the Judicial committee shall be modified so that in Dominion cases any dissentient Judge may be free to give his reasons if His Majesty's consent is given to this change."</quote>
The meaning of that is simple. The King in Council gives the judgment in a case that comes to the Privy Council, but the King in Council acts upon the report of a board which is the Judicial Committee. As a Privy Councillor never violates the secrets of the Council the opinion of any dissenting Judge is never given. The report consists of various reasons, but dissent is never shown. The Dominions say that the judgments would be more illuminating if they knew the opinion of any dissenting Judge. The noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack sees no difficulty in altering the procedure so that the proceedings there may be more like a hearing and judgment in an ordinary Court. Another point taken was that owing to the Courts being separate and
<col>744</col>
not sitting at the same time there is sometimes divergence of opinion in the Judicial Committee and in this House. That, of course, will be obviated if it is one Court in substance which is always sitting.<lb/>
I have told your Lordships what the ground of the proposals in this Bill is. Now I come to the Bill itself. There are three clauses. The first provides that the judicial sittings of this House and the sittings of the Judicial Committee shall be arranged as far as is possible in such a manner as not to take place simultaneously; but it. is provided that nothing in the clause shall be construed as requiring the sittings to be held any times other than those prescribed for sittings of the Court of Appeal in England in pursuance of the Judicature Acts, 1873 to 1910, that period being between October and the beginning of August. Clause 2 enacts that His Majesty may appoint two Lords of Appeal in Ordinary under Section 6 of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876, in addition to the four Lords of Appeal in Ordinary whom he may appoint under Sections 6 and 14 of that Act. That will give six Lords of Appeal together with the Lord Chancellor, the ex-Lord Chancellor, and such other Lords as are qualified to sit, as well as the extra Judges who sit on the Judicial Committee and any Chief Justice or Assessor from the Dominions who may be summoned to attend. The third clause gives effect to the conclusion that it is wrong to differentiate so much as has been done between the salary of a Lord of Appeal and that of a Judge of a Court of Appeal. It is thought that &#x00A3;5,000 a year should be the salary in all cases. The work certainly is not greater; it is a good deal less, and we know that you will get just as eminent Judges on the one footing a8 on the other, and we prefer a footing of uniformity. But that will apply, of course, only to future appointments.<lb/>
I have now stated the substance of the Bill, and I believe that, if your Lordships see fit to approve of its passage, the Bill, in which His Majesty's Government take a deep interest on account of its Imperial character, will lead to a very great strengthening, not only of the Judicial Committee but of the appellate side of this House, and form the foundation on which hereafter to transfer the whole into a Supreme Court of Appeal for the Empire,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0377"/>
<col>745</col>
with uniform procedure and without the anomalies which by degrees have grown up. The Bill is simple and without complication, and, as I have said, it represents the unanimous opinion of the Premiers in consultation with the Home Ministers during the sittings of the Imperial Conference in June. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

Indeed the principal link of the Mother Country to the Dominions beyond the seas is now this appeal to the King in Council. I have had occasion to observe the great importance that our fellow-subjects in the Dominions attach to this appeal and to the proper working of the Court. I have had occasion to urge upon the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack and on his predecessors the importance of this question, and I must say that it has always met with the greatest consideration on their part and that they have endeavoured to the best of their power to make a strong Court of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Whether the Judicial Committee and the House of Lords Court of Appeal should be merged into one Supreme Court of Appeal it is not now necessary for us to discuss. I hope in time to see that done; but in the meantime let us strengthen in every way the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Its decisions are watched with great interest in all the Dominions and also in the Crown Colonies, and the knowledge that they can appeal has very great effect. My apology for interfering in this debate is that I first joined the Colonial Office in 1867 and was for six years Secretary of State for the Colonies, and I can say, therefore, from long personal experience that this question of sustaining the dignity and authority of the Judicial Committee is constantly arising; that it is a matter of great importance; and that your Lordships cannot do wrong in passing this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01880"><member>LORD LAMINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when we were engaged in discussing the reconstitution of this House I remarked that I thought it a pity occasion had not been taken to satisfy the Oversea Dominions in respect of their demand for a strengthening of the Appellate Court in this
<col>746</col>
country. Therefore, like the noble Viscount who has just sat down, I congratulate the Government on having so soon brought forward a measure, and I hope it may satisfy our kinsmen overseas. I am not competent to discuss the provisions of this Bill, but I may say that at the time when the Federation of Australia took place I was then in Queensland, and there was a very powerful intrigue at that time to abrogate altogether this sole remaining link which connects the various parts of the Empire together, and it was solely due to the insistence of Queensland that the right of appeal was retained in regard to Australia. Anything that can tend to promote a greater feeling of confidence in the tribunal which hears the appeals from the outlying parts of the Empire is to be hailed with pleasure, and I endorse the remarks made by the noble Viscount who preceded me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01881"><member>LORD COURTNEY OF PENWITH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I entirely agree with the opinions expressed by the two noble Lords opposite as to the great desirability of strengthening the Court of Appeal for the outlying Dominions of the Empire. It is most desirable that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council should be clothed with the highest authority with a view to inspiring the greatest respect in all parts of the Empire. I also feel that much deference must be paid to the conclusions of the Imperial Conference, and as this Bill is founded on their conclusions one cannot but be disposed to receive it with respect. At the same time I must avow to your Lordships that I am not persuaded that this Bill is the right way of dealing with the problem to be faced.<lb/>
The Government are dealing with what is said to be a deficiency of authority in the Judicial Committee, and are proceeding to constitute one Court which is to embrace both the appellate jurisdiction of this House and the appellate jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee. It is expressly provided that the Court so constituted shall as a rule, almost universally, sit as one Court. If that scheme is carried through, then I submit to your Lordships that you do not require the addition of two Law Lords to this House. You do not want an increase in the Judicial power of this House. Its power is confessedly adequate to the labour thrown upon it. At this time
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0378"/>
<col>747</col>
it is very amply furnished with Judicial power, and if appeals from the Dominions are to be heard by the same body, though not sitting here, you will always have the Judicial force of this House at your disposal to hear appeals from the Colonies. If it were proposed to constitute a tribunal composed of the Lord Chancellor, the ex-Lord Chancellor, the other Law Lords who may be available, and six Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and to divide them into two Courts, you might then well have your two Courts working with great efficiency and with great approval on the part of all concerned. But that is not the scheme here. Here it is proposed, for some reason which does not appear, to incur unnecessary expenditure in the creation of two new Lords of Appeal. If the Law Lords in this House are competent to do their work here, they are competent also to hear the cases from the Oversea Dominions.<lb/>
As I have said, it is not proposed to constitute two Courts. There are practically no arrears in your Lordships' House. Yet it is proposed to increase the number of the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, not to do work in this House or to do work elsewhere when this House is sitting, but, as it seems to me, for no reason at all. For my part I am very jealous of any increase in the Judiciary, It is important for the high character of the Judiciary that it should not be unnecessarily multiplied. Not long since the question had to be considered of an addition to the strength of the King's Bench Division, and the Joint Committee which considered that matter agreed, reluctantly, to recommend that two additional Judges should be temporarily appointed. They have since been appointed, and with their assistance all the arrears in the King's Bench Division have been disposed of, and it is conceived that these two additional appointments may be in the end, as was intended, only temporary appointments.<lb/>
The question of expense is a matter of indifference to me, and I confess I do not agree with the proposal to cut down the salary from &#x00A3;6,000 to &#x00A3;5,000 so as to make it equal to that of members of the Court of Appeal. Members of the Court of Appeal not infrequently pass by way of promotion to the Court of Appeal of your Lordships' House, and it seems not inappropriate that there should be with that transition some additional emoluments.
<col>748</col>
The gain is insignificant, and I think the proposal is only put forward as a means of mitigating the expenditure on the creation of two new and unnecessary Lords of Appeal. It is said that this suggestion emanates from the Imperial Conference, but with all respect to that Conference I remember that this matter was brought up first by the representative of New Zealand, and that the suggestions of New Zealand were distinguished for their crude character. They were no sooner made than they had to be abandoned, and what was at length agreed upon was a compromise rather to save the face of the Colonies. I feel very strongly the impropriety of any unnecessary increase in the Judiciary, and I maintain that no case has been made out to show the necessity of appointing two additional Law Lords.</membercontribution></p>

Can there be anything more surprising and shocking than that a member of your Lordships' House should criticise expenditure that it may please the representatives of the people to impose on the taxpayers? The noble and learned Viscount said that there had been expressions of opinion in recent debates that the appellate jurisdiction of your Lordships' House might be abolished. That is perfectly true; but one of the reasons for those expressions of opinion was that some politicians of the baser sort have actually used the decisions of your Lordships' House sitting judicially as a stick with which to beat the House as a body sitting politically. That was, of course, disgraceful, and for that reason it became necessary for many of us to say, and to say with conviction, that if the impartial judicial decisions of your Lordships' House were to be used for political purposes, the sooner the judicial jurisdiction was abolished the better. So much for the political side of the question.<lb/>
This is not a political Bill. It is a Bill of the greatest importance and of a purely legal character, and I feel very
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0379"/>
<col>749</col>
much out of place in discussing such a Bill. There are, of course, in your Lordships' House many members well qualified to deal with this subject, but they do not appear to be present at this moment. I must say one or two words, however, in order, if possible, to elicit a little more clearly what is the exact proposition which the Government have laid before Parliament. This is evidently a Bill of the greatest importance, because, as the noble and learned Viscount said, its object is to carry out the recommendations of the Imperial Conference with reference to the establishment of a new Supreme Court of Appeal for the Empire. The noble Lord who has just spoken criticised the proposal of the Government because the Bill provides for the appointment of two new Lords of Appeal. Whether that is a good proposal or not depends very much upon how the Government intend to carry out the provision in practice. If I understood the noble Viscount aright, he indicated that the two new Lords of Appeal were to be specially appointed with a view to being qualified to sit on Colonial appeals. [VISCOUNT HALDANE dissented.] The noble and learned Viscount shakes his head. He did not actually say so; but he called attention to certain resolutions which were debated in the Imperial Conference, the first proposal being that there should be a special member appointed from each of the great Dominions. The noble and learned Viscount said that that proposal did not meet with the favour of the Conference and for very good reasons; and then he went on to say that in substitution for that proposal His Majesty's Government submit this proposal to add two new Lords of Appeal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01883"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: It was agreed by everybody that Chief Justices of the Dominions should be made members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and should come over here when appeals were heard from their Dominions. The addition of two Lords of Appeal was agreed on with a view to strengthening the Court for all purposes. The English Common Law extends over the greater part of the Empire, and it was thought that this was the best addition you could make.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01884"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I understand, then, that the New Zealand proposal was met partly by a compromise
<col>750</col>
to appoint more Chief Justices to the Privy Council, and partly by the appointment of two new Lords of Appeal who were to be good for all purposes, Colonial and other.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01885"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: That is so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01886"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: And hereafter, as I understand, there will be a Bill introduced to abolish the separate jurisdiction of your Lordships' House, to amalgamate the two jurisdictions, and to have only one Supreme Court of Appeal?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01887"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I hope so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01888"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: That is a matter of supreme importance, and I do not feel qualified to criticise it. But I am pleased to hear from the noble Viscount that no difficulty is apprehended from too much business being thrown on a single tribunal. There was a time when the decisions of your Lordships' House as a Court of Appeal were very long delayed, but I rather think that that state of things has passed away, and that now the judgments of your Lordships' House are delivered promptly; but if the old state of things were to reappear through working with one Court instead of two it might be a serious matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01889"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The Bill says "wherever practicable."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01890"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: The only other matter which I note is that it is proposed to alter the procedure of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council by establishing minority judgments. I do not know if the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack and the noble and learned Viscount opposite have consulted with the noble and learned Lords on this side of the House as to whether that is a desirable change. It is evidently one of very great, and in some respects of vital, importance, and unless there has been some understanding between the two legal sides of the House we must reserve liberty of action on this point at a future stage. There is no doubt that His Majesty's Government have been well advised in entering upon these changes, because it is above all things important that the well-considered advice of the Imperial Conference should, if possible be followed up in the Imperial Parliament.
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0380"/>
<col>751</col>
From all parts of the Empire men of great distinction have met together and resolved that these changes ought to be carried out, and we cannot blame, but must praise, the Government for having taken an early opportunity of carrying them into effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01891"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (EARL LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would be sorry to deprive the noble Marquess of the pleasure of thinking that we are violating the privileges of the House of Commons in monetary matters by introducing this Bill, but Bills of this kind have always been brought in in this House, and there is a process on the Third Reading by which we say that the privilege Amendment be agreed to, so that the Bill becomes merely a suggestion to the House of Commons rather than an enactment. With regard to altering the practice hitherto observed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of only delivering one judgment, or one statement of opinion as to the advice to be submitted to the Crown, I would frankly prefer that things should remain as they are. I believe it is better that the Court should all agree on one particular view, for the guidance of other Courts, and experience has proved its desirability. At the same time mine was the voice of one perfectly disregarded at the Conference. The representatives of the Dominions concurred in taking a different view. As these judgments affect them entirely I do not think it is our business to stand in the way of their distinct preference not only for the opinion of the majority of the Court, but also for the opinion of any dissenting critic. I hope and am sure that dissent will be rare and very moderately expressed; but I did not myself feel at liberty to disregard the view put forward by the representatives of the Dominions.<lb/>
With regard to the other part of the Bill, it is not only very important but rather delicate work that we have to do. This House, having borrowed from the Crown the authority which is still called the decision of the King in Parliament, decides all appeals from the United Kingdom. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council hears all appeals from all parts of the British Dominions, and there are several and many different codes and kinds of law that have to be administered, There is Indian law, the Roman-Dutch, the old French law dating prior to the
<col>752</col>
French Revolution of 1789, together with the English Common Law and the Statutory laws enacted in some of the Dominions, to say nothing of other systems. The work requires the very best men you can get. The great causes that come to this House from the United Kingdom, and the other causes, some of which are of immense Constitutional importance, that, come before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council are increasing in number. There has, no doubt, been a marked increase since I have had the honour of sitting on the Woolsack, and if it continues it will certainly mean a great deal more work. I am glad to say there are no arrears, and that yesterday morning I heard that the last case had been finished in the Judicial Committee. All the cases ready for hearing had been despatched by yesterday. Your Lordships will I think find, if you inquire, that there is no reason to complain of any delay in this House, but the work is heavy.<lb/>
What one has to do sometimes&#x2014;in fact not infrequently&#x2014;is to divide the Court into two, and my Judicial colleagues are good enough to leave to me the choice in the composition of the two Courts. I do my very best, and with the assistance of Lord Halsbury, Lord Gorell, Lord Mersey, Lord Ashbourne, and others we do make very good Courts, and I do not think there is anything to complain of. But we have no right to ask Lord Halsbury to serve; nothing but his kindness leads him to do so. An ex-Lord Chancellor is not bound to help, although I am sure that as long as he could be would willingly do so. But we have no claim on him, nor on Lord Ashbourne. nor on Lord Gorell, or the other Lords. It is all gratuitous service that they give. The regular body consists of the Lord Chancellor for the time being and four Lords of Appeal. Speaking for myself, I will go on as long as I can doing my best, but I declare that the time is coming and is near at hand when the combination of the duties of Speaker of one of the Houses of Parliament, of a Judge of the Highest Court of Appeal, of a member of the Cabinet with important and momentous matters to decide, to say nothing of administrative duties relating to lunacy, magistrates, and many other matters, may prove too much for the strength of anybody unless it is mitigated by lightening the burden in some direction.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0381"/>
<col>753</col>
That was the situation we had to face. The Colonial Premiers had given notice beforehand of resolutions from New Zealand and Australia desiring that there should be an Imperial Court of Appeal, and the New Zealand suggestion was, I think, that it should consist of Judges from all parts of the British Dominions. They wanted the House of Lords and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to be fused into one. The difficulty about that was that every single self-governing part of the Dominions is entitled to say what sort of Court it wants to decide its final appeals. We found, as we knew beforehand, that Canada, for instance, was not prepared to say that a Canadian appeal should be heard by a South African, a New Zealand, an Australian, and an Indian Judge, and so forth; and unless you could get the consent of the self-governing Dominions, which they withheld&#x2014;the point was expressly put to them&#x2014;it would be very difficult to constitute a Court which would be composed of Judges from all parts of the Dominions. I am very sorry that my noble friend Lord Courtney does not agree to our proposal. I thought I was one of the privileged people who sometimes had the honour of the noble Lord's concurrence, but on this occasion apparently I am not entitled to reckon upon it.<lb/>
Feeling that with all this heavy and increasing work it is not quite enough to have a nucleus of the Lord Chancellor and four Lords of Appeal I suggested, after conferring with my colleagues, that if the Colonial representatives were not prepared to take Colonial Judges we should add two more of the finest Judges we could get in England for the purpose, and they all fell in with the view and concurred in the resolutions&#x2014;I think I may so call them&#x2014;which my noble and learned friend Lord Haldane read to the House. That is the origin and genesis of this proposal, to which Lord Courtney seems to have some aversion. I think it is a reasonable thing to do. The object of saying that the Courts are not to sit simultaneously is that, so far as practicable, we want the fullest strength we can get in trying the appeals from the United Kingdom, and in trying appeals from the British Dominions beyond the seas. We cannot always do that, and we shall be obliged to sit in two bodies. I do not know whether this method of dealing with the subject is strictly logical&#x2014;
<col>754</col>
I am quite prepared to admit that it may not be&#x2014;but at the same time I think it is a practical method of dealing with a practical difficulty, and that it will strengthen the Court. It is impossible that it can be too strong. The cases that we have to consider are very heavy, and I think the proposal in the Bill would prove most useful.<lb/>
I will only refer to one other subject&#x2014;the question whether the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary ought to sit in this House. May I respectfully suggest a point of view that perhaps has not occurred to your Lordships? I am not particularly enamoured of their sitting here, but the criticism which has been levelled against them is that they have not delivered popular judgments, that they have brought unpopularity upon your Lordships' House by doing justice&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01892"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I never said so. On the contrary, the charge I brought was that certain politicians had said that noble and learned Lords had delivered unpopular judgments, and, therefore, that that was another blemish on your Lordships' House, and another reason for attacking it on every platform in England.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01893"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I did not mean to convey that the noble Marquess intended to blame the administration of justice, but the real feeling at the bottom of the complaint is one which I think this House or any House may well afford to be superior to. This House loses nothing by containing within its ranks men who give unpopular judgments. I understand what the noble Marquess means, and share his views. I think it is very wrong indeed to blame either this House or the Law Lords who give these judgments. It is certainly unfair to associate the House of Lords, which has nothing to do with them, with the judgments of the Law Lords. At the same time it is dangerous ground, and I believe myself that neither this House nor any House will ever lose by giving judgments which are fair and just, even though they may happen to be unpopular. For my own part, I may say that I am in a singularly favoured position. I have not been a party to any of these judgments. Had I been present I might have committed myself to some very unpopular opinions. I can therefore say all
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0382"/>
<col>755</col>
the more freely, I am quite certain that the opinions which have been given by the noble and learned Lords who arrived at those conclusions have been purely their view of what the law required.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01894"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot help rising to say a single word in regard to what has fallen from the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack. One reason why every one in this House respects the noble and learned Earl is that he is straightforward and downright, and we are convinced that in any judgment he might give or in any action he might take he would be actuated solely by his opinion of what is right. At the same time it is undoubtedly the fact that the name of the House of Lords being attached to the highest Court of Appeal has prejudicially affected this House in the opinion certainly of the Radical portion of the country. We have had reason to complain more than once that responsible Members of Parliament have not taken the means that they ought to have taken to represent that the opinions entertained in Radical circles on this subject were entertained under misapprehension.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01895"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: It does not affect one side only. On the last occasion that I contested an election for a seat in the House of Commons I was attacked by Conservative questioners because of the monstrous appointments which it was said the Liberals had made and which it was alleged had led to these labour judgments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01896"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I was not referring to that matter. I was talking about what had been said of this House, more especially in Radical circles, throughout the country. We have on many occasions protested against that. We have held that your Lordships' House was very unfairly treated by such things being said of it, and we have felt that this House might have been protected on some occasions by persons who have neglected to do so. If it were possible to do so under this Bill, I would suggest that His Majesty's Government should take some means of separating the House in its appellate capacity from the name of the House of Lords.</membercontribution></p>

<li>(<i>d</i>) Shall wilfully, without any reasonable cause or excuse, administer, or cause or procure, or being the owner permit, such administration of, any poisonous or injurious drag or substance to any animal, or shall wilfully, without any reasonable cause or excuse, cause any such substance to be taken by any animal; or</li>
<li>(<i>e</i>) Shall subject, or cause or procure, or being the owner permit, to be subjected, any animal to any operation which is performed without duo care and humanity;</li>

such person shall be guilty of an offence of cruelty within the meaning of this Act, and shall be liable upon summary conviction to a fine not exceeding twenty-five pounds, or alternatively, or in addition thereto, to be imprisoned, with or without hard labour, for any term not exceeding six months.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01902">(2) For the purposes of this section an owner shall be deemed to have permitted cruelty within the meaning of this Act if he shall have failed to exercise reasonable care and supervision in respect of the protection of the animal therefrom:</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01903">Provided that where an owner is convicted of permitting cruelty within the meaning of this Act by reason only of his having failed to exercise such care and supervision, he shall not be liable to imprisonment without the option of a fine.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01904">(3) Nothing in this section shall render illegal any act lawfully done under the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876, or shall apply&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) to the commission or omission of any act in the course of the destruction, or the preparation for destruction, of any animal as food for mankind, unless such destruction or such preparation was accompanied by the infliction of unnecessary suffering; or</li>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0383"/>
<col>757</col>
<li>(<i>b</i>) to the coursing or hunting of any captive animal, unless such animal is liberated in an injured, mutilated, or exhausted condition; but a captive animal shall not for the purposes of this section be deemed to be coursed or hunted before it is liberated for the purpose of being coursed or hunted, or after it has been re-captured, or if it is under control.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01905"><member>THE EARL OF DERBY</member> moved an Amendment in paragraph (<i>a</i>) of subsection (1), after the word "by" ["or, being the owner, permit any animal to be so used, or shall by"], to insert the words "wantonly or unreasonably." The noble Earl said: There is no desire on my part to lessen the strength of this Bill, but one is bound, when a Bill like this is accompanied by a Memorandum which is so inaccurate as the one which accompanies this Bill, to look very carefully into the various provisions. I have done so, and I find that the words "wantonly or unreasonably" appear in the two Acts which it is proposed to consolidate, and I see no reason why they should be omitted from this Bill. I know that it is contended by the noble Lord in charge of the Bill that the words "unnecessary suffering" cover the case, but I do not share that opinion. A man, for instance, might cause unnecessary suffering not out of malice but because he did not understand the case. He might treat the animal for one illness when it really had another. That might cause unnecessary suffering, but it would not have been caused wantonly or unreasonably, and therefore would not deserve punishment. The object of the Bill would be just as well carried out if the words "wantonly or unreasonably" were inserted, and it would prevent a case being brought against a man who, with the best intention in the world, had made a mistake perhaps I in the diagnosis of the illness of the animal.</p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01907"><member>LORD SAYE AND SELE</member><membercontribution>: It seems to me that to insert the words "wantonly or unreasonably" would be to give a loophole for cruelty. In 99 cases out of 100 where an owner permitted unnecessary suffering it would be wantonly or unreasonably done, yet under the Amendment the burden of proof would rest with the prosecution, and it might be very difficult to get a conviction.</membercontribution></p>

But I do not wish to press this Amendment if I can get an assurance from the noble Lord in charge of the Bill that this provision will not be used by "cranks" for instituting prosecutions.

I believe those words have been favourably received by the Government. But apart from that I wish to move the clause in words slightly differing from those which appear on the Paper.

<title>SMALL HOLDINGS AND ALLOTMENTS<lb/> BILL. [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01984">Order of the Day for the Third Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01985">Moved, That the Bill be now read 3<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Earl Carrington.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01986"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on the motion for the Third Reading of this Bill I have given notice to move its rejection, and I do not think that any of your Lordships who have been present on the previous occasions when this Bill has been discussed can be in any way surprised that such an Amendment should be moved. I am not in the least opposing the principle of the noble Earl's Small Holdings Act. I say that because on several occasions when remarks have been made with regard to the administration of that Act or any part of it, the noble Earl has always regarded the remarks as if they were directed at the Act itself.<lb/>
My reason for moving that this Bill be read a third time this day six months is this. I am sure it will be agreed that if any exemption is proposed to be given in a Bill regarding small holdings or any other matter of that kind to any class or set of people, it ought not to be given without grave consideration, and that when that exemption has been given and is in the Act it ought not to be taken away without some really good reason. This Bill has gone through as many changes and vicissitudes as any Bill that I ever remember, and, if your Lordships give it a Third Reading, the noble Earl is going further to alter it and for the fourth time to introduce material Amendments.<lb/>
May I, in a few words, state what has occurred with regard to this Bill? First of all let me read the subsection which this Bill as introduced was intended to repeal. It is subsection (3) of Clause 41 of the Small Holdings Act of 1908, and it runs&#x2014;
<quote>"No holding of fifty acres or less in extent or any part of such holding shall be authorised by an order under this Act to be acquired compulsorily for the purpose of small holdings or allotments."</quote>
This Bill as originally introduced into your Lordships' House was entitled a Bill "to repeal subsection (3) of Section 41." When the noble Earl moved the Second Reading of the Bill he was asked what
<col>766</col>
reasons he had for taking away from the holders of fifty acres or less a protection which he himself had given to them in the Act of 1908. His reply was that a coach and four were being driven through the Act, and he gave us a case where an old lady in Buckinghamshire had divided a farm among, I think he said, five of her relatives, or at all events among five tenants, and had in this way endeavoured to contravene the principle of the Act.<lb/>
Naturally, this Bill excited a great deal of uncomfortable feeling in the country. People who had felt perfectly safe under this exemption in subsection (3) were alarmed that it should be proposed to take away this protection from them without any good reason. The noble Earl was challenged, and was asked to produce at the next stage the cases on which he founded his allegations of evasion. When the next stage of the Bill was reached the noble Earl admitted that he had no more cases to give us, and his explanation was that his Department were naturally the last people to hear of any violations of the Act. It apparently did not occur to him that it was his Department and he himself who were proposing to legislate on this question. The noble Earl admitted that he could not produce any case except that of the old lady in Buckinghamshire.<lb/>
But that was not all. The noble Earl then altered the title of his Bill. The title of Bill No. 1 was to "repeal" this subsection, but Bill No. 2 was altered in Committee to a Bill to "amend Section 41 of the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1908." This was the second edition of the Bill; but in this the noble Earl provided protection only for the tenant of fifty acres. Under the Act, of course, the protection extended both to the owner and to the tenant of fifty acres. The noble Earl's proposal having been originally to limit the protection which was to be given, he accepted from Lord Clinton an Amendment which runs in this way&#x2014;
<quote>"The powers conferred on a council by an order for the compulsory acquisition of land under this Act shall not authorise the council to acquire or extinguish the interest of any person in land comprised in the order and cultivated by him if the total area, including such laud cultivated by him, does not exceed fifty acres in one holding&#x2014;</quote>
That is, of course, exactly the same provision as is in subsection (3) which the noble Earl was proposing to repeal&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0388"/>
<col>767</col>
<quote>"or sixty acres in two or more holdings; nor where they exceed those areas if the annual value for purposes of income Tax does not exceed &#x00A3;50 or &#x00A3;60 respectively."</quote>
Therefore so far from diminishing this security, if there is any alteration at all it is certainly in the way of increasing it.<lb/>
As I say, it has now become a Bill to amend. It was considered and further amended on Report, and then the noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, called attention to the fact that the owner was not included, and accordingly an Amendment was accepted including the owner as well as the occupier. That is the stage which the Bill has now reached, but if your Lordships give it a Third Reading, the noble Earl has, as I have said, an Amendment on the Paper which is going to further alter the Bill and will, as far as I can see, leave the law as nearly as possible in the same state in which it is now without this Bill. Surely in these circumstances your Lordships cannot give the Bill a Third Reading. The Bill seems to be absolutely purposeless arid useless. The noble Earl introduced it because he wanted to repeal this subsection. If he succeeds in obtaining what he desires from your Lordships to-day he will not have repealed this subsection at all. He has, indeed, boasted that the Bill would leave the tenant of fifty acres or less in exactly the same position as he is in now. I do not think I need say anything more. I cannot believe any one in this House wishes to pass legislation which, if it is anything at all, is so much waste paper.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-01988"><member>LORD ILKESTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would ask the noble Earl who has moved this Amendment to think again before he presses it upon the House. I do so because there is a serious reason why some Bill of this kind should be passed, and I believe before being placed on the Statute Book the Bill would be made as efficient as the noble Earl would like it to lie. I admit that the criticism of the noble Earl opposite is fair criticism of the procedure connected with this Bill. I do not think the procedure is altogether what my noble friend Lord Carrington or any of us would have wished. But at the back of this Bill there is an urgent necessity for legislation.<lb/>
<col>768</col>
If your Lordships will allow me I will put before you an illustration of how at the present time the Act is rendered nugatory, and I think the instance that I shall give will show that there is a crying. necessity for some measure to amend this particular subsection in the original Act. I have myself been connected with allotments and small holdings for a great number of years, especially in the county of Worcester, where there are a large number of these holdings and where they have proved very useful to the inhabitants. The local authority desired, as early as 1909, to acquire a small plot of land of about 12 acres in extent from a. comparatively large farm for the purpose of allotments. They tried for six months to negotiate for that piece of land. They commenced in April, 1909, and at the end of that year they bad not been able to acquire the plot. The local authority rapidly exhausted all the means of obtaining the land without compulsory powers, and finally they passed a resolution to endeavour to acquire it compulsorily, feeling that the needs of their constituents required that this land should be procured. But in this they were thwarted. They issued their compulsory order on September 14, 1910, but on September 12&#x2014;two days before&#x2014;the farm was divided up between the man who originally cultivated it and his three sons, all of whom were made tenants of portions under fifty acres. It looked suspicious; there was no doubt about the method in which it was done. There was a public inquiry held into the question, and the solicitor for the owner came before the Inspector of the Board of Agriculture and said distinctly that this division was clone in order to frustrate the acquisition of that particular piece of land for the purposes of allotments. That is what my noble friend below me described as driving a coach-and-four through the Act.</membercontribution></p>

The moment it is publicly announced that an Act can be frustrated in this way the provision in the Act is rendered inoperative. I would beg your Lordships not to reject the Bill on Third Reading, because I feel confident that if it passes through this House Amendments will be introduced in another place which will make it efficacious. We do not want an Act capable of doing untold good among the poorer members of the agricultural population frustrated, as this Act has been, by these devices. In the particular district of which I am speaking&#x2014;Bromsgrove&#x2014;there has been great annoyance in consequence of the difficulty of obtaining this land. I hope that after the statement I have made showing the necessity for some such legislation as this the noble Earl will not press his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

It has been persistently represented inside and outside of this House that my intention was to change the class of existing small holdings&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01994"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I have never said a single word of that sort.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01995"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: No; but the noble Marquess, Lord Londonderry, used these words&#x2014;that my intention was "to change the class of existing small holdings." Those are his exact words as reported in <i>Hansard.</i> It is said that I wish to reduce the size of the holdings and deprive small holders of the security they at present enjoy. Nothing was further from my intention, and I thought I fully explained the object I had in view. I will read to your Lordships what I stated in moving
<col>770</col>
the Second Reading of the Bill on May 11 last. I said&#x2014;
<quote>"I have seen it stated in the Press that there is some sinister design at the back of this Bill and that it ought to be resisted. It is stated that there is a sinister design to cut up farms and to injure existing small holders. I can assure the House that nothing is further from the thoughts of the Government than to do any such thing."</quote>
I am quoting from the Official Report. I went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"The sole and only reason for proposing the repeal of this subsection is that it has had in its working results which were neither contemplated nor desired."</quote>
The noble Earl cannot stand up and say that these results were contemplated, and still less can lie say that they were desired.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01996"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: But I will stand up and say that the noble Earl could not give us any cases of evasion when asked to do so after due notice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01997"><member>EARL CARRINGTON</member><membercontribution>: My explanation was misunderstood, or else it has been entirely forgotten. To make my position absolutely clear I had the subsection redrafted so as to give the genuine small holder that full security on which the noble Earl and the House rightly insist. There are two grave difficulties with which it is my duty to grapple. First there is the question of by-takes. If the noble Earl carries this Amendment he will perpetuate by-takes. As the law stands at present a tenant farmer farming 1,000 acres may hire a field of under fifty acres, and no matter how important that field may be to the villagers or to the people in that neighbourhood, it is a small holding in the eyes of the law because the additional land is taken from another landlord. Does the noble Earl wish to perpetuate such a thing as that? In Norfolk alone there have been at least four cases of that kind. Shall I be told that it is unreasonable to ask your Lordships' gracious permission to be allowed to remove this anomaly? The second difficulty has been well described by my noble friend Lord Ilkeston, than whom no man in England knows more about small holdings, for it was in 1883 I think that my noble friend and Mr. Jesse Collings started the small holding movement in Birmingham. The second difficulty is that the Act as it stands offers a ready and simple means of evasion. Unless this Bill is allowed to pass, all that a man has to do to retain
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0390"/>
<col>771</col>
a large farm in its entirety is to let it out in parcels of fifty acres nominally to various members of his family, and, as my noble friend Lord Ilkeston said, the county council cannot touch it.<lb/>
Your Lordships have challenged me to produce cases in addition to the case in Buckinghamshire. Four cases of farms being subdivided in order to evade the Small Holdings Act have come to my knowledge. Two cases have come to my knowledge within the last three days, and there is the case which has been quoted to-night by my noble friend behind me, which makes three, and the day before yesterday the clerk to the Northumberland County Council sent in another case, which makes four in a week. That these cases exist there is no earthly doubt, and, as Lord Ilkeston so well said, you have only got to advertise them, as the noble Earl has been doing, to lead to cases all over the country of a coach-and-four being driven through this provision of the Act. I feel very strongly about this. Your Lordships would never allow one of your agents in any circumstances to do such a thing as is being done to evade this Act, and appeal with confidence to the noble Earl to let the Bill go through, and not to perpetuate what is undoubtedly a hardship.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01998"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I think the noble Earl is rather under a misapprehension as to the reasons which induced my noble friend Lord Camperdown to interest himself in this measure. The noble Earl seems to think that Lord Camperdown's action is a purely vexatious one, but that is not at all the case. Let the House remember that this Bill when it was laid upon the Table was directed only to one object&#x2014;namely, the repeal of the third subsection of Section 41 of the Small Holdings Act, 1908. That subsection is the charter of the small holder. It is the subsection which says to a man who occupies a small holding that because he is a small holder he shall not be liable to find himself dispossessed of a part of his holding in order that it may be given to someone else. When we saw the noble Earl laying sacrilegious hands on that provision we were bound to enter a protest, and that was the explanation of my noble friend's intervention. The noble Earl opposite told us that nothing was further from the thoughts of His Majesty's Government

than to produce any result of this kind. I have no doubt the noble Earl is perfectly sincere, but we were dealing, not with the intention of His Majesty's Government, but with the effect of their Bill, and their Bill beyond all question would have had the effect I have ventured to ascribe to it.<lb/>
The noble Earl will remember that when he was challenged as to the necessity of this legislation and asked to produce the cases of evasion on which he said he grounded his proposal he was able only to produce a single case, and that seemed to some of us rather a slender foundation for so grave an alteration of the law. The noble Earl has brought up his reserve forces this afternoon. The noble Lord who sits behind him has produced a second case. We had heard nothing of it before, and some of us thought it did not appear to be in all respects appropriate to the argument; but I will assume there is a second case. Then the noble Earl stated that he was himself able to contribute another two cases, so that we have a total of four cases. But what the noble Earl forgets for the moment is that this Bill has been altered on every occasion on which it has come before us. I think the Amendments which the noble Earl is going to move to-day after the Third Reading constitute the fourth transformation which this Bill has undergone, and he really must not be surprised if the House is a little bit puzzled and I may say a little bit suspicious also.<lb/>
I wish the noble Earl would tell us in the simplest possible language what really is the alteration which this Bill makes in the existing law, as I cannot help thinking that the Bill as we now have it preserves subsection (3) of Section 41, at any rate in its essentials, with a comparatively slight addition. If that is the case, if small holders are not going to be deprived by this Bill of any of the protection which they now enjoy under the existing law, and if the only alteration is that if one of them holds a second holding the two holdings together are not to exceed a total area of sixty acres&#x2014;if that is really all that the Bill does, I cannot see that it does any great harm, and I for one would venture to counsel my noble friend beside me not to press his opposition. At any rate if the noble Earl, with his Department at his back, is really able to tell us that there is a
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0391"/>
<col>773</col>
hard case which ought to be dealt with and that that hard case can be dealt with without practically impairing the security which these small holders now enjoy under the existing law, I for one would be prepared to accept his assurance and not oppose the further progress of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-01999"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Marquess has spoken in a reasonable and fair way about the clause, and I do not think some of the observations of the noble Earl opposite were otherwise than justified. This is a difficult and complicated matter, but I think the justification of the clause is found when you read subsection (3) of Section 41 of the original Act. One has only to look at it to see that that was one of those provisions put in by the draftsman amid a group of clauses and not sufficiently thought out. The subsection is too abstract in its form. It simply took the fifty acre limit and said that nobody who had under fifty acres was to be displaced. That was not enough, and there have been cases of evasion. The Bill preserves the whole of the <i>bona fide</i> rights of the fifty acre holder. It also embraces the holder of sixty acres, and protects him if the sixty acres are in two small holdings and do not exceed a certain figure in value. The Bill simply seeks to carry out what was the original policy of the Act of 1908, and I submit that it is within the spirit of what was intended by subsection (3) and will make the matter clear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02000"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: We have now found out that the person who is really at fault over subsection (3) is the draftsman. The noble and learned Viscount has said that the draftsman somehow or other failed to express correctly the intention of the noble Earl. All one can say is that the noble Earl never said that for himself. It is a defence which certainly is original. As to how far it is correct that might be a matter for further discussion. However, I have not heard yet a really clear statement of what the difference will be if this subsection disappears and the noble Earl's subsection is substituted. The noble Earl says that if the House accepts the Amendments which he will move after the Third Reading it will not be such a bad Bill; but as the Bill stands now I cannot see that it makes any difference worth speaking of in the
<col>774</col>
existing law, nor do I see that even if the noble Earl's Amendments are accepted the existing law will be altered in any material way. It is highly inexpedient to alter existing laws unless you are making some really material, intelligible, and good alteration. I shall, however, accept the suggestion of the noble Marquess and not press my Amendment for the rejection of the Bill. I think it is a matter of very little consequence. All that will happen will be that your Lordships will have distinguished yourselves by putting on the Statute Book by way of a great reform a Bill which, so far as I can make out, does not alter the existing law.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02002"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the question is put I should like to say a few words on this Bill. I took great interest in the Small Holdings Act and have been vainly endeavouring to ascertain how this Bill, as proposed to be amended by the noble Earl, will meet the difficulty with which he seeks to deal. I am in entire sympathy with him with regard to that difficulty. I do not want to see county councils prevented, by fictitious sub-divisions of large farms, from taking land for small holdings and allotments, but what I fail to see is how that will be prevented by the Bill even as the noble Earl proposes to amend it after the Third Reading. I think that Lord Ilkeston, who has had considerable experience in this matter, did see sonic defect in the words as they stand in the Bill. If your Lordships pass this Bill, as I suppose you will, I hope it will be under protest, so that it may be further considered in another place and put into a shape in which it will work.</membercontribution></p>

I should have been perfectly content to leave it at fifty acres, but Lord Clinton put the case of a man who may have added to his holding land which brought it to over fifty acres. We therefore thought that there should be a little latitude, and because I accepted the Amendment I have been reproached by noble Lords on the other side. There is no

<title>SALES OF ARMOURED SHIPS.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02009"><member>EARL BRASSEY</member> rose to call attention to recent sales of armoured ships, and to the insufficient number of cruisers in reserve on distant stations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02010">The noble Earl said: My Lords, in submitting suggestions on this subject I have chiefly in view that policy of co-operation for defence to which, it is understood, especial attention was given at the recent Colonial Conference. I shall endeavour to show how the Mother Country may, without adding to expenditure on the
<col>776</col>
Imperial Navy, materially assist Australia and Canada in creating local naval forces. The cost of constructing ships must be a heavy charge on young nations. Under the scheme prepared by Admiral Henderson for Australian naval defence, the total expenditure on construction would be no less than &#x00A3;23,000,000, and the annual charges would aggregate &#x00A3;5,000,000. It is certain that expenditure on so vast a scale must be spread over a long space of time. In the interval which must elapse before the ships proposed for the local navies are completed, we may place war vessels which we can spare in reserve in the ports of the outer Empire, and more especially in Australasia. We have this year struck off the list and have sold or are about to sell no less than ten battleships, completed so recently as 1894. The list includes the eight ships of the "Empress of India" class, displacement 14,000 tons. These ships are powerfully armed, of good speed, with ample coal supply, and in sound condition. Two ships&#x2014;the "Revenge" and "Centurion"&#x2014;are of smaller dimensions and less heavily armed. They have a speed of over 18 knots. In addition, we have lately sold the "Nile" and "Trafalgar," little inferior in fighting efficiency to the "Empress" class; date of completion, 1890. It is not necessary to go further back. The twelve ships named are the last on a long list.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02011">The naval advisers of the Admiralty are, perhaps unconsciously, too ready to strike off ships. They know that their retention as efficient for service is in some quarters an argument for cutting down Votes. Naval Lords look to the latest ships of the most formidable foreign Power which we must be prepared to meet. They condemn as obsolete ships sensibly inferior in any of the elements of efficiency. We have to look at the naval position as it must be considered in Australasia. Ships of the latest type are few in distant seas. Our ally, Japan, has two Dreadnoughts built, and three building. The other battleships of the Japanese Navy, eleven in number, are similar in type to those which we have struck off.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02012">There is a further consideration. At the present time the Commonwealth is slenderly provided with the means of defence. The existing naval forces consist of three modern destroyers, a few torpedo-boats,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0393"/>
<col>777</col>
one small coast-defence monitor, launched in 1868, one small third-class cruiser, and some gunboats. The local Navy of Australia is a harbour defence flotilla. Battleships no longer fit to lie in line may be a valuable reinforcement. Melbourne, Brisbane, Wellington, and Hobart are at the head of deep inlets. The channels of approach, through shoals and banks, could be enfiladed by the fire from the heavy guns of ships grounded in suitable positions. There are other services for which armoured ships not of the latest type are well adapted. They would be admirable for the sea training of the Australian Naval Reserves.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02013">Let us turn from battleships to cruisers. We have a wide responsibility for the protection of trade. Of all the Dominions and Dependencies, Australia is the furthest from the base of the Empire. Its Colonial and over-sea trade is valued at &#x00A3;160,000,000 annually. To give the protection required would be a severe tax on the Imperial main sea forces. As Captain Creswell, the able director of the Australian Navy, has truly said, the distance is the greatest possible, and the value of the prize offered to an enemy is probably unequalled. How can we best co-operate with the Commonwealth for the protection of trade? The ships from which damage might be apprehended are not the "greyhounds" of the Atlantic, few in number, and, in any time of emergency, certain to be closely watched by our fast and powerful cruisers, but the far more numerous vessels, not of exceptional speed, scattered over the world, which cannot all be watched, pursued, and captured by the regular cruisers of the Navy. We have many cruisers on our list which could be spared, and of a type better adapted for service in Australasian waters than the cruisers of the "Town" class, which the Commonwealth have been advised to build. Take the "Spartiate" class, seven in number, displacement 11,000 tons, twice the tonnage of the "Town" class vessels, with good beam, ample free board, and a speed of 21 knots. Though completed so recently as 1902, yet as the oldest on the lists of protected vessels they may, if the policy of recent years is pursued, not long hence be struck off the list of effectives. Let us not repeat the errors of the past. As we continue from year to year to build cruisers specially designed for naval operations in European waters, let us place in reserve
<col>778</col>
in the ports of the outer Empire vessels which may for many years be valuable for the protection of the coasting trade of Australia if threatened by a stray raider.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02014">In dealing with the naval defences of the Empire it is necessary to distribute as well as to concentrate our forces. I was serving at the Admiralty at the time of the Penjdeh incident. War with Russia was imminent. There was grave anxiety as to the safety of our shipping in distant seas. P. and 0. steamers were taken up and fitted at great cost as improvised cruisers. In Hong Kong and Sydney heavy expenses would have been saved and anxiety relieved if we had had vessels in reserve in those waters ready for service in any emergency. In conclusion, the policy it has been sought to recommend would, as has been said, relieve the self-governing Dominions in no inconsiderable degree of the heavy expense of building new ships. It should lessen charges on Imperial funds for manning. The complements of cruisers of the "Spartiate" class are nearly 700 men, or a total for the seven ships of the type of 5,000 men. if these ships were stationed in the outer Empire they would be effective for the protection of commerce from raiders, and the local Governments might help us to man them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02015"><member>THE EARL OF GRANARD</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships invariably listen with attention to any remarks which the noble Earl makes on matters connected with the merchant service and the Royal Navy, of which he has such large knowledge, and I would venture on behalf of the House to offer him our congratulations upon the promotion in the Peerage which the King has been graciously pleased to confer upon him. Now with regard to the speech of the noble Earl, it is not the case, as he seems to think, that the Admiralty have any objection to selling ships to the Dominions. Two ships&#x2014;the "Niobe" and the "Rainbow"&#x2014;have already been sold to Canada, and I understand that the Dominion of Australia are proposing to purchase a destroyer for training purposes. But the Dominions have to consider whether this is the best way of spending the funds which they have at their disposal. The Government of Australia are about to spend a very large sum on their Navy, and it is a question whether the purchase of old cruisers and battleships is the best
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0394"/>
<col>779</col>
way of spending that money. I think it cannot be denied that there is a very general tendency to under-rate the cost of manning these ships and very much to over-value their fighting capacity. So far there has been no great inclination on the part of the Dominions to buy this class of vessel, and as far as the Admiralty are concerned the advice they give to the Dominions is to build up-to-date ships and to man them with thoroughly efficient crews. Take a ship of the "Royal Sovereign" class. A ship of that order is very expensive to keep up. She deteriorates very quickly and her deterioration, especially as regards machinery, becomes more apparent every year. In addition to this, a battleship of that class has a crew the complement of which is double that of cruisers of other classes and is in no way so effective for defending commerce. I need hardly say that the Admiralty very carefully consider the
<col>780</col>
fighting qualities and general effectiveness of any ship before it is condemned, and they never condemn a ship until they are perfectly certain that the cost of maintenance is not proportionate with the fighting efficiency of the ship. The Dominion Governments have come for advice to the Admiralty, and the advice given by the Admiralty is certainly not to buy old and obsolete battleships and cruisers which can be of no practical use and are very expensive to keep up.</membercontribution></p>

<title>DACOITY IN INDIA.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02092"><member>LORD WYNFORD</member> rose to ask the Secretary of State for India with regard to the trial in the High Court at Calcutta on 1st April last of the 17 prisoners in the Khulna dacoity case&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. Whether any restitution of the property extorted or stolen by these men has been made, or compensation in lieu thereof paid, to the various owners; and</li>
<li>2. Whether previous to or during the trial any communications were made to the prisoners or their legal advisers to lead them to understand that if the prisoners pleaded guilty they would be released on their own recognisances; and, if so, by whom and on whose authority such a procedure was adopted.</li></ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02093">The noble Lord said: My Lords, a fortnight ago the noble Viscount the Leader of the House, in the absence of the Secretary of State for India, very kindly answered a Question which I had put on the Paper with regard to the trial, in what was known as the Khulna dacoity case, of seventeen men before a special tribunal of the High Court of Calcutta on April 1. May I remind your Lordships that the prisoners pleaded "Guilty," and were somewhat unexpectedly released on their own recognisances to come up
<col>786</col>
for sentence if called upon. The noble Viscount explained how very desirable it was in this and similar cases to avoid delay and prevent the trial being dragged out, and in that respect I am sure your Lordships will be in agreement with the noble Viscount. He further stated that the procedure had the approval of the Viceroy, with whom he was in perfect agreement. But there are two matters in connection with the trial which I think require further explanation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02094">I may state for your Lordships' information&#x2014;I hope the noble Viscount will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;that these prisoners did not all come from the lowest classes. Several of them were superior, well-educated, and of considerable social influence and position in their neighbourhood. They had for some time formed themselves into a gang and been making depredations on private property accompanied with the use of firearms, and, in some instances, considerable violence to the unfortunate individuals, their own countrymen, who were deprived of their property. The noble Viscount told your Lordships the other day that on hearing of the clemency extended to them these prisoners left the Court with many expressions of gratitude and joy and returned to their villages; but we did not hear that those whose property had been stolen by these men expressed the same symptoms of gratification, and so far as I have been able to learn not one single word has been said about the restitution to the rightful owners of such property as could be traced or found.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02095">The other matter which I think requires further explanation forms the subject of the second portion of the Question which I have put on the Paper to-night. The noble Viscount, in reply to my Question the week before last, told the House that a very eminent and entirely unsuspected lawyer did make a communication to these men previous to the trial, but it is difficult to understand&#x2014;in fact, to me it seems extraordinary&#x2014;why these prisoners should have consented to renounce their defence on a suggestion which I rather gathered the noble Viscount implied was of an entirely unofficial character. That the course to be adopted at the trial was known before the prisoners were brought into Court is evident, because I
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0398"/>
<col>787</col>
am given to understand that the bail bonds were all ready and had been made out beforehand. In these circumstances I hope the noble Viscount will see some reason in my asking a further Question on this matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02096"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not at all complain that the noble Lord should ask for further information. The answer to the first part of the Question by the Government of India is that the only property restored by the guilty persons was a small quantity of melted-down silver, which was, I understand, all that was recovered. I am not aware, and I say this on the authority of the Government of India, that compensation has been paid to the victims of these robberies. As to the second part of the Question, action was taken by the Government of India with a view to bringing about a conclusion of the proceedings. The intention of the Government was conveyed, as the noble Lord has reminded the House, by a very eminent and unsuspected counsel. There is no secret about it; he was Mr. Sinha, who was thought so well of that it was ray duty to recommend him to His Majesty to be made a member of the Viceroy's Executive Council. He was the first Indian Member of that Council, and was a great success I may observe in passing. It was Mr. Sinha who made the communication to these persons, and I think the noble Lord will agree that the view of the Government of India was a very sensible one. There have been two or three trials of dacoity cases spreading over enormous lengths of time, hundreds of witnesses have been examined, and in a quite recent case, the name of which escapes me at the moment, there was a complete breakdown in the end. You cannot wonder, therefore, that the Government of India&#x2014;and this is the whole Government, not the Viceroy alone but the Viceroy in Council&#x2014;sought some means, without injuring justice, to avoid proceedings so prolonged and so inadvisable from many points of view. It was in accordance with their authorisation that Mr. Sinha made this communication to one or more of these men, with results which I believe are held by the Government of India to be entirely satisfactory and to have justified the course they took.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02101">[The EARL OF DONOUGHMORE in the Chair.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02102">Clause 1:</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02103" align="center"><i>Right of trustees holding leasehold interest in place of worship to acquire freehold.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02104"><b>1.</b>&#x2014;(1) Where premises are held under a. lease to which this Act applies upon trust to be used for the purposes of a place of worship or for purposes connected therewith, whether in conjunction with other purposes or not, the trustees, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, shall be entitled as incident to their leasehold interest to enlarge that interest into a fee simple, and for that purpose to acquire the freehold and all intermediate reversions:</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02105">Provided that&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) if the premises exceed two acres in extent the trustees shall not be entitled to exercise such right in respect of more than two acres thereof;</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) this Act shall not apply where the premises are used or are proposed to be used for the purposes of a place of worship in contravention of any covenant contained in the lease.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02106">(2) The leases to which this Act applies are leases (including underleases and agreements for leases or underleases), whether granted or made before or after the <i>passing of this Act</i>, for lives or a life or for the unexpired residue of any term originally created for a period of not less than twenty-one years, whether determinable on a life or lives or not.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02107"><member>LORD NEWTON</member> moved to omit from subsection (1) the words "or for purposes connected therewith, whether in conjunction with other purposes or not."</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02108">The noble Lord said: This is a Bill of a very unusual, and, I believe, unprecedented character, and it is desirable that its operations should be confined precisely to the objects to which it purports to relate. I move to omit these words because they are objectionably wide and would enable premises to be enfranchised the main purpose of which was purely secular or even commercial. It is quite conceivable that there might be a building which was habitually used
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0399"/>
<col>789</col>
for the purposes of a gymnasium, or as a concert hall, or even for political meetings where the owner of the property might be denounced, and yet under the Bill provided only one religious service apparently was held there in the year enfranchisement could be claimed. In Clause 4 there is a very wide interpretation of the expression "place of worship," and I do not think it can have been intended that the Bill should include premises where religious purposes were really only subsidiary. In view of the very wide definition of "place of worship," it seems to me that it would be perfectly possible to claim enfranchisement for buildings which were actually not even contiguous to the so-called religious edifice. In these circumstances I think I am perfectly justified in asking for the omission of these words.</p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02110"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS (EARL BEAUCHAMP)</member><membercontribution>: If this Amendment were carried it would go far beyond those cases which the noble Lord mentioned. It should be remembered, in the first place, that this Bill cannot possibly apply to any building unless it is being carried on in accordance with the terms of the trust. The terms of the trust must have been approved of by the landlord who originally granted the lease, and the presumption is that the lease was granted by the landlord because he approved of the general objects of the trust; and whatever else there may be in this Bill it is perfectly clear that unless the premises are still being used in accordance with the trust approved of by the original landlord advantage cannot be taken of this Bill. It is also true that these trusts are very often of a somewhat antiquated character. Imagine a case in which the trust, drawn up before there was such a large system of elementary education in this country, provided that evening schools should be held on a certain number of days in the week. The noble Lord will see that by his Amendment the institution or the continuance of those evening schools, to which I am sure he would not object, might prevent the trustees from taking advantage of the Bill as it is drawn at the present time. I am quite sure the noble Lord will agree
<col>790</col>
that because the building happened to be used during the week for continuation schools it would not be fair to prevent the people concerned from taking advantage of this Bill; but that would be one of the results of his Amendment. I have a good deal of sympathy with the endeavour of the noble Lord to exclude from the operation of the Bill premises which are used for wholly secular or commercial purposes, but his Amendment, it seems to me, would go a good deal further than he himself would wish it to go. In the course of the present stage of the Bill I hope to accept a number of Amendments that have been put down by noble Lords opposite which I hope will meet the noble Lord's point, but if, after the Committee stage, he is not satisfied with the Amendments which I propose to accept he could bring up a further Amendment on Report to meet the purely commercial case to which he referred. I hope that on the present occasion he will not press the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02111"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I am sure that my noble friend Lord Newton does not wish to exclude a building used for educational purposes. What he objects to is the extreme wideness of these words. The words include other purposes, purposes which have nothing to do with education and which might be purely secular. The noble Earl says that he has great sympathy with Lord Newton in the objects which appear to be contained in his Amendment. Might I ask whether the Government, as they sympathise with Lord Newton to a considerable extent, will not themselves look at these words and propose some Amendment on Report excluding from the operation of the Bill premises used for commercial purposes and things of that kind?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02112"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I shall be very glad to accept that suggestion and to frame an Amendment which would exclude all commercial cases.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02113"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Earl wants me to meet him he will have to offer something better than that. Commercial is too narrow.

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02139">The noble Lord said: The object of this Amendment is to confine the compulsory powers to cases in which full consideration has been given by way of rent or otherwise for the lease of the place of worship. There have been a great many cases in which leases have been granted at a nominal Tent. What happens is roughly this. The members of some religious body go to a landowner and say they want to put
<col>794</col>
up a religious edifice. He asks them what they are prepared to pay. Their usual reply is, "We are poor people; we think that you might give us the site for nothing." Frequently the owner does not see his way to do this. Perhaps he is contemplating rebuilding his property in that particular neighbourhood. Therefore he says to them something to this effect, "You shall have the land at a purely nominal rent"&#x2014;2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a year, or whatever it may be. It is perfectly obvious that in a case of this kind it would be grossly unjust to the landlord to turn his generosity against him in the case of enfranchisement. The case is so obvious that I do not feel called upon to argue it at all. The essence of the bargain has been a nominal rent in consideration of leasehold tenure. Under the Bill the trustees can obtain the advantage of the nominal rent and deprive the owner of the consideration for it. Apart from any question of justice, it is very desirable in the interests of places of worship that this Amendment should be accepted, otherwise the granting of leases at nominal rents such as I have alluded to is not likely to take place in the future.</p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02142"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I am sure your Lordships will appreciate the very great difference which the noble Lord's Amendment makes in the scheme of the Bill. Let me take a practical example. Supposing that a landlord, because he thinks it right to give facilities for public worship, has allowed certain trustees to erect a chapel upon his land and is content to take &#x00A3;1 a year rent although the land is worth, say, &#x00A3;30 a year. He thinks it right that people should have facilities for public worship, and he therefore lets them have the land at &#x00A3;1 a year. Under the scheme of the Bill if the trustees are anxious to have the freehold they will pay the landlord the discount on the value of the land at the end of the period, as well as twenty-five years purchase, or whatever it may be,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0402"/>
<col>795</col>
of the rent. Under the Bill what we propose is that they should pay the &#x00A3;1, which the landlord agreed to accept, multiplied by twenty-five. The scheme of the noble Lord in his Amendment is that they should pay to the landlord the &#x00A3;30 multiplied by twenty-five, because that would be the real value although the landlord himself had been perfectly content to accept &#x00A3;1 per annum. I hope I have made myself clear. It is the difference between the real value and the value which the landlord out of his generosity is willing to fix. The presumption is that the landlord who granted the land was content to receive &#x00A3;1 a year so long as, under the terms of the trust, the land was used for these purposes. Now under this Bill we very carefully safeguard the fact that the land must continue to be used for the purposes of public worship in accordance with the trust. The landlord has been content to receive &#x00A3;1 a year; the noble Lord wishes him to receive a great deal more. The answer which I can imagine the noble Lord would make to my argument would be, "Yes, you make him take it, but there is no reason why he should not give it back again as a free gift of his own accord to the trustees." That would be perfectly fair in many cases, but not in all cases. In cases where the land was settled or where the landlord was a tenant for life, he would be obliged to receive the larger sum; otherwise he would not be acting in accordance with his duties. Apart from that, there is another practical consideration. If this Amendment was accepted the obvious result would be that trustees would postpone until the very last moment the purchase of the freehold. They would say to themselves, "We arc, enjoying this piece of land for &#x00A3;1 a year. Why should we try and enfranchise it and pay until the expiration of the lease &#x00A3;30 a year? We are perfectly safe under the lease. We will wait until just before the lease expires." That would put the landlord in a large number of cases in the uncomfortable position of not really knowing whether the trustees were going to take advantage of this Bill or not. He would be in a position of considerable uncertainty, especially if he thought of developing the land. In these circumstances, and because it would put a very large burden upon trustees who availed themselves of this Bill, I venture to hope that your Lordships will not accept the noble Lord's Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02143"><member>LORD HYLTON</member><membercontribution>: The London County Council happen to be freeholders of eight sites to which the provisions of this Bill might be applied. These sites, together with adjoining property, were secured by the Council originally for improvement schemes, and they constitute certain lands which will have to be disposed of ultimately. The Council hope that when the time comes for disposing of the land they will get the full market value. But unless some such Amendment as Lord Newton's is inserted in the Bill they will have to be content with a much smaller sum, and the loss will fall on the shoulders of the ratepayers.</membercontribution></p>

I gather that the intention of the Bill is that persons who hold the building lease of a chapel shall be entitled to enfranchise their chapel if they desire to convert their lease into a freehold. The reason for that provision is that in certain cases chapels have been pulled down at the end of the lease, the congregations turned out, and considerable hardship occasioned. The noble Earl objects to this Amendment, as I understand it, in the interests of the trustees of the chapel. But surely the trustees have only got, if they choose, to retain their position as lessees until the end of the lease; they need not enfranchise till the end of the lease. But when they get to the end of the lease and desire to enfranchise the Bill gives them a right&#x2014;I think quite rightly&#x2014;against the landlord which they do not possess at the present moment. But why are they not to pay the real value of the land&#x2014;not of the building, because the building is rightly excluded under the Bill, but the full value of the land at the time of the enfranchisement? A lease may have been given, for charitable reasons, at a very low rent; but the position surely is altered by the enfranchisement. I certainly never supposed that it was the intention of the Bill not to give a reasonable value to the landlord on enfranchisement, and I do hope that the noble Earl may be able to reconsider the matter at any rate to some extent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02145"><member>EARL BEAUCHAMP</member><membercontribution>: I think we are getting a little bit confused. The value of the land is quite a separate thing. I agree with the noble Viscount that it is quite right that the trustees should
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0403"/>
<col>797</col>
pay the value of the land subject to the discount. If the land is worth &#x00A3;1,000 thirty years from to-day, the amount to be paid to-day would not be &#x00A3;1,000 obviously. What we are dealing with in this Amendment is the rent. A landlord of his own accord has, we will say, allowed trustees to have land for &#x00A3;1 a year on a lease extending over a number of years. The landlord is quite content in the circumstances to take &#x00A3;1 a year for land which may be worth &#x00A3;30 a year. What the Amendment suggests is that the landlord should be paid the &#x00A3;30 a year, for the Amendment says that the sum to be paid shall be based upon the full annual value of the site&#x2014;a value which the landlord in his generosity has been good enough to forego. Suppose there are ten years of the lease unexpired. The landlord, under the original terms of the lease, had agreed to take &#x00A3;1 a year. Under the Bill when the sum is calculated which the landlord is to receive it is calculated at &#x00A3;1 a year. But Lord Newton in his Amendment says it must be calculated at &#x00A3;30 a year, which is the real value. The Amendment deals with the question of compensation for the rent and not with that of compensation for the value of the land, which, of course, is an entirely different thing. I submit that the compensation for the rent which is to be given to the landlord should be based upon the sum which the landlord himself was willing to accept when he granted the lease.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02146"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: The noble Earl has stated his case with great clearness. But is he quite certain that the case which he has put before us is the ease which is in the Bill? As I understood him, the only question which is being considered is that of the remainder of the lease. But look at Clause 2. It runs, "for the purpose of acquiring such reversionary interests as aforesaid." The reversionary interest is the right to turn leasehold land into freehold.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02147"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: Put out of account all notion that we are dealing with anything exceptional, and suppose that it is a railway company which is buying. A railway company has, we will say, a ten years' lease, and wants to acquire the reversion. It will buy, not what it has got, which is the lease for ten years, but what it has not got&#x2014;the reversion. It
<col>798</col>
will pay for the reversion the full market value. So under this Bill. The trustees will not pay more than &#x00A3;1 a year for the lease which they have actually got, because that is their property already.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02148"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble and learned Viscount point to the words in the Bill which cover that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02149"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: Clause 2 provides procedure for the acquisition of reversionary interests. It is the reversionary interest which you acquire; the lease you possess already. Your lease, which is your own, merges in the reversion which becomes yours by the purchase, but you pay the full market value of the reversion. Clause 2 runs, "for the purpose of acquiring such reversionary interests as aforesaid &#x2026;" Those are the only things the tenant has not got, and those are the only things he has to buy. If I have a lease and wish to become the owner in fee simple, all I have to do is to buy the reversion, and the lease merges in that reversion. The difficulty in the Amendment is that Lord Newton would make people buy over again what they have already got. We have nothing to do here with the value of the premises for the term of the lease. The value of the reversion is the value of the rent during the time which is still to run <i>plus</i> the fee simple value at the end of that term. Under Clause 2 full value would be paid for the reversion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02150"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I think it is clear that there is no difference between the two sides of the House as to the basis on which we desire that these transactions should be carried out. I understand from the noble and learned Viscount that in the case of a lease with ten years to run at a peppercorn rent, no question arises as to the remaining ten years. Those are already in the hands of the lessees. But so far as the reversionary interest is concerned the purchase, I understand, is to be based on the full market value of the site. If the noble and learned Viscount is quite satisfied that that is so, we are content. But perhaps he will have the matter carefully looked into so that if any doubt exists that doubt may be removed.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02175"><member>LORD KNARESBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: As has been pointed out, there is a very great difference between holding under a lease and holding under a freehold. When a man has a freehold and breaks his covenants you have to prove damage, but so long as he only has a lease you can enforce the covenants. I have been advised in these cases that it is a dangerous thing to sell a freehold and rely upon the covenants being kept. Therefore I think it is quite reasonable that when people are proposing to acquire your property against your will they should show that the premises are <i>bona fide</i> used for religious purposes and for the purposes of public worship. A building may be called a place of public worship when it is only occasionally used for that purpose.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02176"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: I confess I do not see in what way the insertion of the word "habitually" would strengthen the Bill.

I hope the noble Lord will not press the matter. As to the insertion of the word "public," I would ask the noble Earl opposite whether "public worship" is a proper definition. These chapels are not like churches of the Church of England, which are places for public worship. I suppose a chapel belonging to a sect is not a place usually considered public in the sense that anybody could go there who wished to.

They have advised that a dispute as to whether an officer or servant of an asylum is an "established officer or servant" within the meaning of Section 17 (1) of the Act is not a dispute which the Secretary of State has any jurisdiction to determine under Section 15, and apart from any proceedings that may be taken before a Court of Law, no authority except the Visiting Committee of an asylum has any jurisdiction to decide what officers or servants are established; that the list of established officers and servants is made up of (<i>a</i>) such officers or servants employed in a permanent capacity as

have the care or charge of patients, together with (<i>b</i>) such other officers or servants as the Visiting Committee in its sole discretion determines by resolution to include; that the division of the officers or servants placed on the list of established officers and servants into two classes is to be made by the Visiting Committee with the consent of the local authority. The local authority's consent is required to the division into classes, but they have no other jurisdiction with regard to the list; and there is no appeal to the Secretary of State in the matter.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02213"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to call attention to the case of the steamer "Coomassie," owned by Greeks, flying the British flag, and trading without British officers or men, which recently formed the subject of a Question in this House; to ask the result of the inquiries which have been set on foot; whether the "Coomassie" is still flying the British flag; and whether His Majesty's Government propose to take any further steps in the direction of preventing foreign-owned vessels from registration as nominally British-owned vessels, and ensuring that merchant vessels of genuine British ownership shall be commanded and officered by British subjects.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02214"><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: I am afraid that I have had very little time to go into the question which the noble Lord has raised, but I will give him all the information I have been able to get. The vessel to which the noble Lord refers, the "Coomassie," belonged to the African Steamship Company (Messrs. Elder Dempster &amp; Company) until February or March of this year, when she was bought by the Anglo-Ionian Navigation Company, Ltd., a company registered in London under the British Companies Acts. This Company applied to the Registrar of Shipping with a view to registering their title to the vessel, but, as it was doubtful whether the company was entitled to own a British ship, the Commissioners of Customs ordered. an inquiry to enable the company to produce evidence of the location of their principal place of business and their title to own a British ship, the Commissioners of Customs ordered an inquiry to enable the company to produce evidence of the location of their principal place of business and their title to own a British ship.<lb/>

In May last Lord Musketry called attention to the case in your Lordships' House and he was given certain information as to the results of the inquiries which the Board of Trade had made as to the manning and officering of the vessel. At that time the question of the ownership of the vessel and her right to fly the British flag was under consideration by the Commissioners of Customs and Excise, and the noble Lord was told that the Customs had ordered an inquiry into these matters under Section 51 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906. The inquiry, however, did not take place for a very good reason&#x2014; namely, that the Company informed the Registrar of Shipping before the inquiry was begun that the vessel had been sold to Greek subjects and consequently her registry as a British ship was closed.<lb/>
As regards the noble Lord's suggestion that steps should be taken to prevent foreign-owned vessels from registration as nominally British-owned vessels, it might be pointed out that the "Coomassie" was never registered as a British ship under the ownership of Greeks, as the transfer from her British owners to the company who owned her at the time of the occurrences to which the noble Lord called attention in his previous Question was never officially recorded. So far as the case of the "Coomassie" goes, therefore, it appears that the existing provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts were sufficient to prevent a company whose title to own British ships was doubtful from registering their title. I may add that if the noble Lord knows of any cases in which foreign-owned vessels have been registered as British ships and will communicate the facts to the Board of Trade, I can assure him that the Board will be fully prepared to consider whether any action is necessary.<lb/>
With regard to the last part of the noble Lord's Question, the Board do not propose to take any steps to alter the law as to the officering of merchant vessels set forth in Section 92 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and Section 56 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906, except in the direction indicated by my noble friend Lord Granard on May 31 last.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02215"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member><membercontribution>: I have a further Question to put to His Majesty's Government&#x2014;namely, whether it is a fact that a Greek bearing the name of Nicolas Bulgaris
<col>808</col>
passed the Board of Trade Examination as Only Mate at South Shields on January 26 of the present year, and was granted a certificate for that grade; whether it is a fact that this gentleman had previously seen no service whatever in British merchant vessels; and whether under such circumstances he was eligible for a certificate entitling him to act as an officer on British ships; and whether it will now be essential that he shall serve as an officer in British ships preparatory to obtaining his certificate of a higher grade under the Board of Trade enabling him to command British merchant ships. I submit that it is extremely unfair that an alien who has never previously served in a British merchant ship should be able to obtain a British certificate. This is not only unjust to British officers and British apprentices, but it is also a dangerous thing for this country to allow to go on.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02216"><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in answer to the noble Lord's Question I have to say that it is the case that the Greek named passed an examination for a certificate of competency as Only Mate at South Shields on January 16&#x2014;not January 26, the date given by the noble Lord&#x2014;and that he had had no service in British vessels. He had served for over five years in Greek vessels, and was therefore entitled under the Board's Regulations to present himself for examination for the certificate in question. It is not essential that a candidate for any certificate should have served in British ships provided that he can produce satisfactory testimonials as to conduct and character, and that he is able to prove that the service has been in the required capacities, and that during the period of service he has held a British certificate of the rank required by the Regulations.<lb/>
It may be of interest if I state that the number of certificates of competency of all grades issued to foreigners is very small indeed. Out of 4,351 certificates granted in 1910, only 78, or 1&#x00B7;8 per cent., were obtained by foreigners. Even this small total is decreasing. The annual average number of certificates obtained by foreigners in the period 1896 to 1900 was 107, or 2&#x00B7;2 per cent., while the annual average for the period 1906 to 1910 was 73, or 1&#x00B7;6 per cent. It is not possible to say how many foreigners do hold certificates of competency, but the following figures showing the number of foreigners

<col>809</col>
who were actually serving as master or mate on British vessels on April 4, 1906&#x2014;the date on which a census was taken&#x2014;may be of interest&#x2014;

<title>PARLIAMENT BILL&#x2014;VOTE OF CENSURE.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02271"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member> rose to move to resolve, "That in the opinion of this House, the advice given to His Majesty by His Majesty's Ministers, whereby they obtained from His Majesty a pledge that a sufficient number of Peers would be created to pass the Parliament Bill in the shape in which it left the House of Commons, is a gross violation of Constitutional liberty, whereby, among many other evil consequences, the people will be precluded from again pronouncing upon the policy of Home Rule."</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02272">The noble Earl said: My Lords, I rise to move the Motion which stands on the Piper in my name. Yesterday a Motion in identical terms was debated and rejected in the House of Commons. In ordinary circumstances we might, perhaps, regret that the discussion on such a Motion should not be taken simultaneously in both Houses of Parliament; but on the present occasion there is, I think, no reason for such regret, for the debate yesterday in another place, which some of us heard and which all of us have read, threw a light, a most illuminating light, upon the course of proceedings to which it will be my duty to call your Lordships' attention, and confirmed the worst impressions that many of us had formed; and, secondly we learned from that debate the answer that is made by His Majesty's Ministers to the charges which in both Houses of Parliament are levelled against them, so that in formulating those charges in this House to-day we shall be able to take
<col>816</col>
note of the defence which is likely to be made against them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02273">My Lords, the language of this Resolution, which I do not think I need read to your Lordships, is explicit. Our indictment is couched in strong and uncompromising language, but not, I think, language in excess of the necessities of ' the case. For, my Lords, in our view! the action of His Majesty's Government which we ask this House to censure is not merely startling and unparalleled in its character, grave in its nature, and tremendous, I think I might even say appalling, in its probable consequences, but I shall hope to convince your Lordships that this action has been in contravention of the principles and practice of our Constitution as hitherto understood and observed, that it is really action revolutionary in violence, and that the Ministers who are responsible for it have been guilty of an abuse&#x2014;an unpardonable abuse, as we think&#x2014;of their duty to the Throne, to Parliament, and to the people. That is, roughly speaking, the nature of the indictment which it is my duty to bring.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02274">I do not think that I need trouble your Lordships with any lengthy recapitulation of recent events. They are too fresh in your Lordships' memory to lender it necessary for me to recall them. During the last few weeks we have been engaged in this House in debating the various stages of the Parliament Bill, and I do not think that the most embittered of our opponents will say that your Lordships have been at all immoderate or partisan cither in the speeches or in the Amendments which you have directed to that measure. We passed without a Division the Second Reading of the Bill, thereby paying deference to the general character of the verdict of the preceding election, and carrying out what we have always regarded as the Constitutional function of your Lordships' House. In accepting the Second Reading without a Division we did, although many of us may-have done It reluctantly, accept the main principles of the Parliament Bill. We accepted without amendment, or at any rate without substantial amendment, those clauses of the Bill which establish the financial supremacy of the House of Commons. We further accepted those provisions which abolish what is rather fancifully, and, I
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0413"/>
<col>817</col>
think, absurdly called the absolute Veto of the House of Lords. That is to say, we accepted the provisions under which measures in future that have three times passed the Lower House of Parliament will become law over the heads of your Lordships' House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02275">The Prime Minister in his speech yesterday in the House of Commons said that we had mutilated the Government's Bill, that we had turned it inside out, and that we had put our policy into it&#x2014;a policy which, he said, had been repudiated at the General Election. My Lords, is it possible for the language of Party exaggeration further to go? This Bill, even in the form in which we sent it back to the House of Commons, is not our Bill. It does not contain our policy. It neither contains our policy for the reform of your Lordships' House nor for the adjustment of difficulties and deadlocks that may arise between the two Chambers. Our policy is a very different one, and some day, perhaps, we may have an opportunity of putting it into practice; but that was not the situation with which we were confronted. We had to take the basis and the framework of the Government's Bill and, proceeding upon that, to do what we could to render it, if not more acceptable, at least less dangerous in our view to the general interests of the country. Accordingly, my Lords, the Amendments which we introduced into the Bill, notably those which were associated with the name of my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition, were Amendments directed to preserving the rights of the people, with which we conceived that the policy of His Majesty's Government most wantonly and unpardonably tampered. Our object was to restore to the people their Constitutional prerogative of being the final Court on all great and fundamental changes in our country. And then, having introduced these Amendments into the Bill, we sent it down to the House of Commons, from which it has not since emerged.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02276">It was at this stage that on July 21 there came into the hands of the two Leaders of the Opposition a letter from the Prime Minister, the salient words of which I must ask your Lordships' permission to read to the House. They were as follows:
<quote>"When the Parliament Bill in the form which it has now assumed returns to the House of
<col>818</col>
Commons we shall be compelled to ask that House to disagree with the Lords' Amendments. In the circumstances, should the necessity arise, the Government will advise the King to exercise his Prerogative to secure the passing into law of the Bill in substantially the same form in which it left the House of Commons, and His Majesty has been pleased to signify that he will consider it his duty to accept and act upon that advice."</quote>
That was the first intimation that reached us&#x2014;for previously there had been nothing but vague rumours or vaguer threats&#x2014;that at some previous date, without the knowledge of ourselves or of the country, His Majesty's Ministers had possessed themselves of the Prerogative of the Crown&#x2014;a Prerogative unused in any such case for 200 years, and uncontemplated for eighty years&#x2014;and that they were about to employ this Prerogative for the creation of Peers, not to effect a settlement honourable to both Parties, but to crush and subjugate their opponents and to force on to the Statute Book a measure-which is destructive of the Constitution, and which is passionately resented by nearly one-half of His Majesty's subjects. We learned then&#x2014;on July 21, not yet three weeks ago&#x2014;that this measure is to be forced upon us, whether we resist it or not, and that if we do resist we are to be beaten to the ground by a phalanx of Peers. The Home Secretary was kind enough in the House of Commons yesterday to let out the actual number of the mercenary host by whom we are to be overwhelmed&#x2014;400 or 500, I think it was, Peers to be created, if they are created, in circumstances which it is scarcely possible to mention, without a blush, and to be used, as long as their political fidelity lasts, not merely for the purpose of this Bill, but in order to facilitate the carrying, into law of a series of measures which we have no reason to believe the majority of the people either desires or demands.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02277">Can it really be wondered at if in these circumstances we regard the action which I am describing as an outrage? And should we not fail in our duty as Peers of Parliament if, powerless as we may be to avert the catastrophe by which we are threatened, we did not take such opportunity as it presented to us to expose the whole character and enormity of this offence to the country, to pass in review the proceedings which have led up to it, and to place on record our opinion of them? More than that, ought we not to take this opportunity also to record our pledge as soon
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0414"/>
<col>819</col>
as may be to wipe away this stain from the Statute Book, if it is going to be placed upon it, and not to rest until we have done our best to restore balance and stability to the Constitution?</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02278">By way of prelude to what I have to say, may I briefly recall the events of last year beginning not further back than the month of May? Before the death of King Edward in May last, the Parliament Bill, as your Lordships will remember, had only received its First Reading&#x2014;a purely formal stage&#x2014;in the House of Commons. It had never been discussed there except in the form of Resolutions, and with all deference, as an old House of Commons man myself, I decline to admit that Resolutions, however ample, however long discussed, or by whatever majorities they may be carried, are, insusceptible of detailed amendment as they are, in any degree equivalent to or a substitute for a Parliamentary Bill. The policy of His Majesty's Government had only been seen in the form of Resolutions in the House of Commons, and in this House it had never been seen at all. Then occurred the lamentable death of the King, followed by a. truce, as it was called&#x2014;I am afraid a very deceptive and illusory truce as it afterwards turned out&#x2014;in which the leaders of the two Parties were engaged in conference. That Conference, as we all know, greatly to our regret and that of everybody else, proved abortive.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02279">And then it was that suddenly, in November last&#x2014;I believe on November 18&#x2014;to our surprise, and I will say to the stupefaction of the country, the noble Marquess opposite (Lord Crewe), whom I am sure we are all delighted to see again in his place and who we hope will before long resume that position to which he has lent so much distinction in the past, came down here and told us that the Government, without any excuse, with its majority still unimpaired, and with its mission still undischarged, was going again to the country. I have never been able to discover any shadow of justification other than Party justification for that General Election. The Prime Minister in his speech last night in the House of Commons said it was justified by two reasons&#x2014;in the first place, we had entered upon a new reign, and, secondly his plans had now been formulated in the shape of a Bill. My Lords, is it possible to imagine any flimsier reason for the
<col>820</col>
turmoil, the expense, the agitation of a General Election? I do not think any of us has the slightest doubt now, even if we had then, that the General Election of December, 1910, was a tactical election and a tactical election only. Was ever an election, I ask you, conducted in such circumstances before? His Majesty's Ministers tell us that they went to the country upon the details of their Bill; but their Bill, even if it had been formulated, had never been debated in the House of Commons, and your Lordships will have in your minds that it was only in the last days of the session, when the last embers were flickering out, that the noble Marquess came down here and, so to speak, flung upon the Table of this House, with a gesture almost of contempt and disdain, the Parliament Bill. Even if our self-respect had enabled us to discuss it under these conditions, we could not have done so with any advantage, because he told us that not a single Amendment that we might make would His Majesty's Government consider.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02280">We were left, therefore, with only a few hours in which to formulate our own views as to the manner of dealing with the Constitutional situation, and then the General Election was upon us. I venture to say that in these circumstances to pretend that the country decided at that election with any knowledge or circumspection between the two policies that were submitted to It is absurd. Does not every fair-minded man know and admit at the bottom of his heart that the country neither understood the Government's Bill nor our Resolutions? The Prime Minister said last night that his Bill had been accepted In principle at the first election of 1910. I dispute that <i>in toto.</i> He then went on to say that it had been accepted in detail at the second election of 1910; and I remember at an earlier stage in our debates hearing the noble Earl, Lord Russell, who is seated opposite, in one of his somewhat rare but always able interventions in our debates, say that the Parliament Bill at the last election had been carried by the people word by word and line by line.</p>

<col>821</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02282"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I dispute that also. But the noble Lord's colleagues, less moderate than himself, go very much further; and the Prime Minister whom he follows alleges that it was accepted by the people in all its details. Really if the noble Earl were to compose an examination paper upon the Parliament Bill drawn up in a manner which nobody could do better than himself, and if he were to submit it to the electors who voted on his own side, will be seriously contend that 50 per cent. of them would get more than 20 per cent. of full marks in their answers to those questions? A General Election conducted in those circumstances may be indicative of the general temper and political complexion of the country at the time. That I do not deny, and as such we bowed in our treatment of the Parliament Bill to the general feeling of the country. But, my Lords, to say that such an election gave authority for every word and every line of the Bill and that the Bill was invested with a sort of pontifical character by reason of that election, and that you were entitled thereby to use all the forces of the Constitution in order to drive through that Bill without modification and without amendment is, I venture to say, a monstrous claim. It is a prostitution of any reasonable doctrine of a mandate that has ever been employed. And, my Lords, it is all the more absurd when in the same breath you tell us that the same election is held to have decided other independent and separate issues, such as Disestablishment and Home Rule.<lb/>
The full gravity of the situation was only revealed to us yesterday in the speech of the Prime Minister in the House of Commons. I pass by the somewhat misleading reply to the Leader of the Opposition which was given by the Prime Minister at the beginning of the proceedings&#x2014;a reply which I suppose was intended to disconcert and to take the sting away from the attack that was about to be delivered, and a reply which was misleading because we only had to wait to hear the speech an hour later in order to realise that everything we had suspected or believed was more than true. It appeared from that speech that on November 15 last the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Government, submitted a Memorandum to the King and obtained his assent to the conditional creation of Peers. Will your
<col>822</col>
Lordships allow me, although you have no doubt read it, to repeat the words?
<quote>"His Majesty's Ministers cannot take the responsibility of advising a Dissolution unless they may understand that, in the event of the policy of the Government being approved by an adequate majority in the new House of Commons, His Majesty will be ready to exercise his Constitutional powers, which may involve the Prerogative of creating Peers, if needed, to secure that effect shall be given to the decision of the country. His Majesty's Ministers are fully alive to the importance of keeping the name of the King out of the sphere of Party and electoral controversy. They take upon themselves, as is their duty, the entire and exclusive responsibility for the policy which they will place before the electorate. His Majesty will doubtless agree that it would be inadvisable in the interests of the State that any communication of the intention of the Crown should be made public unless and until the actual occasion should arise."</quote>
Thus, my Lords, it is abundantly clear that on November 15 last His Majesty's Ministers did go to the King, before the situation had developed; before their Bill had passed its Second Reading in the House of Commons; before it had even been considered in the House of Lords: before they had any reasonable idea of what our attitude would be; before the Sovereign could possibly know in what form or over what difference the case for the ultimate exercise of the Prerogative might arise; and that they did use their influence with His Majesty to place themselves in possession of the Royal Prerogative in circumstances of such a character that, to use their own words, "the King had no alternative but to assent." And, my Lords, having done this, these scrupulous guardians of the Constitution sat down and recorded their conviction, in the words which I have just quoted, of the extreme importance of keeping the King out of the sphere of political controversy into which they had just successfully inveigled him and the inadvisability of making any statement upon the transactions to which I have referred. Once more I take off my hat to the strategy, or perhaps the better word would be the tactics, of His Majesty's Government, but I cannot compliment them either upon their constitutionalism or upon their candour.<lb/>
I should like to ask, although I cannot say that I expect a reply, Was it ever suggested to the Sovereign at those interviews that your Lordships might possibly accept the Second Reading of the Parliament Bill? Was it ever placed before him that the General Election to which
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0416"/>
<col>823</col>
his assent was asked was going to be fought upon other issues than the issue of the Parliament Bill? Could he anticipate that the point of difference upon which Peers might be demanded at a later date would be the question whether Home Rule should be passed without the assent of the people? Did he know that when the creation of Peers would be asked for it might be a question not merely of forty or fifty, but, to quote the Home Secretary, of 400 or 500? I venture to say that there is no parallel or precedent in the whole course of British history for the incidents to which I have referred. At least Lord Grey waited, before he went to King William IV and obtained his pledge, until his Bill had twice passed the House of Commons and had been rejected by the House of Lords. You could not wait for that. You obtained your blank cheque&#x2014;I have to use that familiar metaphor because there is no other which adequately describes it&#x2014;before the Bill had been passed by the House of Commons at all and before it had even been seen by your Lordships' House. There is a phrase in one of the Letters of Junius to the Duke of Grafton in which he says&#x2014;
<quote>"You began by betraying the people; you ended by betraying the King."</quote>
We do not in these days use the rather full-blooded language of the eighteenth century; but, my Lords, if any modern Junius were to arise and were to address His Majesty's Ministers at this moment and say to them&#x2014;
<quote>"You inverted the process. You began by coercing the King; you ended by betraying the people,"</quote>
I, at any rate, should not quarrel with him either for his language or his sentiments.<lb/>
It may be said, of course, that we were great, simpletons to be taken in by these tactics, and that we ought to have guessed all the time what was going on. Last night the Prime Minister referred to two statements that he had made in the House of Commons&#x2014;one on April 14 and the other on November 18, 1910&#x2014;which he seemed to think ought to have let us into the secret at an early date. Perhaps in the light of knowledge which we did not then possess we ought to have read into those subtly chosen phrases the dark meaning which they were intended to conceal rather than to convey. But I own that we did not. At any rate I did not, and I do not think any of my noble friends
<col>824</col>
sitting on this Bench did. Perhaps we were very stupid not, to know what was in hand. But, my Lords, the main reason why we failed to understand those sentences was that they had been preceded by another sentence from the same source which the meanest intelligence could not fail to understand. This was the language used by the Prime Minister on February 21, 1910&#x2014;
<quote>"In my judgment it is the duty of statesmen and responsible politicians in this country, as long as possible and as Far as possible, to keep the name of the Sovereign and the Prerogative of the Crown outside the domain of Party politics. To ask in advance fur a blank authority for an indefinite exercise of the Royal Prerogative with regard to a measure which has never been submitted to or approved by the House of Commons is a request which in my judgment no Constitutional statesman could properly make, and it is a concession which the Sovereign could not be expected to grant."</quote>
Yet this was the very request which the same Minister was nine months later to address to his Sovereign, and this was the very concession which that Sovereign was to be compelled to make! My Lords, were we such simpletons when we interpreted the language of February in the way we did? Was it language which was susceptible of more than one interpretation? We were not justified in believing that the Prime Minister who used it could possibly be guilty of the act which he had himself described as unconstitutional, or would place upon the Sovereign the pressure which he had himself condemned.<lb/>
In view of these proceedings what a farce the General Election and the subsequent proceedings in both Houses of Parliament now turn out to have been! When you (the Government) went to the General Election I wonder how many of your speakers and supporters when they were denouncing the hereditary principle amid the cheers of the crowd on popular platforms knew all the while that you had a blank bit of paper in your pocket on which your own Patronage Secretary was beginning to write the names of hundreds of hereditary Peers whom for your own ends you were going to add to this House. You thundered against the iniquity of Conservative measures being passed by a crowd of Conservative Peers in the House of Lords, and all the while you were contemplating constructing a similar advantage for yourselves. And then when, the General Election over, we all came back to our work, when the House of Commons for weeks discussed
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0417"/>
<col>825</col>
the Parliament Bill, and when we on our more modest scale in this House devoted two or three weeks to the consideration of the same measure, it now appears that the whole thing was a mockery and a farce! It was what Disraeli in his cynical language would have called "an organised hypocrisy." I can imagine every night as noble Lords opposite went home from the futile proceedings in this House, from our marchings and counter-marchings over a field which was not even a field of battle, they must have consoled themselves for the labours of the day by taking down from the wall and looking to the priming of the blunderbuss with which they were afterwards going to shoot us down.<lb/>
The Prime Minister now asks us to believe that he held his hand during all this time and said nothing about the guarantees because he believed that we were going to accept his Bill. My Lords, if that is so, why was the Prime Minister so confident of our intention to reject it in November last, before the Bill had even reached us, that he must have a General Election in order to put terror into our souls? What I wonder was the use of the Prerogative if the Prime Minister really believed that we were going to accept his Bill without substantial amendment? Reviewing these proceedings, as I have attempted to do, I do not know which is worse&#x2014;the injury that was done by Ministers to the Crown by the coercion of its independence, or to the Constitution by the destruction of its safeguards, or to the people by the deception which was practised at the people's expense. At any rate these debates in both Houses of Parliament have had this advantage. They have torn asunder the veil from these proceedings. They have revealed the whole transaction in its true light. They have enabled, or they will enable, history to pass its verdict upon a course of events that has really been worse than revolution, because it has accomplished without physical violence what physical violence by itself would never have been allowed to effect.<lb/>
Perhaps your Lordships will allow me to say a few words about the precedents upon which His Majesty's Government rely. I note with interest that not one word has been said, so far as I have seen, about the case of 1711&#x2014;the only case in which
<col>826</col>
the creation of Peers was actually accomplished in order to carry the policy of the Government of the day. I think, if I may say so, that Ministers have been wise to give a wide berth to that illustration. For, as your Lordships know, it was a creation in the first place of twelve Peers only, three of whom were eldest sons&#x2014;a creation hardly to be compared with the generous addition to our ranks which is contemplated by the Home Secretary; it was a creation which was intended, not to carry a Party measure, but to put an end to a long and desolating war; and yet, excellent as its intention was, it was so generally condemned that the authors of it were impeached, and the principal of them, Lord Bolingbroke, at a later date, in a letter which has been published, declared that his act was unprecedented and invidious, to be excused by nothing but the necessity and hardly by that. So much for the events of 1711.<lb/>
I pass to the precedent of 1832, upon which, and upon which exclusively, I understand that Ministers rely. I am not going on this hot afternoon and in a debate in which so many speakers wish to join to recapitulate the history of that momentous time, which can be found in any Constitutional History or text-book. I will only draw the conclusions to be derived from such a study. I venture to say it is impossible for any one to rise from a study of those proceedings without seeing that the difference between that case and this is so great that it vitiates any attempt to draw an analogy from one to the other. In the first place there is the notorious fact that the Reform Bill of 1832 was a measure which the great mass of the people earnestly desired. A fierce agitation had sprung up in all parts of the country, riots had occurred in several of our principal cities, Peers had been attacked, the country was really almost on the brink of Civil war. I do not suppose that even the most heated of our opponents would contend that there is any such wave of feeling now. There certainly have been few signs of it on the part of noble Lords who sit opposite. Their enthusiasm for this Bill seems to be of a very tempered description. It has been singularly shy of expression, and has for the most part taken refuge in absence. It has needed an almost pathetic appeal on the part of the noble Viscount opposite to bring even his latest recruits on to the battle-field
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0418"/>
<col>827</col>
to-morrow; and although I congratulate the noble Viscount on the relatively encouraging nature of the reply which he has received, I cannot help thinking that the attitude of his followers is due quite as much to a reluctance at the prospect of seeing the comfortable spaces of those Benches invaded by a number of their colleagues, less obviously deserving than themselves, as it is to a real devotion to the Bill.<lb/>
Whether the attitude of noble Lords opposite really reflects the feeling of their supporters in the country I do not pretend to say. I am quite prepared to believe that it does not. I am quite ready to believe that already many of them have been so tainted with the atmosphere of this House that they are out of touch with the constituencies, and that their followers in the country are as warm about the Bill as they themselves are relatively cool. But, at any rate, you cannot deny this, that the forces against this Bill in the whole country are scarcely inferior, and in England are numerically superior, to those which you can boast. And while Lord Grey received his powers for the creation of Peers to carry a Bill which the overwhelming mass of the people desired, you are going to force a Party measure upon political opponents who are nearly as numerous as yourselves. That is the first difference between the two situations. The second is this. Lord Grey did not go to King William IV for the creation of Peers until the Reform Bill had three times passed its Second Reading and had twice passed its Third Reading in the House of Commons, or before it had been defeated in the House of Lords. You sought and obtained your "guarantees" in November before the Bill had passed its Second Reading in the House of Commons, before it had been introduced into this House, and at a later date you sought to put those powers into operation when three-fourths of the Bill&#x2014;or one-half of the Bill, if you like&#x2014; had been accepted by your Lordships here.<lb/>
I call your Lordships' attention to a third difference to which I venture to attach the greatest importance. There was a stage in the proceedings of 1832 which is conspicuous by its absence on the present occasion. King William IV did not give his sanction to the creation of Peers, after
<col>828</col>
twice refusing it, until he had ascertained that the Opposition was not in a position to relieve him from the anxieties of the position or to form an alternative Government. I believe I am historically correct&#x2014;the noble Viscount opposite will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;in saying that it was not only with the knowledge but at the instance of Lord Grey that King William IV sent for Lord Lyndhurst and the Duke of Wellington and discussed the situation with them. We all know the conditions which rendered it impossible, after ten days' discussion, for the Duke of Wellington to form a Government. But at any rate the discussion and the consultation took place. Now, I do not know whether the present Leader of the Opposition, if he had been similarly called into council, might have been able to do more than the Duke of Wellington did in 1832. I have no knowledge on that subject. But my point is this&#x2014;that he never was so consulted, that he was kept in the dark, that he knew nothing of what was going on. Ministers&#x2014;I speak only, of course, from such knowledge as I have from what has appeared in the newspapers this morning&#x2014;Ministers in November had taken the King and placed him, so to speak, under duress; they had taken him into captivity. They deprived the Sovereign of the opportunity open to every Constitutional Monarch under our system, and assuredly one which ought not to have been denied to the Sovereign in those trying conditions, of hearing the two sides of the case and of receiving advice from those who, although they may not be members of the Government, are equally the guardians of the Constitution and the servants of the Crown. There are many other differences between the two occasions upon which, if I had time, it would be easy to enlarge. But obviously no analogy can be drawn between the creation of forty or fifty Peers, slightly modifying the total number and political complexion of this House, and the creation of 400 or 500 Peers, swamping and destroying one of the two branches of the Legislature. There is no analogy between the creation of Peers for a single measure complete in itself and a creation of Peers intended to promote the enactment of an entire group of measures, the fatal and illegitimate offspring of the Parliament Bill. Above all, there is no analogy between the creation of Peers for a measure to extend the rights and privileges of the people and a measure
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0419"/>
<col>829</col>
to rob them of a Constitutional right which they have always hitherto enjoyed.<lb/>
I see that the Prime Minister lays great stress upon the opinion of Constitutional lawyers, and more particularly of Professor Dicey. I wish that any Minister before he quotes Professor Dicey would write to that learned man and ask how far the dictum which they quote applies to the present case. I think&#x2014;indeed, I know&#x2014;that Professor Dicey would reply, in the first place, that there is all the difference in the world between a single and homogeneous Government pressing a particular policy, and the case of a coalition making a bargain with separate factions for carrying measures which all do not equally or wholly approve. And, secondly, he would say that, while the creation of Peers may conceivably be justified in the last resort to carry a definite measure unmistakably sanctioned and desired by the people, there is no justification or excuse for obtaining beforehand an indefinite authority to create Peers to support the general policy of a Government.<lb/>
But I should like to quote an authority to which I think your Lordships will be inclined to attach greater weight than to the dicta of the most learned jurist&#x2014;the authority of the great Statesmen in the past, whose lives have been spent in the service of Parliament and whose wisdom and character and eloquence have been used to guide the councils of their Sovereign and to shape the destinies of the State. In 1856 there was a famous debate in this House&#x2014;it was, indeed, a combat of giants&#x2014;on the case of the Wensleydale Peerage. In that debate there participated not only illustrious veterans such as Lord Lyndhurst and Lord Brougham, themselves the survivors of the Reform era&#x2014;and there are still in your Lordships' House three members who, I believe, heard that debate&#x2014;but there also spoke in it Lord Derby, Lord Campbell, Lord Cranworth, who was at that time Lord Chancellor, Lord Granville, and the Duke of Argyll. The most remarkable feature of that remarkable debate was the almost prophetic unanimity with which the whole of those noble Lords anticipated the danger of a great creation of Peers in the future, and condemned, by anticipation, the course which their less scrupulous successors have pursued. I wish those of your Lordships who are interested in the matter would take the
<col>830</col>
trouble to read that debate. I have not the time, of course, to make more than a passing reference to it, and I will only trouble your Lordships with two short extracts from the speeches of two of those-eminent men. Lord Lyndhurst said&#x2014;
<quote>"It does not follow that this or any other exercise of the Prerogative, merely because it is strictly legal, is therefore consistent with the principles of the Constitution. The Sovereign may, by his Prerogative, if it should be thought proper, create 100 Peers with descendible qualities in the course of a single day, and this would be strictly legal; but everybody must feel and know that such an exercise of the Prerogative of the Crown would be a flagrant violation of the principles of the Constitution."</quote>
The second quotation is from Lord Granville&#x2014;
<quote>"Such a case as that of 1832 happily does not occur once in a century, or once in two centuries&#x2014;"</quote>
He little knew what was to come&#x2014;
<quote>"but I believe, whenever it should occur, any Minister would be alarmed at the idea of making use of the Crown's Prerogative in such a way."</quote>
Then he discussed the idea that had been mooted of creating forty Peers for the measure in question, and he said&#x2014;
<quote>"Your Lordships must feel that to make forty Peers is as unfeasible as it would be unconstitutional."</quote>
Before I leave the famous men of the past may I refer for one moment to an example which is familiar to the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, because he has himself explained and commented upon it in his book&#x2014;I mean the example of Mr. Gladstone? In 1884, when there was a great controversy between the two Houses of Parliament about the franchise, a controversy which was ultimately closed by the wisdom and moderation of the leaders on both sides, assisted by the sagacious counsels and the immense experience of Queen Victoria, Mr. Gladstone placed on record in a Memorandum to the Queen that he had declined to consider the alternative of the creation of Peers or of making an organic change in the House of Lords. I hope I have said enough to show, therefore, that neither in history, nor in the Constitutional writer who has been principally quoted, nor among the eminent Statesmen of the past can any justification be found for the course which His Majesty's Government have pursued. They have indeed cut themselves adrift from all experience and all authority. They have created an entirely new precedent of
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0420"/>
<col>831</col>
their own. They have started a revolution of which no man can see the end, and it is for this, I think, that they deserve the censure of this House, and later on will receive the judgment of posterity.<lb/>
My Lords, I have only one more observation to make. It is to call attention to that which, after all, appears to us to be the culminating point in this course of Constitutional outrage, I mean the fact that this Bill is to be used, these Peers are to be created, and this revolution is to be achieved because the Irish faction demand it, and that the firstfruits of this measure are to be the passage of Home Rule without the consent of the people. If every other circumstance of this and previous eases was similar this alone would differentiate the present from any previous occasion. Bolingbroke obtained his Treaty by the creation of Peers, and Lord Grey secured his Bill by the threat of Peers; but neither of them went on to use the advantage so obtained to dismember the United Kingdom behind the backs of the people. We know now exactly what is contemplated. The Home Secretary, with that sublime candour which is all his own, told us last night. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"You censure us because we are going to pass Home Rule in this Parliament. So we are."</quote>
There is no doubt about that. The full nature and intention of the conspiracy is revealed.<lb/>
Home Rule may be a good or a bad thing. I do not pause to discuss that. The country may or may not have changed its opinion about it&#x2014;I have no right to form a judgment upon that question. All we know is that on the two occasions on which it has been submitted to the country the country has rejected it with scorn. That it was so submitted again for the third time at the last General Election in a manner enabling the country to give to the question any conclusive or reasoned reply is a contention which no fair-minded man can put forward. The only argument used about it by the Prime Minister last night was that at the last election it was a bogey set up by the Opposition. But whatever the people have pronounced in the past or whatever they may pronounce in the future, at least I say&#x2014;let them pronounce. That is the whole of our case. To utilise the Prerogative of the Crown
<col>832</col>
and the creation of Peers to pass a measure like Home Rule before it has been again referred to the people would, I submit to your Lordships, be a public crime. That any Liberal Government should contemplate such a plan is an indication of the reckless extremes to which, when you embark on the path of revolution, you may find yourselves impelled. That the country should acquiesce in any such plan is to my mind quite unthinkable. There is, after all, a Prerogative of the people as well as a Prerogative of the Crown. The Prerogative of the people is and always has been in this country, at any rate in the last century, that they are deemed to be the final raid supreme arbiter of all great political issues. You are going to usurp the Prerogative of the Crown in order to deny and to extinguish the Prerogative of the people. That is the nature of the offence for which we on this side indict you in this debate. It is an offence which I believe the people of this country will never forgive; and when they realise it&#x2014;and it may be sooner than you expect&#x2014;they will rise in wrath and tear your ill-omened work to pieces.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0009P0I0421"/>
<col>833</col>
I have thought it right, and it has been thought right by those to whose opinions I am accustomed to defer, to appear just for this once in my place to-day as I took a somewhat continuous part in the events which have led up to the present crisis. I have listened, as I always do, with deep interest and great admiration to the noble Earl, and I do not offer any complaint of the fact that he has brought forward a Vote of Censure of His Majesty's Government. He and noble Lords opposite have no doubt good reason for doing so, as they are able thereby to indulge in the more natural pursuit of assailing us than that of differing among themselves. But in reading the terms of the noble Earl's Vote, I do not feel quite sure what it was for which we were to be particularly censured&#x2014;whether we were to be censured for having advised the Crown to do something which it never ought to have done in any circumstances or for giving advice which might be reasonable under some conditions, but was not warranted in this particular case. Or, to put it differently, have we in the noble Earl's opinion been guilty of a deliberate breach of duty or have we been guilty of an error of judgment which of itself of course might form the foundation of a vote of censure?<lb/>
Those who take the view that advice of the kind which was given last month never ought to have been given at all have not been inactive in this controversy. We have seen plenty of random talk of the impeachment of Ministers, sometimes, I think, from those who, unlike the noble Earl who has just sat down, have a somewhat vague idea of what that process historically was. The noble Earl touched on the wide field of Constitutional history, covering just 200 years, with which this question may be held to be concerned. He spoke of the creations in 1711, but perhaps he will allow me to leave to some of my noble friends anything like a close discussion of the Constitutional history of this question. I would merely say, as regards 1711, that I think the noble Earl would hardly satisfy the history school of the great University over which he presides by maintaining that the impeachment of Bolingbroke was founded mainly or to any great extent upon the fact of the creation of Peers in 1711.<lb/>
The noble Earl did not go on to allude to the Peerage Bill of 1719 which would
<col>834</col>
have stereotyped the number of the House of Lords at 184, and I only mention it because it is described by Mr. Lecky, who, whatever he was, was not an extreme Radical, as having the effect&#x2014;and I have no doubt he would also have added the intention&#x2014;of abolishing the only means which the Constitution provides of overcoming in extreme cases the opposition of the Lords. Neither did the noble Earl allude to the fact that by their steady flow of creations from the year 1770 Lord North and Mr. Pitt practically doubled for Party purposes the House of Lords. That is of interest because the noble Earl quoted a letter which he had received, as I understood it, from Professor Dicey, in which Professor Dicey said there never had been a case of indefinite authority being given to alter the composition of the House of Lords with a view to passing Party-measures.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02286"><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: Then I am afraid I must have misapprehended the noble Earl. What the noble Earl might also have alluded to, but did not allude to, is the case of the creations of the Irish Union. The creations of the Irish Union are often spoken of, and not always favourably spoken of, but they are generally spoken of as though they had no effect but to carry the Bill for the Irish Union through the Irish Parliament. But what is sometimes apt to be forgotten, and it is not by any means irrelevant with regard to the present issue, is that not only at that time were a number of English Peerages given to Irish Peers for purely Irish services, but in addition to that twenty-eight Irish Representative Peers were nominated by the Government of the day for services connected with the Union, and therefore amounted to a special creation for the purpose of giving Mr. Pitt a majority in the British House of Parliament. As regards the events of 1831 and 1832, I shall have to say a word later on. They have, as we know, been eagerly discussed in the course of this controversy, and I have no doubt the main details are familiar to your Lordships. I, however, prefer, as I said, to leave the discussion of these historical points to some of my noble friends who are to follow me.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0422"/>
<col>835</col>
But, as I was intimately concerned in the events of last year to which the noble Earl has so fully alluded, I desire to deal, so far as I can, with the specific charge&#x2014;namely, that, even if in some circumstances in the last resort the advice for the creation of Peers might have to be given in order to prevent the British Constitution ending in an absolutely blind alley, as it otherwise would, without the existence of some; such outlet, at any rate on this occasion the advice was wrongly given, and that this was not the time, when the means could properly be employed. Now I ask the House to look back for one moment at Parliamentary history since Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's statement in the House of Commons in the year 1907, when the original Resolutions embodying the main features of the Parliament Bill were carried in the House of Commons. Ever since then I think it is safe to say that it has been the steady view of progressive thought in this country that the relations between the two Houses could not indefinitely persist in their present condition, and that while the more progressive members of the Party opposite were prepared to alter the character of this House, apparently almost to any extent, if it only might be allowed to exercise its powers freely, yet we, the Party represented on this side of the House, thought that the relations must be directly dealt with. The bold step of the rejection of the Budget of 1909&#x2013;10 brought this question to an issue, and, in the point of view of the majority of the country, made our declared policy inevitable. That rejection <i>ipso facto</i> dissolved Parliament in January, 1910, and in parting from the Budget in this House I used words to the effect that we might have to obtain, and probably would have to obtain, statutory guarantees to ensure that no repetition of that rejection took place. That statement was further developed by the Prime Minister, Mr. Asquith, in the Albert Hall on December 10 of that year, when he said that&#x2014;
<quote>"We shall not assume office and not hold office unless we can secure the safeguards."</quote>
that is to say, the safeguards to be supplied by the Resolutions upon which the Parliament Bill was afterwards framed. Then came the statement of my right hon. friend in another place on April 14, which the, noble Earl has quoted, that we should either have to resign or to recommend a Dissolution of Parliament if we were not able to carry our Bill.<lb/>
<col>836</col>
Then came the deplorable event of the death of King Edward, followed by that effort for settlement of which the noble Earl, I am bound to say, did not speak very sympathetically, but of which I am inclined to think the noble Marquess beside him would speak more sympathetically, which took the form of the Conference, at which he and I sat together for so long. Now last winter the noble Marquess and I had a friendly contest in this House as to the proper reading of the breakdown of that Conference, and I will repeat in effect, in a very few words, what I said then&#x2014;that in our view the breakdown of the Conference closed a chapter, not because we particular men had failed to agree round a table, but because we had gained so complete an insight into the public opinion on the two sides which we respectively represented that it was vain to hope for an agreement upon this question. The breakdown of the Conference, therefore, brought us face to face with the position which the Prime Minister had indicated in his speech of April 14. And the words which the Prime Minister used on that occasion indicated that we should either resign our offices or ask for a Dissolution of Parliament. As the Prime Minister yesterday stated in another place, we resolved to ask for a Dissolution of Parliament for reasons with which I will deal later, and on November 16 the Prime Minister and myself, as representing the two Houses of Parliament, had the honour of being received by His Majesty and of placing before him the decision which the Cabinet had reached.<lb/>
I have His Majesty's leave to state plainly what occurred, because, since this question of that interview has been made the subject of so much comment, the King naturally desires that the facts should be plainly stated. The effect of that interview was that we ascertained His Majesty's view that, if the opinion of the country were clearly ascertained upon the Parliament Bill, in the last resort a creation of Peers might be the only remedy and might be the only way of concluding the dispute. His Majesty faced the contingency and entertained the suggestion as a possible one with natural, and if I may be permitted to use the phrase, in my opinion with legitimate reluctance. His Majesty, however, naturally entertained the feeling&#x2014;a feeling which we entirely shared&#x2014;that if we resigned our
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0423"/>
<col>837</col>
offices, having as we had a large majority in the House of Commons, the only result could be an immediate Dissolution in which it would practically be impossible, however anxious we naturally should be to do it, to keep the Crown out of the controversy. The mixing up of the Crown in a controversy such as that was naturally most distasteful to its illustrious wearer, whom we may regard as the first guardian of its prestige, but it could scarcely be more distasteful even to His Majesty than to myself and my colleagues, for reasons which I need not, I am sure, dilate upon.<lb/>
But, my Lords, it is altogether inaccurate&#x2014;and I might use a stronger phrase&#x2014;to say that at that time we asked His Majesty for guarantees. The whole position was obviously hypothetical. The question whether at any time the advice to create Peers should be given must necessarily depend for one thing upon the adequacy of the majority with which we were returned to the House of Commons, assuming that we were returned at all. On November 18 last the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"If the Government secure a majority of half a dozen votes the Bill is to be imposed upon a muzzled and helpless House of Lords."</quote>
That contingency has not arisen, and it is not for me to say whether, if it had arisen, we should have been in a, position to give to the Crown the advice which we tendered last month. What was also hypothetical was, before any question of the advice being actually given could arise, what would be the magnitude of the point in dispute between the two Houses. I do not know whether the magnitude of the difference between the two Houses in this case is disputed. The noble Earl opposite seemed somewhat disposed to dispute it and to argue that, after all, the Amendments which noble Lords opposite had proposed were all of them so comparatively innocuous in character that it would be easy for us to arrive at an agreement upon them, and that the fact that it was so easy was what made the possibility of this last resort being used so monstrous on this particular occasion. I can only say that to me, although I have not been able to follow the discussions in this House, the Amendments proposed by the noble Marquess opposite&#x2014;I am speaking, of course,
<col>838</col>
of the main Amendments&#x2014;do practically mean an altogether new Bill. When the noble Earl said that the House had accepted the principle by passing the Second Reading of the Bill I am altogether unable to follow him, or, indeed, to understand what he meant. Nor does it seem to me to make it very much better that the proposals of the noble Marquess, according to the noble Earl, are neither your policy nor ours. There is apparently something which satisfies nobody, and how a basis of agreement is to be made out of a proposition which apparently is liked as little by its author as it is by us I confess I am altogether unable to understand.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02287"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL CURZON OF KEDLESTON</member><membercontribution>: I did not say that of the Amendments which had been put into the Bill. I said it of the Bill as amended, if the noble Marquess sees the distinction.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02288"><member>THE MARQUESS OF CREWE</member><membercontribution>: I see the noble Earl's distinction, and I beg his pardon if I misrepresented him in any way. But I can put my case in a somewhat different form. Speaking not altogether without experience of leading this House in difficult conditions, I say quite categorically that I would infinitely sooner continue for the rest of my life to lead the House or to be a member of the House in the conditions under winch I have sat in it hitherto than attempt to perform the same feat or be obliged to hold the same position under the Bill as amended by the noble Marquess. I would infinitely prefer to go on as we have gone on since 1905 than attempt to proceed in the conditions outlined by the noble Marquess. I hope I have made that quite clear, because the noble Earl pressed strongly on that point, and seemed to consider that our conduct was of such an infamous kind because we were throwing away a chance of something like a harmonious agreement.<lb/>
To return for one moment to the conversation which we had the honour of holding with His Majesty, I confess that the contention that that conversation gave any unreality either to the election or to the subsequent discussions of the Bill seems to me an entirely empty one; and when the noble Earl complains that nothing was said, I wonder what he would have said&#x2014;and I think would have said
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0424"/>
<col>839</col>
with perfect justice&#x2014;if we had attempted to use that conversation as a lever in the General Election of last December for the purpose of securing votes. As a matter of fact, the question, so far as I know, was never mentioned in the election at all, and I am exceedingly glad that it was not, because the conversation was, although, of course, of a. formal character, eminently in the nature&#x2014;I will not say of a private conversation, but not in the nature of a conversation which ought to have been made, or could properly be made, public at the time. Therefore I confess that I remain absolutely unrepentant as to the alleged irregularity of which, according to the noble Earl, we have been guilty. I cannot help asking, <i>Cui malo?</i> Who is the worse for it? What possible harm was done or, indeed, could have been done? The sole object, and indeed the sole effect, of the conversation was to authorise us in asking for a Dissolution of Parliament, and, as I say, I do not feel that any other course would have been a possible one.<lb/>
The noble Earl questioned us about a possible resignation and the taking of office by his right hon. friend Mr. Balfour. I have already, I think, answered that in stating His Majesty's views on this subject&#x2014;views which I venture respectfully to state that I entirely share. The resignation by us of our offices could only have meant an immediate Dissolution, and it would not have been possible, and I do not believe that noble Lords opposite can say that it would have been possible, to avoid giving some explanation of that resignation which must have led to a controversy in which the Crown might, and probably would, unfortunately have been involved. The allegation is that our action in presenting the views of the Cabinet to His Majesty last November was premature. The only answer to that is that it was not action at all. It was, as I have said, a conversation dealing with a purely hypothetical set of conditions.<lb/>
The noble Karl recalled the events of 1831 and 1832. The Reform Bill passed this House and became an Act at the beginning of June, 1832. It was in the first days of January, six months before, that the King was formally approached by Cabinet Minute on the question of the creation of Peers, and for months before that, even before the Dissolution of the
<col>840</col>
previous April, this question of the creation of Peers had been the subject of frequent correspondence and communication between King William IV and his Ministers. Therefore, when the noble Earl tells us that it was premature even to allude to the subject as a conceivable hypothesis last autumn, there again, I think, he is not supported by precedent. Then the noble Earl dwelt upon the fact that this measure differs from others because it is not a single and self-contained measure, because if it is passed it may involve the passing of other measures, and in that respect it differs from the Reform Act of 1832 and from any other measure on which there has ever been a question of applying the Royal Prerogative. I turn once more to the measure of 1832. There is no doubt that a certain amount of the opposition to that measure was purely selfish opposition on the part of those who possessed nomination boroughs, and who disliked parting with the great influence which was given them, and also with the extremely valuable property which they were able to sell to gentlemen from India and elsewhere. The honest opposition, the really Conservative opposition to the Reform Bill was of an entirely different kind. The Reform Bill was objected to because of the kind of measures which would be passed by a reformed Parliament. It was thought that if places like Birmingham, Leeds, and Manchester were to obtain an accession of Members, and gained enfranchisement for a disreputable sort of people who were likely to be returned for such places, they would bring forward and succeed in passing measures of a cataclysmal and dangerous character. Therefore the 1832 case offers a very close analogy to this present case, because noble Lords opposite are not merely affected with the idea that they personally are going to lose a certain degree of power of rejecting measures and that they therefore will be personally humiliated; what they are afraid of is that certain measures to which they object will become law without the possibility of their showing any resistance.<lb/>
My Lords, I believe it to be the view of the majority of the people of this country that the powers given under the Parliament Bill as limited by that Bill will not be misused. The noble Earl alluded to the question of Home Rule, which, as he said, was dealt with in the House of Commons
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0425"/>
<col>841</col>
yesterday, I think at some length by a former colleague of his, Mr. Walter Long, and more particularly by the Home Secretary. I do not see how it can be disputed that in accepting the Parliament Bill the country was aware that a Home Rule measure was included in the list of measures which it would be possible to pass under that Bill, if it could stand the racket of the two years' discussion, and that the country was content to see it so discussed under the limitations, pretty severe limitations as some people think them, provided by the Parliament Bill.<lb/>
I have endeavoured to describe the steps by which we arrived at the advice which last month was given to the Crown. That advice involves what in our opinion is the last resort, the final resort in the absence of an appeal to the country, and a further appeal to the country has not yet, so far as I am aware, been asked for by anybody. I have not seen it asked for by any one of the newspapers which support the Party opposite, and it is not asked for because it is known that it would not be a reasonable thing to put the country to the trouble of another General Election once more confined to this particular issue. I can only say that His Majesty's Government would look forward with profound reluctance to the use of that last resort; but there is no alternative. There can be no alternative but to face that last resort in the terms of the advice given to the Crown the other day.<lb/>
I will make a present to the noble Earl opposite of one argument. I do not pretend that, as a Party, we are all of one mind on this question of the creation of Peers. We there resemble the Party of noble Lords opposite, some of whom seem to look forward with positive enjoyment to the idea of a forced creation. Even the noble Earl, whom I cannot suspect of such a sentiment, spoke of the possibility in a tone of jocularity in which I am altogether unable to join. Most of us think that if this House is to be reformed that reform should be more soberly considered than by the immediate addition of a large number to its body, even though the effect of such an addition might be to redress in a larger or less degree the balance of Parties in this House. At the same time, as the noble Earl mentioned
<col>842</col>
the subject, I think it is desirable to attempt to remove the misapprehension which may exist in some minds. The noble Earl alluded to the bold figures mentioned by my right hon. friend the Home Secretary in another place yesterday; but this I do feel compelled to say, that if we are to be forced, to my keen personal regret, into giving advice which would have the effect of the creation of Peers we cannot pretend that the number to be so created could necessarily be limited by any newspaper list, of which there have been so many seen of late; nor would it necessarily have any reference whatever to any division lists of your Lordships' House which may be seen when the question of the Amendments once more comes before this House. All such lists will have become, if the lamentable necessity arises, altogether irrelevant, and I all the various combinations of noble Lords opposite of which we read in our morning newspapers must be assumed to be at an end, because they have reference to an entirely different state of things. I state this not, as I venture to claim, in a minatory spirit, because the whole business, I frankly admit, is odious to me. I can only assure your Lordships I that anybody who tells you a different story has either been misled as to the facts of the case or has a purpose to serve in making that statement.<lb/>
I venture to claim that during the whole period in which this matter has been before us our course has been clear and consistent, and that there has been no change of purpose since we were first obliged to deal with the question. I go further, and say that even if his late Majesty King Edward had been spared to the country the course of events would not have been very dissimilar from what it has proved to be. Whether the Conference would have been held I cannot pretend either to affirm or to deny. Whether the influence of His Majesty in his lifetime would have been used in the same way in which the influence of his memory was used to bring about the Conference it is, of course, impossible to say. Neither shall I attempt either to affirm or deny that if King Edward had lived there would have been a General Election analogous to the General Election of December, 1910, with a view to submitting the Parliament Bill in its terms with the alternative favoured by the other side to the judgment of the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0426"/>
<col>843</col>
country; but I do say that our line of thought has been the same throughout. Our line of action has been the same throughout, and it would, speaking generally, have been the same if King Edward had lived. I therefore feel, though I recognise the full force of the manner in which the noble Earl presented his indictment, that we have nothing to plead in extenuation. I make no complaint whatever of the announcement of the noble Earl that his first step and that of his friends will be, if he has the power, to reverse the provisions which we desire to see made into law. The noble Earl has a perfect right to make that statement, and we do not dispute for a moment that he has a perfect right to carry his intentions into effect whenever he and his friends obtain the confidence of the country. In the meantime, whatever the result of tonight's vote, apart from the verdict of history to which the noble Earl really appeals, we are content to leave our conduct to be judged by the reasonable body of our fellow-countrymen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02289"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Prime Minister last night based his justification for the action of His Majesty's Government on three statements&#x2014;that at the last General Election the country had approved of the Parliament Bill, that at the same election it had repudiated the alternative policy of my noble friend behind me, Lord Lansdowne, and, lastly, that there was no alternative Government for the country to his own. I entirely deny and dispute every one of those three statements. My noble friend Lord Curzon has already dealt so admirably with the Prime Minister's statements that there remains very little for me to deal with, but I would remind your Lordships, in addition to what Lord Curzon said, that certain facts absolutely deprive of any moral basis the statement of His Majesty's Government that their action has been endorsed by the electors of this country.<lb/>
Let me remind your Lordships that there are, roughly speaking, 8,000,000 electors in the United Kingdom, and that half of those, electors returned 458 Members to the House of Commons, and the other half only 212. This grotesque system of misrepresentation is so arranged that England has forty-seven fewer members of the House of Commons than she is entitled to, and England is against the Government.
<col>844</col>
It is a question not of opinion but of fact. The majority of English men and women are against the policy of the Government. The Government have done nothing more nor less than this: they have prostituted the Prerogative of the Crown to trample down the rights of English men and women. I would ask your Lordships to remember the moral attitude which the Party opposite have always taken on the question of Home Rule. They have said that the Union had no moral basis, that we were not entitled to maintain it, and that the majority of the Irish people were against it. Yet the same Government are going to tear up the whole of our ancient Constitution by the use of the Prerogative, although by so doing they know they are trampling on the majority of the people of England. England is still the predominant partner. We deny that the Government have any moral authority for what they are doing. This has happened in England before. We are seeing repeated now by the abuse, the monstrous abuse, of the Prerogative what was done at the time of the Great Rebellion.<lb/>
I ask your Lordships to recall what the Great Rebellion was. The war lasted for more than seven years; the Parliament had to conquer England; it conquered Scotland and it conquered Ireland; there was pitched battle after pitched battle, besides hundreds of skirmishes. At the end of those seven years, when England had been deluged with blood, the Royal Prerogative was abolished, the House of Lords was abolished, and the authority of one Chamber was established unchecked and uncontrolled. Your Lordships remember how intolerable was the abuse that followed, and how intolerable the rule of that Single Chamber. It was, however, finally ended by the less intolerable domination of one man, the Master of the Legions, the ruler of the Army. Comparing the results of the Great Rebellion with the results which the Government are now going to achieve if they can, we find that they are going to absorb the Prerogative of the Crown as an ordinary instrument of Party machinery. The Prerogative of the Crown is to be at the beck and call of the Radical caucus for use when required. It is to be used simply as an instrument of Party machinery to destroy all independent action on the part of members of this House, and if need be for imposing on the majority of
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0427"/>
<col>845</col>
this country the rule and domination of the minority. The House of Lords is not in form to be abolished, but gradually to be deprived of all power, emasculated of everything that made it a force in the Constitution.<lb/>
I know there are members of your Lordships' House who think that this is the language of exaggeration. Let me test that. I appeal to what the Home Secretary said last night. He said, with the most perfect confidence&#x2014;
<quote>"We are going to pass Home Rule for Ireland in this Parliament."</quote>
The particular functions still left to this House under the Parliament Bill did not strike him as at all germane to the question of whether Home Rule was to be passed into law or not. No; "in this Parliament," he said, "we are going to pass Home Rule." I will apply another test which is simple and conclusive. There are noble Lords in this House who still think that some power will be left to this Chamber under the Parliament Bill. I will ask them, Is it not true that the House of Commons on its own motion, after the period of suspense, could destroy those limited powers altogether or abolish this House? This House would have absolutely no more influence over its own fate after that period was over than any debating society in the country. Therefore I am entitled to say that it is a mere hypocrisy and sham to pretend that in this Bill any real effective power is left to this House. The noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, referred a little time ago to the utter humiliation which this Bill inflicted upon this House. The Prerogative is to be exercised. This House is to be abolished in fact if not in name, for what purpose? To establish the autocratic position of a Single Chamber, itself unreformed and unrepresentative, proved by the statistics I have given your Lordships not to represent the people of this country, and utterly to misrepresent the people of England. Yet that is the Chamber in whose favour this tremendous revolution is to take place; a Chamber which, in its turn, will be dominated by the junto of the day which has control of the machinery of the largest Party in the Chamber.<lb/>
I offer my compliments to the Government of the day who have with such singular success, but at the price of their trust, manipulated this great conspiracy.
<col>846</col>
They will have accomplished in two years of intrigue by use of the Prerogative what was not accomplished at the time of the Great Rebellion except after seven years' Civil war. I cannot extend my compliments equally to my own Party in the constituencies and in the House of Commons. I do not think that, either in the House of Commons or in the constituencies, my Party have fought this question as it ought to have been fought from the beginning, or with a quick enough sense of the tremendous issues that were at stake. They allowed political lassitude, not unnatural after two General Elections, to have an influence over them which history will not justify, particularly when remembrance is had of the reason why the present revolution has taken place, why the Prerogative has been abused, and why the Cabinet has been false trustees to the Sovereign and to the people.<lb/>
Never was there a more pitiless exposure of this Government than that given by the noble Earl, Lord Curzon. He showed us that their policy had not been due to the special amount of original sin that resided in the Cabinet or in their Party, but how they had embarked on the fatal policy of endeavouring to pass Home Rule into law without giving the country an opportunity of saying "Aye" or "No." Is there a noble Lord here who does not know that if the question of Home Rule had not existed the Government would have taken a wholly different course? I do not believe they ever would have contemplated this abuse of the Prerogative, or have set out for a partisan and temporary settlement. The spirit of statesmanship which animated them at the Conference would have prevailed. They would have come to the House of Lords and said, "We want a fairer representation in this House and equality of opportunity," and your Lordships would have met them. They would have said, "We want not only equality, but a Constitutional machinery for the readjustment of the differences between the two Houses," and again the House of Lords would have met them. There would have been a national settlement of the Constitutional difficulty. But the Government were dragged down to their present position because they are tied hand and foot to the chariot-wheels of Mr. Redmond, because by this abuse of the Prerogative, by this temporary device of the Parliament Bill, the Second
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0428"/>
<col>847</col>
Chamber is not to be allowed to give the people of this country an opportunity of saying "Aye" or "No." That is the only condition under which Mr. Redmond thought Home Rule could become law, and so to their eternal shame the Government have accepted his conditions and abused their trust.<lb/>
I listened with profound admiration to the speech which Lord Curzon has delivered. He and I have for many years past worked together in a common cause, and I trust and believe that for many years to come, if we are spared, we shall work together in complete amity and cordial agreement. For the moment we are divided on a question with which you are all familiar. But that does not prevent me in the least from admiring his speech and associating myself with all that he has said. Let me refer to one or two of those noble and pregnant sentences. He said that Ministers had been guilty of an abuse of their duty to the Throne, to Parliament, and to the people. He spoke of the enormity of their conduct and the monstrous prostitution of the doctrine of the mandate. He said they had begun by coercing the King and had ended by betraying the people. He said this was a measure to rob the people of their Constitutional rights, and that the Government had usurped the Prerogative of the Crown in order to extinguish the Prerogative of the people. I associate myself with every single word that the noble Earl said. I have already alluded to the fact that he and I take a different view of our duty at this crisis, and I am not going to allude to that difference. But it does seem amazing and incomprehensible to me that there should be members of our Party who share Lord Curzon's opinions and my own in regard to this Bill, and who yet are going, from what we learn in the newspapers, to vote with the Government to carry into law the measure which has been denounced in such noble and eloquent language by my noble friend. I think that those who are going to take that action owe it to this House to explain the motives which are dictating their conduct. I know we shall be told by them that they are going to take this action in order to prevent the creation of four or five hundred Peers, to prevent this House from being swamped by an intolerable abuse of the Royal Prerogative.<lb/>
<col>848</col>
My noble friend laid great stress on some words used by the Home Secretary in the House of Commons last night. What were those words? The Home Secretary said&#x2014;
<quote>"Why should we shrink from the creation of 400 or 500 Peers."</quote>
Who would suggest that Mr. Churchill would shrink from anything? It certainly never occurred to me that Mr. Churchill would hesitate, to create four or five hundred Peers if he had the power and if he thought it suited his purpose. But I would ask you to compare what the noble Marquess, Lord Crewe, said were the "bold words" of the Home Secretary with the statement made by Lord Crewe himself here to-night. Those words are fresh in your Lordships' recollection. You will agree that they were uttered by a man who singularly dislikes the task to which he may have to put his hand presently, by a man who, although I think he has given a most mistaken interpretation of his responsibility in this matter, is yet obviously feeling his responsibility very keenly. Lord Crewe and his friends will not shrink from advising His Majesty to create as many Peers as are necessary to fulfil the pledge which they admit His Majesty has given to them. They will not make nice calculations drawn from lists published in <i>The Times</i> or in other journals. They will ask His Majesty to fulfil the spirit of his promise&#x2014;that is, enabling them to carry the policy, of which they say the country has approved, in connection with the Parliament Bill. I ask them now to contradict me if they can. They have not a blank cheque to create as many Peers as may give Mr. Churchill that majority which he would like to see used for purposes entirely unconnected with the Parliament Bill. If Mr. Churchill's threat is the only reason which those Unionist Peers who hold the whole policy of the Government to be a monstrous enormity, if that is the only reason they can adduce for their intention to assist the Government with their votes, I do not envy them the verdict of history. They stand confessed, even on their own showing, as intending to do evil that good may come. The good they look forward to is the prevention of the creation of Peers; the evil they are prepared to assist is the passing of the Parliament Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02292"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl who has just sat down concluded his speech in language which recalls the days of Charles II. I cannot follow him into all his metaphors, and I shall pass that part of his speech. The noble Earl has spoken of the majority of the men and women of England as being against the Government. I confess myself wholly unable to agree with or dissent from him in that. Unfortunately the majority of men and women in this country do not have votes; and if they had the existence of plural voting prevents us knowing what they would say. Then, again, the noble Earl went on to say that the desire of the Government was to absorb the Prerogative of the Crown into Party machinery. It is easy to make assertions. But what we are here to discuss are the Constitutional principles of the present situation. I wish to try to strip this question of some of the rhetoric in which it has been involved and which seems to me to be largely irrelevant.<lb/>
What is the position? The quarrel arose between the two Houses long ago and has been becoming more and more acute, until it became very acute in 1906, and the result was that in 1907 a Resolution was carried by a large majority, nearly 300,
<col>850</col>
in the House of Commons asserting the principle which is embodied in this Bill. The next cause of quarrel was when your Lordships rejected the Budget by a large majority. That was met by a counter-Resolution, also carried by an enormous majority in the House of Commons, condemning your Lordships' action. Then the question came to a General Election and a large majority of the country pronounced for the Budget and also for the principle of what is called the restricted Veto. Then there was a long debate, and the Resolutions which were embodied in this Bill were again passed by a large majority in the House of Commons; and then at a General Election there was a further pronouncement of the electors. Even those on the other side who take most strongly the view that the proposals of the Government are not justified do not profess to desire an appeal to the country. It is common ground that an appeal to the country would not be likely to result in a change of opinion on this question.<lb/>
How do we stand in this state of things? Two alternatives seem to me to be the only possible ones. I rule out as inconceivable the proposition that, assuming it to be the deliberate intention of the House of Commons after two elections to pass a certain measure, your Lordships should offer a permanent opposition to it&#x2014;I rule, out as inconceivable a situation in which that should be left without a remedy. If that is so there were two ways only of dealing with the problem. One was for Ministers to resign and leave the Sovereign to choose other Ministers, who would go to the country. That would be a very proper and natural course under certain circumstances; but it was neither a proper nor natural course in the circumstances which occurred here. We were desirous throughout to keep the Crown out of this controversy. There is a great deal of confusion about the position of the Crown in this matter. The Crown is not a mere piece of machinery. The Crown is a very important element in the Constitution, but the Crown always acts upon the advice of Ministers, and always will so act as long as our Constitution remains what it is. If that be so, the Crown must have Ministers who have a reasonable chance of possessing the confidence of the country, and if the Crown has Ministers who could not hold their office for a week and who if they went to the country would
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0430"/>
<col>851</col>
be defeated&#x2014;it is not advisable that the Crown should be placed in that position.<lb/>
The other alternative was the alternative which has actually been adopted. It was to tender advice to the Crown, and that advice was tendered only on the footing that there was to be a reference to the country and a reference in the only Constitutional way. That reference was taken, and the response was emphatic&#x2014;the majority was undiminished. It is no answer to say it was a coalition. It was a coalition of men holding divergent opinions on various subjects, but unanimous upon one point, and that point the Parliament Bill. These were the facts which we had to face. I think the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, was miles away from the facts. I also think the noble Earl who moved this Resolution was very far away from the facts, but he spoke in measured language. The only part I shall refer to of Lord Curzon's speech is that in which he characterised the action of the Government. But it is not the characterisation by other people of the Government that we want. We want to be judged by what we have done, and in reference to the facts; and if the facts are what I have stated no amount of rhetoric will make the situation seem different.<lb/>
Lord Curzon referred to Professor Dicey. I, for one, am not likely to be wanting in respect for Professor Dicey. He is a personal friend of my own. But I am not concerned with Professor Dicey's political convictions. What I am concerned with is his opinion as a distinguished jurist on the large question of principle which he has discussed in his book quite apart from all current policies, and it is because he has laid down that principle that we turn to his book as a book of authority. Lord Curzon also referred to what occurred in 1711 and again in 1832. To discuss what particular shades of opinion there were between this statesman and that, and what the controversy was at the time and how the circumstances have differed in minute details from the present situation, is not a very profitable course to pursue. What is a great deal to the point was that in 1711 it was admitted that there was this remedy for a breakdown in the Constitution, and that doctrine became even more definitely expressed in 1832. Does anybody imagine that between 1832 and now that doctrine has not got still more authority than it had in those days?
<col>852</col>
Why, our Constitution is not rigid, and does not stand still. It is unwritten; it is evolving itself in the direction of making the basis of government more and more a popular basis; and that being so I maintain that the value of the precedent of 1711 and 1832 is simply to show that there is in our Constitution a principle which has grown more powerful still&#x2014;so powerful that t think no sane or rational Minister would have given any other advice to the Sovereign than that which was given by His Majesty's present Ministers.<lb/>
Really the question is a very simple one. Your Lordships have been jousting with the House of Commons, and it is a serious matter to joust with the House of Commons, and when a trial of strength has arisen with the House of Commons, with the country behind it, there are those who think that the House of Commons ought to prevail. If that is so there is in this Constitution a remedy for the situation which has arisen, and that remedy, in the circumstances which are actually current, is a remedy which is proper to be applied. What my noble friend Lord Crewe said to-day, coming after the documents which the Prime Minister laid before the country yesterday, shows that the advice which was given was not advice directed to some state of things which was to be crystallised irrespective of what might happen hereafter, but advice directed to this, that it might prove necessary to obtain a creation of Peers, in which case advice would be given to the Sovereign that the creation should take place. It is not to the point to say that the matter appears to have been entered upon long before these discussions took place. Why, last year the Resolutions, the very substance of this Bill, were discussed in the House of Commons with a bitterness and a rancour which gave us a most lively anticipation of what would happen when they were crystallised into a Bill. We knew what we had to expect. We knew the position we should have to meet at the hands of a majority in this House, and under the circumstances there was no course open except the course which the Government have taken, unless we were to find ourselves in the humiliating position of acknowledging that the Constitution had broken down and that there was no remedy for the situation in which we were left.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0009P0I0431"/>
<col>853</col>
it has been to me to hear Lord Curzon to-day. I feel sure I may say, as a humble member of this House, that having listened to the eloquent words of the noble Earl, we all came to the conclusion that he thoroughly exposed the enormity of the conduct of His Majesty's Ministers. The noble Marquess the Leader of the House said that he welcomed the Vote of Censure. He seemed to get up in a frame of mind either of triumph or very good spirits. Whichever it may be, we are pleased that the Government rejoice at this Vote of Censure. For this Vote enables us to consider two distinct, points&#x2014;the Constitutional soundness or unsoundness of the policy which His Majesty's Ministers have adopted in their advice to the Crown, and the action we shall pursue to-morrow evening when the Parliament Bill comes up again in virtue of that advice. As to the latter point, I find myself in agreement with Lord Selborne. I welcome this Vote of Censure, but I regard it more in the light of a preliminary to action than as a substitute for it.<lb/>
If we compare the precedents which have been cited this evening, those of 1711, of 1832, and of 1884, when in one case Peers were made and in the others it was suggested that Peers should be made, we are able to see at once the extravagant position in which His Majesty's Ministers have placed themselves. They are attempting to shift the centre of Constitutional gravity and to take away from the Sovereign and from this House power which has been possessed for many years. It is ridiculous for His Majesty's Ministers to pretend that the precedents which have been quoted this afternoon can possibly cover and cloak their present intentions and actions. Their policy can be justified by one consideration and by one consideration alone, and that is success. Are the Government quite sure they will be successful? I have myself very grave doubts. Lord Curzon reminded us of the circumstances connected with the Reform Bill of 1832, and of the position of the two Parties in 1884 when Mr. Gladstone brought in his Franchise Bill and Lord Salisbury would not agree to it unless it was accompanied by a redistribution of seats. But to-day two elections have taken place, and, as Lord Selborne has reminded the House, opinion is almost equally divided in the country. The majority the Government possess in the
<col>854</col>
country is a very narrow one indeed. Constitutional changes which have been carried out in the past have had a proportionate amount of public opinion and fighting strength behind them to justify their passage into law; but to-day the Government desire to carry out a colossal change, though they have not that overwhelming opinion behind them which alone could justify them in embarking upon it.<lb/>
Is it statesmanlike, is it prudent or wise, on the part of His Majesty's Ministers to attempt to force upon half the people of this country measures like Home Rule and Welsh Disestablishment, contravening the very principles to which so large a section of the population is entirely pledged? Surely a reaction will take place. History furnishes many cases of reaction as the result of violent action on the part of Ministers. Are you sure that no reaction will take place, condemning in the most emphatic terms the policy which you now advocate, and especially the means by which you are carrying that policy into effect? On the Third Reading of the Parliament Bill the noble Viscount opposite, whom I am glad to see in his place, gave expression to an amazing sentence, a really astounding sentence. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"What I would desire would be that this inevitable Parliamentary and political operation should be carried through without anything like a social shock."</quote>
So his proposition is this&#x2014;that this House which has existed for 700 or 800 years, which is older even than the House of Commons, is to have its powers taken away from it, and yet the noble Viscount hopes that it will be "carried through without anything like a social shock."<lb/>
During the course of this debate nobody on the opposite side of the House has produced any precedent to justify the character of the step which the Government intend to take. Let me make one observation on the means that they are determined to employ. I claim that the maintenance of the dignity of the Crown is far more important than the success of any legislative proposal. I confess that in this connection the course which the Government propose to take causes me the most profound apprehension. No doubt the noble Viscount and his Party are perfectly entitled to take the risk of passing a Home Rule Bill through both Houses, although it is a measure which has been
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0432"/>
<col>855</col>
twice rejected and never endorsed by any preponderant body of public opinion. But what they are not entitled to do is to force that measure through this House by using the Prerogative of the Crown. The Crown ought not to be placed in such a position that it can be accused of having violated popular opinion as expressed on two separate electoral occasions. By your action you do not protect the Crown; you expose the Crown. You do not keep it out of Party politics; you involve it in Party politics. By your advice you have compelled the Crown to become partial&#x2014;I venture even to use the word partisan.<lb/>
There is one other point to which the noble Marquess, Lord Crewe, alluded, and, I think, also the noble Viscount, Lord Haldane. It is admitted that the Prerogative of making Peers should be invoked only in the last resort. I believe the noble Viscount laid stress on the fact that it should be only exercised after the utmost limit of concessions has been exhausted. But this is not the case to-day. The Conference, to which allusion has been made, has kept its secret. None of us know its secrets. But it sat for five months and held 21 meetings, and I think it is reasonable to assume that at that Conference His Majesty's Ministers did not say to the representatives of the Tory Party, "You know the terms of the Parliament Bill. These are our terms. We have none other to offer you." We may very reasonably suppose that the representatives of both Parties went into the Conference prepared to offer the maximum amount of concession with a, view to arriving at a settlement which would be compatible with the wishes and goodwill of both sides. In fact last night the Prime Minister rather indicated that-much. I think, therefore, that it might be plausibly argued that the noble Viscount and his friends would be perfectly justified in embodying in their Bill the maximum of concessions which they were prepared to give, and in then invoking the Prerogative of the Crown to pass them. But what is to be said of a Government, what will the people of England say of a Government, which invokes the Prerogative as an excuse for withdrawing its concessions? For my part I think that that is an extraordinary extension of the right of advising the Crown to exercise this Prerogative, and I do think that their action, in the words of the noble Lord,
<col>856</col>
makes them guilty of a breach of duty. I deplore the action of His Majesty's Government, and I condemn the methods by which they have sought to put that policy into effect.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02295"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in asking your Lordships' leave to intrude for a few moments in this debate, I am conscious that I occupy a position which is supposed to be not a desirable one. My first observation is that noble Lords on the other side have rendered it extremely difficult for any one to speak upon the subject, and that is my main attack upon them. One of the cardinal principles that most of us have recognised has been the fact that we should, as far as we possibly could, keep the Crown out of our political debates. That has been recognised, I suppose, on both sides of the House. Noble Lords opposite know perfectly well that it is absolutely impossible to keep the Crown out of this debate. It is not a thing that you can speak of without considering what is the proposition which the Crown has permitted and what are the circumstances in which that permission was given. How is it possible to keep the Crown out of the debate?<lb/>
What appears to me to be a very serious part of my arraignment of the Government is that we do not now know what took place. We have got one side. It is a dialogue in which there is only one person speaking. We do not know what His Majesty said, and we do not know what were the arguments by which His Majesty was induced to give that consent. I must say if ever there was a situation in which the Crown ought to have been protected against undue influence under such circumstances it was that in which, as I understand, in November last this agreement was come to. What was the agreement? We heard from the Home Secretary last night what it was, and we heard a very doubtful and tentative correction of that statement. It was said in bold words. All that the noble Marquess opposite said was that he could not confirm it, but that it must not be understood that he contradicted it. What does that mean?<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0433"/>
<col>857</col>
Just consider what we are dealing with. It is no ordinary circumstance. The noble Viscount opposite very truly said that you cannot treat analogies as if they were absolute principles; you must see what the thing is, and argue on facts and not upon what people say to each other. I agree with each one of those propositions. But what were the circumstances? What was it that induced the King to give that permission? And what was the permission he gave? We are left in the dark. I should have thought that now, if ever, there are circumstances in which we ought to have had the whole story. If you are going to make a new departure and say, "We are going to abandon what hitherto we have done, and we are going to do what has not been done for 200 years," then you ought to let us hear the whole story, and justify it if you can. But do not let us have these mysterious hints as to what the King said, and how much His Majesty was going to give. Everything is in the dark. That seems to me to be one of the things of which we have a right to complain. Can any one doubt that this Bill which the Government desire to have, and without which they cannot get this power over the Constitution, would reduce the House of Lords to an absolute nonentity? Can any one gravely argue that the mere interposition of two years makes the whole difference? Surely when we are dealing with a Constitution which has admittedly lasted for 700 years we might have some reason given to us for this proposed departure, and as to why you should have these unlimited powers&#x2014; if they are unlimited&#x2014;and we do not know what they are. We ought to know what we are dealing with. The mystery maintained by the Government has no doubt this advantage to them, that it may divide those who generally think alike. Some people think that if there is going to be a complete change in the Constitution you had better force your adversaries into the open and see what they mean. Why do you not tell us what the truth is? It is because you want to divide your adversaries and so command them. That is the reason you have taken this line of action.<lb/>
I do not wish to go through the history of the Reform Bill. I think the version given of it by the noble Marquess opposite &#x2014;whom I, as well as everybody else in the House, I am sure, am delighted to see
<col>858</col>
again in his place&#x2014;is absolutely inaccurate. I am afraid I am one of the few members of the House who can remember the riots on the Reform Bill; but, as a matter of fact, there is this distinction, which I will commend to the noble Lord's attention. The question of the Reform Bill differs from the present question in one remarkable respect&#x2014;that the agitation for the Reform Bill was right, whereas the agitation for a Home Rule Bill is wrong. Although he may say that that is a matter of opinion, and I agree that to some extent it is, it is also a matter of fact. Can anybody doubt what the question in the country was with regard to the Reform Bill? And can anybody say that there is any agitation in the country for a Home Rule Bill now? I might go through the different classes of things that are to be dealt with under this Parliament Bill. There is the Church, for example; and I appeal to the Episcopal Bench to have regard to that question, which is also to be forced through under the same circumstances.<lb/>
We are dealing now with an accusation ', against the Prime Minister, and I repeat that the grounds for keeping the King out of this controversy ought in my opinion to have been overwhelming in the circum- stances in which this pledge is supposed to have been given. A young King, uncrowned, suffering from the deepest grief which could afflict a loving son, is suddenly appealed to by a Minister, himself a lawyer of no mean distinction, and informed that the only thing to be done is to give him the authority he claims. Was there ever a grosser breach of trust than such a thing done at such a time and in such circumstances? Everybody must recognise the supreme importance of this occasion, and when I hear talk about a professor giving an opinion upon matters I very much concur with the noble Viscount opposite. I doubt whether it is a desirable thing to bring our professors into our debates. I speak with all respect to those who are professors. At the same time professors are sometimes not the best advisers in the active life of the present. I appeal to other authorities. Can anybody give me a single authority who will not denounce the precedent of 1711 as a gross and unconstitutional act? I admit it is difficult to give a definition of the word "unconstitutional," but my noble and learned friend opposite knows how easy it is to take the mere letter of the law and violate
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0434"/>
<col>859</col>
the spirit of it. Can anybody doubt that this is a gross violation of the spirit of our law? We are dealing with what is really and truly the abolition of one independent legislative Chamber, and you talk about that being only a question of the Royal Prerogative. I observe that there has been a marked avoidance of the precedents of 1711 and 1719. I invite the noble Viscount, who is thoroughly familiar with Constitutional history and thoroughly competent to give your Lordships advice and information, to consider that question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02296"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: May I ask what the exact question is?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02297"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: The exact question is whether it is Constitutional or not Constitutional, and whether any authority can be found to suggest that the precedent of 1711 was Constitutional. The noble Viscount has been good enough to ask me, and I will give him authority if he likes. This is an authority with reference to the creation of twelve Peers in 1719. I am quoting from Lord Stanhope's History&#x2014;
<quote>"The creation of twelve Peers to establish a majority for the Court has been justly reprobated in Lord Oxford's Administration, and formed an article in his impeachment."</quote>
The 16th article of that impeachment alleged the very thing I am suggesting now&#x2014;namely, an impression being made upon Queen Anne's mind of the necessity of what was being done. Lord Oxford, in his defence, said that every one who had known of one of these creations of Peerages had remarked the fact that without an appeal to the Privy Council or to any other of the authorities whereby certain things were given or granted, letters patent, or otherwise, it was always alleged to be <i>ex mero motu,</i> and it was only by the grace of the Crown and the selection of the individual for merit that a Peerage was granted. That seems to me to be a precedent that one would like to have asserted, because, apart from threats, no other such precedent can be found anywhere. Therefore, whatever was supposed to be done in 1832, it was not done, it was threatened; and those are the threats that we have held over us now.<lb/>
We do not know what is to be done; it may be, for aught I know to the contrary, that the authority given has been grossly
<col>860</col>
exaggerated. At all events, whatever the authority is, it was given under circumstances which, as I say, are absolutely unprecedented and condemned by every authority. I do not except the precedent of 1856, because although the question there was to some extent a different one yet what was said and done in relation to Lord Wensleydale's Peerage was this: Each of the noble Lords who took part in that debate admitted that any such thing as a wholesale creation of Peers for the purpose of overbearing this House could not be Constitutional, or indeed, some of them said, imaginable. They had not any experience of His Majesty's present Administration or they would not have said that. What I am anxious to say is that I am not one of those whose loyalty is dependent upon a particular act of the Crown. We ought to recognise that the Crown was, in the circumstances I have described, not to be blamed, and certainly not to be regarded as the advising authority for any such proceeding as we are now considering. It was a proceeding taken in the interest of and for the purposes of the present Administration, and, I do not hesitate to say for the purpose of keeping themselves in office.<lb/>
I do not desire to impute anything unworthy or improper, but I will say this&#x2014;that the Government have a sort of impression, which I need not say I do not share, that it is absolutely for the good of the country that they should continue in office, and they, not unnaturally, regard that proposition as one which entitles them to do extraordinary things and make extraordinary promises such as shall keep them in office. They may, perhaps, be right. I do not think they are; but if they are, it is not unlikely that their judgment is a little swayed by that which follows upon it. In these circumstances it appears to me it would be burning daylight to go through what both Lord Curzon and my noble friend Lord Selborne pointed out as to the support the Government have in the country. You cannot deny the facts. You cannot deny the amount of support there is by the counting of the votes. Some mysterious calculation of the noble Viscount opposite is suggested to throw doubt upon them, but does anybody in the world doubt that on the whole the figures are correct? I do not deny that when you are dealing only with the votes, and if you have not examined that interesting little model which is to be
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0435"/>
<col>861</col>
found in the neighbouring chamber to show how far one vote is from being of one value in the present state of the constituencies, you can manipulate the figures as you please. But if you take the broad facts, and take the numbers, about which there is no question, you can entertain no doubt that what the Government are doing is what was done in the first great French Revolution&#x2014; a mere minority will be governing this country under circumstances which I venture to say have not been seen or heard of in this country for 200 years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02298"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (EARL LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I only desire to address a few observations to your Lordships, stimulated, I will not say provoked, by the eloquent speech of the noble Earl. The logical conclusion from the speech of the noble Earl is neither more nor less than this&#x2014;that this House, alone among the institutions of the United Kingdom, is free from all control. The Crown can be controlled and has been controlled by the refusal of Supplies; the House of Commons is repeatedly controlled by Dissolution; but the whole gist of the noble Earl's argument goes to this&#x2014;that it is unconstitutional for the only pressure that can be put upon this House to be put upon it under any circumstances. If that be the true doctrine of the Constitution&#x2014;and, with a very unfeigned respect for the noble Earl and his great authority, I think it is contradicted in the pages of nearly every Constitutional writer that I am acquainted with&#x2014;then Lord Grey was right in saying in the early thirties that this country would be governed by an uncontrollable oligarchy. I submit that no one who has studied our Constitutional system can for a moment entertain such a doctrine as the noble Earl desires in effect to maintain.<lb/>
The fact is, as my noble friend Lord Haldane pointed out, the whole question is one of circumstances. Are we in such a situation that we are driven to take this unwelcome step? Let me very briefly remind your Lordships of what the facts really are. Ever since that step, which I have always regarded as the most fatal mistake that has ever been made in the long annals of this House, was taken&#x2014;I mean the throwing out of the Budget&#x2014;there has not been any question on any side of the House but that the Constitution ought to be changed. There is no dispute that the
<col>862</col>
situation in which that act left us and the apprehensions that it bequeathed to us for the future were such that the Constitution had to be changed. All of your Lordships agree with us on that point; it is only a question of competition between different methods for attaining that result. The Government method is to restrain the powers of this House, to alter the relations of the House. That has been our method all through. We have also stated in the Preamble of the Bill our intention to modify the constitution of this House, and the more I reflect upon it the more I believe that that will provide an avenue to common consent, and some day, I hope an early day, to the condition that all of us desire to see.<lb/>
What is your method? It has only been gradually disclosed, a circumstance well worth bearing in mind. At first it was limited to a reconstitution of this House. But the proposals made were, as I have more than once pointed out, so vague and indefinite that one could not tell what the effect of them would be if carried into legislation. Gradually they became a little clearer, and then we found that it was contemplated that there should be a permanent Conservative majority installed in this House&#x2014;a disputed majority, if you please, as to size and dimensions, but the fact was that a majority was contemplated. There was not a single proposal made from the Opposition side of the House which did not involve that consequence. It was defended by the noble Marquess himself in a speech not long ago in which he said that it was natural that there should be on the Conservative side a majority in this House, and he thought that we should not dispute that. Then we began to hear of some proposals for altering the relations of the two Houses and the powers of this House. It was proposed that there should be a Joint Session. There is a great deal to be said for a Joint Session if you have equality of opportunity between the two Parties in this House. But there was not that equality of opportunity between the two Parties in your Lordships' House. Then followed the last and I think the most unfortunate of all the proposals, that of a Referendum and the appendage of a Joint Committee to decide when matters were of such gravity that it should invoke this new fangled instrument unheard of in the previous history of this country. My Lords, I am not going to discuss the Referendum. I will confine
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0436"/>
<col>863</col>
myself to one single sentence about it. If that system were introduced into our Constitution as a means by which this House could appeal against the other House, it would be destructive of representative government, and it would, in my opinion, be a dangerous and revolutionary innovation. Those are the two policies confronting each other.<lb/>
Now let me see what has been said by the country. Allow me to state my own view. In January of 1910 when we were driven to a General Election&#x2014;that election at least was not encompassed by any strategy on our part but imposed upon us by a hostile vote in this House&#x2014;this policy had been for three years before the country, ever since the Resolutions passed by the House of Commons in January, 1907, and it was substantially the same as the Parliament Bill which is now before Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02299"><member>EARL CADOGAN</member><membercontribution>: But you lost 110 seats, I think, in obtaining that majority.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02300"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: Is a Liberal Government not entitled to govern with a majority of 125? I think it is rather an unfair thing to take an opportunity when we were somewhat at a disadvantage to do a thing which had never been done before, to stop Supplies in order to force an election in the interests of Tariff Reform. But I pass by that. The fact is that we had a large majority as majorities go. That policy of ours was adopted and approved of in January, 1910. It was then put forward in the form of Resolutions carried in the House, of Commons in the Spring of 1910. That was followed by a Bill being presented to Parliament which was an echo of the Resolutions. That Bill was passed by the House of Commons. We then came to this situation. Your Lordships' proposals had not been even then developed. We never heard of the Referendum until the end of last November. Did it not look as if this subject was being trifled with, as if the alternative proposals had not been put forward in their fullness, and that the time and patience of Parliament and the country was being exhausted and we should be driven into a backwater with the consequence that we should be prevented from carrying out the very measure which was before Parliament in January, 1910?<lb/>
<col>864</col>
Then came the General Election of December, 1910. I should like very much to know whether that election meant anything at all. I am told that it certainly did not mean Home Rule. In the course of this debate we have been told that it certainly did not mean an endorsement of the Government policy which had been discussed almost <i>ad nauseam</i> in the country and in Parliament. Did it mean anything at all? I respectfully submit to your Lordships that the election of December, 1910, meant a second public approbation by the electors of the methods by which we propose to settle this important Constitutional question. That being the case, we are reproached for having given advice to the Crown in November of 1910. My Lords, we knew that this was a serious, matter. We had had an election only eleven months before. We risked another election and gave your Lordships and the Party in the country who agreed with you the opportunity of retrieving the disaster of January. But we also were bound to foresee the possibility that your Lordships might not be willing to give way to the decision of the General Election of December. Let me remind you how often it has been said here within the last two or three years, and by no one more explicitly or more clearly than by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, that this House never seeks to stand against the opinion of the country when it is clearly expressed. I will not reason with your Lordships, but it will take a great deal to convince plain men, after the short narrative I have given you, that the opinion of the country was not clearly declared with regard to the Parliament Bill. That being the case, we tendered the advice which we did to His Majesty in November. We are now confronted with the danger which we then apprehended, the apprehension of which led us to tender to His Majesty the advice to which I have referred.<lb/>
Now that it has come, what do you propose we should do? Do you propose that we should dissolve? No one proposes that. There is a House of Commons returned upon this subject with strong views in support of the Government and equally convinced of the necessity of this step, and there can be no Dissolution. Resign when we are supported by a Parliament which you cannot dissolve! What is to be done? Is it not obvious that
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0437"/>
<col>865</col>
your Lordships have brought the deadlock upon yourselves? What are we to do? We cannot resign. We should be wrong to do it. We have got the House of Commons at our back and we cannot dissolve. You are not prepared to form a Government which would have support. The noble Marquess speaks for himself alone. His Party has never asked for a Dissolution, and it would be an outrage to go to the country a third time in twenty months upon the same subject.<lb/>
Then it comes to this, that the only resort left to us in your opinion is to submit to the noble Marquess's Amendments. Let us see what those Amendments are. The only one which I will dwell upon now is the Amendment incorporating the Referendum&#x2014;the Referendum which is the very point and sting of the policy which was defeated in the country but which is supported by your Lordships. We are therefore expected, after having gone through the fire and the furnace and having succeeded in our appeals to the country, actually to accept into our Bill the very thing which you wanted the country to accept but which they rejected, and which would be destructive of our policy. I submit that you have indeed, as the noble Earl said, to look at the facts. In the first place you have to make up your minds on this, Is this House to be free from all sorts of control, different in that respect from any other part of the Constitution? If you answer that in the negative, as I feel you must, tell me what is the alternative to the course which we now propose to pursue.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02301"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble and learned Earl devoted a considerable part of his eloquent speech to a denunciation of that which he describes as the alternative policy of noble Lords who sit on this side of the House. I have never been able to understand why the noble Earl judges our alternative policy so severely. Let me take one by one the limbs of which that policy is composed. We have suggested that there should be a reconstitution of this House. That is common ground to us and to the noble and learned Earl. Our scheme is one which the noble Viscount who leads the House describes as a helpful scheme. It is a scheme, therefore, which clearly you cannot rule out of Court altogether as being a negligible contribution to this
<col>866</col>
great controversy. And we made it clear thoughout the discussion that we are ready to meet noble Lords opposite upon all points of detail. The noble and learned Earl says that under our scheme there would have been a permanent Unionist majority in this House. Well, opinions differ as to the way in which our scheme would work, but I am quite ready to say that if you could show that our scheme would work unfairly as between the two Parties we are ready to consider with you whether it could not be made to work more fairly. Then there was the proposal for Joint Sittings, and other means of extricating the two Houses when they found themselves involved in a persistent difference. Joint Sittings have been blessed in principle by noble Lords opposite. Joint Sittings and Conferences and all those palliatives find favour with noble Lords opposite. Why, then, is our alternative policy to be so severely denounced?<lb/>
And finally we come back to the Referendum. I have ventured once or twice to cross swords, if I may say so without presumption, with the noble and learned Earl upon this question of the Referendum. The noble and learned Earl does not desire to see the Referendum made part of the standing machinery of the Constitution, but he is quite ready, he told us the other day, to see the Referendum adopted on particular occasions and to meet a particular difficulty. Let me make a suggestion to the noble and learned Earl. Here is a matter about which there is a persistent and somewhat acute difference between the two Houses. Will he not send this Bill and our Bill to the country and let the country decide between them? [A noble Lord: "We have done it."] The noble and learned Earl, as I expected, shakes his head. I venture to say that whatever be the merits or demerits of our alternative policy it is one for which there is a good deal to be said, and in our view it is a much saner policy than the policy of His Majesty's Government, which desires to give absolute control over all the Estates of the Realm to the House of Commons, or rather to the Minister who happens to control the House of Commons at the moment.<lb/>
Before I go further, I want to say one word, and one word only, with regard to the speech delivered by my noble friend, Lord Selborne. I was unfortunately called
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0438"/>
<col>867</col>
away from the House while my noble friend was speaking, and only heard a few of the concluding sentences of his speech, but I gather that he expressed himself with some warmth as to the conduct of those who, being determined to support this Motion of Censure, and who therefore take the strongest possible exception to the Government Bill, were yet prepared at a future stage to abstain from voting against it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02302"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: No. I never said a single word about that. I only spoke of those who were prepared to vote with the Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02303"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am glad to hear that. I only heard the last words of the speech. At any rate I suggest to my noble friends that whatever is to be said on that subject can be said more properly to-morrow evening and that to-night it is better to confine ourselves to the Motion of my noble friend Lord Curzon, and I assure my noble friend that though we do not see exactly eye to eye with him in this matter we do not yield at all to him in our disapprobation of the conduct of His Majesty's Government, and that far from having it in our mind to relent in any way in our opposition to that policy, we are determined in the long struggle that lies before us to offer to that policy an opposition every whit as convinced and as courageous as that which will be offered by him and his friends.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, what is the charge we desire to make against His Majesty's Government this evening? We charge the Government of the day, holding as they do immense powers&#x2014;powers which tend to increase with every year that goes by owing to the concentration of power in the Government of the day and the diminution of the opportunities given to independent members&#x2014;with having used those powers, and particularly the special power of giving advice to the Sovereign, in a manner detrimental to the interests of the public and of the State; and we charge them with having done so in such a manner that when the Parliament Bill comes back to us as it will to-morrow we shall have the Bill before us, not in ordinary circumstances and with the prospect of a useful interchange of ideas between the two Houses on the disputed points of the Bill, but in circumstances which deprive us of
<col>868</col>
all opportunity of moulding the form of the Bill and which oblige us to discuss it with the certainty that we must in the end be overcome by coercion. It is upon this question that we shall vote to-night. We hold strongly that the conduct of His Majesty's Government has brought about a gross violation of the Constitution of this country, a very grievous wrong to the House of which we are members, a great injustice to the people of this country, and last, but not least, that, it has been the means of bringing about a most regrettable introduction of the august personality of the Sovereign into the arena of Party politics.<lb/>
I will say a very few words as to the use of the Royal Prerogative for the purpose of creating Peers. The Secretary of State for War seemed to think that the matter was a perfectly simple one. The noble Viscount said that the Constitution recognises the Royal Prerogative as a remedy, and that, the remedy in this case was a perfectly proper and natural one. I think that was the gist of his statement. Now I am certainly not going to call in question the bare right of the Sovereign to create Peers, The Sovereign, I suppose it will be admitted by every one, can create as many Peers as he pleases as I he reward of signal virtue and distinguished merit. I think that is a formula with which the noble Lord is familiar. But what is the true place of this right of creating Peers in the Constitution? Surely that right is the corrective of the equally Constitutional and equally unlimited right of this House to obstruct all legislation to which it takes exception and, even if it thought fit to do so, to stop Supplies. You may have the unconstitutional exercise of a Constitutional right on the part of this House. You may have it on the part of the Ministers who advise the Sovereign. But if there is one thing to my mind clearer than anything else it is this, that the Royal Prerogative should not be exercised except as a last resort and when all other expedients have been exhausted. That was indeed admitted by the noble Marquess, whom we were so glad to see taking his accustomed place on the opposite Bench. Even when the Prerogative has been thus invoked or when its invocation has been contemplated, the idea has always been approached with reluctance, I would almost say with some degree of abhorrence. And surely there is an obvious reason why this mode of proceeding cannot be regarded
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0439"/>
<col>869</col>
as a remedy to be applied in anything like ordinary circumstances. Is it possible, is it conceivable that any right should form part of the standing machinery of the Constitution unless it is a right that could be used not by one side alone, but with equal fairness and with equal convenience by the other side? Apply that to the Prerogative of creating Peers. Supposing the great bulk of your Lordships' House were going to follow my noble and learned friend into the Lobby to-morrow, and you were prepared to create 400 or 500 Peers or perhaps 600, if you were to allow for that wastage which seems so inevitable after noble Lords have taken their seats in this House, do you suppose that such a creation could be followed within any period of time which we can contemplate by a similar creation on this side, and that then there should be a third creation and perhaps a fourth creation? That is unthinkable and absurd, and therefore I contend that that does show how absurd it is to treat this power as being a part of the normal machinery of our Constitution.<lb/>
It is a case which really seems to me to be one to which, we can well apply a doctrine which I remember was laid down by the noble and learned Earl when your Lordships insisted on reserving the Finance Bill of 1909 for the judgment of the people. We maintained that we had a perfect legal right so to deal with that Bill. The noble and learned Earl said he did not question the legal right, but he said there were a great many things that were legal but were not Constitutional. I say exactly the same considerations apply to the course which His Majesty's Ministers are about to adopt on the present occasion. And surely if there was illegality or unconstitutionality in either case the illegality is very much greater in the case of the creation of Peers than in the case of the action which your Lordships' House adopted in 1909. You are invoking the Royal Prerogative in order to cheat the people of an opportunity of deciding whether they want Home Rule and other important measures. We, on the contrary, did what the noble and learned Earl considered unconstitutional, but we did it for the purpose of giving the people an opportunity of saying whether they wanted the Finance Bill of 1909 or not, so that all the arguments are, I venture to think, on our side.<lb/>
<col>870</col>
I will not go into what has already been said on the subject of precedents. I believe it would not be incorrect to say that there are no precedents in point. I notice that noble Lords opposite cling with touching affection to the precedent of 1832 in spite of the complete exposition which my noble friend made of the difference between the circumstances of that time and of the present day. Here again there is a fundamental difference which it is very easy to put one's finger upon. In 1832 the Government had it in contemplation to create Peers to ensure the passing of a great popular measure which was earnestly desired by the people of this country, and for which there was a universal demand in every large city throughout the United Kingdom. You, on the contrary, are contemplating the creation of Peers, not for the purpose of passing a popular measure, but for the purpose of preventing us putting into your Bill Amendments the sole effect of which will be to give the people an opportunity of passing judgment upon your measures when they happen to touch grave questions of public policy which have not already been adequately submitted to the judgment of the country.<lb/>
But, my Lords, why is it necessary to cite precedents or authorities. Surely, on the face of it, the course which you have advised His Majesty to take is a course involving some thing which can only be described as an outrage on the Constitution of the country. I do not care whether you are going to ennoble 5 or 500 Peers; the point is that you are going to raise to the Peerage a number of gentlemen whose names cannot possibly have been before His Majesty when you first applied to him for this power. You are going to raise to this House a number of Peers, not in order to promote the efficiency of this House, which you yourselves already complain of because it is too large; you are not going to promote them because they have done anything to deserve promotion; you are going to promote them for one purpose and one only&#x2014;to destroy the balance of the Constitution in order that you may, while the Constitutional machine is out of gear, pass measures which we believe are distasteful to very nearly one-half of the electorate of this country. I said a moment ago that these gentlemen for whom you are providing seats in this House will have done nothing special to deserve
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0440"/>
<col>871</col>
that honour. I say more. I say that they will Lave done a great deal to show that they ore wholly undeserving of that honour, for every one of those gentlemen before he comes to the Table and signs the roll of Peers will have forfeited his independence. Not one of them will come in free and capable of giving a perfectly free and independent vote either upon the Parliament Bill or upon those other measures which we all know are to be the by-products of the Parliament Bill.<lb/>
What are the extenuating circumstances? What is it that the noble and learned Earl urged upon us just now when he asked us what else His Majesty's Government were to do? The words he used were that His Majesty's Government were driven to take this step. I beg to suggest that the Government are by no means driven to extremities in this matter. I recall the words of the noble Marquess, Lord Crewe, in a speech which he delivered at Winchester in April of last year. Speaking of the use of the Royal Prerogative he said&#x2014;
<quote>"Obviously this is a power which only ought to be used in the last resort, and not until all other means have been exhausted."</quote>
And in the same way the Prime Minister said the Government would take this course only in the event of the Lords declining to consider the policy of His Majesty's Government. Is it true that we have declined to consider your policy? What have we been doing during the last few weeks? What have we been doing but considering with the utmost attention and with the utmost desire to come to terms the proposals of His Majesty's Government? You tell us this House is unfairly composed. We are ready to reconstitute it. You tell us that deadlocks have to be avoided. We are ready to find the means. You tell us that in the meantime it is necessary to do something in order to prevent this House encroaching on the privileges of the House of Commons or unduly exercising what I think is most unfortunately described as its power of vetoing legislation. We have passed your Bill and sent it back to the other House in a shape which makes it impossible for your Lordships to do <i>mero motu</i> either of the things which you are so anxious we ought not to do. Under the Bill with the Amendments it will not rest with the House of Lords to decide whether they will or will not deal with a Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<col>872</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02304"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: Surely in the noble Marquess's Amendment the procedure in regard to the Home Rule Bill, for example, is reserved and taken away from the operation of this Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02305"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I was at the moment speaking of the question of the interference of this House in matters of finance; but when you come to other matters, such as Home Rule, the noble Viscount does not, I think, realise that it could not rest with your Lordships to say that the Bill was to go to a Referendum.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02306"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: Am I completely deceived? I thought that the noble Marquess's Amendment said in subsection (<i>b</i>) that Home Rule, so to call it, is to be reserved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02307"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Yes, Home Rule is, of course, reserved for the Referendum, but in the case of the other category of Bills the Referendum conies in only in the event of the Committee which we propose to set up deciding that a Bill should be dealt with in that manner. We have insisted upon these safeguards for this reason. You propose to do away with the power of reserving legislation for the judgment of the people which this House has hitherto exercised, and our contention is that if that power is taken away you must give us some safeguard to take its place. Unless you do you will place the country absolutely and entirely at the mercy of a chance majority in the House of Commons, and that is a risk which we are not prepared to run.<lb/>
One thing, however, has emerged clearly from these discussions. It is that in the present case the Royal Prerogative has been invoked, not, as Lord Crewe suggested it should be invoked, in the last resort, not when all other means have been exhausted, but long in advance and in cold blood. The evidence on that point is, I venture to think, conclusive. Lord Crewe, in the speech which he delivered on April 5, 1910, said this to his audience&#x2014;
<quote>"To my mind it is altogether improper even to consider such a contingency" [the invocation of the Prerogative] "until the occasion has actually arisen."</quote>
I venture to suggest to your Lordships that, properly speaking, the occasion has not arisen even yet. The occasion would
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0441"/>
<col>873</col>
not arise until there was a difference between the two Houses as to the Amendments to be put into the Bill and until it was shown that all negotiations failed and that there was no prospect of arriving at an understanding. But at any rate the occasion could not possibly have arisen until the Committee stage of the Bill, when the Amendments were put into it. What do we find, admitted and proved in black and white? That eight months before that His Majesty's Ministers went to the Sovereign and demanded from him this hypothetical undertaking, as Lord Crewe called it, which we are discussing this evening.<lb/>
Now let me remind the House of what the undertaking was. In the document which has been so often quoted these words occur&#x2014;
<quote>"His Majesty's Ministers cannot take the responsibility of advising a Dissolution unless they may understand that, in the event of the policy of the Government being approved by an adequate majority in the new House of Commons, His Majesty will be ready to exercise his Constitutional powers which may involve the Prerogative of treating Peers, if needed, to secure that effect shall be given to the decision of the country."</quote>
It was admittedly upon that understanding between His Majesty and His Majesty's Ministers that the Dissolution was granted. I want to call your attention to the extremely dangerous pledge which was extracted from His Majesty. Lord Crewe objected this evening, and I think rightly, to the use of the word guarantees in this connection. The word "guarantee" would be inappropriate because it conveys the impression of an extremely concrete and definite undertaking; that in a particular event a particular consequence will follow. That was not the promise obtained from His Majesty. What was obtained front him was a hypothetical undertaking, to use Lord Crewe's expression. That was an undertaking that was so contrived that it would cover anything which His Majesty's Ministers might afterwards read into the verdict of the electorate at the General Election. The real undertaking was that in whatever manner the decision of the country might be interpreted by His Majesty's Ministers the Royal Prerogative should be made use of to give effect to the decision so interpreted. The question has been asked, I do not know whether it will be answered, whether at the time it was explained to the Sovereign that o this ambiguity was to be found in the formula recommended by His Majesty's Ministers
<col>874</col>
and whether His Majesty realised that he was giving an engagement to make good the decision of the electors whatever interpretation might be put by his Ministers upon that decision. The fact is that the specific pledge which was given last month by His Majesty cannot be dissociated from the general pledge which was given by His Majesty eight months earlier. The two are absolutely interdependent. There is in the first place the hypothetical undertaking given in the month of November followed by the specific undertaking given last month.<lb/>
The Prime Minister said last night that it was a great mistake to suppose that the Government had secured the Royal approval of what he called "any cast-iron scheme of legislation to be rammed through Parliament." That is quite true. It was not a cast-iron scheme. It was something very much more dangerous. It was a <i>carte blanche</i> scheme, and the blank cheque, as my noble friend put it so well, had to be filled up by His Majesty in accordance with the directions of his advisers. Let me add this one other observation. If I am wrong in believing that a really improper and dangerous undertaking was obtained by His Majesty's Ministers as long ago as November last, why was it necessary to go to His Majesty at all at that time? His Majesty is the son of a Sovereign who for ten years was, above all things, a Constitutional ruler. He is the grandson of a great Queen who during her memorable and glorious reign never departed a hair's breadth from Constitutional propriety. Was it likely, then, that the present King would show himself otherwise than amenable to the advice of his Ministers, if they deferred giving that advice until the occasion arose?<lb/>
Why was it, then, they went months beforehand to obtain this hypothetical undertaking from His Majesty, except for the purpose of depriving him when the time came of that full discretion which would otherwise have been his? When we come to consider how that earlier undertaking has been interpreted by His Majesty's Ministers, I ask this question&#x2014; "Are they going to tell us seriously that the decision of the electors at the last General Election was to the effect that they did not desire to be consulted as to great and important measures which had not yet been referred to them? Are we to
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0442"/>
<col>875</col>
understand that it is your contention that at the last election the electors of this country told you that, although they had twice had the question of Home Rule referred to them and twice decided against it, they desired when Home Rule came up on the third occasion that they should not be given any opportunity of saying a third time what they thought upon the subject? That, nevertheless, was the advice which in the Constitutional exercise of the power of advising the Crown His Majesty's Ministers did not scruple to give to the Sovereign at the commencement of his reign, and truly it seems to me that this</membercontribution></p>

<title>PARLIAMENT BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02339">Order of the Day for the consideration of the Commons Reasons for disagreeing to several of the Lords Amendments, read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02340"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I move that the said Reasons be now considered. I should have thought for my part that it would have been better to defer any general observations on the Parliament Bill and on the Amendments until we came to the consideration one by one of those Amendments and of the changes that have been made in them by the decision of the House of Commons. It is by considering each Amendment in detail that we are brought to close quarters on the matters that unhappily divide us; but I believe that that is not the view which finds favour with the majority of the House. That view, I understand, is that we had better first discuss the question whether we do or do not now discuss the Commons' Reasons for dissenting from the Amendments made by your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I do not propose to enter into any general observations. I will only point out that there are, so far as I can make out, seven points upon which the Commons' decision affects the Amendments of your Lordships' House. Of those seven points, on three the Commons agree with this House. They agree with the two Amendments&#x2014;it is true they are not of the first order of importance&#x2014;moved by Lord Camperdown; that is to say, first, that Provisional Order Bills and Private Bills do not come within
<col>884</col>
the scope of the Parliament Bill, and, second, that the enacting words shall not be the ordinary enacting words that His Majesty has enacted, "with the consent of the Lords and Commons," but that they shall be words enacting truly and accurately the confirmation of His Majesty's will and authority. Then there is a third Amendment which was brought before you by Lord Avebury&#x2014;that is to say, that any proposal for altering the term of duration of Parliament should be excepted from these proposals in the Parliament Bill. Those, then, are points on which there is no room for discussion. Therefore there are four others, two of which, in my humble but undoubtedly partial opinion, are not of vital consequence. The first concerns the constitution of the authority which is to decide what is and what is not a Money Bill. Upon that point my colleagues in the House of Commons, with the assent of both sides in the House, have come to a proposal which will be brought before your Lordships in its turn.<lb/>
The second outstanding and controversial point is the point we were made familiar with on the Amendment of my noble friend Lord Cromer, which is to decide when the general purpose of a Bill is financial and when it is partly financial and partly political or social. On that I shall hope to show your Lordships that the controversy is not very acute. Then there is the only Amendment with which, as I believe, the majority of the House is concerned, I mean the Amendment known as the Amendment of the noble Marquess opposite. That Amendment, as I ventured to say when the noble Marquess moved it in Committee, opposes an insuperable barricade to an agreement between the Government and the majority of this House. Therefore I submit that it would have been better to have gone through the Amendments on which there is a good deal of accord and then have conic to the noble Marquess's Amendment, which will raise those great issues on which unfortunately so far there has been no agreement. All I have to do now is to move that the House do now consider the reasons given by the Commons for their assent to or dissent from your Lordships' Amendments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02341"><i>Moved</i>, That the said Reasons be now considered.&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Morley.</i>)</p>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0447"/>
<col>885</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02342"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount suggested that it might be more convenient to your Lordships if we took our discussion upon the different Amendments <i>seriatim.</i> I venture to suggest, on the contrary, that there are reasons which make it desirable that before we approach that detailed discussion we should consider the more general aspects of the situation which confronts us. That situation is in a sense a somewhat unexpected one, for until a very few days ago most of us expected, and I think not without reason, that it was not the intention of His Majesty's Government to part with this Bill in the House of Commons until they had either received some kind of assurance that it would be allowed to go through without the more important Amendments made by this House, or, failing that, until a number of Peers had been created sufficient to ensure its passage into law.<lb/>
But the situation is now very different. Ostensibly we are invited to examine the reasons of the House of Commons for differing from our proposals, and ostensibly it is open to us to reconsider our own proposals, to suggest further Amendments, and to embark upon one of those prolonged exchanges of opinion between the two Houses which sometimes end in a conference between the two Chambers. Well, my Lords, that is the ostensible position, but it is not the real position. The real position is this. Our Amendments come back to us with three or four small concessions which have been specified by the noble Viscount. He mentioned the two Amendments which were moved by my noble friend, Lord Camperdown, both very useful Amendments, but, as the noble Viscount evidently is aware, dealing with points of secondary or third-rate importance. The second of these Amendments has, indeed, the effect of saving the Government from perpetrating what I might almost call a legislative absurdity. Then there is the Amendment of my noble friend Lord Avebury, which is no doubt a valuable Amendment, and the fourth Amendment is that which associates with the Speaker two Members of the House of Commons for the purpose of forming a kind of tribunal to which is to be entrusted the duty of deciding whether a Bill is a Money Bill in the stricter sense of the word or a Bill which is partly financial and partly dealing with other subjects. The counter pro-
<col>886</col>
posal of the Government on this point seems to us a most futile and negligible one. In debate in this House we demonstrated the impropriety of using the Speaker of the House of Commons&#x2014;a high House of Commons official&#x2014;as the arbitral tribunal to decide disputes between the two Houses, and our point is not in the least met by associating with the Speaker two other Members of the House of Commons. It is a tribunal to decide, as I said just now, disputes between the two Houses, and it is composed entirely of Members of one House.</membercontribution></p>

What is the essence of the situation? It is surely this. We are invited to deal with the other Amendments, the Amendments which we really care about, and which we showed in the course of our discussions here that we did attach essential importance to&#x2014;we are invited to deal with those Amendments under circumstances which make it absolutely clear that there is not the slightest prospect of our views with regard to them obtaining one iota of further consideration at the hands of the Government. Not only do we know that they will not be considered, but we know beyond dispute that if we persist in our proposals we are to be voted down by a body of newly-created Peers, created by a use of the Royal Prerogative which we ventured to stigmatise last night as highly improper and unconstitutional.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0448"/>
<col>887</col>
What is the duty of your Lordships' House in those circumstances, what road remains open to us? There is clearly from our point of view no room for compromise. You have offered us nothing which can form the basis of a transaction between those who think with you and those who think with us. The idea of an appeal to the people is scouted. In these circumstances it seems to me obvious that this House is no longer in a position to offer effectual resistance to the policy of His Majesty's Government, and in these circumstances some of us, myself amongst the number, are convinced that further insistence on our Amendments would be not only unprofitable, but detrimental to the public interest. Those who so think hold that it will be wiser to abstain from further intervention in these discussions, that we should assume no responsibility for the Bill, and that we should part with it making it clear that whenever the opportunity presents itself to us we shall spare no effort to redress the balance of the Constitution which you have so gravely disturbed.<lb/>
I am well aware that the attitude that I have ventured to recommend is one that lays itself open to abundant criticism. We are ready for that criticism and we are not afraid of it. We are asked why did we think it necessary to insert Amendments in this Bill if we did not intend to stand by them. There is a complete answer to that suggestion. It was our duty whatever might happen to the Bill in another place to insert in it in this House whatever Amendments we thought proper, and to send those Amendments down to the House of Commons. I ask your Lordships to remember that had we not done this the damning fact would not have been revealed that your real objection to our policy is that you are going to create Peers in order to prevent us from securing an appeal to the people on grave matters as to which they have not yet been adequately consulted. That fact would never have been elicited had your Lordships not insisted on putting these Amendments into the Bill.<lb/>
Another consideration that should be borne in mind is that although our Amendments improved the Bill, they did not make it a good Bill. It is not as if we had the choice between a good and a bad Bill; we have to choose between a bad Bill
<col>888</col>
and a Bill rendered less bad by our Amendments. There is another observation that has been not unfrequently made. We are asked why it was that whereas in 1909 we made a stiff fight over the Finance Bill of that year we are not ready to make a stiff fight now. MY answer is that in 1909 we fought to the end because we knew that we had a chance of success. Although our success fell short of our hopes and expectations, we succeeded at any rate to this extent, that we were able to put the Finance Bill before the country, with the result that a great part of the colossal majority of the Government of the day was wiped out of existence. But in this case we are unable to force an election. We know, or at least I know, that we have no means of preventing this Bill from finding a place on the Statute Book. I have seen somewhere or other connected, I think with the name of my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke the suggestion that the introduction of the new Peers should be resisted by main force. I think my noble friend added that he himself would see to it that it only came about in that way. My noble friend will think me a very pusillanimous person, but I confess that I prefer Parliamentary methods; and in a case of this kind I doubt whether your Lordships would achieve much or add greatly to the credit and reputation of this House if you were to resort to unparliamentary methods such as often repeated adjournments and various technical modes of opposing the accomplishment of the policy of His Majesty's Government. I am convinced that such attempts would be unsuccessful and would probably be much misunderstood in the country.<lb/>
I know that many of your Lordships think that other courses are open to us. What is the situation as it presents itself to the minds of many of those whose opinion I greatly respect? They know and we know that His Majesty's Government are extremely reluctant to create Peers. That has been freely admitted by Lord Crewe last night. There are all the difficulties of the selection&#x2014;formidable I should think&#x2014;of the selection of 500 gentlemen whose fidelity is to remain beyond suspicion for eighteen months or two years. Nor can I bring myself to believe that any members of His Majesty's Government desire that the name of the Government should be handed down to posterity in connection with so violent an outrage upon the Constitution. The matter was well summed up by
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0449"/>
<col>889</col>
Lord Crewe last night when he said that the whole of this business was odious to him. If it was odious to the noble Marquess may we not rest assured that it was also odious to the Sovereign? In every line of the account given last night by Lord Crewe of the communications which had passed between Ministers and His Majesty&#x2014;in every line of that, I must say, pathetic story&#x2014;it appeared clear that the course recommended was one that His Majesty was most reluctant to adopt and one which he would only adopt if no other course was left open to him by his advisers.<lb/>
Now it is true that we can force His Majesty's Government to take that course so odious to them. We can force that course on the Sovereign; we can force the Government to do something which is hateful to them, something which is injurious to the reputation of this House, something which I venture to say will bring discredit on this country. But are we to force these things upon the King and his Ministers merely from a feeling of petulance or vindictiveness? I say to do so from such motives would be not only unpatriotic but contemptible in the highest degree. I do not, however, for a moment suggest that any of those who differ from us are inspired by motives of that kind. Their motives, I know, are of a different order. In their view nothing short of the creation of Peers will clear this House of a suspicion that we are accomplices in the policy of His Majesty's Government. In their view, and I think rightly, a. revolution is upon us, and they believe that nothing would bring home to the people of this country the fact that it is a revolution unless an outward and visible sign is given by the appearance of newly-created Peers in this House. I confess I have not so poor an opinion of the intelligence of my own countrymen as to believe that this is quite the case, and I must say that it affords me some relief to find that so large a number of noble Lords who sit on this side of the House, and who, after all, are not men who lead isolated lives, but who live and move amongst their neighbours in different parts of this country, are of the opinion that I hold myself. May I add this observation with all deference to my noble and learned friend behind me? I believe that if one-half of the eloquence which he and his friends have been exhibiting lately for the purpose of proving to those who listen that they are being betrayed by us
<col>890</col>
had been directed to the task of explaining the true situation to the public they would have had no difficulty whatever in satisfying the people of this country that we were as effectually coerced by the Prime Minister's letter and by the statements made in this House by Lord Crewe last night as if the whole four or five hundred Peers had come down to this House and voted us down.<lb/>
But let me assume, for the sake of argument, that my noble friends who hold these views are right, and that it is necessary or that it is desirable that conviction should be carried to the minds of the people by means of an actual creation of Peers. I ask your Lordships to consider what will be the price that we shall have to pay for the piece of education which it is proposed to give to the people of this country. Why is it that we object to this proposal for the creation of Peers? Let me put on one side the suggestion which I know is sometimes made, to the effect that the present Members of this House would resent on behalf of the order to which we belong the intrusion of a large body of newcomers because we are, as it were, an aristocratic and therefore an exclusive Assembly. I believe, if I may say so, that this is pure nonsense and that it does not reflect the opinion of any reasonable Member of this House. This House has long ceased to be an Assembly composed exclusively of aristocratic and territorial members. Since the year 1830 one Government after another has never desisted from pumping new Peers into this House, and they are not all the descendants of men who came over with the Conqueror, nor are all their names to be found in the Doomsday Book; and I believe I am only expressing a feeling shared by the large majority of the Members of this House when I say that most of us would gladly welcome an accession of new Members representing new interests, professions not at present represented, men who would give to this House and to our debates a certain novelty and freshness, in which perhaps those debates are at present lacking. But we have, at any rate, one amply sufficient answer to the charge that our opposition proceeds from a feeling of mere exclusiveness. This House passed only this year, by a large majority&#x2014;I think it was carried unanimously&#x2014;a Bill the effect of which would have been to bring into existence a reconstituted House, of which only one-third
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0450"/>
<col>891</col>
was to be chosen by the present House of Lords. I do not think you could have much stronger evidence that this House is not penetrated by those exclusive feelings that are sometimes imputed to us.<lb/>
Assuming, however, that the creation of a number of new Peers would have a certain educative effect upon the people of the country, I ask your Lordships to consider what is the price which we should have to pay for taking that step. In the first place, while we remain in Opposition we should be liable to find that the whole of those extremely exiguous safeguards which are left to us by the Parliament Bill might disappear altogether. I have never rated the value of those safeguards too highly, but I do say they are worth something, and to my mind it might make the whole difference to us that we should have a full period of two years in which to discuss and to examine a proposal which we considered a dangerous one&#x2014;two years which we could turn to account by enlightening public opinion with regard to the measure in dispute. I ask your Lordships to consider the difference between the fate of a Home Rule Bill, for example, under the Parliament Bill with this interval of two years and time fate of the same Bill supposing we found that in this House there was an overwhelming Liberal majority which could carry everything before it. But I am not content to assume for a moment that we are always going to remain in Opposition. I do not for a moment believe that the country is going to sit down patiently for au indefinite time under the despotism which is being established by noble Lords opposite; and when the time comes for the Party which now sits on this side of the House to cross over, we shall no doubt consider it our duty to address ourselves to the great task of Constitutional reform. We shall have to deal with the composition of the House of Lords, the relations of the two Houses, and the limitation of the Royal Prerogative. When that time comes I am free to confess that I think it would be a serious misfortune to us if we found ourselves confronted by an obstinate and, perhaps, obstructive Radical majority in this House.<lb/>
But while those reasons prevail with me, there is another reason to which, I think, I attach even more weight. I am haunted by my apprehension of the spectacle which will be presented not only to this country, but to the whole civilised
<col>892</col>
world and to the rest of the British Empire if the threat of His Majesty's Government is carried into effect. Can the noble Viscount tell us of any country in which any exhibition approaching to it has ever been seen? Some of us who have had an interest in foreign affairs know how much of the respect which our country commands abroad is due to the stability of our institutions and to the respect in which our Parliamentary system is held. What, I ask, will be thought of our Parliamentary system and of the stability of our institutions when 300, or 400, or 500 Peers&#x2014;I do not care which&#x2014;are created for the express purpose of voting down one of the two Chambers of the Legislature? We should have exclaimed and poured forth volumes of ridicule and contempt if such a thing had happened in the Republic of Venezuela under the Presidency of President Castro, and that is what we are asked to contemplate as likely to happen in this country and to this House.<lb/>
I shall perhaps he told that the spectacle will be every whit as degrading if the Peers are not actually made and if this House yields to the threat that Peers will be made. I shall be told that the infamy remains, although it will be kept out of sight. I shall be told that it is bad for political morality that these things should be hid away and that it is much better that the thing should be done and a salutary shock administered to public opinion. But I take leave to say that to my mind it makes an immense difference whether this out rage has been merely contemplated or whether it has been actually accomplished. The moral guilt of the criminals would no doubt be the same, but if it is not actually accomplished, then, at any rate, the British Government will not have added to our history a piece of what I can only call stupendous political corruption. If it is not accomplished 500 English gentlemen will not have taken their seats in this House upon conditions which I can only describe as humiliating and disgraceful. If it is not accomplished, this House, with all its historic traditions, will not have sustained the most outrageous affront which could be offered to it. And, finally, the Sovereign will not have been required to lend himself to a transaction which is already agitating the minds of all those who are devoted to the Monarchy and which will, beyond all question, disfigure the annals of the new reign. To my mind it is not inconsistent with the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0451"/>
<col>893</col>
honourable traditions of this House, not inconsistent with patriotism, not inconsistent with the self-respect which we owe to ourselves, that these considerations should be carefully weighed by your Lordships. With sonic of us, indeed, they weigh so heavily that we are ready to face all the misrepresentation, all the abuse, which has been levelled against us, and even&#x2014;what is worst of all&#x2014;the interruption of old political friendships rather than face the consequences which we apprehend; and we say that in our belief the country even now&#x2014;a great number of the people now and a much greater number as time goes by&#x2014;will recognise that our patriotism is as much above suspicion and our sincerity fully as transparent as that of those who differ from us.<lb/>
My Lords, I may be told that all this time I have been waving a mere bogey in the face of your Lordships' House, that I have been talking of an overwhelming creation of Peers, and that there is no question of an overwhelming creation of Peers. Some noble Lords seem to think that all that is contemplated is a pleasant little addition to the composition of this House&#x2014;a little reinforcement which will perhaps have the effect of enlivening our debates and promoting a greater abundance of repartee from the Benches on the other side. If, however, it be true, if it were ever true, that all we are threatened with is a small creation of Peers, I would ask this question, "To whom do you owe it that it is so?" When my noble and learned friend started on his crusade he made it his business to collect as large a number of recruits as he could gather to his standard. But supposing we had all followed his example, His Majesty's Government would have had at once to create the whole of their 400 or 500 Peers in order to outnumber us, and if the necessity of that large creation has in any way become less, surely there should be some gratitude to those who have been instrumental in bringing about that result.<lb/>
But I must ask, in passing, whether, if that really represents the feeling of my noble and learned friend, if he desires to have, let us say, fifty or sixty Peers, but strongly objects to having 500 or 600, it is not fair to point out that those who follow him are in the delightful position of getting all the glory while we save him from the risk of the calamity he does not wish to incur and obtain all the ridicule and vituperation. But there is a much more
<col>894</col>
serious aspect of the case. Are the noble Lords who hold these views satisfied that the only danger that we have to anticipate is a small creation of Peers? I should very much like to know upon what foundation that belief is grounded. One noble Member of this House is reported to have said the other day that he was quite ready to rise from the ditch with a little mud on his clothes, rather than have collars round our necks. I hope the noble Lord will be grateful to those who saved him front getting a great deal more mud and from perhaps breaking his bones into the bargain; but is he quite sure that he will get off with only a little mud? I believe nothing of the sort.<lb/>
It was said by the Home Secretary in the House of Commons two nights ago that the creation of Peers which His Majesty's Government have in view is a creation of 400 or 500. And last night a most remarkable statement was made by Lord Crewe. Lord Crewe warned us that when the creation of Peers took place no regard would be had by His Majesty's Government to the newspaper list of Peers, or to the division lists. He said they were not relevant to the question at all, and that His Majesty's Government would assume that all combinations had ceased and come to an end. I will tell the House how I interpret these words, and I would ask the noble Viscount to correct me if I am wrong. I understand that His Majesty has promised a creation of Peers sufficient to ensure the passing of this Bill in its House of Commons shape. There is no doubt about that. The number necessary for this purpose must necessarily be an indefinite number, and what I gather is that the pledge given to His Majesty's Government is a pledge which, beyond all question, covers the creation of any number of Peers which, as the result of the calculations made by the Government, or of their inability to make any calculations at all, His Majesty's Government may choose to demand in order to prevent a further miscarriage of the Bill. Is that the correct interpretation of the words of the noble Marquess?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02347"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member>: I am not at all averse to answering any plain question, but I believe the noble Marquess and your Lordships will feel that to ask a question of that kind across the Table of the House without any notification, upon so delicate and important a matter, is rather going I beyond Parliamentary practice.</p>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0452"/>
<col>895</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02348"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member>: I merely put to the noble Viscount what I believe to the ordinary reader is the obvious interpretation of the words used in this House last night by the noble Marquess. I am sure that I am not misleading your Lordships when I say that if this Bill is thrown out it will be a case, not of a small, but of a large creation of Peers. And, to use Lord Crewe's words&#x2014;</p>
<quote>"I venture to say that anybody who tells you a different story has either been misled himself as to the facts of the case or has a purpose to serve in making the statement."</quote>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02349">In these circumstances, some of us are disposed to consider that the wiser course for this House to adopt is to recognise that the Prime Minister's letter to Mr. Balfour and the speech made by Lord Crewe last night are conclusive on this point. We believe that, in the face of these facts, we shall be wise to desist from opposition which can only be futile, and that, when the moment comes for dividing on these Amendments, it will be better that we should withdraw from this House, leaving the modest battalion commanded by the noble Viscount in occupation of the field. We should, in this event, assume no responsibility whatever for the measure. We should desist from our opposition only because we are profoundly convinced that further resistance would be absolutely useless, and we should have the Bill passed over our heads every bit as effectually as if 300 or 400 Peers were to come down to this House to outvote us.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02350">My Lords, what is the alternative course? It is a course which implies divided counsels; Peers on this side of the House voting in groups and sections, one man going into a particular Lobby because another man has chosen to go into another Lobby; the public puzzled and distracted; the action of those who have abstained from voting misunderstood; because obviously, if courage and heroism are claimed by one Fide, by implication cowardice and want of courage are imputed to the other side. Finally, we shall have the invasion of new Peers&#x2014;and, after all, that is the pity of it&#x2014;we shall have the Parliament Bill without our Amendments all the same. I cannot hesitate between these two courses. If I believed that these proceedings were going to be the end of this Constitutional struggle, if I thought that nothing lay beyond the debate which will finish to-night or to-morrow, then I would join my noble and learned friend's standard and have one
<col>896</col>
good fight before the end came. But, my Lords, in our view this is not the end. This is the beginning of a struggle which may last for many years, and of which some of us who are here to-night may not see the end. It is a struggle which we shall pursue with unrelenting energy so long as life and health and spirit are given to us. We may be worsted in this encounter, but we are not going to be annihilated, and when our turn comes it will be our business to rebuild upon the ruins of the Constitution which you have wrecked a. new Constitution more appropriate to the spirit of the age in which we live. In that great task we shall want all our resources, all our fighting strength, and above all a united. Party It is because I hope that in this great struggle your Lordships' House will play an honourable and momentous part that I do not want to see it now weakened and discredited by such a use of the Royal Prerogative as that for which His Majesty's Government have now, in our opinion most improperly, obtained the consent of the Crown.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02351"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would not have intervened so early in this debate but for one or two observations which have fallen from my noble friend and which call at once for an explanation from me. My noble friend has spoken of a crusade which I have initiated. I can assure him upon my honour that I never spoke to one single person on the subject until a large number of Peers came to wait upon me, after a speech which I made in this House, and suggested that we should agree in regard to our action. So far from entering into a crusade against my noble friend or any of those who think with him, I had no idea that what I had said would have any effect or would meet with so enthusiastic an agreement on the part of such a large number of friends of my own. So much for the personal point.<lb/>
I have also to say, and I say it with great pleasure, that at none of the meetings which I have attended, and in no speech which I have made, have I ever spoken of my noble friend in words other than those of respect and affection. I rather protest, however, against some of the language which he has used. He has avoided a direct accusation against any of us, but what he has said is that if you claim courage exclusively to yourself you by implication suggest cowardice to the other
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0453"/>
<col>897</col>
side. That is a rather circuitous method of arriving at an accusation. I have heard a great deal about military metaphors, about dying in the last ditch, and many other phrases used apparently for the purpose of degrading and insulting those who take different views, but I have not been a party to it, nor have I heard it.<lb/>
I regret that my noble friend should think it right, in defence of himself and his own courage, which no one I am sure has ever disputed, to make an imputation on those whose simple view is that they do not agree with him on a matter of tactics. I do not believe there is any person in this House who has a greater opinion of my noble friend in respect of his honour and his ability than I have. But I must say that I felt aggrieved by language which seemed to me to point to the fact that I was in some way intriguing against him. ["No."] I know that this imputation has been made, and I confess that I read with astonishment in a vile journal, whose principal idea is to get an advertisement in some way or another, that it was part of a conspiracy against my noble friend and against the distinguished leader in the other House to obtain from them the leadership, forsooth! as if any human being had the smallest idea of any such thing, except the degraded journalist who thinks it proper to send slander forth. I lament the expression of my noble friend's views, and I think I have cleared myself in that matter.<lb/>
But a more important matter is that which we are supposed to be discussing at this moment&#x2014;namely, the question of the consideration of the Commons' Amendments. The proposition that this House should be overborne by the creation of a number of Peers has been described in language I will not attempt to imitate; but what strikes me is that there is one thing we must clear our minds upon. Is there any bargain that if the Parliament Bill is passed the Peers will not be created? I think we must deal in the open if we are to have this question discussed, and also with respect to the number. Is there any guarantee that the operation is not to be repeated next year? How have you got rid of the degrading condition of things which my noble friend has eloquently described by staying out of the House and allowing a Bill to be passed which has been denounced over and over again in language
<col>898</col>
which no one can exceed in violence? I say nothing about courage, about the necessity of something like principle as distinguished from tactics; but what is to happen? If you say that this Parliament Bill is simply a question of delay for a couple of years and of securities, then what is to happen? Is this bogey, as I will call it, of the Royal Prerogative to be brought out every time there is a difference of opinion between the two Houses? What are you doing now? You are making something like a transaction with the other side in politics to do that which you yourselves have denounced over and over again as an improper thing to do. If there is a bargain that no Peers are to be made I want to know whether that bargain goes any further. How long is the bargain, if there is one, to last? Is there any Royal Prerogative Suppression Bill to be brought forward after this measure? What is there left of power to this House without the Amendments of my noble friend? Every one knows that there is no power in it.<lb/>
My noble friend has spoken on the subject of tactics. For myself I think my task would have been more clear and not open to some of the observations which have been made if I had moved the rejection of the Third Reading of the Bill. Why I did not do it my noble friend knows perfectly well. I assumed, as I think every one had a right to assume, after the language and for the reasons my noble friend himself gave on the occasions when we were discussing the Bill, that he would stick to his Amendments. What was the meaning of asking a large number of Peers to attend in order to overrule the Government on the question of the Amendments that were made? Had I not the right to assume that these Amendments so moved in such language and upon such grounds would be adhered to when we came to the question of difference with the other House? Any one who heard any of the convincing speeches of the noble Marquess behind me could entertain no doubt that the person who held that view of the Bill would at all events, unless those Amendments were agreed to, refuse to pass the Bill. That idea has apparently passed away.<lb/>
I confess that I was a little surprised when I heard myself denounced, and those who have been acting with me, as if we were disloyal to our own side. ["No,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0454"/>
<col>899</col>
no."] I do not know, but some of the language used by the noble Marquess certainly points to something of that kind. I am glad, however, to hear it disclaimed; but the noble Marquess will allow me, I hope, to say that when he is dealing in that way with friends and colleagues I should have thought it to be a little more appropriate to take care that he was not so misunderstood.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02352"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I did not use a single word or make a suggestion of what my noble friend has said. I am incapable of harbouring any such thought regarding him, and I venture to prophesy that if he will look at my speech to-morrow he will find no sentence conveying that idea.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02353"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: I assume then that I was mistaken. Even if I had not the high opinion which I have of the noble Marquess, one would always accept of course an explanation made by one gentleman to another under a misapprehension. I leave that topic altogether.<lb/>
I wish to say something about the temptation which is offered to us to allow the Bill to pass. For my part I do not and will not draw any distinction between the responsibility of a person who votes for it and a person who abstains from voting. It seems to me that upon a question of principle, if I believed a thing to be wrong, I ought to do my best to prevent it. The temptation given to us is that we must allow the Bill to pass, and then, forsooth!agitate, until we get the country to take our view. Thus we are told that we shall be satisfied that we have saved this House from degradation. Have we? Is it saving this House from degradation when that which is admitted to be so degrading to it is yielded to as a threat? I ask those who yield to it as a threat&#x2014;are they very much better than those who strive to the best of their ability to resist that threat to the end? I cannot help thinking that that rather savours of the spirit of "Stand aside; I am holier than thou." I do not understand those who will walk out of the House and allow that to be done which they think wrong because they think they will gain a little time.<lb/>
I myself certainly will not yield to the threat. Let the Government take the responsibility of introducing 400 or 500 Peers&#x2014;I care not how many&#x2014;in the
<col>900</col>
circumstances that my noble friend has pointed out and then let him shield himself by saying "And you forced them to do it." I never heard such an extraordinary argument in my life. It is as if a highwayman came and said, "Give me your watch or I cut your throat," and if you did not give him your watch that you are the author of your own throat being cut. I deny that, because one may resist to the best of his ability what was believed to be a wrong, therefore he was responsible for the wrong being done. The contention is so absurd that every one would laugh in your face if you advanced it. I have no more to say on this part of the case. The abuse, the contempt, and the epithets heaped on those with whom I have been associated are greater than I have ever heard or read. I speak particularly of some of the organs of public opinion, forsooth! who profess to give guidance and who take the other side. I have nothing more to say, except that nothing in the world will induce me to vote for a Bill or to abstain from not voting against a Bill which I believe to be wrong and immoral and a scandalous example of legislation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02354"><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the whole House will, I am sure, rejoice for its own sake and for his at the vigour and eloquence which the noble and learned Earl always introduces into our debates, never more signally than on the present occasion. I feel myself at some disadvantage in endeavouring to call the attention of the House to what may seem to many of its members largely a question of form. The real issue submitted to the House is whether or not in the circumstances with which we are faced and which we are unable to control, it is or is not wise to insist upon the Amendments which this House has introduced into the Parliament Bill. Feeling is running high between not only the two great Parties but between two sections of one Party, and any man may not unnaturally be heard with impatience who attempts to attach some importance to the form in which the issue is presented. But, my Lords, I venture to claim that that form, for some of us at least, is a matter not pedantic and unreal, but going to the very reality of the situation.<lb/>
It is unreal at the present time to discuss either the Bill, however deplorable, or the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0455"/>
<col>901</col>
Amendments, however admirable, because we know perfectly well that the Bill must, and the Amendments cannot, become law. It is unreal at the present time to denounce the Government for the course of policy which has rendered this result inevitable. That is a matter upon which this House yesterday by an overwhelming majority recorded its emphatic opinion. The single issue before us is whether it is right in the interests of the King, the country, and the character of this House, to vote upon a Motion to insist upon the Amendments, which, if carried, would compel the King to exercise his Prerogative in the creation of Peers. We are free to consider that question upon its mere merits, and if any of us are convinced that to insist on these Amendments under existing circumstances would be a policy prejudicial to the interests alike of the King, of this House, and of the country, we are entitled to say that our attitude does not and must not be taken to involve any sort of approval either of the Parliament Bill or of the policy of the Government which has insured its passing into law.<lb/>
Speaking for myself&#x2014;and let me hasten to say that I am unable to speak in a representative capacity for any others&#x2014;I should probably attach greater importance than many noble Lords opposite to two facts. One is that the country has already expressed, however ill-informed it may have been, its approval of the Parliament Bill; the other is that no one has suggested that a new General Election would be likely substantially to alter its verdict. I find it more difficult than many noble Lords opposite to believe that it would be consistent with the Constitutional traditions of this House to insist, in these circumstances, upon its Amendments. Perhaps I should attach more value than many noble Lords to even the exiguous opportunities of delay and revision which are still entrusted to the House under this Bill, but I cannot in any way be held in what I say or in what I do to be supporting either the Bill or the policy which the Government have pursued. I regard both as the record of a great failure&#x2014;a failure to use a unique opportunity.<lb/>
It is common ground that it was felt on all sides that the time had come for a reform&#x2014;even a drastic reform&#x2014;of the constitution of this House and of its relations to the House of Commons. The
<col>902</col>
Unionist leaders gave signs, abundant and most sincere, of their willingness to assist in such a reform. The omens were favourable for a settlement which might have been permanent because it would have been based upon consent. The Government chose to scorn these omens. They preferred a settlement necessarily unstable because it could only be wrested by force. It is difficult&#x2014;I hope that noble Lords on this side will forgive me for saying it&#x2014;for a detached observer not to feel that they were under some compulsion, before they knew all the sacrifices which noble Lords opposite were ready to make, to adhere to a pre-determined course; and we cannot resist the inference that the compulsion under which they laboured was due, not to the necessity of carrying out a large reform of this House and its relations to the House of Commons, but to the exigencies of their own Party. There are many of us who had high hopes of the possibility of some reasonable settlement who can never fail to regret that His Majesty's Government chose to lose an opportunity which can never return. But, my Lords, though I hold this opinion, I hold another with equal strength&#x2014;that to insist now upon these Amendments and therefore to force the King to create a large number of Peers would be a policy inconsiderate to him and prejudicial to the interests alike of the character of this House and of the country. I am aware that this is an opinion shared by the majority of this House, and the grounds for it have been set before us with the usual lucidity and clearness of the noble Marquess, and it would be merely wasting the time of the House if I were at any length to attempt to repeat them.<lb/>
We have all listened with admiration to the speech of the noble and learned Earl who has just sat down. I am glad that, unlike some of his followers elsewhere, he has not made such appeals to the courage and consistency of those who differ from him as to imply that they were doubtful as to their position. On these matters I beg leave to say that each man's conscience is the only judge whose verdict he will accept. When we pass from the high ground of conscience, on which I shall venture to assume we are all in this House in the same position, to the field of argument, there are only one or two points in the speech of the noble and learned Earl to which I would
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0456"/>
<col>903</col>
like for one moment to refer. He asked what evidence there was that Peers would not be created even if the policy of the noble Marquess were to prevail. The only answer is that so far as has been divulged His Majesty has only given his consent to such a creation of Peers as will enable this Parliament Bill to pass. The noble and learned Earl spoke very eloquently about the Amendments which had been moved with great care by noble Lords in this House, and asked why they were to be so easily sacrificed. I suppose the answer is&#x2014;though it rests rather with noble Lords on the opposite side than with me to make it&#x2014;that the Amendments are not lost; they are, I presume, held in reserve. We are only at the beginning of a long Constitutional struggle, and the Amendments which were laid before this House are an abiding contribution to any settlement which is likely to command the adhesion of any large number of citizens in this country.<lb/>
Arguments have been used, not by the noble and learned Earl, Lord Halsbury, but by his friends both in the Press and in their not infrequent arguments with some Members of this House, which I will notice. It has been said&#x2014;I think it was implied this evening&#x2014;that those of your Lordships who resent the idea of a large creation of Peers are exaggerating the evil with which the House is menaced. But the strength of that contention depends entirely upon the assumption that the number of Peers to be created is extremely small. What is the warrant for that assumption? The noble Marquess has already called attention to the speeches delivered, not only here by the Lord Privy Seal, Lord Crewe, but in the House of Commons, from which it is quite plain that His Majesty's Government consider themselves bound to make such a creation of Peers as will meet any conceivable circumstances in relation to the passing of this Bill. I know it is suggested that this may be what is called, in the language of this discussion, a mere policy of "bluff." Many accusations, I am afraid, may be brought against His Majesty's Government, but no one, I think, will deny that from first to last and in every stage of this crisis they have acted with what can only be described as calculated determination. Men who have not hesitated to take the steps winch they have already taken are not likely to hesitate about taking the
<col>904</col>
further steps which are necessary to bring them to the end they have determined to reach.<lb/>
The contingency which we are responsible for considering is that of the entry into this House of a number of Peers large enough to alter its character and to determine its action in matters of great moment which are still to come; and we must be forgiven if on that point we prefer the explicit declaration of members of His Majesty's Government to the private inferences of the noble and learned Earl and his friends. In these circumstances it is our duty, so I venture to submit, to consider in the light of this contingency what is our duty to the King, to this House, and to the country. We are bound to consider the King. It is always a matter of extreme delicacy to mention that august name in these contentious debates, but, as the noble Marquess has already pointed out, two things at least it may be permissible to say&#x2014;one is that His Majesty has, by the admission of the noble Marquess yesterday, yielded as a Constitutional Monarch to the advice of his Ministers on this matter with the greatest reluctance; the other, that every loyal man will desire to do what in him lies, even at the cost of any sacrifice which he can make with honour, to save the King from the exercise of his Prerogative in a manner necessarily so distasteful.<lb/>
We are bound to consider the character of this House. Some friends of the noble and learned Earl, as the noble Marquess intimated to us, have spoken on this matter with something that might be described as levity. They have asked what harm would be done by the entry into this House of a certain number of gentlemen in closer touch than many Members of this House with the social and industrial life of the country. But the question is not one of restoring the balance of Parties&#x2014;a matter which on both sides of the House is earnestly desired. It is not a question of enriching the House by the accession of a few men of tried and proved service to the community&#x2014;an accession which we should all welcome. The question is whether or not we are to acquiesce in an act of force which would thrust upon this House a large number of Peers who would be precluded by the very terms on which they took their seats from exercising an independent
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0457"/>
<col>905</col>
judgment upon public affairs. It is sometimes said that Members of this House entering under these auspices or their successors might very soon change their opinions. But the mischief which might be wrought is a matter of the next eighteen months or two years, and what we have to consider is the possibility that very weighty matters may be determined within two years in a direction from which there might be no return. I must sorrowfully confess that I am more than sanguine that such a proposal being carried out would lower the prestige of this House in the eyes of the country and of the world at a time when the prestige of any Second Chamber is a thing jealously to be prized.<lb/>
An impressive appeal was made by the noble and learned Earl, and has often been made by his friends, that we should regard the effect of a creation of Peers upon the opinions of the citizens of the country, who are apt to take our political debates with too little seriousness and concern. It is, perhaps, not for me to make the rejoinder which I would like to make, but I may be pardoned for making it. What is it that has impressed upon the country during the last few weeks the great gravity of our international relations? Was it not the fact that in the presence of this danger both Parties composed their differences and treated those matters in a spirit of impressive unity? I believe, though I again say I hesitate to make the suggestion, that nothing would more impress the minds of the citizens of this country with the gravity of the issues involved in this dispute than if the two sections of noble Lords opposite would unite their differences and hold themselves together to resume this great debate on another occasion and under more favourable auspices. But that is not my point.<lb/>
I pass for one moment to our duty to consider in the light of this contingency the interests of the country. It is a matter of common knowledge that there are two great matters which will be presented to this House under the protection of the Parliament Bill. One is Home Rule. I am no fanatic on the subject of Home Rule. Home Rule as an abstract idea matters little. It is vague and unimportant. What matters vitally is Home Rule in concrete shape. The essence of any Home Rule scheme is the Home Rule Bill. It may be true that the opportunities
<col>906</col>
of revision and delay left to this House under the Parliament Bill are very small; but at least, as the noble Marquess has pointed out, they may suffice to allow some criticism where searching criticism is necessary, and delay where delay may be of the utmost value. What would be the position of those who feel strongly in regard to Home Rule, or even of those who were content to believe that the subject must demand most careful and prolonged consideration, if they were to find that even these opportunities of revision and delay were estopped by the votes of a majority of imported Peers? There is one other matter to which in a sentence I would refer&#x2014;a matter which the House will naturally suppose very closely concerns me. It is the possible Disestablishment of the Church in Wales. In regard to that no one, I think, would say that there was any mandate from the people of the country. Here at any rate no Bill has been presented for its consideration. Here, therefore, the danger would be very great if it was not even open to your Lordships' House to have recourse to those opportunities of delay which, in the shifts and chances of political life, might at least secure that a measure affecting in a most vital manner one of the most ancient branches of the Church in this country was not rushed through Parliament without being submitted to the intelligence and thought of the people. These, my Lords, are not fancy pictures; they are forecasts rendered reasonable by the language of His Majesty's Government and by the, whole course of their policy. They are dangers which no reasonable man can ignore, and they are consequences for which, in recording the vote or taking the action which we take in this debate, we must be held responsible. I feel that I ought to apologise to your Lordships for speaking so long upon a ground already so admirably covered by the noble Marquess.<lb/>
I come now to the point which perhaps alone justifies my intervention in this debate. We have reached a juncture in which, so far as we can judge from sources of information open to all of us, it is possible that the policy commended by the noble Marquess and endorsed by most of his supporters may not prevail. It is possible that the opinion of the majority of the House, if they cannot do more than abstain from voting, may be overruled by the votes of a united, strenuous, and able
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0458"/>
<col>907</col>
minority. I know that the noble Marquess and those who follow him do not feel themselves able to do more than abstain from voting. They are under obligations as members and leaders of one of the great Parties, which I entirely recognise, and which, if I may be permitted to say so, I entirely respect. But, my Lords, there are several members of this House who, not for any merit, but by virtue merely of their positions, are under no such ties of obligation, however legitimate and indeed Honourable these may be. Times must sometimes occur when independent members of this House find themselves, at a moment of great national emergency, in a position of quite exceptional responsibility, from which they must not shrink. In my position I happen to be one of them. It may be that there are others on the Bench behind me who share the views that I express, and who may be prepared to follow the course which I propose to take. I have no means of knowing. So far as I know, the occupants of the Bench behind me will follow in divers ways their own opinions according to their own conscience, and I know not in the least for how many I am now able to speak.<lb/>
But, my Lords, for myself I venture to put this point to the House. If I hold the opinions which I have just, I hope at not unnecessary length, attempted to express, if I believe that upon my vote in some degree may depend whether or not that which I cannot but regard as a great evil to this House and to the country may be carried out, can I withhold that vote? Let it not be said either here in this House or elsewhere hereafter that that vote is given on behalf of His Majesty's Government or of their policy. To say that would be to put an interpretation upon that vote which I have, before giving it, expressly and publicly disowned. My Lords, I give that vote with very great reluctance. Let not the noble and learned Earl and his friends imagine that their appeals leave my own feelings unmoved. But there are times when it may require a higher courage, when it may win a truer victory, to restrain one's feelings, however strong they may be, than to relieve them, times when in the service of the King and of the country, "He that ruleth his spirit is better than he that taketh a city."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02355"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that I have ever
<col>908</col>
in my political life stood at this Table with feelings of more poignant regret than I do at this moment. It is true that as no two men ever see eve to eye, it has been my misfortune from time to time, although it is a matter of very immaterial importance to your Lordships' House, to differ from my noble friend and leader Lord Lansdowne, but never before upon a matter of first-rate importance. My noble friend spoke in a moving passage of the severing of political friendships. Let me assure him that, so far as I am concerned, there is no such question in issue between us. How can it be said that because upon a matter of procedure, however important it is&#x2014;and I shall show, I hope, before I sit down that it is of vast importance&#x2014;I, a very humble individual, have the misfortune to differ from a man of my noble friend's distinction, it should lead to the severing of political friendships which do not depend upon procedure but upon the great political issues with which procedure has to deal? If I may be allowed one other personal observation, I would like to put myself right with your Lordships in the hearing of my noble friend. I am certain he will not say that in any degree those who sit on this Bench and are acting together ill opposition to him for the moment have deceived him in any way. From the very first, when it was quite clear what was coming, we told him what must be our conduct when the moment arrived. My noble friend cheers that. There is no question of betrayal, or deception, or disloyalty. We told him with grief but with conviction that if events shaped themselves as we foresaw, we should act accordingly. I notice that there has been a great assumption of ignorance as to what was coming. We all foresaw it, and we stated with great regret the action that we would feel bound to take when the time came.<lb/>
I now pass from personal questions and come to the subject of the discussion we are now engaged upon. Let me deal first with perhaps the most delicate matter of all. The most rev. Prelate spoke of the difficulties in which the policy recommended by my noble friend Lord Halsbury and ourselves may place His Majesty the King. We have every reason to treat the King with the most profound respect, not only from his exalted office but as one whose personal character inspires his
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0459"/>
<col>909</col>
subjects with all the affection and loyalty of which we are capable. We have no right to criticise what His Majesty has been pleased to do; and as far as we can see, reading between the lines, we should be surprised if it did not turn out that His Majesty had acted as a great friend, not to one Party but to both Parties in the State throughout this struggle. But the King has acted as a Constitutional King. [VISCOUNT MORLEY: Hear, Hear.] The noble Viscount assents to it. No doubt the most rev. Prelate does. He does. But, my Lords, you cannot have it both ways. If His Majesty acts as a Constitutional King he acts upon the advice of his Ministers, and the credit&#x2014;there is very little of that&#x2014;or the discredit must fall upon the Ministers. There is nothing which we can do or say which can discredit the King. There is no difficulty in which we can place the King if he acts as a Constitutional Sovereign. The discredit lies upon His Majesty's Government; let them bear the full burden. I am sure the most rev. Prelate will not think that I desire to be too critical when I say that to drag the King into this discussion is utterly irrelevant unless it can be said that he is not a Constitutional Monarch.<lb/>
Then the most rev. Prelate said we were stopped from acting because of the result of the late General Election. We do not think so. I do not think it necessary to say why we do not think so, because that was said with great effect and at great length last night by my noble friends who sit on this Bench. If the election settled the question, what were we doing in Committee so many days? If it is said that the election settled it, what business had we to put vital Amendments into the Bill at all? We ought rather to have accepted the decision of the country if that election settled the matter. Nothing has happened in the country between the Committee stage and the present stage. What was true in Committee is true now. If the election did not compel us to give way in Committee, it does not compel us to give way now. My noble friends the noble Marquess and Lord Curzon have said, or implied at any rate, that the election did not force us to give way in Committee. Very well; so far as the domestic controversy between ourselves is concerned, the question of the election is irrelevant and does not apply.<lb/>
<col>910</col>
I now pass to some of the observations which were made by my noble friend who leads the Opposition. He did not say anything about the election. On the contrary, he defended our attitude during the Committee stage, and said that through our action then we had revealed the attitude of His Majesty's Government upon the Referendum. Did we? Was it not revealed abundantly before? Was there anything really gained by way of revelation as to the attitude of His Majesty's Government in our proceedings in Committee? It was quite well known that we were in favour of the Referendum and that the House of Commons was against it. We must look deeper than that for a justification of our work in Committee. The next argument my noble friend used was that, after all, whatever happened in Committee, if we forced our policy upon your Lordships' House&#x2014;that is to say, if we persuaded a majority of your Lordships to agree with us&#x2014;we would bring infinite discredit upon all concerned. The most discreditable thing is that in order to save the reputation of the House of Lords we should be parties to deceiving the country. There is no discredit so great as that.<lb/>
I know that a great many of your Lordships, and I agree with them, feel acutely for the reputation of this House. They think of its glorious traditions, its independent spirit, its noble debates, and of the illustrious statesmen both living and dead who have been ornaments of it, and they cannot bear the idea that this violation of the House of Lords should take place upon the advice of His Majesty's Government. It is still worse that we should be parties to any lie to the country, and every time I hear a noble friend of mine speak of the discredit that would be so wantonly thrown upon this House by His Majesty's Government. I am afraid lest they are deceiving themselves into thinking that it is justifiable to try and cloak over the great revolution which is taking place. It is to the great gospel of make-believe that so much discredit is due. In this country we are apt to think that all is satisfied if we can only keep the black things out of sight. I have no doubt the most rev. Prelate has often said so in the pulpit&#x2014;and, if I may say so with great respect, with greater advantage than in your Lordships' House. Let it be made quite clear to the country that hence-
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0460"/>
<col>911</col>
forward when the Parliament Bill passes we cannot stand any longer and protect them. We shall be disarmed, and unless we bring that home to the country we have committed the last and most fatal breach of trust of which we are capable.<lb/>
My noble friend spoke of the odium thrown upon His Majesty's Government. I am quite sure he did not desire to relieve His Majesty's Government of one penny weight of the odium which they ought to bear. Any one can see the odium which is reflected upon them by the frantic struggles they are making not to have to fulfil the threat which they made of this creation of Peers. We have watched with a certain amount of amusement how the various forms of threats addressed to your Lordships' House have been modified as time went on. Once we were told that this Bill was not to come back to your Lordships' House until some kind of assurance had been obtained, either by the creation of Peers or by some private understanding, that it would pass in the form in which it left the House of Commons. We were not frightened by that threat, which has been abandoned. The particular threat now is, "If you do not give way we will overwhelm your Lordships' House with a hostile Radical majority." That threat has, I think, made an enormous impression upon this Bench. It made a great impression upon my noble friend Lord Curzon, who, in that masterly speech which he made last night, quoted the Home Secretary at least three times on this point. It also made a great impression, if I may use the phrase, upon so cool a head as that of my noble friend who leads the Opposition. I do not generally attribute very great weight to what the Home Secretary says. But did he say that there would be 500 Peers created or 400, as my noble friend seemed to imply? Not a bit of it What he said was, "Why should we shrink from the creation of 400 or 500 Peers? That is a very different thing. As my noble friend Lord Curzon said last night, the Home Secretary is not accustomed to shrink from anything. But was that a statement implying the policy of the Government? How was it dealt with by Lord Crewe last night? Lord Crewe spoke of those figures as bold figures, and said&#x2014;I think it was in an interruption to my noble friend Lord Selborne&#x2014;that though he did not confirm them he did not contradict them. That is not very enthusiastic
<col>912</col>
support from a colleague. It is quite clear that the Home Secretary was wrong, or at any rate that Lord Crewe thought he was wrong. ["Why?"] That is a matter of debate; but it is not usual for colleagues in a Government to throw each other over in that way unless there has been a serious mistake&#x2014;at least it was not so when I was in office. My noble friend Lord Lansdowne essayed to ascertain what the Government have really got up their sleeve and he put a specific question to the noble Viscount opposite. Did he get an answer? Not at all. The question was quite plain, but the noble Viscount refused to answer. Now I will put a question. I want to know whether His Majesty has given authority to the Government to create as many Peers as they please without reference to what they require to pass the Parliament Bill. That is quite clear, and I should like an answer "Yes" or "No."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02356"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: I entirely decline and shall continue to decline to answer questions of this cardinal character put without notice and without any opportunity of considering.

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02357"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I am obliged for the compliment of the noble Viscount. When we are getting on towards middle age we all like to be called juvenile. I am certainly juvenile beside the noble Viscount. But I am not surprised that he cannot answer "Yes" or "No." I did not expect for a moment that he would, and so I thought I had better arm myself with another authority&#x2014;namely, the words of the Cabinet Minute which was read out in another place&#x2014;
<quote>"His Majesty will be ready to exercise his Constitutional powers which may involve the Prerogative of creating Peers if needed to secure that effect shall be given to the decision of the country."</quote>
So that all that the Minute, to which His Majesty we are given to understand was pleased to assent, said was that he would create enough Peers to give effect to the wishes of the country. That is precisely in conformity with the letter written to Mr. Balfour by the Prime Minister. Here, again, it is said that should the necessity arise the Government will advise the King to exercise his Prerogative in order to secure the passing into law of the Parliament Bill in substantially
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0461"/>
<col>913</col>
the form in which it left the House of Commons. So that apparently all that the King's consent has been obtained to is the creation of a sufficient number of Peers to pass this Bill into law. That does not necessarily mean a majority of Liberal Peers in your Lordships' House. Why should it be held to be so? I defy any member of the Government to say that it does mean that. My noble friend assumed in his speech&#x2014;as I think quite wrongly&#x2014;that the Government have this roving authority to create as many Peers as they please, and he went on to say that the result might be that we on this side of the House would be out-voted when in office. No one respects your Lordships' House and its traditions more than I do, but if it comes to creating Peers, two can play at that game. Does my noble friend really mean, if he allowed this monstrous usurpation of power by the Radical Party of creating as many Peers as they like, that he would shrink from creating a number of Peers to adjust the balance when the time came? The warrant of the Government does not apparently go so far as my noble friend believes, and until I am corrected I shall adhere to that view.<lb/>
My noble friend spoke with great appreciation of the intelligence of the electors. He said he was quite sure, after these debates in your Lordships' House, that the electors would thoroughly understand that we are acting under duress even if there be no creation of Peers. With great respect, I do not agree with that. If the electors knew my noble friend as well as I do I am quite certain they would be impressed. But as a matter of fact they hear so many things from so many different politicians, and so many of the things they hear turn out to be untrue, that they have become very distrustful of what they are told. Depend upon it, that is the secret of the apathy in the country at this moment. The country has ceased to believe in politicians, and I confess I am not surprised at it. I do not believe that all the debates in your Lordships' House, all the flowing periods of my noble friend Lord Curzon, all the well-drafted Resolutions of censure upon the Government which your Lordships pass will have the least effect upon the electors. They have seen all this sort of thing before, and all they will say is, "Oh yes, beating the big drum to conceal a retreat. It is the old man&#x0153;uvre&#x2014;talk big and do
<col>914</col>
nothing." That is what the electors think. My noble friend said the time is coming when we shall be in a position to reverse all this, and we shall, of course, make it our first policy to do so. I am sure the noble Marquess will, but I am afraid none of that will have any effect upon the electors. What they will say is, "Did you vote against it? Did you use your power when you had it?" The working man understands deeds; he utterly despises words. I say that to the most rev. Prelate. He said, in a most eloquent and moving passage, that no one was hereafter to charge him with supporting His Majesty's Government, because he expressly barred it. But they will charge him with it; and he will have to be explaining so far as he is a politician all the rest of his life to get out of it. If my noble friend Lord Halsbury had not undertaken this very difficult task we all know what would have happened. There would not have been even that wonderful vote of want of confidence last night. My noble friend says "No."</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02359"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: Some noble Lord said "No." Of course it is only a matter of opinion. We should all have walked out and no one would have heard any more about it. There would have been a few speeches in the country, but the whole thing would have been a discredit. My noble friend Lord Halsbury has called the attention of the country to this matter in a way in which it would not otherwise have been done, and if he persists to the end we will follow him into the Division Lobby. Whether we will be in a majority or a minority none can tell; but this is certain&#x2014;that in the annals of this year it will go down to history that a certain number of your Lordships were as good as their word and voted according to their opinions. That is the reason for our action. We have no quarrel, I need not say, with my noble friend who leads the Opposition. I hoped that we should have been spared an appeal to courage, but the most rev. Prelate could not avoid it. The greatest courage, he said, lay in retiring in good order. Why should we talk about courage? We are all brave. Let us assume that from the very start, and let us with a good conscience and straightforward act vote as we believe, be the consequences what they may.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02360"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose to follow the noble Marquess, whose speech I am sure we all listened to with interest, or the Archbishop of York, into the difficulties that the friends of the noble Marquess may impose upon the King. I am much more concerned with the difficulties which the course that the noble Marquess and his friends recommend is likely to land this House in. Nor do I propose to examine for the moment the domestic differences of the Front Bench opposite. However, they seem to be of a lofty character and conceived upon the highest principles and ideals of British statesmanship. Last night I had the advantage, which has been denied me for some little time, of being present during the debate in your Lordships' House, and I was fortunate enough to listen to the speeches which were addressed to us by Lord Curzon and Lord Selborne. It is quite true that the Government received a certain amount of censure from the mouths of these two noble Lords, but the House as a whole received a great deal of exhortation, especially from Lord Curzon when he told us that it was our duty as individual Peers of Parliament to take stock of the situation and mind what we were about when it comes to the vote. Acting on this hint I should like to say a few words to justify the vote which I hope to give presently.<lb/>
I always suffer from a sense of uneasiness when anybody says he is going to justify his vote, for that generally means a long and tiresome speech. I have no doubt I shall be tiresome, but I will try not to be long. Mention of the word "vote" brings me up against&#x2014;I do not know quite what to call them after Lord Halsbury took such exception to the name of "Die bards," and "Death and Glory Men," and "Ditchers"&#x2014;names forced upon us by the newspapers, but we live under newspapers. I assume the "Ditchers" are the only persons as regards a vote that noble Lords opposite and ourselves have got to reckon with. I quite agree with Lord Salisbury that we are all brave, and I do not doubt the courage or the sincerity of the "Ditchers." What I doubt is their appreciation of the Constitutional position, and of their duty having regard to Parliamentary theory and practice&#x2014;I had almost said Parliamentary law. To-night, as the most rev. Prelate said, we are not at close quarters with the provisions of the
<col>916</col>
Parliament Bill. What we have to consider is what justification we have as a House either to insist or not to insist upon the Amendments which this House has seen fit to insert into that Bill. In my view, for what it is worth, we cannot insist if we act Constitutionally and on the evidence of facts and in obedience to usage.<lb/>
I very much deplore the decision which Lord Halsbury and his fighting friends have cone to. I am certain, to use a colloquialism, that whatever the merits or demerits of the Parliament Bill or of the Amendments may be, at this particular moment the game is up. You must give way. No doubt the country will be very willing to give these "Die bards" every credit for their unconquerable souls. I quite agree; and, while giving them that credit, they are to be congratulated upon the fact that they are masters of their unconquerable souls with very slight damage to their bodies. At the same time, if they would pay a little more attention to the pages of John Morley's "Compromise" and less to the columns of the <i>Observer</i> and the <i>Pall Mall Gazette,</i> the most desperate "Ditcher" of them all would be satisfied that he might give way to-night or even vote with the Government without any sacrifice of moral or intellectual dignity. May I remind your Lordships of the French aphorism, <i>Les hommes faibles ne c&#x00E9;dent jamais &#x00E0; propos.</i> The present position, to my mind, is justified by the result of two General Elections and by the absolute failure of the Lansdowne Resolutions&#x2014;Resolutions which, much as I disliked the Referendum complexion at out them, I was perfectly willing to swallow whole because I was anxious that they should go out to the constituencies before the General Election as in some way stating the case of the House of Lords, which in my view had never been fairly stated to the people of this country. Those Resolutions, if I may say so, fell as flat as a pancake. I quite agree with the noble Marquess who said that they had no sort of effect upon the constituencies. I am afraid he was right. It is driven in upon me that the constituencies have ceased to care very much about the House of Lords. We get on very well at hunting, and bazaars, and those kind of things, but I rather feel that our time is up as regards the constituencies. Not only have you had two elections and this failure, but you have the fact that if there had been a
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0463"/>
<col>917</col>
Dissolution you could not have won an election on the cry of the House of Lords, and had Ministers resigned you could not possibly have formed an Administration. I am afraid that with dear food round your necks and the House of Lords on your backs you are not likely to win an election for some little time to come.<lb/>
I subscribe very much to the views of Lord Durham, who made an excellent speech on the Third Reading of this Bill. I am no partisan of His Majesty's Government. I freely admit that in all this House of Lords business my qualified sympathies have been almost entirely with noble Lords opposite. I have on more than one occasion been gently applauded by noble Lords opposite for comments I have made upon the performances of His Majesty's Government&#x2014;one of those precious balms of an insidious character which one should try to avoid&#x2014;and I am now trying to take a dose from the other side. My agreement with noble Lords opposite, and especially with the constructive reformers opposite, has been not only platonic but critical. If a David may say such a thing to a Goliath, I did not agree very much with what Lord Halsbury said in his speech, but I do agree with him to this extent, that we are none of us very ardent reformers of the House of Lords. My views of noble Lords opposite have become critical especially since Lord Lansdowne's Second Chamber Bill the other day, and, if I may say so without offence, since Lord Curzon and Lord Selborne got so very actively to work in doing away with everything which I, for my part, consider makes the House of Lords an agreeable place. One of the compensations that a broken leg gives is that you have many opportunities for reflection, and for reading the newspapers and the showers of letters in <i>The Times</i> which I am sure no man in his seven senses would like to miss a word of. Profiting in that way by an enforced period of inactivity owing to an accident, I am driven to the conclusion that we have reached the moment when, to employ the apt phrase of a member of this House&#x2014;I think Lord Powis&#x2014;it is time to beat a dignified, but determined retreat.<lb/>
Might I say a word about what I will call the super-Peers whose advent upsets so many of my friends? Lord Curzon, in his otherwise grave discourse, permitted
<col>918</col>
himself one or two quips about this promised invasion or acquisition, and I think Lord Lansdowne did the same to-night. I noticed also that the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons was very down on the Government for thinking of bringing in Peers, as he said, to serve a term and to bring about a Parliamentary arrangement. It may be a good or a bad thing, but given a certain dilemma it is the only way in which you can bring about Parliamentary arrangements at all, and I venture to ask the House, Why not? The whole common life of this country exists by virtue of Parliamentary arrangements. We live under a Parliamentary Church; we are protected by a Parliamentary Army; we have Parliamentary trains and Parliamentary education; in fact, the whole of our lives from the cradle to the grave is more or less spent under the shadow and influence of Parliamentary institutions. I saw that in the Commons' debate Mr. F. E. Smith, one of the leaders of the new Unionist Party, in a partly forensic but chiefly comic vein which must endear him to his supporters, satirised us very severely on this side because he said that none of the Liberal Peers turned up at any of the Divisions during the earlier stages of this debate until they got really frightened and thought that a lot of new Peers were going to be created. I do not know what my friends behind me think of that, but I certainly was not here because I rather purposely kept away. I can assure Mr. Smith, however, and those who think with him, that is not my view. The new Peers would probably be what is called a very nice body of men. I should regret as much as anybody a comic opera creation of Peers, and I feel certain that the classical and aesthetic sense of the Prime Minister would make such a thing most repugnant to him. But I agree with what Lord Lansdowne said that it might increase the gaiety of the foreign nations, perhaps at the expense of the Mother of Parliaments.<lb/>
Whether the new Peers would number fifty or 500 I really do not care very much. The changes proposed under the Parliament Bill are so great that I have really ceased to trouble about any nicely-calculated number less or more. In 1719, which has been alluded to constantly, two very clever pamphlets were written, one by Walpole and the other by Lord Peterborough, on the Peerage Bill which was
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0464"/>
<col>919</col>
agitating everybody at that time. Lord Peterborough wrote to Pope or Swift&#x2014;I which&#x2014;at the same time that he had often reflected on the glorious possibilities of the English Constitution. That, no doubt, is a very spacious occupation. I know that in the opinion of many of us here to-night these possibilities are being overstrained, and I think, in the words of Lord Curzon and of Lord Selborne last night, many think that they are being betrayed. I confess that I am not of that opinion, and for this reason. I believe the Constitution is all right, because to my mind our unwritten Constitution is an area congenial to these time to time adjustments and working agreements. I quite recognise that in the discovery and the working out of these new arrangements&#x2014;which I hope we shall adopt&#x2014;there must of necessity be a great deal which will jar upon the nerves of people like myself, and probably on a great many noble Lords on both sides of the House, but I really cannot believe in the very large words which are employed as to our degradation, and so on, or accept the phrases used by Lord Selborne and Lord Curzon. Our occupation I do not think need necessarily be gone because we are curtailed in our power. Your Lordships' House will become more like family solicitors who warn and delay and advise and confuse their clients, but who do not decide and never accept any responsibility. But, after all, solicitors are reassuring and indispensable people and held ill very general esteem.<lb/>
In my view, as I have just said, we have got to give way. I do not believe in the disastrous and immediate results which seem to terrorise so many noble Lords opposite and which they recount with an almost fearful joy. I do not anticipate that the romantic consequences involved in the well&#x2014;known lines&#x2014;
<quote>"Religion, blushing, veils her sacred fires,</quote>
<quote>And unawares Morality expires"</quote>
will ensue on the passage of the Parliament Bill, with or without the Amendments. I do not believe that we shall see a Home Rule Bill or a Disestablishment Bill passed in the twinkling of an eye, or in the life of this Parliament; and with the Parliament Bill I still believe in the reason and common sense and sense of fairness both of governors and governed. For these reasons, although, as I have said, I have never been a sympathiser with the House of
<col>920</col>
Lords policy of the Government, in the particular conjuncture we are considering to-night I shall give them an unqualified vote, a vote which in my mind will be both Constitutional and inevitable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02361"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Lord Halsbury, in the observations which he addressed to your Lordships, complained of the epithets which had been applied to himself and to those with whom he is acting in this matter. I heard that complaint with some surprise, because epithets even worse have been largely applied by some of his followers to those who happen to differ from him. I do think that on this occasion the less we use epithets the better. Surely we can all in your Lordships' House give credit to each other for honesty of purpose and endeavouring to do our duty to our country as our consciences dictate. I entirely believe that of my noble friend Lord Halsbury with whom I have acted for many years of Parliamentary life, and I listened to him, and also to Lord Salisbury, in the hope that they might be able to give some reasons why any good could be done by the vote which they propose to give in favour of insisting upon your Lordships' Amendments.

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02369"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: I see. It would kill this Bill for the moment, but what would happen? I suppose the Prorogation of Parliament, the passage of the Bill again through the House of Commons, the creation of Peers, and the passage of the Bill through your Lordships' House, because the existing members of this House would be swamped by the new Peers. That is what my noble and learned friend contemplates. I venture to tell him that if be carries his Motion the Bill will become law just the same without the Lords' Amendments and in spite of his voting against it.<lb/>
I suppose there are some points on which the whole of this side of the House is in agreement. In the first place, we are all agreed in condemning the Government for the advice which they have tendered to His Majesty in respect to swamping this House by the creation of Peers. Secondly, I think we are all agreed that we dislike this Bill even with Lord Lansdowne's Amendments, and that supposing those Amendments were inserted in it, we would endeavour, as soon as the country was with us, to repeal it. Thirdly, I think we may also be agreed that whatever we do on the Motion now before the House we cannot stop this Bill from becoming law.

<col>922</col>
body on this side felt that though it might be right to vote in favour of insisting on your Lordships' Amendments it was impossible to prevent the Bill from becoming law without them. I think everybody would be content to let this Bill pass if the Government had been willing to insert our Amendments. If that is so, why is it so? The reason is that last December the constituencies by a majority accepted the main principles of the Bill. There can be no question about that. It has been discussed in the House of Commons and discussed in this House. It has been accepted by large majorities in the House of Commons, and does anybody believe for a moment that if the main principles of the Bill could be referred to the country again the country would give a different answer from that which it gave in December? Lord Selborne thinks so, and we shall hear from him on what ground.<lb/>
Has there been any sign in the country of a change of opinion? The constituencies have been absolutely apathetic in the matter. There have been by-elections, and the by-elections have gone practically in accordance with the previous election, allowing, of course, for some natural loss to the Government of the day such as always takes place in by-elections. If there had been a change of opinion in the country with regard to this Bill, would it not be certain that we should have had meetings all over the country, petitions to Parliament, addresses to the Crown, and every kind of engine put into organisation in order to prevail upon Parliament not to pass it? But nothing of the kind has occurred. There have been by-elections, but the topics discussed at those by-elections have not been the Parliament, Bill, but the Shops Bill, the Insurance Bill, and perhaps Tariff Reform, and there has not been the remotest sign of any general change of opinion. If that is true of the main principles of the Parliament Bill is that any sign that it, is not also true of your Lordships' Amendments. I attach the greatest importance&#x2014;nobody attaches more importance&#x2014;to Lord Lansdowne's Amendment, relating to the submission to the electors of Bills affecting the Crown, the Protestant Succession, or Home Rule, in any part of the United Kingdom, but I cannot honestly say that I believe that if that issue could be submitted to the country the country would give us a majority in its favour now. I do not believe
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0466"/>
<col>923</col>
this matter was properly before the country in December, and, to some extent, that was the fault of the leaders of my Party. If Lord Lansdowne and Mr. Balfour instead of waiting until the eleventh hour had put their policy before the country earlier it is possible that the verdict in December might have been in some measure different. But we have to deal with matters as we find them, and it must be confessed that the opinion of the country was then in favour of the Parliament Bill. That to my mind, as the most rev. Archbishop said, is an important factor in the situation with which we have to deal.<lb/>
But there is another factor which has been alluded to already. I have served the Sovereign of this country in political office for more than twenty years, and I feel most deeply the position of my Sovereign at the present moment. I believe the action of the Government has deliberately placed him in the most cruel position any English Sovereign has been placed in for more than a century. We have had full details from the Prime Minister and Lord Crewe of the terms of the Minute which was placed before the King by his Ministers in November, 1910. There was then absolutely no crisis. The Parliament Bill had not even been considered by either House of Parliament. It had not been submitted to the opinion of the country, and no one knew what the opinion of the country would be upon it, or the opinion of the House of Commons or of your Lordships' House. That was a moment when everything as to the future was uncertain, and that was the moment at which His Majesty's Ministers thought right to submit that Minute to His Majesty. It was a hypothetical recommendation, and it asked for a hypothetical promise.<lb/>
A question was asked by my noble friend Lord Halsbury yesterday which has not been answered. It was of the utmost importance&#x2014;"Why have we not all the papers that passed?" We have a Minute, but nothing beyond that, except that His Majesty acquiesced in the advice, as the noble Marquess, Lord Crewe, said, "with legitimate reluctance," and that a few weeks ago the same advice was tendered by Ministers and had been accepted by His Majesty. Were there no qualifications to the first acceptance? Was nothing said as to the possibility of reasonable Amendments being accepted, as to the number of
<col>924</col>
Peers whom His Majesty might assent to create? We have not the whole case before us, and for the benefit of the country and of history the whole case ought to be before Parliament. Ministers might have thought fit to decline to make any communication as to what passed, but they have no right to make a partial communication. Part of the truth is sometimes no truth at all. If there were further Minutes from Ministers or from the King, we ought to have them before us; and until we have them before us we cannot fairly understand all the circumstances.<lb/>
In November last Ministers presented two alternatives to the King. They might resign or they might be permitted to dissolve with a certain promise. Was there not a third alternative? Why could they not go on to the next session in February, 1911, and bring forward their Parliament Bill in the House of Commons or the House of Lords? Parliament was young; the House of Commons was not eleven months old; Ministers had the complete confidence of the House of Commons; what then was the reason why this alternative was not presented to the King? I think at the time there were some differences between them and the Irish Nationalists. Aye, and it was to compose these differences with the Irish Nationalists on the subject of the Budget that they refrained from putting the full situation before the King. We have it from Ministers that the King discussed the matter in all its bearings with the Prime Minister and Lord Crewe. In that discussion reference must have been made to the proceedings at the Conference just concluded. I assume that His Majesty was in full possession of all the proceedings at the Conference, with which I am not acquainted, and in connection with the subject of the relations between the two Houses a good deal must have been said about Home Rule at that Conference. Were not the members of the Government at that Conference willing to make certain concessions on the subject of Home Rule? Was His Majesty made aware of these concessions? If not, why not? Was it ever suggested to the King that the difference between the two Houses on this Bill might turn, as it has turned, on the application of it to the question of Home Rule? We are really feeling in semidarkness in all these matters.<lb/>
But I gather from what has been said
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0467"/>
<col>925</col>
that His Majesty was told that if he accepted the resignation of his Ministers he might place himself in the awkward position of bringing the Crown into Party controversy. I should like to know whether Mr. Balfour and Lord Lansdowne were ever suggested to the King by his Ministers as persons who might be prepared to form a Government in the event of the King declining to give the promise asked for by his Ministers. I have no doubt whatever that the Prime Minister and Lord Crewe, to the best of their power, gave an honest account to the King from their point of view of all the circumstances of the situation; but the question was one of exceptional difficulty and importance bearing on the Constitutional action of the Sovereign, which no King for a long time has had to consider. He ought, then, to have had the fullest possible information and to have heard both sides of the question. The King ought to have been told that he was at liberty to hear what Lord Lansdowne and Mr. Balfour had to say before making up his mind as to whether he would give that hypothetical promise. This question was asked by Lord Curzon, but was not answered by Ministers last night; will it be answered in the course of this debate? It seems to me that these things show in the gravest light the manner in which Ministers dealt with the King last November. If they had had common generosity they would have advised the King to do what I have suggested&#x2014;namely, fully to inform himself from both sides before committing himself. I go further and say that it would have been common honesty from the advisers of the Sovereign to the Sovereign; but what they did on that momentous occasion seems to me to show that they preferred working for their Party purposes to carrying out their duties to their Sovereign and to their country.<lb/>
What has been the result? When the crisis came near us the other day Ministers tendered certain advice to the Sovereign and he accepted it. But he was previously bound by this hypothetical promise. The King has been misled by his Ministers into making that promise; and now we are asked by my noble and learned friend, not on a matter of principle, but of tactics and procedure, to give a vote which will practically compel the Sovereign to create any number of Peers which Ministers may please to recommend to
<col>926</col>
him as essential for the carrying of the Parliament Bill. I for one will never give a vote which will place my Sovereign in such a cruel position; and I hope your Lordships will carefully consider the position in which your King is about to be placed before you decide to insist on these Amendments.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Salisbury has laid great stress upon the question of the number of Peers that are to be created. I confess he seems to me to be under an entire delusion upon this most important part of the subject. I will venture, because it is important, to read again to your Lordships the words which were used by the noble Marquess, Lord Crewe, last night. Lord Crewe referred to what he called the bold figures of the Home Secretary&#x2014;400 or 500 were bold figures. It may not go as far as that, but it is pretty well known&#x2014;it was admitted by the noble Marquess himself yesterday&#x2014;that there is a section in the Cabinet who desire to see a large creation of Peers, although perhaps that section may be more or less overruled by those who, like himself, look upon the whole of tins matter as an odious concern. Lord Crewe said&#x2014;
<quote>"If we are to be forced into giving advice which will give effect to the creation of Peers, we cannot pretend that the number created could necessarily be limited by any newspaper lists, nor would it necessarily have any reference whatever to division lists. All such lists will have become altogether irrelevant, and all calculations assumed to be at an end."</quote>
Now what is the plain meaning of that? Supposing my noble friend Lord Halsbury and those who support him succeed in insisting upon your Lordships' Amendments their majority cannot be very large&#x2014;ten, twenty, or thirty as the ease may be. How can anybody seriously believe that a number of Peers sufficient to overcome such a vote as that would be all that His Majesty's Government would ask the King to create? By any creation of Peers the whole situation would be altered, and I have not the slightest doubt that many noble Lords who are now prepared to abstain from voting would feel, after the Peers had been created, that the situation had been so completely altered that they would be entitled to back up their opinions in the Lobby and vote against His Majesty's Government. His Majesty's Government must for their own protection advise the creation of a large number of Peers.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0468"/>
<col>927</col>
My noble friend Lord Salisbury said a good deal about the opinion that might be entertained in the country with regard to the vote that your Lordships may see fit to give. He said that the only way to bring home to the country the iniquities of the Parliament Bill was to insist on the creation of Peers. I think that would bring it home to the country in a way that lie little imagines. I believe there would be no set of persons more unpopular in the country within a year after the present Members of this House had been swamped by the creation of Peers than those who by their vote in favour of insisting on these Amendments would be held to have made this creation necessary.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02375"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: I submit there are reasonable grounds for believing it. Lord Lansdowne said lie knew that the creation of Peers would be very large, and the noble Marquess would not have said that unless he had some good source of information. My noble friend thinks that, assuming the present members of your Lordships' House are swamped and the political complexion of the House changed by the creation of Peers, it would be an easy matter for the next Government to create more Peers so as to change that complexion again. He would answer one revolution by another. I cannot imagine that that argument is seriously put forward. In my belief the threat of the exercise of the Prerogative has killed the Prerogative for the future. It is perfectly certain that both sides will have to set to work before very long to substitute some form of Second Chamber for the present House of Lords. There can be no question of that; and it is equally certain that of that substitution an essential part will be some arrangement for settling differences between the two Houses without recourse to the unconstitutional procedure of swamping one Chamber of the Legislature
<col>928</col>
by the exercise of the Prerogative. That, indeed, would have been the effect of the Bill proposed by Lord Lansdowne, and it must be the effect of any reasonable proposal for reform of this House.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Salisbury&#x2014;and Lord Halsbury also&#x2014;blamed Lord Lansdowne for not sticking to his Amendments. My noble friend Lord Lansdowne stuck to his Amendments up to the very last moment when it was possible to carry them, and if he does not support them by his vote now, what is the reason? The reason is that it would be impossible for him to carry them by any exercise of that vote. Lord Salisbury asked whether the electors would consider that we had used our powers of resistance to the utmost of our ability. I think the electors are a little more acquainted with political affairs than he seems to suppose. I am quite sure that when it is perfectly clear that by opposition you cannot secure what you desire, when the Bill you object to must pass in the form you dislike whichever way you vote, the electors will be sensible enough to see that one evil is bad enough without introducing another evil into the country. I do think it would be a serious evil if this Chamber were to be swamped as contemplated by the Government.<lb/>
I will not dwell on the point touched upon with such eloquence by Lord Lansdowne as to the feeling that would be entertained throughout the civilised world by such a proceeding; I am thinking, more of its effect on the proceedings of your Lordships' House. I candidly admit that when the pendulum swings back and the Unionist Party is again predominant in the House of Commons, I do not want to see their Bills delayed and their action harassed by a hostile majority in your Lordships' House. Noble Lords opposite will say that is precisely what they are suffering from now. But it is generally agreed that they have a grievance in this respect which must be remedied. And I would venture to remind them that the circumstances of the two Parties are not the same. Noble Lords opposite are very fond of proposing Constitutional changes. That is not the function of the Unionist Party. Our ideas of legislation are very different from theirs, and our, support of the Amendments of my noble friend is due to our desire to secure that Constitu-
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0469"/>
<col>929</col>
tional changes, and practically Constitutional changes only, shall be submitted to the people for their assent before they become law, and shall not be made by the uncontrolled will of possibly a very small majority in the House of Commons. I do not think it can be said that we claim for ourselves what we are not also ready to concede to noble Lords opposite, because undoubtedly the effect of the Reform Bill proposed by Lord Lansdowne, as Lord Curzon showed at the time, would have been to give the present Government a majority in any joint voting of the two Houses for all matters of ordinary legislation.<lb/>
I should like, if your Lordships will pardon me for a few moments, to say a word or two as to my own position. I have been accustomed all my life, for something like fifty years, to act with my political Party. I have differed from them sometimes on important questions like Tariff Reform, but on those occasions I have simply held aloof. The Press, for some mysterious reason of which I am entirely ignorant, have thought fit lately to use my name in a quite different connection. They have spoken of "Lord St. Aldwyn's movement" with reference to this question and of "Lord St. Aldwyn's Party." I have made no movement. I have never dreamt of forming a Party. That is the last thing I should think of. All I have done through this controversy has been to address a few observations to two private meetings of Unionist Peers; on the first occasion in favour of the policy proposed by Lord Lansdowne and on the second occasion deprecating, and with success, any organisation of Unionist Peers to vote with His Majesty's Government upon this occasion.<lb/>
But ever since Lord Lansdowne and Mr. Balfour declared their policy on this matter, Lord Selborne and Lord Salisbury have endeavoured to counteract that policy by an organisation, carried on with a great flourish and beating of literary and oratorical trumpets and drums. They have acted in direct opposition to their leaders. I have no right to judge them, but this I will say, that I do not think they are acting fairly to the two leaders of the Unionist Party. I would never give a vote on this Bill which would accentuate and increase our existing divisions. It is my intention to follow my noble friend Lord
<col>930</col>
Lansdowne, both for this reason and because it would go deeply against the grain for me to vote against insisting upon an Amendment which I believe to be necessary for the welfare of the State, by giving the people of this country some power of controlling the House of Commons upon great Constitutional issues. I follow my noble friend, and I would only in conclusion express my earnest hope that this being a question of procedure and tactics, as is admitted, those of your Lordships who have not yet declared your intention will do the same. However agreeable it may be to our private feelings to express our dislike of the Bill by voting in favour of insisting upon the Amendments, we have something to consider besides our private feelings, and that is, what is our duty to our country. That, I hope and believe, will weigh with your Lordships in the decision at which you arrive.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02376"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have listened with great interest to the speech of the noble Viscount, and no one could possibly have applauded more than I did the masterly way in which lie dealt with the transaction which has been going on between His Majesty's Ministers and the Sovereign with regard to this matter of the Royal Prerogative. When listening to that part of the speech I must say I made up my mind, more firmly if possible than ever I have done before, that I would insist to the bitter end upon this matter being exposed by following Lord Halsbury in his policy of resistance&#x2014;because believe that is the only way in which this transaction will ever be properly placed before the country, and because I think it is the best way in which the Sovereign may be protected from a repetition of this kind of thing in the future.<lb/>
The noble Viscount who has just sat down said that in taking the course we propose to take we are doing something which is not quite fair to the two leaders of the Unionist Party. May I say at once that in a matter of this kind loyalty to Party leaders bears no relation whatever to the magnitude of the present issue. If he only understood the searchings of heart and the pooling of consciences that have gone on in the ranks of the Unionist Party amongst those who, like myself, feel strongly about this Constitutional question, and the way in which we have agreed to things which we
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0470"/>
<col>931</col>
really thought we ought not to agree to&#x2014;proposals for the reform of the House of Lords, which a great many of us secretly dislike, and other substitutes for the Constitution of this country which have been brought forward from time to time&#x2014;if he remembers that we agreed to the Second Reading of the Parliament Bill and also to the Third Reading with very grave misgivings, our action may be viewed in a somewhat different light. We put our consciences into the common stock of the Party on the understanding, and in the sure and certain hope, that we should be allowed to have a fight at some stage or another with regard to the most important measure that has ever been presented to Parliament.<lb/>
Lord Bolingbroke's name has been mentioned a good many times in the course of this discussion, and metaphors have been put forward, principally military ones. May I be allowed to mention Lord Bolingbroke's name in connection with a hunting metaphor. What he said about the House of Commons I believe applies to the House of Lords. He said that the House of Commons grew fond of the man who showed them sport and by whose hallo they were wont to be encouraged. This time the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition will come home with many of his hounds left out, because we do not mean to leave our fox as long as he is above ground. But I can assure your Lordships that it is with no idea of sport that we have taken up the attitude we have done upon this question. This is only a phase in the prolonged Constitutional conflict in which this country will probably be involved for a great many years to come.<lb/>
I am not going back over the whole history of this matter. Let me just refer to the commencement of it. The point always insisted upon by the noble Viscount on the Front Bench, and by the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack who is always reminding us of the rejection of the Budget, is that the House of Lords challenged the House of Commons. That is their version of what has taken place. My version of it is that the Radical caucus challenged the British Constitution when they man&#x0153;uvred the House of Lords into rejecting the Budget. I think the House of Lords did quite right when they rejected the Budget and I should advocate
<col>932</col>
exactly the same course being followed again in similar circumstances. A Liberal Government were returned to office in 1906 with one of the most magnificent majorities by which any Party has ever been returned to the House of Commons, and they proceeded to legislate, not for the welfare of the people, but underlying the whole of their policy was the purpose of making war upon the Constitution of this country, partly because inveighing against the <i>personnel</i> of the House of Lords suited their general plan of campaign of setting class against class, and partly because they knew that sooner or later they were bound to be faced with the problem of getting a Home Rule Bill through Parliament without an appeal to the people.<lb/>
I wish to say a word about one line of argument which we very often hear. It is said, "You took a bold line on the Budget; you fought for that and you did not do very well, so for Heaven's sake do not try it again." The rejection of the Budget, if I may put it in this way, is the very reason why your Lordships should stick to your guns now. It is all part and parcel of the same policy, and those who were responsible for advising the House of Lords to reject the Budget, or to refer the Budget to the people, or however you like to describe it, ought to have foreseen that, unless you had the most phenomenal luck at the election, sooner or later a situation which would probably involve a recommendation to the Sovereign to create Peers would have to be faced, and that we would be bound to see it through. If at that time an attitude of resistance to the creation of Peers had been taken up and the reasons against a creation of Peers had been put forward up and down the country, as they have been put forward in the course of this debate by Lord St. Aldwyn and Lord Curzon, we should never have been in the position in which we are at the present moment. It is too late to inveigh against the creation of Peers when those who have made such speeches have said that they will give way. Until these Peers are created the statement that they will be created is nothing more or less than a menace. I do not think that the Radical Party are altogether happy about the creation of Peers. Here is an exceedingly interesting statement that I find in your great newspaper the <i>Morning Leader.</i> It is headed "Lord Crewe's Slip"&#x2014;
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0471"/>
<col>933</col>
<quote>"Now the one power which is forcing this Bill through the House of Lords, it must be remembered, is simply fear."</quote>
So that one of the official organs of noble Lords opposite openly admits that the Government are trying to bluff the House of lords by threatening to create Peers. The statement continues&#x2014;
<quote>"We believe it to be the simple fact that 400 or 500 Peers will be created, but it is difficult to understand why Lord Crewe should have made the following Statement 'I do not pretend that, as a Party, we are all of one mind on this question of the creation of Peers."</quote>
It is for that reason that Lord Halsbury and those acting with him are determined to see this thing through and to force His Majesty's Ministers, not only to show their hand, but to lay their cards face upwards upon the table&#x2014;to produce their Peers and explain to the nation all the circumstances which led to their creation.<lb/>
We have been told by several speakers that the "game is up," that we have been overborne at two General Elections, and that therefore the time has come for the House of Lords to give way. That is an overbearing, bullying, and dictatorial argument to apply about anything, and it certainly cannot be applied to a proposal to abrogate the British Constitution. And when we are told that the time has come for throwing up the Constitution our answer to that is, "Never." We do not intend to allow the ancient traditions of Parliamentary practice to be applied to a class of measure which has never been before Parliament in the recollection of I do not know how many generations. During the last eighteen months we have heard nothing else up and down the country but loud-mouthed denunciations of the Parliament Bill by Lord Curzon and others because it would establish a system of single-Chamber government in this country. Yet now at the very last minute we are told that we must assent to the passing of the Bill because, after all, it still leaves the House of Lords a certain amount of power which is worth keeping. Noble Lords who make use of that argument cannot possibly have it both ways. This Bill either means single-Chamber government or it does not. If Unionist Peers say it does not, then they are adopting the Radical argument in favour of the Bill and not the Conservative argument against it. That is the argument that noble Lords
<col>934</col>
opposite are always using in order to rope in the moderate men on their own side. If, on the other hand, the Bill does Mean single-Chamber government, then we who belong to the Conservative and Constitutional Party have no right to assent to its passage into law in any shape or form.<lb/>
We are constantly being told&#x2014;the Archbishop of York reminded us of it, placing an entirely private construction of his own upon it&#x2014;that the Parliament Bill was approved at the last two General Elections. That may or may not be true. Next we are reminded with great force by the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack of the fact that at some time or other a time comes in the Constitutional history of this country when the House of Lords must be controlled. I believe that is his theory, and it is backed up by Professor Dicey and the ancient Romans who get big print in <i>The Times.</i> But, with the greatest respect to Professor Dicey and his friends and to the Lord Chancellor, may I suggest that all these conventions with regard to the Cabinet representing the House of Commons and the House of Commons. representing the electors and the electors representing the nation are only applicable to ordinary legislation and become tyrannical if used to push through extraordinary legislation. When they are applied to legislation which is not only extraordinary but in our view absolutely unthinkable and impossible, then we cannot entertain that affection for representative government which we ordinarily extend to it. You may claim majorities if you like in favour of the Parliament Bill at a dozen General Elections, but that will not alter my view and I do not think it will alter the view of Lord Halsbury or those acting with us in this matter. We will continue to resist the abrogation of the Constitution as long as we have ally power left in us so to do. The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition made some good-natured remark about a speech that I was allowed to make the other day, in which I said that the Constitution could only be abolished by main force, and that I for one intended to see that it should be abolished only by main force. I adhere absolutely to that intention; but, as a matter of fact, the main force to which I was then alluding was the main force of the creation of Peers and the overbearing of this House by introducing into
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0472"/>
<col>935</col>
it an unlimited number of new Peers. That is using main force, as I ventured to say the other day, just as much as if you called a regiment of dragoons in to make the House of Lords do what the Radical Party wanted it to do.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, this Bill may or may not pass into law. We are laughed at by noble Lords who used to act with us and by noble Lords opposite when we say that there is a chance of this Bill not passing into law. If Lord Halsbury and his friends are successful in the Lobby when the time comes I take it that this Bill, at any rate, will be dead. I for one am going to be no party to hastening the revolution by agreeing to the Bill. So long as this Bill is not upon the Statute Book we have a perfect right, and we intend to exercise that right, of using every, Constitutional means in our power of obstruction and delay to prevent its becoming law. We do not think it at all ignoble to delay the passage of this Parliament Bill in the hope of something turning up. Plenty of things may happen in the meantime.<lb/>
The noble Viscount Lord St. Aldwyn, and other noble Lords have told us&#x2014;and no doubt they believe they are saying what is absolutely true&#x2014;that an unlimited creation of Peers will take place if we are successful in our opposition. Our answer is that we do not think anything of the kind will take place, and we shall not believe it until they actually take their seats in this House. If this Bill is passed it will be by virtue of the abstention from voting of a certain number of noble Lords who sit on these Benches. I am not going to criticise their conduct, though I must say that I have not been able up to the present to understand it. Or it may be passed into law by means of the concurrence and the assistance of noble Lords who sit on these Benches, by their voting with the Government. I will not criticise their motives in this matter either, or their courage. We will agree that we have a common stock, as Lord Salisbury said, of both motives and courage; but when we have a section of the Unionist Party taking their political lives in their hands and standing up for what they consider the best means of saving the ancient Constitution of this country, I do think we have a right to expect at least that we shall be allowed a fair field and no favour upon
<col>936</col>
which to meet the Radicals and to beat them if we possibly can. I feel very much in the position of the native who was so humble in his demands to the Almighty that when be met a bear walking in a wood he knelt down and prayed that Divine providence would at least not be on the side of the bear.<lb/>
There is one section of this House that I cannot understand voting for this Bill&#x2014;I refer to the Episcopal Bench. I respectfully, invite the Bishops to remember that every vote a Bishop gives for this Bill will be directly helping the Radicals to do away with the Constitution, and&#x2014;I do not use this language as the language of menace&#x2014;if they desire to retain an Established Church in this country they can only do so through the agency of the Tory Party, which is the only agency, as Lord Beaconsfield used to say, by which you can maintain an Established Church. The Tory Party is the only Party that believes in the State recognition of the Church; and if you agree that the Established Church is bound up with the existence of the Tory Party, then right rev. Prelates may be placing themselves with regard to the protection they may expect to receive from political Parties in the future in a very equivocal position indeed. They have nothing whatever to hope for from any temporary or permanent alliance with noble Lords who sit on that Bench. Their only hope of salvation&#x2014;I do not wish to talk about salvation to a Bishop; I am speaking of political salvation&#x2014;is to stand up for the Party which is the trustee of the ancient Constitution of this country and the bulwark of the Church.<lb/>
There is a great deal more in this Bill than meets the eye with regard to Party politics in this country during the next eighteen months If I may say so with great respect, there has been far too much tendency to talk about the Bill in the terms of what is going to happen to the Conservative Party next year, and all that kind of thing. There is something involved in this which is infinitely more important than any consideration of Party loyalty or Party fortunes. The analogy, of the Duke of Wellington, I may remind your Lordships, has nothing whatever to do with the present case. He intended to accept the Reform Bill for all time, whereas in the case of the Parliament Bill noble
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0473"/>
<col>937</col>
Lords on this side of the House desire to do away with it immediately an opportunity occurs. That is the difference between their position and that of the Duke of Wellington.<lb/>
I shall refuse to believe, until I see it, that any Peer calling himself a Unionist will actively assist in the passage of this Bill by giving a vote for it. The country will never understand the sophistries they will be obliged to resort to in the future to defend their position. I believe I am as intelligent as some of my neighbours in my own part of the country, and I do not see how any ordinary man can possibly understand a man talking one way and voting another. If I and my friends are asked by noble Lords who sit on this side for, any proofs of our sincerity, I would say as far as I am concerned, here and now, that I am prepared to take in my hand every possible weapon of delay and obstruction, even the referring of this matter to the Committee of Privileges&#x2014;in fact, to indulge in every kind of stone-walling; and I hope noble Lords will assist Lord Halsbury to the utmost of their capacity and so force a Dissolution of Parliament or postpone this Bill and afford a chance of something turning up which may prevent its passing into law. Until the Bill is passed into law, we as trustees of the Constitution have no right whatever and no power from a moral point of view to do anything which will accelerate or facilitate its being placed on the Statute Book.<lb/>
[<i>The sitting was suspended at five minutes past eight o'clock and resumed at half past nine.</i>]</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02377"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF BEDFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to support the noble and learned Earl, Lord Halsbury, but in following that course I do not flatter myself that I am doing anything heroic. As a Back Bench Peer simply pursue that course which, according to my own political conviction, I consider to be the best for my country in a crisis of unexampled difficulty. The one vital point at which I think we have to aim is to recover for the electorate their control over the legislation by which they and we are governed. When I agreed to the passing of the Second Reading of the Parliament Bill without a Division, I did so because the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition had announced
<col>938</col>
his intention of moving important Amendments during the Committee stage of the Bill. The noble Marquess did so by inserting into the Bill the Amendment known as Lord Lansdowne's Amendment. I understand from the speeches delivered and votes recorded by noble Lords on this side of the House that they regarded the Amendment as absolutely vital and essential to safeguard the rights of the electorate during the next few years&#x2014;in short, that the Amendment represented absolutely the ultimate concession to which the principles of the Unionist Party allowed them to proceed.<lb/>
But now when we come to the question of whether or no we are to insist upon that Amendment&#x2014;and from the very first it was a foregone conclusion that we should arrive sooner or later at this stage&#x2014;then at once we come to a difference of opinion between those who are in favour of yielding as soon as threatened, and those who are determined never to yield on questions of principle but to be outvoted as I hope upon a future occasion and by a contingent of their supporters whom the Government propose to summon to the Upper House for that express purpose. Under the Bill, as we are ready to pass it with the Amendment inserted, we surrender those powers which the Government call upon us to surrender in virtue of the result of the last two General Elections. On the other hand, under the Amendment upon which those who follow Lord Halsbury are prepared to insist, we do claim to preserve for the electorate some portions of their authority over the majority in the House of Commons. The effect of the Parliament Bill, deprived of Lord Lansdowne's Amendment, is to endow the group majority in the House of Commons with absolute power, uncontrolled, unchecked, and unbalanced&#x2014;in short, to make them during the present Parliament the despotic masters of the nation.<lb/>
If the question were asked at any public meeting, "What is the need for this proposed wholesale creation of Peers?" I am sure that every Radical present would reply, "To do away with the Veto of the House of Lords." It is nothing of the kind. We know that we have now come to the last stage in a deliberate plan to deprive the electorate of all control over the legislation which is to be passed by the Coalition
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0474"/>
<col>939</col>
majority in the House of Commons. Now, under the Bill with the Amendment inserted the so-called Veto of the House of Lords is already abolished. Therefore if the Government summon additional supporters here they cannot force that door because it is already open. The last two General Elections have done that. The task assigned to them would be a very different one. It would be to force the safeguard provided by our Amendment for preserving the control of the electorate in certain instances over the majority in the House of Commons. The effect of the vote of the newly-created Peers would be a despotic oligarchy in the House of Commons, and that is a very different story from abolishing the so-called Veto of the House of Lords. We must remember that the Parliament Bill has a Preamble promising double-Chamber government. That Preamble was inserted, as we all know, to secure the support of those politicians whose political faith is summed up in the old platform cry of "Government of the people, for the people, by the people." If they honestly believe in this cry I am at a loss to understand how any of these supporters of the Government can accept seats in tins House on the understanding that by their votes they are to deprive the electorate of all control over the legislation to be passed by the group majority in the House of Commons.<lb/>
I am one of those who hold the view that the House of Lords are the trustees of the Constitutional rights of the nation; and that they cannot of their own free will divest themselves of their trust. The Constitutional right to which I allude is the right hitherto enjoyed by the people of saying the last word on the detail of the laws by which they are governed. Our consent is asked to deprive them of that right. As trustee, I have no power to consent. I must do my duty until I am forcibly deprived of the power of doing it. The threat of deprivation is not sufficient; there must be the act of violence. I am, of course, aware that this sense of trusteeship is not felt by all Members of your Lordships' House, but it must dominate the action of those who do feel it. No argument that can be brought forward justifies the betrayal of a trust. There is nothing heroic about this. It is a matter of common honesty.<lb/>
The case in point is Home Rule. Home
<col>940</col>
Rule is not mentioned in the Parliament Bill although everybody knows that it is the moving spirit of that measure. Twice have Home Rule Bills been passed by the House of Commons, twice have they been referred by your Lordships to the judgment of the constituencies, and twice have they been rejected by large majorities. On the third occasion, if Lord Lansdowne's Amendment is deleted, the electorate will be deprived of their right of saying the last word on the details of the Home Rule Bill, and that when not one of the rank and file of their representatives elected at the General Election know a line of the contents of the proposed law. I know it will be said. "But if Peers are created the people will equally be deprived of their right, and you will get Home Rule a year sooner." I can safely leave the matter of the year sooner to be dealt with by noble Lords from Ireland. My point is this. You may compel the Government to create Peers in order, first, to make absolute the rule of the group majority in the House of Commons, and, secondly, to pass that measure of Home Rule which satisfies the Irish section of the Coalition group over the heads of the British constituencies. In that case we can at least point to the presence of these Peers whose votes have deprived the nation of their right of deciding upon the details of a Home Rule Bill before it becomes law.<lb/>
Nothing short of the actual creation and the actual votes of these Peers will force home to the country the true nature of the purpose for which those Peers have been summoned to the House of Lords. But their presence, and still more their votes, will open the eyes of the nation to the fact that it is the electorate who have been deprived of that right of final veto on which their liberties depend. On the other hand, you may yield without compelling a creation of Peers. Then whatever protest you may make with your voices, it will be your hands alone, my Lords, which have opened the door to allow an unknown measure of Home Rule to pass through and occupy a position from which it is certain that in less than two years time it must become law over the heads of the constituencies. No doubt during that brief interval you could within these walls pass Resolutions condemning Home Rule&#x2014;which will be met with contemptuous indifference elsewhere&#x2014;and parade the country to denounce Home Rule as a pernicious measure, always adding, in plaintive justification of your conduct,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0475"/>
<col>941</col>
"Please remember that it was only under protest that we opened the door for this evil measure to pass through and in due course become law." Plain men will not understand the mental attitude of those who propose at once to facilitate and to condemn the passage of the Home Rule Bill. To them your action and your verbal criticism will seem inconsistent, but it will be by your deeds and not by your words that you will be judged. The nation will hold you responsible for the Home Rule Bill and all its consequences. Far stronger is the position of those who can say. "We never agreed to open the door at all. We held the door until it was forced open by superior weight of Peers specially created for that purpose. Here they are; you know the circumstances under which they were created and how they forced the safeguard which we put in on behalf of the electorate."<lb/>
It seems to me that to yield to the mere threat of creating Peers forms a most dangerous precedent, especially at a moment when we are making new chapters in our Constitutional history with a reckless rapidity. The same threat ran be brought into play whenever required. Once the Upper Chamber has yielded to threats it will always have to yield. This is a procedure hitherto unknown in Parliamentary practice. We know it in private affairs as "blackmail," and it is fatal to yield to blackmail. The moment the threat is produced, by precedent established, the Upper House would say, "We are no longer free agents. We are absolved from all future responsibility." The country will have no use for a Second Chamber of that kind.<lb/>
It is said that the House of Lords has still considerable powers left. There is the two years power of delay, in practice eighteen months. This shred of delay can be further diminished by the majority of the House of Commons whenever they wish to do so, and without any appeal to the electorate. Of course, from the Party point of view this cuts both ways&#x2014;by the same method a Unionist majority in the House of Commons could always override a Radical Socialist majority in the House of Lords. I see no advantage for the country in this two years delay except on the chance of something unexpected turning up. On the other hand, if the House
<col>942</col>
exercises this power, the act can be easily turned to its disadvantage so long as the balance of Parties remains unadjusted by any considerable addition of Liberal Peers. If you yield to the threat of the Government to create Peers, crying out that you are no longer free agents, it is true you may defer for the moment the swamping of the House of Lords. But what security have you got that the swamping will not be carried out the moment it is to the advantage of the Government to do so?<lb/>
Certain noble Lords on this side of the House have written to the public Press to announce their intention of voting for the deletion of the Amendment. They are prepared to throw to the winds every principle of Unionist policy, apparently in the fond hope of avoiding&#x2014;I presume permanently avoiding&#x2014;the wholesale creation of Peers. I trust they will explain to us the security upon which they rely against the contingency of the Government creating any number of Peers when it happens to be convenient instead of inconvenient for them to do so. It is useless to try and defer the Constitutional crisis when it is upon us. Much better meet it now. Let the Peers be actually created. Let that creation advertise to the whole Empire the violence, done to our Constitution, and that at a moment when half the country are already opposed to this revolution. The Parliament Bill must have far-reaching results. It seems to me impossible for the Unionist Party to dissociate itself from these results by a policy of consent, even if it is accompanied by a dignified protest. Your consent to the deletion of the Amendment which you have so solemnly and emphatically declared vital to the safety of the country will always be remembered and used against you&#x2014;your protest will be forgotten tomorrow.<lb/>
I desire to see the re-establishment of double-Chamber government. The first step towards that reconstruction is to unmask to the nation the true nature of the Parliament Bill, and to show the electorate that despotic single Chamber rule has been set up by an act of violence to the Constitution without any parallel in our history. But if the country is to learn the lesson it can only be taught by an act of violence. It will never learn it from a threat of violence which this House is perfectly free either to obey or to defy.
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0476"/>
<col>943</col>
I do not believe that our supporters in the country will understand that we are no longer free agents because of a threat which has never been put in execution. I do not myself understand where this coercion comes in. It is not there. It is only anticipated. I cannot believe that the supporters of double Chamber government will be roused to enthusiasm by the well-known policy, of which I think they are getting a little tired, of waiting for something to turn up, even though that policy is accompanied by an intimation that if ever by some lucky chance the Unionist Party returns to power we will then repeal the Parliament Bill which we have, under protest, consented to pass.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02378"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I desire to associate myself with the observations of Lord Salisbury concerning the attitude which I and other noble Lords with whom I have the honour to act feel bound to take towards the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne. Our attitude is not one of disloyalty to Lord Lansdowne but an attitude of conviction on our part. On this occasion we feel it our duty to differ from the advice which the noble Marquess has given to us, but we still retain, and shall always retain unimpaired, our feelings of loyalty and devotion to him. My noble friend Lord Salisbury has been a colleague of the noble Marquess for many years, and therefore it is easier for him to make his views known on an occasion like this. I had the good fortune in past years to be an underling of a Government, and had to obey the word of command given to me. Therefore your Lordships will realise that it is all the more difficult on the present occasion to find myself differing from one whom I have always regarded as my chief.<lb/>
At the last General Election other noble Lords as well as myself took an active part. I think we all got plenty of kicks. I am not sure that my share was not rather a greater one than that of many other noble Lords. But what statement did we then make? Shortly, we declared that this Bill which is now before the House was a revolutionary measure involving single-Chamber government. We asserted that the Bill was fundamentally bad and reduced the position of this House to that of a third-rate debating society. We asserted also that the liberties
<col>944</col>
and rights of British subjects were not protected under the Parliament Bill. I propose to support my views by my action. My attitude towards this Bill is one of unchangeable hostility. The Bill is pregnant with&#x2014;I am anxious to get the correct phrase&#x2014;it is tainted with every political vice. It is a phrase of Lord Curzon's, and I do not think I could possibly quote a better one. We accepted the Amendments of the noble Marquess because we believed that they were the maximum which we could possibly concede. We were fortified by the words of the noble Marquess at the Committee stage, words full of force and full of vigour. Now we are advised not to insist upon our Amendments because the country has declared in favour of the Parliament Bill. But we have been reminded over and over again that the Amendments safeguarded the people of the country by providing that measures must be submitted and approved before being passed. Moreover, this House has in itself a right to self-protection and no amount of decision by the British public can necessarily dissolve it. Lord Ellenborough once said&#x2014;
<quote>"Each branch has an inherent right to self-protection against injuries offered to the aggregate body."</quote>
You are offering injuries to the aggregate body which might prevent the full exercise of their Parliamentary functions. I have a profound respect for the views of the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack, but, at the same time, if I had to choose between his view and that of Lord Ellenborough, I would prefer the latter.<lb/>
We know that the majority which the Government possess to-day in the country is rather a slender one&#x2014;53 per cent. as against 47 per cent. of the electors who voted in the United Kingdom. Are you sure, if these Amendments were thoroughly understood by the electors and they had an opportunity of voting upon them now, that that majority might not be considerably reduced? What is the position? How do we stand? We have given up everything in the Parliament Bill, except the one principle of the right of the people to be consulted on issues of great gravity.

What happened a few years ago? The Norwegians decided by a popular vote that they would prefer to have a King rather than a Republic. Natal decided by a popular vote that she would like to come into the South African Confederation. And you yourselves refused to recognise the Republic in Portugal until the people had decided by a popular vote in favour of that <i>r&#x00E9;gime.</i> Yet to-day, in defiance of your practice in international relations, you refuse to allow your own countrymen to exercise their judgment upon a measure which you insist upon passing without it being referred to them.<lb/>
We are advised not to insist on these Amendments. The noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, has explained the misfortunes that would fall upon this House if the threatened creation of Peers was made and said he was haunted by the spectacle of what the countries of Europe would think. We have been told that we must justify our vote to-morrow, and no doubt we shall be severely criticised for our action and for the decision which I and many others have arrived at. But I contend that it is better that it should be said that noble Lords opposed the Bill with the intention to reverse it, than that it should be said they had fought the Bill and did not vote against it, though at some future date they meant to
<col>946</col>
reverse it. If there is any odium to arise out of this measure&#x2014;and there will be plenty of it in the future&#x2014;let it fall upon the shoulders of the Government. Let them bear the full weight of it. Let us have our hands perfectly clean. Let the Government bear their full share of the disapproval and the contumely which I feel sure at no distant date will fall upon their heads. To-night the only method left to us to demonstrate to the country the determination of the Government to destroy altogether the powers which this House possesses is to vote against this Bill. The electors have stood by the House of Lords in the past, and surely the time has arrived when we must stand by them.<lb/>
We have been told of the creation of Peers. I confess I think a moderate election of Peers might afford a great source of strength to this House. But according to what was said by Mr. Churchill in the other House and the statement made last night by the noble Marquess the Leader of this House it is the intention of His Majesty's Government to create a very large number of Peers&#x2014;from 100 to 500; the specific number has not been mentioned. I believe that the Government will find the greatest difficulty in keeping in cheek 500 independent Liberal Peers, especially when they will be asked to contribute, as undoubtedly they will be, to extra taxation in order to find sufficient funds to run the Administration of Mr. Redmond in Ireland, which will be independent of British control. For my part I do not envy the position of the noble Viscount in the course of the next six or seven months, when he has to shepherd this miscellaneous horde and be quite sure that he gets them into the right Lobby. Supposing these Peers are made, what will be the effect upon that outside pressure which to-day welds and keeps together the coalition in the House of Commons, that pressure which is helped by the fact of this House having a Tory majority? I cannot but feel that if the present state of things was altered by the creation of Peers the coalition would break up. We know that the Home Rule Bill which is going to be introduced next year will be "gagged" and "kangarooed" in the House of Commons, and that the real debates, presuming the noble Viscount has his Peers made, would take place in this House. The centre of interest would shift from a House where no free discussion is any
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0478"/>
<col>947</col>
longer permitted to this House, where there would be open and free discussion. The numbers would be evenly divided, and, as we already know, the mere suggestion that in a debate in this House the numbers will be on a close equality has been a source of profound interest to the Press, and the votes of noble Lords have been convassed for the last fortnight or three weeks.<lb/>
But, after all, the important point is surely this. We have been told that this Parliament Bill&#x2014;we were told so by our Leader, Mr. Balfour&#x2014;is really single-Chamber government. If this is single-Chamber government, surely the argument as to the importance of not allowing the Liberal Party to possess a majority in this House completely falls to the ground. I confess I am much impressed by the position taken up by the Irish Unionist Members in the House of Commons. What have they said? What is the message which they have sent to noble Lords in this House? They have begged us to stand by our Amendments even at the cost of the creation of Peers. I have profound respect for and belief in the judgment of men like Sir Edward Carson, because they know that strong, resolute, action is worth a great deal more than the trumpery, miserable two years which is put into this Bill; and in this connection may I remind your Lordships that the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition told us some two months ago that under his proposals two-thirds of your Lordships would be excluded. The noble Viscount and the noble Marquess opposite told us last night that we might look forward to the possible accession of 500 Peers. I confess&#x2014;and I want to be perfectly frank on this point&#x2014;that as between the alternatives of a purge and a reinforcement&#x2014;I hope your Lordships will not be shocked&#x2014;I am in favour of reinforcement.<lb/>
Let us look briefly at the reverse side of the picture. What is our position if we do not vote for the measure? In my humble opinion acquiescence&#x2014;not voting for the measure&#x2014;means the acceptance of the measure. I know that the noble Marquess and others deny that, but it is so and I will tell you why. What is the chief feature of this Parliament Bill? I think this point is a vital one, and it justifies the position I have taken up in this1 matter as much as any other. What
<col>948</col>
is the vital point? It is the power of negotiation and delay. Now how will an astute, cunning, and not over-scrupulous Minister use this power, and what position shall we stand in to the House of Commons in respect to this power? I am sure that His Majesty's Ministers will proceed on the principle of political pressure. I do not use the word "blackmail," although I gather that it is a perfectly Parliamentary phrase on the ruling of the Speaker last night. I prefer to call it political pressure. His Majesty's Ministers will exercise political pressure. What they will do is this. They will have two Home Rule Bills, or rather a double-barrelled Home Rule Bill. The more extreme Bill will be introduced into the House of Commons and passed there by the closure and the gag, and then it will be presented to your Lordships' House, and the noble Marquess or any other noble Lord will be told that the Government are prepared to accept from the Leader of the Opposition some Amendment which may safeguard the position of Ulster. But they will say this&#x2014;We will only guarantee to accept this provided you are prepared to pass the Home Rule Bill in the year 1912. Now observe the difficult position in which we shall be placed. Of course, Radical opinion will be on the side of compromise. Moderate opinion in this country may equally be on the side of compromise. Our own Press has been urging us to recognise the necessity of bowing to the inevitable&#x2014;who knows that our own Press will not advocate a compromise a year hence on the matter of Home Rule? Colonial opinion may be in favour of compromise, and probably American opinion as well. But if it were even suggested that your Lordships should compromise on a Home Rule Bill next year you will have given this Parliament Bill a double endorsement, not only by acquiescing in its passage at the present time, but by effectively employing the powers given you under the terms of the Parliament Bill. Yet I am told by noble Lords this evening that they mean to repeal the Parliament Bill at some subsequent date.<lb/>
But supposing&#x2014;and this is, I think, the more reasonable supposition&#x2014;that the noble Marquess advises us to be consistent and reject the Home Rule Bill? Surely then we shall lay ourselves open to this charge, a charge which will be driven home with terrific force by all the un scrupulous speakers on Radical platforms,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0479"/>
<col>949</col>
that your Lordships gave way when the exclusiveness of your order was menaced, but that you adhered to your prejudiced obstruction to a measure when the welfare of Ulster was at stake. I feel that we shall be driven on to very dangerous ground in the future. I foresee that the ground will be a kind of morass, and I hesitate to be pushed on to it.<lb/>
I confess that, having listened to this debate with the greatest care and to all the observations which have fallen from the noble Marquess, from Lord St. Aldwyn&#x2014;who counselled Party loyalty, which I must say did not impress me very much&#x2014;and from others, I feel that the decision we have to make is this. We have to be true to ourselves, true to the people whom we faced at the last election, and, above all, true to the people of England whose trustees we are.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02385"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like my noble friend who has just sat down I also have listened with great attention to this debate, and I have come to the conclusion that it is infinitely the most interesting debate to which I have listened since I have been a Member of this House. It is interesting to me for a double reason. It is the first instance within my recollection in which there is some uncertainty as to what will be the result of a Division in this House. The second reason why I feel it doubly interesting is that for the first time in my experience I have realised that my vote is a valuable asset, and that if I were of an unscrupulous disposition I might, so to speak, make something out of it. I observe that this truth has dawned upon other noble Lords besides myself, because I noticed with interest that quite a considerable number of noble Lords appeared yesterday or the day before and took the oath, presumably with the intention of taking part in the Division. Therefore we may arrive at this curious and remarkable result, that one of the most important decisions ever taken by this House may possibly be influenced and decided by the votes of noble Lords who put in a fleeting and intermittent appearance in this place, possibly not more than once or twice in the course of a Parliament. And I might add that it would be difficult to find a more convincing argument in favour of the view that some radical changes in this Assembly are absolutely necessary.<lb/>
<col>950</col>
But, my Lords, there is another point with regard to which this debate is equally remarkable. I think nobody is likely in future to bring against this House as at present constituted the charge that it is not independent. Independence is a fairly common phenomenon in this House. It manifests itself as a rule on the Back Benches and on the Back Benches alone; but on this particular occasion it has invaded higher quarters. Independence has shown itself upon the Front Bench, and even noble Lords who are habitually&#x2014;and this is the really humorous feature in the proceedings&#x2014;the obedient minions of the official Front Bench are on this occasion, some of them, engaged in a more or less active campaign against their official chiefs; and as we are all aware, there is, to put it mildly, a very marked difference of opinion on this subject amongst the illustrious occupants of the Front Bench themselves. This remarkable difference of opinion cannot be altogether explained away by those expressions of profound esteem for one another with which we have been regaled to-night.<lb/>
To me these expressions of mutual esteem and affection are rather beside the point. As military metaphors are so much in vogue, I will say that I rather look upon it in this sort of light&#x2014;as if a general were to call his principal officers together on the eve of a most important, if not fatal, engagement and to give them his orders; and those officers were to reply, "Sir, we have the most profound admiration for your character; we respect you as a man, as a husband, and as a father, but as regards your orders we propose to act in a precisely different direction." In this fratricidal struggle I confess I felt slightly perplexed myself. My natural inclination would have carried me into the camp of the noble and learned Earl, Lord Halsbury. Many of my intimate friends are associated with him, noble Lords who are not only personal friends of mine but with whom it has been a pleasure for me to act in conjunction, and I recognise at once that theirs is the really attractive part. They in this drama monopolise what the French call the <i>beau r&#x00F4;le.</i> They are able to appear as the resolute and inflexible champions of what I am afraid at this moment is a falling cause. It is only natural that theirs should be the popular attitude. Is there anything whatever
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0480"/>
<col>951</col>
surprising about it? Third parties and the persons who are not likely to be involved in it are always in favour of a fight. You may observe this phenomenon every day in the course of an ordinary street fight. If there are two boys who are about to embark on a fight, what do the spectators do? Do they endeavour to restrain them? Do they offer them kindly words of advice? Nothing of the sort. They give the same advice impartially to both, "Go in and win." That is the advice which naturally anybody would get from their supporters in the country at this moment; but there is no chance of winning from what I have been able to observe. The appearance of showing fight always inspires admiration in third parties, but in the present case, as I think has been admitted by previous speakers in the debate, there is not the slightest ground for maintaining that one party in this contest is more courageous than the other. What is the true test of courage in politics? To my mind the obvious test of courage in politics is readiness to face an election, and if my noble friends with whom unfortunately I disagree at the present moment were ready to face an election I should certainly respect their courage, though at the same time I do not think I should feel very much respect for their judgment. But as a matter of fact, although I do not wish to say anything to which they may object, the attitude which they have taken up was not adopted until an election was out of the question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02386"><member>LORD WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE</member><membercontribution>: So far as I am concerned I beg to state that that remark does not apply to me or to Lord Selborne or to Lord Salisbury.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02387"><member>LORD NEWTON</member><membercontribution>: Possibly not, but I am content to fix it on a question of dates, and my noble friend can work it out with the Press to-morrow. Why, holding the opinions which they do about the Bill, they failed to divide against the Second Reading is a thing which passes my understanding. Personally I must admit&#x2014;I admit it with a certain amount of shame&#x2014;that I regard this Bill from a totally different standpoint. I dislike it as much as my noble friends do. I honestly consider that a Government has never more grossly abused its powers than in this particular case, and that never was the remedy for an alleged grievance so absolutely disproportionate as what is pro-
<col>952</col>
posed at the present time. But where I differ from my noble friends is that, much as I hate this Bill, I have always considered from the very start that there was no possibility of preventing its passing in some form or other. I do not think my noble friends realise altogether what I have realised with a considerable amount of pain&#x2014;that is that, say what you will, you cannot ignore the result of the past elections. It is not the slightest use pretending that the last election did not turn upon this particular question, and surely everybody here must have realised that fact by having consented to vote for the Second Reading of the Bill.<lb/>
The obvious moral, it seems to me, of the recent elections, which you really cannot possibly ignore, is that, even if the voter was not enthusiastically in favour of the Bill, he was apathetic and looked upon the quarrel as one between politicians with which he had no particular concern, and was content to leave it to be fought out between them. And this is the result of the beneficent influence of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has effectually taught the voter to think about nothing except what concerns his own pocket. It was first of all the result of the elections which convinced me that the passage of this Bill in some form or other was inevitable. The second consideration which affects me is the size of the Government's majority, and the fact that, however the Government may behave and whatever they do, we are unfortunately unable to make any impression upon it. It was once remarked by a French general that you could do everything with bayonets except sit upon them. I do not think that some of my noble friends in this House realise that with an enormous majority in the House of Commons you can do anything in this country except satisfy your political opponents; and if you can find a Minister who is sufficiently vindictive, sufficiently determined, and sufficiently unscrupulous, it is within his power to coerce everybody in this country from the lowest to the very highest in the land.<lb/>
If the Government, as I contend, have the power to enforce their will whether it be right or wrong, does not the question upon which we are going to vote resolve itself into one purely of sentiment and common sense? Sentiment says, "Let us die like gentlemen in the last ditch; let us hamstring ourselves; let us, if necessary, commit suicide"&#x2014;for the purpose
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0481"/>
<col>953</col>
of annoying our opponents. I rather think the practice prevails in China, when an individual has a grievance against a man who has ill-used him, of going and committing suicide upon his doorstep, and that seems to me to typify the attitude which some of my noble friends are prepared to take towards the Government. Whether the fact of committing suicide upon the doorstep of a person who has illtreated you really inconveniences that person I feel some considerable doubt, and as to whether the course adopted by my noble friends will injure or annoy the Government I feel still greater doubts. Sentiment says, "Let us force them to create their 400 or 500 Peers, whatever the number may be. Ridicule will kill them." Well, will it? I am not so sure about it. It seems to me highly probable that we shall have the ridicule and that the Government will have the Peers.<lb/>
I would like to ask quite impartially, Is there any particular reason why there should be much greater ridicule attaching to the prospective noblemen who are going to adorn this Chamber than to those who have recently accepted Peerages at the hands of His Majesty's Government? Will they be any more ridiculous than those noble Lords recently ennobled who can only be induced to vote for the Bill in order to prevent what I suppose they would call the pollution of their order? Surely the circumstances are fairly plain up to now. The assumption of my noble friends, with whom I have disagreed all along, is that the Government have been, to use their language, "bluffing all the time." I should like to believe that that is the case, but I really do not see that there is any necessity for it, because it does not seem to me that there is the smallest difficulty of any kind to prevent them carrying out their proposals if they want to do so. All that the Government have to do is to issue a circular saying that 500 respectable Radicals are wanted for the purpose of carrying out a particular job; that intelligence is not so much a requisite as absolute political docility; that it is thought desirable that preference should be accorded, say, to pro-Boers, and to passive resisters, and to conscientious objectors; that everybody must produce a certificate of proficiency and soundness from Mr. Redmond and Mr. Keir Hardie; and that finally when they have completed their contract nothing will further be
<col>954</col>
required from them, and that the Government will have no further use for their services. Does any one believe that if such an invitation were addressed to the Liberal Party generally there would be anything but an enthusiastic response to it?<lb/>
I have already detained the House longer than I intended, but I should like to address a final appeal to my noble friends. They are under what I believe to be an entire delusion in thinking that this course is distasteful to the Government. I have no doubt that it is distasteful to noble Lords upon the Front Bench opposite, and I am quite sure that it is even more distasteful to the noble Lords who occupy the Benches behind them. But they do not constitute the Liberal Party. You have to consider the other portions of the Liberal Party, and for my part I feel absolutely convinced in my own mind that there is nothing that the more extreme section of the Liberal Party, there is nothing which the Socialists would hail with greater delight than the prospect of flooding this House with people created for this particular purpose. I would ask noble Lords for a moment to pay attention to these passages which I culled from two leading Liberal organs the other day. One I observe was written by Mr. Harold Spender and appeared in cither the <i>Daily Chronicle</i> or the <i>Morning Leader.</i> He observes this&#x2014;
<quote>"A large militant influx of young Liberals and Radicals of a quite different type from those Liberal absentees who have served their cause so poorly during the struggle&#x2014;"</quote>
rather unkind that to noble Lords opposite&#x2014;
<quote>"would make a startling change. For the next four years the effect would be tremendous."</quote>
I take another extract, this time from the <i>Daily News</i>&#x2014;
<quote>"From the purely Party point of view we regret it. We should have preferred to see a Liberal House of Lords which would clear this road for Liberal legislation and render impossible an unpatriotic policy of obstruction. We should have preferred to see the order which planned an outrage on the Constitution wrecked in social prestige as well as trimmed of political power. The next step&#x2014;theestablishment of a democratic Second Chamber&#x2014;would have become as simple as it is necessary."</quote>
I believe that these passages reflect absolutely accurately the view which is entertained by the extreme supporters of the Government, and I would urge with all respect upon my noble friends that they
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0482"/>
<col>955</col>
should pause and consider deeply before they take the fatal step.<lb/>
To my mind we are incurring the danger of again being led into a trap. I, in common with other members of the Party, was led into a trap not so very long ago, and I wish, if possible, to avoid it again. It seems to me that in taking the step contemplated by my noble friends they are playing into the hands, not perhaps of noble Lords opposite, but into the hands of the extreme members of their Party, and I should like to urge them, with all due respect&#x2014;and I am sincerely anxious not to offend any of their feelings&#x2014;again to pause before they take a step which affects not only the constitution of this House, but will most undoubtedly administer a greater shock to existing institutions in this country than they have hitherto been called upon to endure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02388"><sup>*</sup><member>THE LORD BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the few words which I shall address to the House I will deal with what seems to me to be the general character of the situation. As I see it, we are not called upon to pronounce <i>pro</i> or <i>con</i> on the conduct of His Majesty's Government. This House gave a large amount of time yesterday to that particular subject and pronounced a very emphatic verdict upon it. Many of us on this Bench who have not the happiness or the misfortune, whichever you call it, of being Party men felt that our proper place was outside that Division altogether. Nor do I think we are called upon to-night to pronounce <i>pro</i> or <i>con</i> upon the Parliament Bill and whether or not it ought to be passed, for the very plain reason that that issue has been clearly and unquestionably decided. The Parliament Bill must pass. The noble and learned Earl opposite said something about killing the Bill. If it is killed to-morrow, it will, I suppose, have a resurrection within a week. The Bill will undoubtedly pass.<lb/>
The decision, therefore, to which we are asked to come turns upon the question how the House should comport itself in what we are all agreed is one of the most critical moments in its long history. In facing that issue every one of us must ask what is the opinion, the sober and enduring opinion, of the country on the matter. Those who follow the noble and learned Earl speak much of the effect of the course
<col>956</col>
which they propose upon opinion in the country, and I think they consider that what they suggest would have two effects&#x2014;it would advertise and it would arouse. It would advertise something which is not at present understood, and it would arouse feelings which are, unfortunately, all too languid. About the advertisement I have a certain amount of scepticism. It is a rather slender argument by which to support so momentous a course as that which they suggest. I ask whether those noble Lords are sure that public opinion, being apparently languid, apathetic, and imperfectly informed, even after all that has been said and written, will be roused by the appeals now made. I cannot help feeling very doubtful indeed whether this proposal, so objectionable I think in other ways, will act successfully as an advertisement, and I hope before I sit down to show some reason why I think it may have a very opposite effect from that which noble Lords desire.<lb/>
That the course proposed will rouse feeling I quite agree. We have seen that already. Both Parties are doing to some extent the same thing. I think that His Majesty's Government in the line which they have taken in this House of pushing through their own measure&#x2014;without any willingness to come to terms upon it and without any readiness to meet Amendments, have been doing exactly what noble Lords opposite are doing&#x2014;playing to keep up the spirit of their Party and trying to concentrate and give effect to the support that is behind them. But I am sure a House like this ought not to ask itself what effect such and such a course would have on this and that Party, but ought to think largely and broadly of the effect it would have on the mind of the nation. Cynics may say there is no such thing as a nation, and it is said that there are about a dozen public opinions. I think that all true political wisdom depends on the belief that there is a nation to which you can appeal, and that it has a judgment, a slow, lumbering, inefficient, hesitating judgment if you like, but still a judgment of some sort.<lb/>
May I try for an instant to indicate what seems to me would be the attitude of a large part of the nation which has been characterised by such unfavourable epithets as apathetic and so forth. What is the attitude of that part of the nation which might have unseated the present
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0483"/>
<col>957</col>
Government at the last election but declined or failed to do so? I rather think that the average attitude of a large part of the nation is somewhat of the following kind. They think that the time has come when the powers of this House cannot be maintained as they have been without considerable change, that the present condition of things has become intolerable, and that it is reasonable that a Liberal Government supported by a majority in the House of Commons should be able, after reasonable delay, to carry their measures into law. Further, I think the country feels that at the time of the rejection of the Budget a challenge was given by this House to the people, a claim for a larger amount of power; that this challenge led to defeat, and that those who were defeated cannot complain if they suffer. Under these circumstances, the country is not, I think, disposed to look very narrowly at the measures by which the present Liberal Government proposed to achieve their purpose. So, again, when matters come to the last pinch I think the people would say, "You have come to a deadlock, and some solution must be found"; and therefore they are apathetic about the creation of Peers. I cannot leave that point without saying how deeply I regret that the last resources of the Constitution were put into operation so long before there was anything that could be called a crisis, and that, there was brought to bear upon the King pressure which I think will be very widely regretted. Now with the country in this state of mind it seems to me as plain as daylight that this House is in this position, that it can do nothing to-day but it may do a great deal in the years to come. It has two things to do; it has a case to put before the nation, and it has to retain the respect and confidence of the nation in order to avoid anything like that sort of feeling towards this House which would hinder the case from being reasonably considered in the long run. Apart from Party exaggerations, it seems to me that this course is very much that which, under the leadership of the noble Marquess opposite, the majority of the House has in the main taken. This House cannot offer a root-and-branch opposition to the Bill, which received some kind of general sanction at the General Election. Therefore there was no Division on the Second Reading; but in a long course of vigorous and able debate in this House defects in the Bill were laid bare and remedies for those defects were suggested. Having done that,
<col>958</col>
has not this House done all that for the moment it can do? We have come to the point at which resistance is impossible, and we have to acknowledge with dignity that that is so and to wait for that reaction which you will have done a great deal to help and nothing to hinder.<lb/>
I am quite sure that members of the Government themselves must feel that there is a tremendous case against the Bill. As it stands it is a most lop-sided and crude Constitution which it gives to us. There is surely a very great case which this House represents. I do not like to hear noble Lords opposite talk of the reversal of this measure. Surely it is not reversal which will be asked for, but the supplementing and the combining with it of things which will give the position an altogether different character. The case for a Second Chamber of some sort has nine-tenths of the political wisdom of recent times behind it, and it must be a Chamber which can check and bring into force the judgment of the nation. Noble Lords opposite have got a great and valuable case for which they hold the trusteeship, but there are only two ways in which that case can be brought home to the people. One is by way of patient and long-continued education, by debate and discussion, and the rest; the other is by painful experience of the action of an unrestrained House of Commons. As the noble Marquess has so wisely said, if the House of Lords, which is not too popular a body, is to have any chance of bringing it home to the people in the years that are coming, it must not throw away its credentials, it must not let its reputation for political sagacity be changed into a reputation for party violence.<lb/>
Shall I speak too boldly if I say that there are two characters in which this House may appear before the country? It may appear as a Chamber which contains some of the nation's best, wisest, and most experienced men, in touch with the people's mind and contributing to their welfare. Such a Chamber is, I think we shall all agree, one of the most precious possessions of a democratic Constitution. But the House may appear before the country in quite, another capacity. It may appear as a Chamber out of touch with the popular life, aloof from the people, defiant or reckless of popular opinion, and consulting only its own order and conventions. If so, it will appear as a Chamber for which
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0484"/>
<col>959</col>
a democratic country has no use at all. It is just at that point that the issue to-night and to-morrow is so grave. We have heard a great deal about courage and intrepidity. Intrepidity is a great military as it is a great political virtue. When we hear that "the old Guard die but never surrender," it always stirs our blood. But surely that is not the last word of wisdom even in war, and certainly not in politics. There are great captains who are not Prince Ruperts; and surely there is such a thing as political wisdom which means a power not merely to enforce with zeal and emphasis your own opinions but to take stock of the situation. It is a great mistake to confound tactics with strategy and to forget that it is by strategy and not by tactics that in the end a cause prevails.<lb/>
I cannot face what will be the effect on the nation, and on those great industrial constituencies to which both Parties appeal, if it appears on Friday morning that this House, by a Division in which perhaps only a third part of the members of the House take part, had decided, not only against the Government but also against the wisdom and the experience of the most trusted leader on the Bench opposite, to cast the Parliament Bill into the ditch. I really cannot face the mixture of indignation and contempt with which that course would be very rightly regarded in the country. Nor is that all. People will say that this House has gone head downwards towards bringing a political catastrophe which a few years ago we talked of as a 'Gilbertian' impossibility. I am astonished at the levity with which this matter has been treated by some noble Lords on the other side of the House. It is said that it does not matter if the House is swamped by 500 Peers because the other Party when they come in can perform a similar operation. That seems to me unworthy. It is things of this kind which I fear will draw upon us so much condemnation and contempt. Therefore feeling as I do I shall give my vote, not for the Bill, but for the Motion that this House do not insist upon the Amendments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02389"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD AMPTHILL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is, to say the least of it, surprising that the right rev. Prelate should base his course of action on a somewhat incorrect, if I may venture to say so, and misleading use of military metaphor. I certainly should have thought
<col>960</col>
that he would have adopted a different guide for his opinions. But in regard to what he has said I will only say this, that I regret deeply that he has taken the line which he has indicated, and that it is indeed painful that we, who are so entirely agreed as to the objects to be aimed at by Members of this House in discharging their high duty and responsibility, should be so much at variance as to the precise way in which that duty should be fulfilled.<lb/>
I wish to say a few words in reply to my noble friend Lord Newton, who I regret to see is not now in the House. Having delivered himself of his carefully prepared oration, he has no doubt retired to well-earned rest and refreshment. We all of us welcome the intervention of the noble Lord in our debates. I venture to say that even those whom he attacks welcome the relief which he brings to the gravity of our discussions just as much as those whose cause he is supporting. But I should like to tell him this, that on this occasion and in regard to this question we&#x2014;that is to say, those with whom I am acting at this moment&#x2014;do not treat the matter as a huge joke as he appears to do. I wish to say, further, that he has no right whatever to guess at the reasons which actuate us, for he knows nothing about them. Nor has he any right to impute to us motives for our conduct. The whole burden of his speech was a suggestion that we were aiming at cheap popularity by an exhibition of cheap valour. I think that was an ungenerous and utterly unwarranted suggestion, and although I will not take him too seriously or follow him into all his arguments, I am bound to say that I thought the most unfair thing which he stated in the course of his speech was that the attitude which we have taken up was not adopted until there was no question of a General Election. That is not true, and that statement was not fair.<lb/>
Then the noble Lord asked us why we did not vote against the Second Reading of the Bill. If he does not know, I will tell him. The reason is perfectly simple and straightforward. We thought it our patriotic duty to exhaust every possible effort, to use every possible opportunity of arriving at a national settlement of this great problem. We thought that we should be neglecting out duty if we did not try, however hopeless it might seem to be, up to the very last moment to persuade His Majesty's Government to agree to some compromise which
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0485"/>
<col>961</col>
would be more or less acceptable to all Parties. That is why we voted for the Second Reading of the Bill&#x2014;in order that the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition might make his proposals for I that compromise. The noble Lord expressed fear that we might be playing into the hands of our political opponents and fall into a trap. That may be his opinion; but we think&#x2014;and, what is more, we are justified in our opinion by what has actually occurred&#x2014;that we have saved him and those who think with him from falling into a trap. If we had given way a fortnight ago and the Parliament Bill was already on the Statute Book, can anybody doubt that those political opponents of ours who are offering us their hypocritical advice to admit that we are beaten and to give way&#x2014;can anybody doubt that these very men would be using the fact of our surrender to pour further derision and contempt upon us, to hold us up again for fresh reasons to the odium and hatred of the country in order to further their next designs?<lb/>
We have been so persistently misrepresented that we must persistently explain our attitude, and I make no apology for attempting to do so again. The motives which actuate us&#x2014;that is to say, those who follow the noble and learned Earl, Lord Halsbury&#x2014;are not motives of Party expediency but motives of principle. Rightly or wrongly, we regard it as our duty to do that which is dictated to us by our own sense of conduct and honour. We endorse the maxim which was put forward by the most rev. Prelate the Archbishop of York, who said that on this question each man's conscience is the only judge whose verdict he ought to accept. We regard this Parliament Bill as a crime. We regard the whole manner and method in which it has been promoted as the gravest political outrage that has ever been perpetrated short of bloodshed, and we regard the objects of the Bill as utterly corrupt. That being so, we say we cannot stand by and see this crime perpetrated, this outrage continued, with out offering resistance even though our resistance be entirely hopeless.<lb/>
You may call us fools, if you like; not to regard the consequences, or what you believe, possibly with too great confidence, will be the consequences. But similarly you might designate as a fool the man who rushes in to resist an outrage which is being perpetrated in the street by two or three
<col>962</col>
miscreants. The action of such a man, even though he be overpowered and personally injured, may have the effect of delaying the final consummation of the crime until the arrival of assistance. Similarly you may designate as a fool a man who goes to Court to protect his honour even though the expense should bring about his ruin. That man, if he has defended his honour, has a greater satisfaction in the years that come hereafter, even though he be broken and impoverished, than if he had neglected that duty. You may designate as a fool the woman who attempts to hold the armed burglar who has broken into her house. Her cries may possibly bring the police, and if the ruffian is then brought to justice other people will be saved from outrage at his hands. I use these analogies in order purposely to avoid the military metaphors which we all agree are so misleading. The only military metaphor which I have seen which seems to me at all applicable to the circumstances was that which was so aptly used by the noble and gallant Field-Marshal who sits on the Cross Benches. Such persons as I have indicated are not fools in the eyes of all people; nor are we fools in the eyes of a great number of our fellow-countrymen. The consequences of our action may be, and probably will be, disagreeable to us so long as we live; but the consequenees of refraining from that action will in our view be even more disagreeable.<lb/>
The fact is that whatever we do we cannot avoid disagreeable consequences. We cannot protect the King from outrage because that outrage has already been perpetrated. His Majesty has been forced, in circumstances on which I need not dwell and in a most improper manner, to give this pledge. We cannot prevent the humiliation of this House, because that has already been brought about by the mere threat to create "Puppet" Peers. We can not preserve the powers of this Chamber, because the moment this Bill is put on the Statute Book those powers are gone, and, in accordance with the showing of every speaker on this side of the House, we shall have single-Chamber government. The harm is done, and nothing we can do or abstain from doing can possibly repair or prevent that harm at the present stage; and our only feeling in regard to this matter is that if we do not exercise the power of voting which still remains to us we
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0486"/>
<col>963</col>
shall feel hereafter that we have neglected what, rightly or wrongly, we regard to be our duty at the present time. We do not claim to be courageous or heroic, or anything of the kind. We have not called ourselves Last Ditchers, or Die Hards, or any of those names which are given to us by the Press. We cannot help what the Press says about us. I say we do not claim these qualities, and still less do we attribute lack of those qualities to those who do not agree with us. I challenge any one to point to any occasion on which responsible men amongst us have attributed lack of courage or any other defect of character to those with whom, unhappily, we are not in agreement at the present time. We are only deeply sorry that their conception of our duty at this moment differs from ours.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Newton, cast doubts on our sincerity in this matter. He did not believe that it was any matter of pain or regret to us to sever our association for the moment from our political leaders. I dare say it is difficult for him to realise that feeling, for he himself has never acknowledged any leadership, but let me assure him that that pain is very real, and very deep and very sincere on the part of every one of us. Our leaders told us that without the safeguards which they proposed to put into the Bill nothing in this country would be safe&#x2014;neither the King nor the Constitution, nor our political liberties. We were convinced that our leaders were right. Then our leaders told us that we ought to insist on the safeguards as long as we are free agents. Again we agreed with them; and we regard ourselves as free agents so long as we have the power to give a vote in this House. It is urged that we ought to give way because it is impossible for the Government to give way. I cannot accept that view. The Government tell us that their policy has been consistent. I do not deny it; but I am bound to say I cannot see in what way they can claim credit for that. Certainly there has been a consistent refusal to entertain any national or patriotic solution of this problem, the existence of which we all admit. There has been a consistent misrepresentation of the problem to the people of this country. There has been consistency there. There has been a consistent refusal to tackle that reform of this House which the Radical Party themselves have said to be necessary and have said to be at the very root of the evil. There has
<col>964</col>
been a consistent determination to pay for the Irish votes which keep the Government in power by bringing in Home Rule behind the backs of the people. So far the Government have every right to claim that they have been consistent, but I utterly deny that it is in any way creditable to them.<lb/>
And then the Government tell us that they have no alternative. They say the whole matter rests in our hands. Just as well, as the noble and learned Earl pointed out, might a criminal say he had no alternative but to carry out his crime. From the point of view of the Government that may be true. When the directors of a commercial company have adopted questionable methods of finance or of trade, perhaps to gratify the cupidity of the shareholders, they have no alternative but to go on with their trickery unless they wish to make a clean breast of it. But that is no reason why shareholders who object to those questionable methods should refrain from protest, even though it might lead to a showing up of the methods of the directors and possibly to injury to all concerned. In making their protests they are acting in the best interests of the shareholders. The Government had an alternative in the first instance. They had the alternative of adopting an honest, patriotic, and national solution of the Constitutional problem. They had the opportunity when they saw that your Lordships were willing to meet them more than half way in spite of all their anticipations to the contrary. No doubt it would have been less profitable to them to have adopted that course, and possibly, also, less welcome to their followers, who make no secret that their main object is to gratify their feelings of vindictiveness against this House.<lb/>
But sooner or later the people will learn that honesty is the best policy, not only as regards private and commercial concerns, but also, and more particularly, as regards the management of national concerns. Sooner or later, and Heaven grant that it may not be too late, the people of this country will find out that, so far from making their fortunes, this Bill will actually deprive them of their liberties and rob them of those very things which they value more than anything else in their political life. They will find out that the Royal Prerogative has been shamefully abused in order to deprive them of their own undoubted prerogative of deciding what our laws are to be; and then
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0487"/>
<col>965</col>
they will learn that this House has not been contending for any privileges of its own or for the personal rights and privileges of its members, but actually for the liberties of the people. Then they will recognise that we on this side of the House, whatever our views may be as to the actual methods to be pursued, have been fighting in very fact for King and Country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02390"><member>EARL RUSSELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just sat down is another member of the House of Russell, together with the noble Duke who resumed the debate after the dinner adjournment to-night&#x2014;a House that was at one time found on another side in the political arena. If I were to use what is nowadays the standard language of political controversy, I suppose I should hurl the word "traitor" across this House. Apparently the word "traitor" is now used to describe a person with whose political opinions you disagree at the moment. But I do not propose to use the strong language which has become customary. I should like, however, to examine for a moment some of the sentiments which the noble Lord who has just sat down has expressed. He stated that a time will come when the country will discover how it has been tricked and fooled by the proceedings of the Government, when it will discover how this Bill has put the people in a far worse position than they were ever in before, and has, in fact and in effect, deprived them of their liberties. If it were indeed the fact that this Bill deprived the people of their liberties, I should find myself in entire agreement with the noble Lord in hoping that that might be discovered at the earliest possible moment, and I should find myself in entire agreement with him in wishing to remedy it.<lb/>
The noble Lord said&#x2014;and it has been said over and over again&#x2014;that if we had shown ourselves reasonable and accommodating we had every opportunity on this side of politics for coming to an "honest, national, and patriotic" settlement. I have observed that those large words in the mouths of the Opposition generally mean a settlement favourable to themselves, and I think they must forgive politicians on this side if they are unwilling to interpret the only settlement as a national and patriotic one which is unfavourable to them and favourable to the Opposition. I was challenged by the noble Earl who opened the debate last
<col>966</col>
night on the Vote of Censure as to something I had said about the Parliament Bill having been before the electors at the last election word for word and line for line. I was asked if I had to set an examination paper in the details of that Bill, although it might be said to have been printed and in that sense to have been before the electors line by line, whether I supposed that many of the electors would receive a large number of marks? I do not suppose it; I do not suppose it in regard to any Bill, and that is one of the strongest reasons why a Referendum on a particular Bill containing a number of complicated clauses is about the worst conceivable way of obtaining the, opinion of the electorate. For the electorate to understand a Bill in detail would require a series of school-mastering lectures up and down the country; and although I should be very glad to see an electorate so highly educated, I think we must all agree that it will be many a year before we come to that stage, and that at present the electorate must deal with the broad facts of the situation so far as they can take them in.<lb/>
In this matter it is impossible to add anything to what the right rev. Prelate the Bishop of Winchester has just said. I think he described with remarkable accuracy the general impression in the country as to this matter. The country has succeeded, chiefly owing to the action of your Lordships' House, chiefly owing to the ill-judged action taken by this House, in being permeated with the impression that Liberals have not for a very long time had fair play, and the country has made up its mind that it is prepared to allow the Government to take such steps as they think fit to secure that Liberals when in office shall have fair play. Your Lordships cannot have failed to have noticed the amusing slip&#x2014;shall I call it?&#x2014;that was made by the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, when he was addressing us. After dwelling on the possibility of the creation of 400 or 500 Peers the noble Viscount said that he would not care, when he found himself again in office, to have Conservative measures obstructed, mutilated, and delayed by a House of Lords containing a Liberal majority. Liberals have suffered from such a state of things for generations, and it is not to be wondered at that they complain.<lb/>
We have come to-night to a situation of very great difficulty, a situation to
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0488"/>
<col>967</col>
which we never need have come if noble Lords in the Conservative Party had been willing to accept what I think all sane people regard as the verdict of the last General Election. According to the ordinary Constitutional traditions of this House, when a Government has a measure before the people and receives the confidence of the people for the purpose of passing that measure, the time has come for the majority in this House to give way. I am not without the greatest sympathy for&#x2014;I do not know what name is the least offensive&#x2014;I will say the revolting Peers on the other side. I am not quite sure that if I sat on the other side of the House I might not even be rash enough to find myself in their ranks. To have convictions and to be compelled by the ordinary Constitutional traditions of this House to suppress those convictions and avoid voting in support of them is extremely invidious and unpleasant, and I have strong sympathy with those noble Lords who feel a difficulty in doing so. But it is, and it has been for a great many years, the Constitutional tradition of this House that at some point or other it gives way to the will of the Commons and the will of the country, and the only possible excuse for not doing so is some sort of belief that if there were an appeal to the country the country would support you in the course you are taking. Now it is perfectly well known that the general opinion of noble Lords opposite and of their advisers is that they could not successfully appeal to the country against the policy of His Majesty's Government. It has been so stated in the most emphatic way in a leading article in <i>The Times. The Times</i> said&#x2014;
<quote>"No sane man can suppose that the Opposition could get a majority."</quote>
If that is admitted, why should resistance be prolonged to what is, according to our ordinary political rules, the will of the people?<lb/>
Again I find myself not without a good deal of sympathy with Lord Willoughby de Broke when he says that the phrase the "will of the people" is a phrase which is capable of being dissected. I admit that there are far fewer voters exercising the franchise in this country than I should like to see. But that is the present Constitutional method of ascertaining the will of the people, and if it is admitted that
<col>968</col>
the Opposition cannot go to the country with ally hope of success, that the proposals of His Majesty's Government hold the field, what is gained by pressing resistance to the point where the Constitution is strained? I think every one is prepared to admit that the weapon of using the Prerogative for the purpose of employs Peers is a weapon which no one creating except in the last resort, which no one employs unnecessarily, or willingly, or lightly; but if a Government which has the confidence of the House of Commons, which has the confidence of the country, finds itself still persistently thwarted by a House of Lords which is obstinate, reckless, unwilling to learn by experience, what other remedy is there left in the Constitution for bringing matters to an end? That, I venture to think, has been in this controversy very largely the position of your Lordships' House. Your Lordships' House has been unwilling to recognise the facts that have taken place.<lb/>
We have heard a great many taunts from the other side that the country is very apathetic about this question and does not care whether the Parliament Bill becomes law or not. I think that apparent apathy is susceptible of another explanation. The real explanation is that the country is convinced, and has been convinced ever since the last election, that the Parliament Bill will become and must become the law of this country; and I myself ant perfectly certain that if the country thought that the Parliament Bill would be impeded on its way to the Statute Book noble Lords opposite would have had as much effervescence as they would desire on the part of the people. Assumptions are made and expressions used in these debates as if the House of Lords before the Parliament Bill was heard of had been a House of co-ordinate jurisdiction and co-ordinate power with the House of Commons. Such a thing is not tenable for a moment. A Vote of Censure has this week been proposed in both Houses of Parliament. In the House of Commons the Government have been successful by a majority of 119; the Government have been beaten in this House by an enormous majority, but nobody cares a snap of the fingers.<lb/>
Is there no difference between the two Houses of Parliament even now, quite apart from the Parliament Bill? Is there
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0489"/>
<col>969</col>
no difference in their authority and in their powers? There is the greatest difference, and we know it has been the practice of this House to give way to legislation after a General Election and after it has clearly received the assent of the electors. The Liberal Party have said that they see no reason why that cumbrous process should be forced upon them in respect of all their measures, and this Bill is the result. What is to be gained by noble Lords opposite who, it is said, are going into the Lobby against the Government? They are going, it is said, to force the Government to give an example to the country that a revolution is actually in process by creating Peers. There will be an example given to the country, but I am not sure how the country will interpret that example. I suggest to this House that the country will think that noble Lords opposite, out of touch with popular feeling, in disregard of Parliamentary tradition, against the advice of their normal and respected leaders, have pushed opposition beyond the point to which opposition ought to be pushed and driven the Government to exercise powers the exercise of which is regretted by every One. I do not think that any benefit will accrue to the Opposition from that course; and, unpleasant as it is for noble Lords who have the technical and legal power to vote against the Government, I cannot but think that the course for this House is to let this Bill now pass.<lb/>
Noble Lords have before them an opportunity of obtaining, if they can, the confidence of the country. The noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, said the other day that he was a democrat, and he added that he and those who voted with him in this House really represent the liberties and the rights of the people. I am sure the noble Marquess believes that, but he has not succeeded in persuading the people to believe it; and until he does that it is no use for him to say that he and his friends are the true representatives of the people. On the whole, judging from the discussions that take place in the country, it looks as if the country was of opinion that the House of Lords and the present majority in the House of Lords had not on the whole been friendly to popular measures. Therefore I hope that when the issue comes this Bill may be successful Without the unfortunate event which we should all regret, and I hope that we shall
<col>970</col>
not have the campaign which was indicated in his speech before dinner by Lord Willoughby de Broke&#x2014;a campaign of delay, of resistance, and of obstruction. The incidents of such a campaign might be amusing, they might add a certain liveliness to our debates, but they would not conduce to the dignity of this House or to the carrying on of the government of the country. I hope the House will recognise the situation as it exists. The people to convert are the country at large and not until noble Lords opposite have the support of the country behind them are they entitled to say that the larger half of their countrymen are traitors and are betraying their trust.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02391"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would like to say a few words with regard to the speeches which we have just heard. The noble Earl seems to think it unreasonable to expect that the electors should properly understand the details of an important Bill before the country. That is exactly what we complain about. I quite agree that in the case of a long and complicated measure it is quite impossible to bring before the electors all the details of the Bill, but in a short and concise one of this description surely it is not too much to expect that the country should be able to understand the real grave issues put before them. I am. perfectly certain of this, that at the last General Election, owing to the deliberate policy of His Majesty's Government, the country was not given the opportunity of understanding this Bill. I know from the experience which I had upon the many public platforms on which I had the privilege of addressing the electors that the general public were completely mystified with regard to this Constitutional question, and it is an absurdity to say that the General Election was a complete verdict with regard to all the details of this complicated Constitutional question. I agree that the verdict at the last General Election may justly lie claimed as an expression of opinion by the country that the time had come when a considerable change should be made in the constitution of this House and with regard to the relations between the two Houses. But I do not believe for one moment that the voters of the country understood that the Parliament Bill as suggested by His Majesty's Government was going to give to any Minister who happened to command a
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0490"/>
<col>971</col>
small majority in the House of Commons the power to force into law any important or vital measure even although the general opinion of the country was against it.<lb/>
We are told that this Bill is put forward because there was nothing else to be done. I gather that it is the main contention put forward by His Majesty's Government that they had no other alternative. I do not think that too much stress can be laid on the important point which was brought forward by Lord St. Aldwyn to-night, and which should be rammed home to the electors on every opportunity&#x2014;that there was absolutely no necessity whatever for His Majesty's Government to resort to a General Election at the time they did, and that if they had desired to get a proper opinion upon the question before the country, if they had honestly desired to carry out what everybody at the moment regarded as the honourable word of the Prime Minister that the Royal Prerogative should not be invoked until the question had been adequately discussed in Parliament, they ought to have given an opportunity for the Bill to be brought in and discussed in both Houses of Parliament, and then would have been their opportunity of going to the country and taking the opinion of the country after the electors had had a chance of forming a considered opinion upon it. I think we ought to be grateful to Lord St. Aldwyn for having brought out that point. It has not been dwelt upon with half enough insistence up to now but it is a most important point to consider, and I think it completely demolishes the argument put forward by His Majesty's Government that they had no other alternative but to proceed in the way they have done.<lb/>
Then there is the other answer to the argument of the uncontrolled nature of your Lordships' House put forward by the Lord Chancellor last night. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Is it right that this House alone, as distinct from the Sovereign, as distinct from the House of Commons, should remain practically the only uncontrolled and uncontrollable portion of what is known as the Estates of the Realm?"</quote>
I quite agree with what fell from the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War last night when he called attention to the democratic tendency and to the demand that the constitution of this House as it has been known through all these centuries should be brought into
<col>972</col>
harmony with the tendency of the day. I have myself admitted that on many platforms, and I always found during the last two elections, in which I did a great deal of speaking, that the admission of the fact that the House of Lords as a hereditary Chamber could not be said to be exactly in accord with democratic tendencies and that the time had come when some alteration should be made to make it a stronger Chamber and more in harmony with the times, was invariably received with approval both by opponents and supporters. I know there are noble Lords in this House who are not willing to subscribe to that opinion; but I myself am strongly of opinion that the time has come when it is necessary and advisable to put forward some practicable scheme for the purpose of reconstituting this House on a different basis so as to command to a greater extent the confidence of the country. Would not that have been an alternative to the course adopted by His Majesty's Government? Would not some assistance from the Government to the efforts of this side to produce a practicable scheme have been of use in bringing about proposals which would have commanded the assent of both sides? Would it not have been possible, by a proper reconstitution of your Lordships' House, to have obliterated the reproach which we have been under of being too one-sided?<lb/>
I contend that there are two answers to the main argument of His Majesty's Government. First, that the reconstitution of your Lordships' House would have met the greater part of the objections which have been put forward; and, secondly, that there was absolutely no necessity to dissolve at the time they did, and that the Government, by dissolving when they did last winter, deliberately chose their time for the purpose of rushing this question and taking the opinion of the electors at a time when it was impossible that that opinion could be properly expressed. And I say that we are completely justified when we complain of the organised hypocrisy with which this question has been put forward. We hear repeatedly upon the other side that the whole of this has originated from the action of your Lordships' House with regard to the Budget of 1909, and that it is merely a question of an outraged people rebelling against your Lordships' House for interfering in matters of finance. We know perfectly
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0491"/>
<col>973</col>
well that it was the intention of the Party opposite to pick a quarrel with this House immediately after they were returned with a large majority in the year 1906, and that if a quarrel had not been picked with us upon the Budget some other opportunity would have been very speedily found, and I say it is pure hypocrisy to state that this is nothing more nor less than a question of your Lordships' House having interfered in finance and referred the the Budget to the people.<lb/>
We hear a good deal, too, from members of the Government in the other House with regard to the main objects of this Parliament Bill. We know perfectly well, although we never get any admission of it naturally from the other side, that the whole action of the Government at the present time is merely an interpretation of that parade movement which is called "toeing the line," and which was ordered by Mr. John Redmond in the interests of the Irish Party. We had an interesting admission in the House of Commons yesterday that Home Rule is going to be forced through in this present Parliament, although it was somewhat consoling this evening to be informed by Lord Ribblesdale that he did not believe for a moment that it is going to happen. Although we do not expect very much in the way of political consistency in these days, and still less from such a changeable individual as His Majesty's Home Secretary, it is rather interesting to see what Mr. Winston Churchill said about this particular question of the Constitution and Home Rule a few years ago. I happened to come across a quotation yesterday from a speech which he made to a meeting of the Primrose League in 1899 which is very interesting reading. Mr. Churchill then said&#x2014;
<quote>"It was strange that the proven Constitution that we had in Great Britain excited the dislike and animosity of the Radical &#x2026; The Radical had attempted to break up Parliament, and had attacked the House of Lords. In the future they would not hesitate to assault the Throne, the most glorious, and not the least essential, of the Three Estates. The English Constitution was not the work of any man, nor assemblage of men. It had grown up year by year. With all its compromises, inconsistencies, and safeguards it had always seemed to him to be the embodiment of the national character and the outcome of the English soil, the product of a little island lost among the northern mist.'"</quote>
And in his address to the electors of Oldham in 1899 Mr. Churchill said&#x2014;
<quote>"First of all I am a Conservative. I believe that the present Constitution of the United
<col>974</col>
Kingdom is, upon the whole, the best and most practical arrangement for the purposes of Government that exists in the world or is recorded in history &#x2026; Thirdly, I am a Unionist. The question of a separate Parliament is now withdrawn from the political arena. The Radical Party, however, will profess their devotion to the cause of Home Rule. All true Unionists must, therefore, be prepared to greet the reappearance of that odious measure with the most strenuous opposition."</quote>
Next I have a singularly interesting extract from Mr. Churchill's election address at Oldham in 1900. He then said&#x2014;
<quote>"What will happen if a Radical Government comes into power? They enjoy the support of the Irish vote, on the understanding that they will introduce a Home Rule Bill. Either they will break their pledge or the dreary farce of their last Administration will be repeated. The Conservative Party in the House of Commons will vigorously oppose, and the House of Lords will most certainly reject, that pernicious plan which the electors of England have twice condemned. To avoid this, or in consequence of this, the Radicals will try to abolish the House of Lords and so subvert the ancient Constitution of the land. In this they will again be met by the firm and unfaltering resistance of the whole united Conservative Party. The country will be plunged into a furious political struggle, trade will suffer, the Empire will be weakened by internal strife, and no practical good from social reform will come to the people."</quote>
I do not know whether those words are in any way interesting to noble Lords opposite. I notice that they are received with a certain amount of amusement by the noble Earl, Lord Russell. Perhaps he may consider it rather a small thing to have as Home Secretary a gentleman of such remarkable opinions one day and of such other remarkable opinions another day. But still I do put forward the suggestion that, in the interests of political consistency and political honesty, it is desirable that the country should remember that the Minister who is now the spokesman of the Government in the House of Commons on this most important question not very long ago held the opinions which I have ventured to quote to the House.<lb/>
I have addressed your Lordships because I did not wish to give a silent vote on this occasion. I entirely echo the sentiments put forward by my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury, and I intend tomorrow to go into the Lobby with him as a protest against the way in which this measure is being forced through. I know that my noble friend and leader Lord Lansdowne&#x2014;we still regard him as our leader in this House in spite of our difference of opinion on this particular question&#x2014;looks forward to the time when this
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0492"/>
<col>975</col>
egislation may be reversed. At the same time he cannot reverse this measure single-handed. He has to look to his supporters in the country, and I maintain that he is far more likely to get the whole-hearted and unstinted support of the real workers in the country if it is realised that everything possible was done to resist this iniquitous measure to the very last. It is because I believe that this question is not understood in the country and that there will be a better chance of obtaining a reversal of its verdict on a future occasion, quite irrespective of the question whether there is a majority for or against us in this particular House, that I intend to-morrow to give my vote in support of my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02392"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SCARBROUGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I happen not to be numbered amongst those of your Lordships who have made use of the columns of the daily Press in order to explain how you intend to vote or not to vote on this question. I therefore ask your Lordships to be good enough to give me your attention for a few moments. I do so, not for the purpose of argument, because I do not imagine for a moment that any of your Lordships will be influenced by argument at this stage, but I desire, after the advice that has been given to us this evening, to state and to state clearly, that the course which I propose to take is based upon strong conviction formed months ago when the alternative methods open to the Government for forcing its will on this House were as clear as they are to-day. Nothing that has been said or done in the last fortnight has in any way affected my conviction unless it was the strong indictment which was made by the noble Earl, Lord Curzon, last evening against the Government, which, if possible, strengthened that conviction. I see nothing new in the general situation except this&#x2014;that the Prime Minister has announced which method of the two open to him he intends to pursue, and having announced that intention he shrinks from carrying it into effect.<lb/>
I supported the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition in his measure for the reform of this House a short time ago, because I believe, and I ventured humbly to tell the noble Marquess so, that this House has no right to surrender any of the powers which it holds under the Constitution until the question of the reform and reconstitution of the House
<col>976</col>
has been dealt with and agreed upon. His Majesty's Government chose to reverse the order of procedure. While they propose to deprive this House of all powers except that of temporary delay, they treat the question of reform with the utmost contempt and indifference. The noble Marquess met that proposal by inserting in the Parliament Bill what I certainly understood to be vital Amendments for the purpose of preventing the introduction of what is commonly known as single-Chamber government in its most insidious and dangerous form. But while doing this the House consented to abandon its right to reject Money Bills, which, after all, was the origin of the whole controversy. I do think that in thus showing its readiness for drastic reform and in consenting to pass the Parliament Bill as amended this House has gone as far as it has any right to go, and, moreover, as far as, if not further than, the country ever intended it should go. I go further and say that holding these Amendments to be vital it seems to me that it would have been better that they should not have been introduced at all unless they were to be persevered in as long as we have the power to do so.<lb/>
We are told that whether we fight or whether we surrender the immediate result is the same&#x2014;the Government must have their way. That argument, even if true, has no weight whatever with me. What matters is the way in which we meet that end now, and the moral effect of action or inaction at this stage will be incalculable. Surely if we have a principle we should fight for it, and if we have a policy which we believe to be right we should abide by it. No other consideration to my mind will count, or ought to count, in the long run when this House comes to be judged by the country. Personally, therefore, I can only regard this question as one of right or wrong. I cannot regard it from the point of view of expediency or fear of consequences. The noble Marquess, in tendering his advice to his followers, based that advice on the assumption that we are no longer free agents. I cannot admit that I cease to be a free agent until I am outvoted in this House, and until then I hold that it is our simple duty to safeguard the future while we have the power to do so. It seems to me that to yield to threat or any other form of pressure short of an adverse vote is to abandon our trust to the nation. Moreover, it would be
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0493"/>
<col>977</col>
playing false to that great mass of moderate opinion in the country which looks, and looks rightly, to this House to safeguard the spirit and letter of the Constitution as long as we have the power to do so and at all costs. It is only, I venture to think, by doing so that we can honestly free ourselves from the accusation of being accomplices in an act of great violence and separate ourselves from au share of responsibility for what may follow. On these grounds, my Lords, and in the firm belief that I shall be doing what is right, I feel that. I have no other course to take but to follow what I consider to be the strong, straight, and simple line advocated by my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02393"><sup>*</sup><member>EARL STANHOPE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at this late hour I do not propose to detain the House for more than a few minutes. It seems to me that the question before us really resolves itself into this&#x2014;Did the country at the last election give a considered judgment against the Parliament Bill in the shape in which it left this House and in favour of its shape as it was originally sent up to this House by the I louse of Commons? I welcomed the speech of the noble Earl, Lord Russell, for more than one reason; but I welcomed it most of all as typical of the speeches that were delivered all over the country during the last election by Radical candidates. The noble Earl said that the country felt that this House was unfair as between the two Parties and that the policy of His Majesty's Government was to adjust matters and make this House fairer. I have read the Parliament Bill a good many times, but I fail to see anything in it that makes this House fairer as between the two Parties than it was before. This House will be left the power, such as it is, of delaying Radical Bills for two years and of allowing Conservative Bills to go through. It is quite obvious that if the, speech of the noble Earl is the sort of speech that was delivered throughout the country at the last election, the people had no opportunity whatever of giving a considered judgment on the Parliament Bill as it came up to this House. It was made more difficult because the Parliament Bill was not thrashed out in either House of Parliament before the General Election. The policies of the two Parties were never thoroughly grasped by the people of this country, and they had no opportunity of realising what the effects of these two policies would be. Further
<col>978</col>
than that, the policy of the Party on this side of the House, as put forward in the Lansdowne Amendment and in the other Amendments, was neither in form nor in substance before the country at the last election.<lb/>
Holding those views many of us on this side feel that it is our duty to stand out for the right of which we are one of the joint trustees&#x2014;the right, that is to say, that the voters of this country should have the final word upon measures before they are actually passed into law. If we are prepared to sacrifice principles such as that for what I can only call Party expediency, it seeing to me we shall forfeit the trust which has been handed down to us and be unworthy of our position in your Lordships' House. I believe that by not fighting to the very end on our Amendments and giving way in order to preserve a Conservative majority in this House we shall be accused of sacrificing principles to Party, and we shall for a very long period put off any chance of carrying the views that we hold on any great principles into practice when we return to power.<lb/>
I am convinced that the people of this country have never grasped that a revolution is in progress. I believe that the only way to bring it home to them is, if the Government desire revolution, by making them carry that revolution by revolutionary methods and by no other. I am sure I need not remind the House that the day on which Mr. Asquith's letter to Mr. Balfour was published the Press&#x2014;and particularly the <i>Daily Mail</i>&#x2014;had centred the whole interest of the public on the flying competition that was going on in England, and the intentions of the Government passed practically unnoticed. Several instances came under my own personal notice of individuals asking to have newspapers sent to them giving the result of the flying competition, but no interest was taken in the Parliament Bill. It is true that during the last few days the <i>Daily Mail</i> has been graciously pleased to give some prominence to this crisis, but I venture to think that if it had not been for the action of those who support Lord Halsbury there would be very little notice taken of this crisis. I think your Lordships will agree that the energies of the newspaper which I have mentioned have been principally devoted to abuse of those who support Lord Halsbury and his policy. Whether that action is due to personal
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0494"/>
<col>979</col>
motives or to the hot weather and the advent of the silly season I cannot say; but this much I will say, that without the creation of Peers, without a real fight by the Members of your Lordships' House, the whole interest of the public will be diverted next week to Heaven knows what object&#x2014;probably a prize for the best grown cabbage or some other object which will promote the sale of that paper.<lb/>
My Lords, the policy of walking out instead of voting on a question has been tried before. It was tried in 1905 by the last Unionist Government in the House of Commons on questions relating to Tariff Reform. I ask those of your Lordships who were members of the last Unionist Cabinet whether they found that policy so successful that they are anxious to repeat it. I do not believe that more than three members of the Cabinet will be found to hold that view. My Lords, if the policy of walking out was misunderstood then it will surely be far more misunderstood and misinterpreted on this occasion.<lb/>
I am aware of the arguments against the Government being given a majority in this House; but I confess that I agree with Lord Russell that this House has lost the confidence of the country, and I also agree with him that until we can show to the people that we are prepared to inaugurate a Second Chamber which shall represent the opinions of the country over a long period of years and be perfectly fair as between the two Parties, this House will never regain the confidence of the country. For that reason I do not fear the creation of any number of Peers. It is said by many that one of the principles for which we stand is the union of the British Isles, and that if we hand over this House to the opposite Party we are hastening the destruction of the principle for which we stand in that respect. Will any Member of your Lordships' House contend that if a Home Rule measure is passed in the House of Commons in 1912 it will not again be passed in 1913? Would it be possible for any Radical member in the House of Commons who had taken part in this campaign against your Lordships' House to climb down the year after he had voted for a Home Rule measure? I venture to say there is no one in your Lordships' House who would contend that he would find a dozen Radical members of the House of Commons who would be
<col>980</col>
able to take such action as that when the time arose.<lb/>
It is quite true that we are given a period of delay of eighteen months. Many of us have been trying to turn out the present Government for a considerable period, and I put it to those noble Lords who have spoken in the country, Did they find more enthusiasm for the cause which they were advancing at the end of the short Budget campaign or do they find more enthusiasm at the present day? If you desire to arouse enthusiasm against the Government, I believe it can be done in a short, sharp campaign far better than by a long dragging engagement. So far as upsetting the policy of Home Rule is concerned, I think the period of eighteen months is more of a disadvantage than an advantage. For by holding up important Government measures such as Welsh Disestablishment and Home Rule for two years we thereby hold the composite majority of the Government together. It is obvious that while each section has its Bill hung up the whole of the composite Party must hold together until those Bills become law. But if there was a Government majority in this House there would at once be immense competition as to which of the Radical measures should be passed first, and that would not be a very pleasant experience for His Majesty's Government. Further, the moment one of those measures had become law&#x2014;we will suppose it is Home Rule&#x2014;in that case the Redmondites would care nothing for either Party in the House the moment they had got Home Rule, and would be prepared to split away from the Radical Party. And I venture to think that those who sit on the Episcopal Bench would find that there would be a greater probability of destroying any chance of Welsh Disestablishment by having a Radical majority in this House than by standing out and keeping all these Bills hung up for eighteen months or two years.<lb/>
I believe the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition was perfectly correct in describing the guarantees as a blank cheque. In one of the statements that have been made it is said that the guarantees are sufficient to give effect to the wishes of the country. What are the wishes of the country as described by the Radical Government? Are the wishes of the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0495"/>
<col>981</col>
country merely to have the Parliament Bill passed into law? We know perfectly well that the Government claim a mandate not only for the Parliament Bill but also for Home Rule, and if they have guarantees to make Peers in order to pass the Parliament Bill I firmly believe that they also have guarantees to enable them to pass Home Rule. What will the position be next year supposing this House refuses to pass a Home Ride measure sent up to it by the House of Commons? Immediately there will be very great unrest in Ireland and to a large extent in England also. His Majesty's Government will say that the only possible way of quelling this unrest is that Home Rule should be passed into law without further delay, and they will demand that guarantees shall again be put into operation to give them a majority in this House in order to pass Home Rule into law forthwith. I for one believe that our position on such an occasion next year would be no stronger than it is on the present occasion. I believe we should have far more chance of destroying Home Rule if we had a clear-cut issue on the Home Rule question alone and did not have it complicated by any question of the creation of Peers.<lb/>
The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition has confessed that he would prefer to have a Conservative majority in this House when he came to deal with the Constitutional question. The majority on this side of the House are inclined to agree with him. But what guarantee have we that we shall find a Conservative majority in this House even supposing no Radical Peers are made at all? The Radical Government have still four more years to run. Is it not probable that in the next four years His Majesty's Government will bring in some tremendous scheme for the reform, possibly the annihilation, of this House, and that the noble Marquess if he returns to power at the end of the four years will find, not a Conservative majority, but a House more swamped by the reform scheme of the Government than by any creation of Peers that has been proposed? I for one do not fear the bogey of these extra Peers, because I believe there are far greater dangers if these Peers are not made. The whole of the contention that this House is unfair as between the two Parties is destroyed if these Peers are made. I have changed from being one of those who some months ago were inclined to surrender,
<col>982</col>
and I may say, despite Lord Newton's assertion, that I changed long before there was any question of a General Election being impossible. I changed before the Second Reading was given to this Bill in your Lordships' House, and I have become one of the strongest supporters of the noble and learned Earl, Lord Halsbury. I have yet to hear any arguments put forward other than those of what I can only describe as Party expediency for adopting any other course. I grant that behind this question of Party expediency there are, to some extent, questions of principle, but I believe that by standing out for the principle which Lord Halsbury's supporters are fighting for we shall support far more strongly those other principles on which Members of this House are agreed, and I believe we shall gain far more truly and far more thoroughly the trust of the country in the fight we are waging against the unconstitutional methods of the Government.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PARLIAMENT BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02448">Debate on the Motion that the Commons Reasons for disagreeing to certain of the fords Amendments be considered <i>resumed</i> (according to Order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02449"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at the conclusion of business last night the noble Viscount the Secretary of State for War, in assenting to the adjournment of the debate, stated it as his belief that there was a wish that the general debate should terminate at a comparatively early hour to-day in order that we might enter on the consideration of the Amendments. I think that before that takes place we have a right to expect some explanation from the Government on two points which have been so far left obscure. Two questions were addressed to the noble Viscount the Lord President of the Council last night, one by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition and the other by my noble friend Lord Salisbury. In each case the noble Viscount declined to be drawn into a reply without consideration on a question of so important a nature. The noble Viscount has had ample time for consideration and I think that before we go to a Division to-night we have a right to know the extent of the guarantees which have been extracted from His Majesty by His Majesty's Government. We ought to be under no doubt about it. But the loose talking of some members of the Government not altogether supported by their more prudent colleagues has left an element of doubt, and I venture to put the question again as clearly as I can&#x2014;Have the Government, as we are led to believe by the Home Secretary and as we were assured by the noble Marquess the Secretary of State for India, received from His Majesty authority to make such a number of Peers as they may consider necessary for the passage of this Bill substantially in the condition in which it left the House of Commons?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02450"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: I will answer that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02451"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: Then I leave that question; but I trust that we shall have a solution before we are asked to terminate this discussion. The other point, is, perhaps, less immediately important, but it is one which in the future history of Parliament will never be lost sight of&#x2014;that is the vindication of His Majesty's Government against the charges brought against
<col>988</col>
them last night with regard to their conduct in relation to their confidential advice to the King. Now, my Lords, there is no man in this House who from his experience of public life has a greater right to ask for those assurances than the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn. I do not suppose that in the history of Parliament there is a parallel of such charges as were made by the noble Viscount being brought against a Government at six o'clock in the evening and no notice being taken of them by any member of the Government during six hours of debate. I venture to summarise them in a few words. Lord St. Aldwyn charged the Government with having grossly violated their Constitutional duty to the King. He charged them with having proffered advice on a hypothetical question when they had no knowledge, and when the King had still less knowledge, what would be the condition of the Bill in respect of which they were asking for guarantees. The noble Viscount charged them with having omitted to advise His Majesty according to all precedent to send for the leaders of the Opposition and ascertain their views at so vital a moment. He charged them with having placed before His Majesty the results of the Conference to which they were only one Party, while not being sedulous that His Majesty should hear the views of the other Party to that Conference. He charged them, further, that on this Bill, which they had not attempted to pass through either House of Parliament, they had assumed the action of their political opponents, which has proved to be entirely different from that which they anticipated.<lb/>
I came upon one quotation which seems to me to bear upon the whole of these proceedings. It is almost obvious to us, in default of any explanation by the Government, that such an appeal to the superior power of the Prerogative was intended from the very first without regard to the action of this House. That seems pretty obvious from the facts which are before us. And be it recollected that Lord St. Aldwyn, with the experience of a Cabinet Minister for many years, has pressed for that which we have not yet seen&#x2014;not merely that the Cabinet Minute presented to the King should be made known to Parliament and to the country, but that the correspondence resulting from that Minute should also be made a part of that of which Parliament should be seized in coming to a conclusion. But long before this a member of the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0499"/>
<col>989</col>
Government had anticipated, and was preparing to use, the Royal Prerogative as a reinforcement of the Radical majority. This is the language of the Home Secretary in the House of Commons on March 31, 1910&#x2014;
<quote>"The Lords have used their Veto to affront the Prerogative of the Crown and to invade the rights of the Commons. It has now become necessary that the Crown and the Commons acting together should restore the balance of the Constitution, and restrict for ever the Veto of the House of Lords."</quote>
In the whole history of Parliament has there ever been a case in which a Minister of the Crown has so dared to invoke the name of the Crown and say that the Crown and the Commons, acting together, should subdue another Estate of the Realm, even if the Veto to which that Minister referred had been exercised, which it had not? I think that that quotation and the subsequent action of His Majesty's Government prove that from the very first they intended to bring about the use of the Prerogative of the Crown; that they made the crisis and intended to make it; that the whole action of the House of Commons last year was a sham; that on the Government's part the Conference was a sham; and that their action in this House this year has been a sham from first to last.<lb/>
I feel very deeply the bearing of these proceedings on the vote which we are going to give to-night. Of course I am not going to repeat what has been said by so many speakers before me as to the motives of different parties on this side; but if we differ in our action on this side of the House as to procedure, as regards our patriotic aims the aims of both sections are the same; our objects are the same, only we achieve the result by different methods. That is my feeling. I am sure my noble friends who have so strongly supported their own course of action will not, grudge me putting in as strong language as I can the results which in my opinion will follow upon their action, if they are successful. My contention is that the more we dwell on the unconstitutional action of Ministers, on the position in which the Crown has been placed, on the contempt which has been shown for the ordinary practice of Parliament, the more careful we ought to be not to arm those Ministers with any further powers than we cam avoid, because we know that they will be used to the uttermost to the detriment of the national interests which we have at heart.<lb/>
<col>990</col>
The noble Viscount will answer, no doubt, presently as regards the creation of Peers. But so much was said yesterday as to the probable extent of that creation that I may be pardoned for referring to it for a few moments. Personally I cannot see how any member of this House can have any doubt that what was said by Lord Crewe, quite apart from other statements, shows that a very large creation of Peers must be the result of the rejection of this Bill by the insistence upon your Lordships' Amendments to-night. It is quite true that the Amendments may be affirmed to-night by a small number of Peers. But the best calculator cannot tell whether or not, after a Prorogation of Parliament and the whole subject has assumed a fresh phase, the number of Peers dissenting from this Bill will not be very much larger, and I am quite certain of this, that if it was desired to calculate that to a nicety we have no security that the present Government would desire or attempt to calculate it. They have everything to gain by a large creation of Peers. I believe they will attempt a large creation and carry it out. My noble friend Lord Salisbury dealt with very considerable satisfaction on this thread of escape, that the number of Peers would not be a large one. If you make 200 Peers&#x2014;and you may make a very much larger number without being at all certain what the effect will be on your Bill if you bring it up here again&#x2014;I venture to say that every evil which can result from a large creation of Peers will have been effected; except that on some possible division when men are called up from all parts of the country those 200 might be put into a minority. I do not think the Government would risk that. But, apart from that, consider the effect on the House of the creation of only 200 Peers. Consider the effect on the business of this House, because, after all, we must consider facts practically when they are within a few days of us. Those of us who have been present during the last few nights have experienced how difficult it is to find seating room in this House. The House holds 275 members and consists of 600. Increase the number to 900 and you will have three men for each place. My noble friend (Lord Salisbury) scoffs at these things, but I shall have a word to say in a few minutes with regard to his plan for dealing with them. If you wish to preserve the dignity of this House you must keep it in a position in which it can act as a deliberative Assembly. It
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0500"/>
<col>991</col>
would be impossible for the House of Lords so to continue after such a creation. But that is not the most important thing. The important point is the effect of it.<lb/>
My noble friends who follow Lord Halsbury think they are preserving the dignity of this House and acting in the confidence of the nation by going to the last extreme; but the noble Marquess behind me said something with regard to what foreign opinion&#x2014;and he might have added Colonial opinion&#x2014;will be with reference to this matter. Foreigners and our fellow-countrymen in our Colonies do not know quite so well as we do that all this will have been caused through the act of the Government. They regard the King as the fountain of honour and therefore as the dispenser of Peerages and such patronage. They regard an institution not simply as to how it has become what it has become, but as to what it is for the purposes it has to carry out; and I submit with respect to my noble friends that other people no less wise than they will think of this unwieldy and unworkable Assembly as degraded, as it will be, by the presence of a number of men who, as the most rev. Prelate said last night, will not be able to exercise their own judgments on the measures submitted to them, but who were sent here for a definite purpose and with a definite charge. Our honour and dignity will have been impaired by the impossibility of carrying on business and by the composition of the Assembly which would meet in two months' time.<lb/>
Last night my noble friend Lord Salisbury treated this as a matter of no account. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"After all, two can play at that game; if you can make 200 or 300 Peers, we can redress the balance when we come in."</quote>
That brought clown on him a protest&#x2014;I might almost have said a rebuke&#x2014;from the right rev. Prelate the Bishop of Winchester. I could not help thinking how singularly little my noble friend had really considered the effect of his action when he made such a proposition as that. For what is his proposal? In an eloquent passage he told us that our difficulty in arousing the country from its apathy was that the belief of the people in the truth and integrity of politicians had been greatly blurred by past events. What is it he proposes to do, coming fresh from an indictment, in which we have all sup-
<col>992</col>
ported him and of which he has been one of the most eloquent exponents, of the iniquity of the Government in advising the King to exercise his Prerogative in order to swamp this House? He proposes that we should proceed by the same method, and that as soon as we get the power we should advise His Majesty to use the same Prerogative and by the same unconstitutional means overturn the majority then existing in this House in order to secure a Party majority for ourselves. Does my noble friend really think that by that change of front he will succeed in inspiring the people of this country with belief in the integrity of politicians?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02452"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: I was referring to the question of whether politicians tell the truth to the people or not. What I suggested was that my noble friends who sit upon this Bench are incapable of not telling the truth, and that they must by their action, as trustees for the people, see that the country is not deceived.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02453"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I will carry it a step further. If you tell the truth about one thing, why not tell it about another? If we are speaking the truth in telling the country, as we tell it to-day, that we regard this exercise of the Prerogative as a most outrageous departure from the right conduct of a Minister, are we to stand assured that those who listen to our words will not be surprised if in two or three years' time they find us supporting an identically similar operation? We must be fair to ourselves in this matter. We cannot treat this great swamping of the House of Lords as a sort of game to be met by a counter swamping such as the noble Marquess alluded to. I do not pursue it any further, because I am quite certain that my noble friend never would have entered on that argument unless he had failed to appreciate the false nature of the position in which he is placed by his proposition.<lb/>
I venture to draw two deductions from these facts so far as we have gone. The first is that if noble Lords, with the best intentions in the world, give the Government an excuse for making Peers, they will not only make them in a very large number but they will use them to the last degree to carry out the measures against which all of us on this side are most opposed. The second point I would submit is this.
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0501"/>
<col>993</col>
I am not at all certain that Lord Newton, in his brilliant and amusing speech last night, did not hit the mark when he said, as for supposing that the Government will be swamped in the country by the ridicule they will incur in making the Peers, that they will get the Peers and we shall get the ridicule. I am quite certain that when you go further afield you will find that that ridicule will fall, not on the Government who made the Peers, but on the King, who was forced to create the Peers, and on the institutions which they had rendered unworkable and unwieldy.<lb/>
One point feelingly made by all those who have spoken on this side of the House is that we have a trust from the people which we cannot afford to disregard. One noble Lord said we should have committed the last and most fatal breach of trust if we failed to go into the Lobby to-night against the Government. There are two ways of looking at that. In the first place I conceive that the trust which we have from the people is to preserve the privileges of this House and through them the liberties of the people. The privileges of this House are being largely filched front us by the Bill, but I doubt very much whether, when by our action we cannot preserve the privileges of this House, but can only further detract from them, and when by our action as proposed we cannot preserve the liberties of the people, we are wise in giving up safeguards which the people look upon us to preserve. I know that we shall have a speech in the course of this evening, amongst others, from my noble friend behind me who represents the Ulster Clubs, Lord Templetown, who speaks with an authority for the North of Ireland that I do not pretend to. He may be quite right that the North of Ireland would be willing even to see the Peers created rather than we should abstain from voting; but I say that is not the general feeling in Ireland, when we know that a Home Rule Bill is immediately in contemplation. When you think of giving to the Government a majority in both Houses you must remember that that majority will be used to push through next year a Bill which gives, in however incomplete and unreasonable a fashion, Home Rule to Ireland and vindicates the pledge given by the Government to the Irish Party. I believe that within twelve months from to-day the loyalists in Ireland who would be entirely at the mercy of the Government set up in
<col>994</col>
Ireland would turn round and ask us why we did not maintain the trust which the people gave us and retain the only safeguard which would enable us effectively to deal with such a measure when the occasion arises. ["What safeguard?"] The safeguard of two years. Noble Lords scoff. Do noble Lords who laugh think that no education of the country on Home Rule can be carried out in those two years? Do they forget the Budget of 1909 engineered through the House of Commons with the greatest difficulty at appropriate moments in sections&#x2014;that Budget which your Lordships were complained of for arresting for two months, but which took twelve months to pass through the House of Commons by manipulation. And do you suppose that the Government on a question of Home Rule will be able by similar manipulation to carry it in three years if your Lordships have the same case? You make light of that advantage to-day, but if you rid yourselves of it you will regret it when a Home Rule Bill is introduced.<lb/>
There is another point. We are told that the people of this country will not rally round this House unless they see us showing by our courage and straight policy that we do really believe in the liberties which are being filched from us under this Bill. Will your Lordships consider what will be the case to-morrow morning and what will be put before the people of this country, if, as is possible, those who take the extreme view defeat the Government by a small majority. It is quite possible that the Government may be able to bring eighty or ninety Peers into the Lobby. It is also possible that those who are opposed to them to the last extreme may bring from ninety to a hundred. Among the names in that division list, which will be closely scanned to-morrow and for months to come, will be some of Peers who stand highest in your Lordships' House for experience, for ability, for devotion to the public service, but there will inevitably be names of men who seldom take part in our affairs, who perhaps have not been heard in this House at all, and who are among the less experienced members of your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02454"><member>THE MARQUESS OF SALISBURY</member><membercontribution>: And on the other side the same.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02455"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend says there will be the same on the other
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0502"/>
<col>995</col>
side. That may be true; but these half-a-dozen or ten men are going to dictate to 400 men who disagree with them. I press that point on the attention of every man who is going into the Lobby and on every man whose vote may be in doubt. What will be the feeling of the country to-morrow when it is found that on this vital issue, in a Division in which less than a quarter or only about a quarter of your Lordships' House take part, the insistence of five or ten men&#x2014;who are not., to say the least, of first experience in public affairs&#x2014;has been allowed to counterbalance the opinion of 400 men who undertook to stay away and not to insist upon their vote, not because they did not detest the Bill, but because they had come to the conclusion that different tactics, to quote Lord Halsbury's phrase, or a different procedure had become necessary in the interest of their common cause. I cannot help thinking that the country may well expect that so great a change should be backed by something more substantial than perhaps the half-dozen votes which it is proposed should bring about one of the greatest changes ever introduced in a legislative Assembly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02456"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: What I said was that it was a question between us with regard to tactics.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02457"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: That is the very point I was making. The minority, by force of circumstances, must dictate and will dictate to-night, on a question of tactics, the policy to a great majority; and I think it will be unfortunate if it is found that by a very small number the opinions of the leader of this side of the House and of the great majority of his supporters have been set aside, with results which will not be temporary but permanent, and which will make it impossible to put back this House on the same footing as before. That, I think, is a picture on which posterity will gaze with some wonder, and I feel that it does require a little more consideration than those who propose to carry it out have given to it.<lb/>
I have not the smallest doubt of the courage and resolution of those who propose actively to oppose the Government. But is it not fair to ask them what their procedure will be after they have carried out this very great change by the exercise
<col>996</col>
of the power of very small numbers? Do they mean to sit down after that result has been achieved? My noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke last night spoke in very unfaltering terms. He said he was willing to use every power which was left to him as a member of this House in order to stop the Government from carrying their scheme into effect. I presume that he means he would use the same majority to adjourn the House and refuse to transact business. I am not quarrelling with him if he has come to that decision. He would hold that the House is under duress; he would hold, as has been said before by members on this Bench, that the duress of the creation of Peers is as great as if soldiers were brought in and the House were cleared. If he and those who act with him hold those views surely they have a right, in their desire to rouse the country, to do what they can and to adopt the only course by which they can obtain that which my noble friend most desires&#x2014;an appeal to the country, which must result from such conduct. My noble friends beside me have hitherto given the house no guidance in this matter. If they, holding the views they do about the effect on this House and on the honour of members of it, had decided to take such steps I am not sure that they might not have found a very considerable recruitment from those behind me. But so long as they are determined to cease action at the point at which they do cease it, then I think we are right in leaving them to take action alone.<lb/>
My noble friends have had the strongest possible provocation for taking the course they are taking, and if I do not join them in that course I can only say that I for one believe that it requires more courage to keep out of their Lobby than to go into it. They have asked us whether we do not feel that we have some responsibility for not moving in this matter, and whether we are not accepting sonic responsibility for this discreditable measure. We refuse to take the course they suggest because it would lead to the most stupendous piece of political corruption that has ever been heard of in the history of the world&#x2014;a piece of political corruption which Sir Robert Walpole never contemplated and which none of the Ministers of the eighteenth century ever would have attempted or considered. We are asked to-night to allow a Minister who has been declared
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0503"/>
<col>997</col>
from this Bench to have tricked Parliament, to have coerced the Sovereign, and to have betrayed his trust, not to suffer in the last resort but to go from this session as one who has sown good seed and who goes on his way rejoicing carrying his sheaves with him, among those sheaves being the entire abolition of the safeguards which have existed for a century past in this House, and a pledge absolutely clearly made which will lead to the disintegration of a part at least of the Empire. I feel this Bill to be an odious Bill. I feel the conduct of the Government to have been deplorable and to be deserving of, as it has received, the severest censure of this House. But considering the magnitude of the issues at stake, I believe that the majority of this House are taking the wisest course when they refuse to become parties with they Government in the annihilation of this House, the effects of which would be felt among our descendants to the third and fourth generation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02458"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not now rise for the purpose of taking part in the debate. But I would venture respectfully to ask whether it is not time for some member of the Government to intervene and answer the very pertinent and important questions that have been addressed to them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02459"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (VISCOUNT MORLEY)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like my noble friend I do not propose to make a speech at this moment, but I have net the slightest desire to avoid a reply to the questions that were put to me last night by the noble Marquess and by the noble Viscount and Lord Salisbury. I am completely prepared to answer; but I understood, and I still hold it to be so, that the reason why we did not interpose was that it was considered more advantageous that noble Lords representing different groups on the other side should first have the opportunity of stating their ease to one another and against one another, and that then I should speak&#x2014;not the least, let me assure the House, as what is called in diplomacy <i>tertius gaudens</i>&#x2014;for I feel no rejoicing whatever (I say this with perfect candour to the House) in watching the controversy which went on yesterday and is to go on, I understand, until at all events dinner time. I do not rejoice&#x2014;why? Because I have seen what misfortunes happen to the
<col>998</col>
country from the disruption of Parties. I entirely agree with the noble Marquess that we are perhaps only at the beginning of a course of operations, the beginning of a series, possibly, of troubles and perils; and that in order to encounter these with the best chance we ought to have two great and united Parties. Therefore I ant not <i>tertius gaudens.</i> I was waiting, and I will, if the House will indulge me, wait until we have heard those noble Lords, and I thought that Was an arrangement which was rather understood.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02460"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Our anxiety on this Bench is that before the debate proceeds further, and in order that those who take part in the debate may know what they are talking about, the noble Viscount should tell us whether our interpretation of the undertaking given to His Majesty's Ministers by His Majesty was a correct or an incorrect interpretation. We placed upon it this interpretation, that His Majesty had promised the creation of a number of Peers sufficient to ensure the passing of the Parliament Bill in its House of Commons form. We understood that no number had been specified, and we understood further that when that pledge was implemented it would be implemented in such a way that the number of Peers created would be amply sufficient to overcome any possible combination of Parties in this House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02461"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: Well, if that is all I think I had better answer. I will not say make my speech, for I never intended to make what is called a speech. We have heard a hundred times&#x2014;at the First Reading of the Bill, the Second Reading of the Bill, the Committee stage, the Report stage, the Third Reading of the Bill&#x2014;we have all of us said, both noble Lords opposite and I myself have said, we are to-day arriving at a great and critical stage&#x2014;another act of the drama. Well, to-clay at all events we have arrived undoubtedly at the last act of this particular play. The Greeks had trilogies, three dramas forming a whole, and you may have three or four. This particular stage of the Parliament Bill will conclude to-day, and speaking is not very much needed for us at all events. But then dramas are not made by words; they are made&#x2014;I do not think this is an original remark&#x2014;by situations. I will, since the noble Marquess desires it, give a plain answer
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0504"/>
<col>999</col>
to his question. He did not think me, I hope, guilty of any discourtesy in declining to answer at the moment. He knows as well as anybody, from his diplomatic practice and otherwise, that words need to be very carefully weighed in these matters, and in good faith.<lb/>
I am glad to take this opportunity of replying to the question put to me by the noble Marquess. It is a question that deserves and requires an answer that is plain, deliberate, and beyond all cavil or mistake. If the Bill should be defeated to-night His Majesty would assent to a creation of Peers sufficient in number to guard against any possible combination of the different Parties in opposition by which the Parliament Bill might again be exposed a second time to defeat. Those words do not really carry the matter any further than it was left by my noble friend Lord Crewe the other day. But if more definiteness and emphasis is required I submit that your Lordships now have it. I will read it again, because some noble Lords, including Lord Willoughby de Broke, whose zeal and energy make him so powerful a person in these operations, have said that the statement made about the creation of a large number of Peers is merely made in order to inspire your Lordships with fear.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1000</col>
am loath to use the word, but slang has invaded this great Constitutional crisis&#x2014;that it was a mere piece of bluff. The noble Marquess (Lord Lansdowne) at all events did not think so. His language last night was a perfectly correct and accurate interpretation of the language that had been used the day before by my noble friend Lord Crewe. I will say this to Lord Willoughby de Broke, that whatever be the source or the purpose of the view that he takes, it is a pure, absolute delusion. All I have to say on this part of the matter is that every vote given to-night against my Motion not to insist on what is called Lord Lansdowne's Amendment is a vote given in favour of a large and prompt creation of Peers.</membercontribution></p>

That, I think, is pretty conclusive. However intense may be your disapprobation of that proceeding, in voting against my Motion by-and-by you are making that proceeding which you disapprove of with such intensity and such sincerity inevitable; and let every noble Lord who goes into the Lobby to-night against my Motion reflect before be goes there what it is that he is doing.<lb/>
Now, I was challenged by the noble Viscount to offer some reply to the questions put to me by Lord St. Aldwyn. The chief point made by the noble Viscount last night was whether your Lordships and the public have all the Papers connected with the proceedings of last November before you.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0009P0I0505"/>
<col>1001</col>
think, so large, certainly nobody who has had a larger, experience of the great affairs of State than the noble Viscount, and he must know that these important matters are effected, especially nowadays when the distances between the Sovereign and his Ministers are not great, as they used to be&#x2014;he must know that some of the most vital transactions, transactions upon which the most serious results depend, are conducted orally, face to face, between the Sovereign and his Minister, and with no written documents at all. The Prime Minister is absent, and I have not been able to-day to ask him. But I am perfectly confident when I say that there are no documents in existence, no documents that bear&#x2014;no, I will not say that&#x2014;no documents in existence which answer to the description of what is desired and required by the noble Viscount. Mr. Asquith, in his speech last Monday in the House of Commons, stated the whole of that transaction, and be stated, I believe, the whole of the later transaction about the creation of Peers. The noble Viscount is quite in error and does us an injustice if he thinks we are keeping Papers back. Then the noble Viscount asked&#x2014;Did we lay before the Sovereign the state of decision or indecision which followed the end of the Conference, and did we speak to the King about Home Rule? I do not know how the noble Viscount is acquainted with what passed at the Conference about Home Rule or about anything else.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02470"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: I think I said I was not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02471"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Viscount has no knowledge and no authentic reason to suppose that Home Rule played a great and decisive part in the proceedings of the Conference, I think it is very unreasonable, to use a most moderate word, for the noble Viscount to ask us in this kind of interrogatory&#x2014;Did you say to the King what passed at the Conference about Home Rule? Well, we could not. When I say we could not, I was not a member of the Conference; but if the Prime Minister did not, he would surely not have been unjustified.<lb/>
Then I think the noble Viscount raised the question whether the Prime Minister suggested to His Majesty that he should, if he thought fit, make inquiries as to
<col>1002</col>
whether Mr. Balfour and the noble Marquess would be prepared to make a Government. To put that question shows a. want of knowledge and experience of the relations between the Sovereign and his Ministers that is to me incredible, there being no crisis [Opposition cries of "Oh"]&#x2014;no crisis that would justify a Prime Minister in saying to the Sovereign, "If your Majesty does not approve of our view we beg you, before you come to a decision, to be so gracious as to send for Mr. Balfour." Though great and delicate, the rules governing these affairs are pretty well understood through long tradition by anybody who has had experience of them, and I ask, Is there any occasion where, in those circumstances, a Minister would have thought it right or becoming to say, "We do not resign, but pray, Sir, send for the leaders of the Party opposite to see what they say to your Majesty"? Any one who views the situation so created will see that it is thoroughly inconsistent with English official and Ministerial traditions, and the suggestion that we should have taken such a course is a wholly unjustifiable one.</membercontribution></p>

We shall find that out, I have no doubt. But I submit that the more you examine and the better acquainted you become, so far as proper reserves allow, with the facts, the more convinced you will be that our answer to those interrogatories of the noble Viscount is an answer which honourable men
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0506"/>
<col>1003</col>
and patriotic Ministers have no reason whatever to be ashamed of, either in reference to their relation to the Sovereign himself, or to their countrymen, or to their Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02476"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I certainly did not come here to-night with any intention of speaking, and I shall not trouble your Lordships for more than a minute. But the speech of my noble friend opposite, important and weighty as it is, and wholly convincing, as I think it is, on the point at issue in the Division to-night, does raise one or two more issues than perhaps he contemplated. The misfortune of this debate is that it is almost impossible to keep the name of the Sovereign out. I do not think the charge brought by my noble friend Lord St. Aldwyn is completely valid as against His Majesty's Ministers. I do not think they were bound to advise the Sovereign in November to send for Mr. Balfour or Lord Lansdowne. I think there is only one instance, perhaps, on record of such a thing being done, and that was when Lord Melbourne went to Brighton in 1834 and laid on the Sovereign all the discredit of dismissing him, when, as a matter of fact, he had practically advised that course. I do not think anybody can maintain sincerely that it was the duty of His Majesty's Government, with a large majority in the House of Commons, to send for any other personages to form a Government. But my noble friend must remember that the circumstances were extremely exceptional.<lb/>
I venture to say that, great as the noble Viscount's knowledge of Constitutional history is, he will never find that any Minister went to any Sovereign to ask for a third Dissolution in the course of their tenure of office&#x2014;a second in the course of a single year. That, to my mind, is a circumstance of exceptional gravity. Deep as the waters may be in which we find ourselves to-night, and on my part I think they are as deep as the Pacific Ocean, we cannot overlook that grave consideration&#x2014;going to a young and inexperienced King four or five months on the Throne to ask him for a third Dissolution, a second within the year, and accompanying that demand, as I understand the case&#x2014;and this part of the case is wrapt in some obscurity&#x2014;with a request for a contingent.<lb/>
<col>1004</col>
guarantee, before they had read their Bill, perhaps, even once in the House of Commons, that should that Bill not meet with acceptance in the House of Lords, there should be an immense creation of Peers. Deep as our waters may be, I venture to say that we cannot exaggerate the enormous gravity of the position brought about by the Government at that time. That was the true Constitutional crisis. I think myself it would have been open to the Sovereign to say that before he acceded to so enormous a demand he should be allowed to take counsel with ex-Ministers and not be left entirely in the hands of His Majesty's Government, an <i>ex parte</i> body pleading their own cause with one Who was hitherto unversed in such affairs. But that is all history. It does give an unpleasant savour to the whole of this transaction. No words that I can use, and I do not mean to use any such words, would exaggerate the effect that such a transaction would produce on any impartial and thinking man in this country.<lb/>
Now I come to a far more important point, the announcement that the noble Viscount has categorically made this evening. I confess I am not very well qualified to advise your Lordships as to rejecting a measure supported by two General Elections. I am not a good adviser, because ever since I have been in this House, some 43 years, I have always been under the impression, though I was as jealous of the honour of this House as any member of it, that it was not a political instrument that was capable of achieving the purposes which its leaders thought it capable of producing. I never thought it was an instrument that could be used for rejecting what might even appear to be the will of the people without causing an exasperation and a reaction pre-eminently clangorous to the fortunes of this House. For taking that line on more than one occasion I have been reproached with cowardice in this House, and if I continued to sit here I might again make myself liable to that charge; but it is my conviction that an unreformed, hereditary House of Lords is wholly unfitted to resist great popular movements, and that is why all the time I have been in this House I have endeavoured to further the cause for reform. I do not think that this House is a body that could resist a cause or a measure supported by two General Elections.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0507"/>
<col>1005</col>
I think there is a great deal to be said about these General Elections. We swallow them rather too easily. The Government sometimes gives one account of these General Elections, and sometimes another, and never the same. The first General Election was on the Budget and not on the House of Lords. We have been told, and I am willing to accept it, that the second election was on the House of Lords, but if that were so, how could it give a mandate for Irish Home Rule? It either was an election, a Referendum as complete as could be had on the question of the House of Lords, and therefore confined to that particular object, or it was a General Election of the usual kind in which the House of Lords figured for one thing, Irish Home Rule for another, cheap food for another, and so forth. There is another point affecting these General Elections which I think has a considerable bearing on the case. They were elections both fought on the part of the Government under the most enormous bribe that has ever been given to the people of the country. Thirteen million pounds a year were to be awarded in exchange for no consideration whatever in old-age pensions to the great masses of the country, who were naturally under the influence of that boon when they came to vote at the poll. I therefore think that these General Elections are questionable in more than one respect; but we must recognise that they have taken place, and that the measure has come up with that support.<lb/>
Now, how do we find ourselves? We find ourselves chiefly divided on this [the Opposition] side of the House in arguing, not against the propositions of the Government, but on the best method of dealing with those propositions. I have tried as hard as I can to convince myself that I could do what is a congenial thing to everybody in our position, when an act of degradation and disability is aimed at us, to resist it with my noble and learned friend (Lord Halsbury) as long as Widdrington fought upon his stumps. But I cannot see more than one side of this question. You must admit that whichever side of the Opposition prevails to-night the Bill must pass. No one denies that. I see that my noble and learned friend denied it last night, but he was speaking legally. He could delay it for 48 hours; he might delay it for a week.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02482"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: The Bill is temporarily dead; but there could be a Prorogation to-morrow and the Bill could be passed rapidly through all its stages.

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02484"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My noble friend does not admit it; but I think the general sense of the House is that, after what has passed, this Bill must come into law before the 31st of December. Let me give that latitude. The only difference between the two sections of the Opposition, who loathe and detest this Bill with equal hatred, is whether it shall pass with some enormous creation of Peers, such as has just been announced by the noble Viscount, to control the future conduct of this House, or whether it shall pass without the scandal of such a Constitutional strain as that. That is the victory at which my noble and learned friend aims. Is it worth while, simply for the purpose of further degrading and weakening this House, to insist upon these futile Amendments? I read with great interest a letter from the noble and gallant Field-Marshal (Earl Roberts) in <i>The Times</i> yesterday. It was as noble and gallant as himself; but it was conducted on the principle which has done enormous injury in this discussion&#x2014;the principle of military analogy. My noble and gallant
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0508"/>
<col>1007</col>
friend conducted his military analogy with complete success. But there is no analogy between the two cases. If he does want a military analogy, let me put this case to him. Would he, if he were in command of an army, as he has so often been, be willing to obtain a slight victory in a skirmish at the beginning of a war on condition that his whole army should be flattened out next day by the enemy? That is the point.<lb/>
My Lords, this is no subject for recrimination. It is the most solemn moment the House of Lords has had to face in my lifetime or in that of many men much older. By a wise concession to the feeling of the people, under the guidance of a leader whom no one ever dared to accuse of cowardice, the Duke of Wellington, the House of Lords preserved its existence for eighty years, when without that concession it would not have had three years of life. That is one example. We stand now at the parting of the ways. Whatever happens, I recognise for my part that nothing can ever restore the House of Lords. After the Second Reading of the Bill to which we were compelled reluctantly to yield our assent, the House of Lords as we have known it disappeared. It is possible that if this Bill be allowed to go through to-night there may still be a considerable balance of party which may be of great use in opposing the Government, and which I was glad to see my noble friend the noble Viscount wished to see unimpaired. There will still be a force left in this House to oppose and even sometimes to thwart the dangerous measures of the Government. If this Bill be allowed to pass, Europe and the Empire will be spared the sight of a scandal which may go far to weaken the hold of the centre of the Empire on its component parts, and we shall be left, at any rate, with a certain amount of vitality without the strain on the Constitution involved in the creation of hundreds of Peers; whereas, on the other hypothesis, we shall be left with no power at all, flattened out completely, with an addition of hundreds of Peers, added to this House under, I must be allowed to say, a most degrading franchise, and the ruin of this ancient Constitutional Assembly will be as complete as its worst enemies could desire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02485"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT MILNER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after the important announcement which was
<col>1008</col>
made by the noble Viscount the Leader of the Government in this House and the eloquent appeal of the noble Earl who has just addressed you, I feel that I am at a certain disadvantage in trying to recall the attention of your Lordships from those wider considerations with which the debate has naturally largely dealt to the narrower though profoundly important issue which we are to decide to-night&#x2014;whether or not we are to insist on the Amendments made by your Lordships to this Bill. I am somewhat surprised at the immense importance which seemed to be attached by the last speaker to the declaration made by the noble Viscount, valuable and necessary for our consideration as that declaration was. Nothing would have induced me, or, I think, the noble Lords with whom in this matter I am associated, to advocate the insistence by your Lordships upon your Amendments whatever might happen, if we had not been prepared for the possibility of what has been called the swamping creation of Peers. If the Government are going to act upon the powers with which they are armed to the full extent by creating an artificial majority in this House&#x2014;if that is what they contemplate it adds enormously to the outrageousness of their proceedings; but it does not, to MN' mind, affect the course which noble Lords who regard this measure in the manner in which I do ought to take. We should indeed have been shortsighted if we had ever entered upon this campaign not foreseeing the possibility of such a declaration as has been made by the noble Viscount to-night. My feeling remains what it has always been&#x2014;that if we regard this measure as bad, if we regard the methods by which it has been forced upon this House as abominable, then it would be better that it should be passed, if it must be passed, by the votes of men who believe in it, rather than that it should owe its presence on the Statute Book to the acquiescence, or still worse to the votes, of those who think it a thoroughly bad Bill. I believe it would be better for the country, for the wholesomeness of our political life, and for the honour and character of all those concerned in this transaction.<lb/>
One thing which deeply influences me, and I believe many of my friends who are acting with me, in the resolution to which we have come, is the spirit in which the Government have dealt with this question
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0509"/>
<col>1009</col>
from first to last. A great deal has been said about the abuse, as we think it to be, of the Royal Prerogative. The defence offered by 'Ministers is that it was inevitable, that they were driven to it, that there was no other way out. It was only inevitable because they have pressed forward this measure in a spirit of pure partisanship and without the slightest vestige of a constructive idea. The Government have based their whole campaign on the complaint that there was inequality of opportunity between the two Parties in your Lordships' House. Has their policy done anything to diminish or to remove that inequality? Their policy is simply to reduce the proceedings of this House to such a farce that it no longer matters whether opportunities are equal or not. Very drastic proposals have been made from the Front Opposition Bench with a view to meeting the difficulty of which the Government complain. How have those proposals been met? They have been met with the most contemptuous indifference. When asked to justify their attitude the Government replied that those proposals, after all, did not remove the inequality of which they complained, and that they still left one Party in this House stronger than the other. Very likely they did; but has it never occurred to them, that it was their duty to make some proposals for the solution of the problem they themselves had raised? It was not sufficient for them merely to reject every suggestion made to them from the other side. No political controversy of great magnitude in this country has ever been dealt with by the Government of the day with a more complete and total absence of the spirit of give and take.<lb/>
The Government say to us, in effect, "We have a majority in the House of Commons. This is the measure which is approved by that majority. You are free to alter it when you in your turn command a majority."That was the way in which their case was put the other night by the most moderate and persuasive of the speakers for the Government, the noble Marquess who is not in his place to-night. That sounds fair enough. It would be fair if there was nothing in the whole business but a Party fight. But is it fair to the nation, whose supreme interest in this matter is the stability of its fundamental institutions, and not to see them altered backwards and forwards with every swing of the political pendulum?
<col>1010</col>
If there must be a change in those institutions, is it not the duty of statesmen to try and devise a system which would at least command some degree of sympathy and assent from moderate men of all Parties, and would therefore be a durable one, at any rate for a certain number of years? What is the position in which this unamended Bill will leave us if it becomes law? We may have to spend the rest of our lives in perpetual changes and counter-changes of the fundamental institutions of the country, and that position is due to what I can only call the tyranny of the Government, their tyrannous abuse of a temporary majority to coerce half, or nearly half, the nation, and the Sovereign.<lb/>
It is not heroics, and it is not a desire to strike an attitude, but it is merely common sense to refuse to yield to such an unscrupulous abuse of power. If we submit to it now, we shall only encourage the Government to repeat such abuse in the future. If we run away to-night from the threat of the creation of Peers we have no assurance, not the slightest, that that threat will not be repeated on the very first occasion, when in the exercise of our remaining exiguous powers we prove ourselves in the slightest degree inconvenient to the Government. Here comes in the relevance of that review of the past history of this matter to which I have called your Lordships' attention. We have seen the levity with which His Majesty's Government create situations, in which they are able to declare that an exercise of the Royal Prerogative is the only way out. When I consider the nearest problem which besets us in the future, it seems to me that a repetition of the tactics of the Government is not only possible but extremely probable with regard to the question of Home Rule. That is the reason, and a very good reason, why, as I believe, those Irishmen who most dread Home Rule are in favour of resistance to the present threat of the Government at any hazards.<lb/>
Suppose a year hence we have a Home Rule Bill acceptable to Mr. Redmond passed by the House of Commons, and coming up for the decision of this House. Suppose that that measure has not only created great political excitement in this
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0510"/>
<col>1011</col>
country, but has brought Irishmen in Ulster to a state verging on active resistance and that such threatened resistance has excited the rest of Ireland to fever pitch. Is it not reasonable for us to assume, after the experience we have had of their handling of this measure, that the Government would in that case be prepared to urge on the Sovereign that delay in settling the matter was dangerous and might lead to bloodshed, and that, if the House of Lords was not prepared to pass the measure at once, they would advise the Sovereign to exercise his Royal Prerogative to override the opposition of this House? If we give way to-day we shall be exposed to the same threats again and again in the future. The Government may have&#x2014;I have no doubt they have&#x2014;the power of creating such a number of Peers as would entirely destroy the independence of this House. But it is also evident to any man who hears their speeches or reads their Press that a check given them to-night would put them in a position of the greatest embarrassment. Taking the view that I do, I hold that it is the duty of those who wish to defeat the policy of the Government. to take every opportunity that they lawfully and honourably can to assist in increasing their embarrassment; not for the mere pleasure of embarrassing them&#x2014;for that would, indeed, be a contemptible motive which I do not think would actuate any noble Lords in this House&#x2014;but for a far better reason&#x2014;in order to make them pay the penalty of their unscrupulous action.<lb/>
There is one appeal which must commend itself to every loyal subject, the appeal that we should not compel. His Majesty to take a step which we are glad and grateful to know is distasteful to him. But I cannot see how the keeping of a promise already given could injuriously affect the august position of His Majesty. In this instance, so far as His Majesty is concerned, the mischief has already been done by the unfair pressure which has been put upon him by his Ministers to give that promise. And as for the future, it seems to me that the fulfilment of that promise on the present occasion would be more likely than anything else to prevent the Royal Prerogative being made use of hereafter as the normal means of bringing pressure to bear on this House. If we are going to make it easy and comfortable for the advisers of the Crown thus to abuse the
<col>1012</col>
Royal Prerogative, it is not likely that they will not have recourse to it again. On the other hand, I am firmly convinced that once you swamp this House by a large creation of Peers in order to enable the Government to ride down their opponents, the storm of odium that will be aroused will prevent any Ministry in the future from abusing the Royal Prerogative in a similar manner and will thus preserve the Kim, from being involved over and over again in our political controversies.<lb/>
It has been stated that this is a mere question of tactics and procedure, but in my opinion it is in the highest degree a matter of principle. I consider, after what has happened, that this House is as good as wiped out as a real power in British politics, and that we shall have to look in other directions for checks and safeguards against the tyranny of the single-Chamber government with which we are threatened. The wire-pullers have got the people of England by the throat, and the struggle which lies before us in the future is a struggle to free the nation, and especially that part of the nation which is not too deeply devoted to either Party, from the tyranny of the House of Commons and the wire-pullers. In that struggle the incident of to-night is the beginning, as probably it may be regarded as the end of the importance of the historic House of Lords. In that struggle those who appeal to their countrymen for support will, I think, have to create in their minds a confidence that they are not to be frightened or browbeaten by any abusive exercise of power or by any adverse circumstances whatsoever. In view of the tyrannous spirit in which tins measure has been forced on us, and in face of the combination which has been brought against us, I feel that the right course for those who think as I do is to adhere to their position, and I believe that, in spite of the adverse circumstances against which we are struggling, no one who votes to-night for insistence on this Amendment will ever regret it in the future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02486"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that I may as well begin my remarks by stating that I shall feel it to be my duty at the proper time, whenever that may be, to suggest to your Lordships, for whatever a suggestion from me may be worth, that your Lordships should not insist on your Amendments.
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0511"/>
<col>1013</col>
I propose to give my reasons now for taking that course. I am well aware that to probably very few of your Lordships will it be a matter of any particular interest to hear my reasons for my action. At the same time we who take the view that I do have been challenged to give our reasons, and all I can say is that so far as I am concerned I know perfectly well the reasons which actuate me, and I have not the slightest hesitation in imparting every one of them to the House. Let me say at once, with reference to the speech that has just been made, that I have not the slightest intention of following the practice which has occurred several times in the course of this debate of noble Lords who sit on this side of the House and take different views arguing with and contradicting one another. I do not think that any advantage is to be derived from that course. Moreover, I feel that your Lordships' time is too valuable for me to intrude upon you at any great length.<lb/>
I have had an experience to-night which I believe most of your Lordships have at some time or another gone through. The greater part of my speech has been made for me to-night by the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery. I fancy most of your Lordships know what it is to hear things which you were going to say said much better than you could say them and just before you were proposing to address the House. I labour under that disadvantage to-night, but your Lordships will be rather at an advantage in consequence, because it will be quite unnecessary for me to repeat anything that has been already said, and I am sure that you will return me grateful thanks for observing that rule, which I shall endeavour to do. As to those noble Lords who sit on this side of the House awl who take a different view from me with regard to this matter, I wish to say that, so far from owing them any grudge or entertaining any ill-feeling towards them, I, on the contrary, sympathise with and enter into all their feelings although I do not happen to share them. It is quite true that a very inconsiderable number of them have rather challenged those who hold the opinions that I do; but, as I say, I do not feel the slightest grudge against them for that, and I wish to say nothing unkind of them in any way. Rightly or wrongly, I feel that in several of their cases their zeal is so great that it has outrun their discretion, and that they
<col>1014</col>
take so deep an interest in this subject and feel so acutely the position which they have taken up that they cannot make allowance for persons like myself who entertain a different view.<lb/>
What are the reasons why I am proposing to take the course which I just now announced to your Lordships? It certainly is not for love of the Bill. I regard this Bill as an act of violence, as violent an act as if you marched soldiers up to this House and removed the Mace. It is a revolution, nothing else; and I must say I should have respected noble Lords opposite much more if they had not tried to minimise the effect of their measure so much, but had courageously stated what actually is the effect of their Bill and had stuck to that and said it was quite right. There is one other thing&#x2014;that is, the bad effect which I am afraid has been created by this Bill and which I greatly fear will endure. This Bill has imported a feeling of bitterness into our politics far exceeding anything that has ever existed before. I admit that I feel indignation at this measure and the manlier in which it has been brought forward, and when I say that I am in favour of supporting it on the present occasion I announce to your Lordships that I am doing it certainly not from any love of the Bill. I hate and detest the Bill, and I do not believe that there is any one in the House who entertains towards it feelings of a less friendly sort than I do.<lb/>
It is unnecessary for me to repeat tonight what was said with great effect and in such admirable terms by the noble Viscount, Lord St. Aldwyn, last night. The noble Viscount is recognised on both sides of the House as a man essentially impartial and essentially fair. He does not always agree with those who sit on this side of the House. I have heard him many times criticise measures which proceeded from this side of the House, and I have heard noble Lords over there cheering him to the echo for what he said. What do they think with regard to the condemnation which he pronounced of their conduct last night? We have heard some answers to-day to questions that he asked. But has any one of his questions been answered in such a way as to deserve that that condemnation which he administered should be in any way diminished?<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0512"/>
<col>1015</col>
May I add one iota to the indictment which was pronounced by the noble Viscount last night? It is with reference to the manner in which the statement made by the Prime Minister in another place was not only amended but almost partially contradicted by what Lord Crewe said in this House two nights ago. Your Lordships will remember, according to the account given of this meeting with the King on November 16, that on that day not merely was a communication made to the Sovereign but his promise appears to have been&#x2014;what shall I say?&#x2014;obtained. The other day the Prime Minister, in the other House of Parliament when giving an account of this transaction, said that the King, after considering the matter with him and Lord Crewe, felt that there was no other alternative except to do what they wished. What happened in this House the next night? Lord Crewe came here and, having received apparently, as he said, commands from the King, stated to your Lordships that the King had assented to their advice with natural and legitimate reluctance. In my opinion the Prime Minister ought to have announced a point of that sort in his version of what had occurred to the other House of Parliament. But Lord Crewe, in concluding his speech, made a remark which I should like to recall to your Lordships' attention. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"The allegation is that our action in presenting the views of the Cabinet to His Majesty last November was premature. The only answer to that is that it was not action at all. It was a conversation dealing with a purely hypothetical set of conditions."</quote>
What were the conditions? Just let me read a sentence of them to your Lordships&#x2014;
<quote>"His Majesty's Ministers cannot take the responsibility of advising a Dissolution unless they may understand that in the event of the policy of the Government being approved by an adequate majority in the new House of Commons, His Majesty will be ready to exercise his Constitutional powers, which may involve the Prerogative of creating Peers."</quote>
Is that a mere conversation about hypothetical matters? At all events whatever that conversation was it was good enough for the Government after that to immediately proceed and undertake that Dissolution which in their communication to His Majesty they said they could not undertake if he did not give them this pledge. I concur in every word that was said by Viscount St. Aldwyn on this matter, and in every word that was said
<col>1016</col>
by Lord Halsbury in reference to matters to which no answer at present has been given.<lb/>
Some of my friends on this side have said to me&#x2014;and very fairly&#x2014;"How can you, entertaining the opinion you do of this Bill and of the conduct of the Government in connection with it, bring yourself to vote with the Government?" To myself the answer seems absolutely apparent, but out of regard for my noble friends I am perfectly willing to give them the answer. It is this. When we were discussing the Bill and the conduct of the Government, no one blamed them more than I did. But what are we discussing to-night? We are discussing an altogether different set of things which have no connection with the Government but which vitally concern this House. Everybody must admit that although you may delay this Bill for a few weeks or months, it must pass. If it is not carried to-night, it will be carried by the creation of a large number of Peers. Are you, then, going to say that, in addition to this great injury which this House will receive&#x2014;without getting any compensating advantage of any kind as far as I can see&#x2014;you will willingly make yourselves instrumental to the further injury of the House being swamped by a large creation of Peers? because after what we have heard to-night all doubt on that subject has disappeared, and we need not argue that matter any further.<lb/>
For a long time I was undecided as to the course I should pursue. If I had been merely considering my own feelings I am pretty sure that I should have been on the side of those who are now differing from me, but as soon as it was announced that the Crown had sanctioned the creation of Peers then I said to myself, "That is the end of this part of the question; an entirely new state of things has arisen, and it is with that new state of things that we have got to deal." I am asked, Why do I support the Government? I do not want to quarrel over words, and I will call it supporting the Government. Really what I wish to do is to represent to your Lordships, and to carry it out by my vote, that in my judgment it is not expedient or wise under present circumstances, with this Bill as good as passed, to prolong a resistance which is not really a resistance at all and which can only end in the creation of a large number of Peers.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0513"/>
<col>1017</col>
The next thing I am asked is, why am I not content to abstain from voting and take the same course as the noble Marquess who leads the Opposition. I should be absolutely content to take that course. The advice which I suggested to your Lordships is this, that you should follow the ancient practice of registering your protest in the Journals of the House and then walk out, and I would go among the rest and leave the Government to carry their Bill. But noble Lords here say, "No, we will not take that course." Very well, then that course simply becomes impossible. The noble Marquess and noble Lords on the Front Opposition Bench are all in the position of having a Party to lead, and it is very difficult for them to divide one portion of the Party as against the other. But that does not apply to me. I have the most complete liberty of action, and therefore holding the views that I do I feel bound to give effect to those views. My vote is, after all, only a single vote. I have not canvassed any one. I have not asked a single Peer how he meant to act. After a great deal of anxious and unhappy thought I wrote a letter to the Press stating the course I intended to take. Possibly some of your Lordships may have seen that letter. Before writing it I did not consult any of those whose opinions I place value upon. That letter was written without anybody seeing it and entirely on my own initiative and under no other circumstances whatever. I have not asked a single noble Lord for a vote&#x2014;I should scorn to do such a thing. I know what answer I should get from any of those who are worthy of being Peers. A good many Peers, it is true, have written to me and asked me questions, and I have answered those questions; but beyond that I have not indicated to any single person that he should vote in this way or in that.<lb/>
It has been said that your Lordships are trustees for the country. I accept that position. I do regard myself as a trustee for the country, but I am a trustee for the purposes of the country and not for the purposes of my own personal feelings or predilections. I may be quite wrong, but I consider it my duty to take as wide and as broad and as national a point of view of the whole circumstances as possible, and acting upon that view I feel bound to vote as I propose to do. I am painfully aware that these remarks are excessively egotistical. But what else could they be? I
<col>1018</col>
have been challenged to state what my views are, and I have stated them as fully and as clearly as any language which is at my command will convey. I understand that the Duke of Norfolk, for whom I have the greatest possible regard and respect, and who in my opinion is one of the sturdiest, one of the most able, and one of the strongest Members of this House, is going to speak after me. I saw a letter from the noble Duke in the Press a few days ago, and as far as I understood that letter the meaning of it was this, that he himself did not feel very keenly inclined to vote, but that if any Member of your Lordships' House voted for not insisting on these Amendments, he himself would vote in the other Lobby, and would do all that he could to bring into the other Lobby as many as he could. I do not know personally how a policy of that kind can be carried out. If I had to carry out such a policy I can assure your Lordships that I do not know how I should set to work.<lb/>
I perfectly understand the policy of insisting on the Amendments. That is an intelligible policy, and one that I can to a great extent sympathise with. But what is not an intelligible policy, so far as my understanding goes, is for a Peer not to take any particular interest in the matter until he sees A, B, C, or D walking into the opposite Lobby. I can understand noble Lords voting for upholding these Amendments, but how any noble Lord who may not take any particular interest in this question can, simply because A or B goes into the other Lobby, think it necessary that he should vote the other way, passes my understanding. I have tried to enter into the noble Duke's mind and to invent a theory by which to justify his policy. The only theory that I can see is this. The noble Duke desires that there should be an open and fair fight between noble Lords opposite and noble Lords who wish to insist on retaining the Amendments. But what course does he take? He takes a course, in a sense, of disfranchising fellows like me. For he says, "You are not to vote; if you do vote, then I shall take a lot of Peers into the other Lobby." I apologise to your Lordships for having detained you so long, but I thought it right to state what my views were for taking the course that I am going to take. I have conveyed those views to your Lordships as well as I can, and I must leave you to judge of them for yourselves.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02487"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF NORFOLK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel considerable embarrassment in rising to address your Lordships, because for the last half-hour we have had only two biographies&#x2014;one of the noble Earl and the other of my humble self. The noble Earl gave us an exhaustive description of all that he had been thinking during the last three or four weeks, and then he was good enough to tell your Lordships all about what I had been thinking.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02488"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: I did that because I was asked to do so by Lord Selborne.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02489"><sup>*</sup><member>THE DUKE OF NORFOLK</member><membercontribution>: I am extremely obliged to the noble Earl, but I did not ask him to do so myself. He not only stated all that I had been thinking, but he was good enough to try and invent an excuse for my conduct. I am extremely grateful to him for having done so. I am very anxious, after all this personal detail, to keep myself out of the question as much as possible; but I must explain, as I have been asked the question, that the noble Earl is entirely mistaken in supposing that I did not and do not take any great interest in this question. How he could conceive that any member of your Lordships' House could possibly have been in such a mental position I cannot understand. But he seemed to think I was. On the contrary, like everybody else, I took a keen interest in it, and, like everybody else, I had great searchings of heart as to what course I should adopt, what policy it was best to follow.<lb/>
And when the time came when we were expected to state what course we should take, I was one of those who stated that they were in favour of the policy of abstention from voting. I did so because I believed that, on the whole, the danger of flooding this House with a large addition of Peers sent here specially to support measures to which we should object was a danger which we ought to strive to avert, if it was impossible to prevent the Parliament Bill becoming law whether we tried to avert the incoming of Peers or not. I am bound to say that for a time I was fully under the impression, obviously erroneously, that the Government would create a certain number of Peers, and that by supporting the policy of abstention I should not be joining in assisting this House to yield
<col>1020</col>
to a threat. I am bound to say that to that I attached very great importance. I also fully believed that the policy of abstention would not be exaggerated, and that no Peers on our side of the House would support the Government in passing this Bill into law, or, rather, in cancelling that Amendment winch was the last refuge we had designed for the people of the country against the ravages of this Bill. It may be a strange mental conception to entertain, but to my mind it is not an unnatural one, and if I do find that Peers on our side are going to give votes to support the Government I am bound to say that, so far as my single vote can cancel one of those votes, I intend to use it for that purpose.<lb/>
I cannot but think that the speech of the noble Earl (Lord Camperdown) marks a distinct epoch&#x2014;I do not know what word to use for it&#x2014;in this debate, and one which to my mind calls upon us to reconsider our position. We have known for some weeks, from the noble Earl's letter, that there were rumours that certain Unionist Peers did intend to support the Government, but we never got it in any way definitely. One noble Lord did tell me yesterday in conversation that he intended to take that course, and now the noble Earl himself has told us so in his speech. But one always hoped that these were idle rumours. As far as I can charge my memory, I have not up to the present moment tried to induce any single Unionist Peer to drop that course if he intended to take it, and to abstain from voting for the Government. I have not done that because I hoped there would be no occasion for it. But it has come to my knowledge that there are Peers who have that intention, and I do think that that has produced a very serious situation indeed, and one which we ought very gravely to consider. We ought to face it, I think, and if we ought to face it let us face it frankly and fully. What I feel about it is this, that after all these long discussions, after all these representations to our fellow-countrymen, after all the debates in this House, after all the vehement denunciations of the Government the country may wake up to-morrow to find that the Government have piloted this Bill through your Lordships' House without having had to create one single Peer, and have clone so because Unionist Peers came to their
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0515"/>
<col>1021</col>
aid and voted with them. I venture to think that is a situation of extreme gravity.<lb/>
The noble Marquess, our leader, reminded us that this is not the closing chapter of some long controversy. He told us, on the contrary, that we were preparing for a great fight. Does anybody suppose that the battle of the Constitution is going to be fought out on the floor of this House instead of on the platforms of the country? I can quite understand anybody arguing that if you can defeat a measure by not voting it makes little difference if you support it with your vote. But do you think you will be able to bring that lesson home to all those in whose minds will have to be worked out the problems with which tie issue of this conflict is involved? I therefore would appeal most strenuously and openly to any Unionist Peer who purposes by his vote to enable this Bill to become law to consider very earnestly indeed if he may not rue his action, and if lie is not putting those whom I am sure he would wish to support with all the energy he can into a very difficult and a very cruel position. We shall all of us have to fight in many places and before many audiences, and I am bound to say that I should welcome no one more than the noble Earl as an ally in this titanic struggle. But I hope the noble Earl will not think me wanting in affection or regard for him when I say that, whereas I should have welcomed his presence at any meeting of my countrymen before whom we were going to debate this question, alter the Vote he is going to give to-night I should find his company somewhat embarrassing. For if I tried with my stilted sentences to impress the meeting with the perfidy of His Majesty's Government they would in all likelihood ask me to sit down and say they would prefer to hear the arguments of the noble Earl who voted with the Government to carry the Bill. I am afraid that will be the case all over the country, and that most grievous injury will be inflicted on us in the battle we have to fight. I do think it is a most serious question. I cannot say my mind is sufficiently arithmetical to tot up all the numbers we hear, but I understand it is quite possible that the Government can carry out their purpose, and may carry it out, by the aid of Unionist votes, when otherwise, had they not obtained those votes, they would not have succeeded.
<col>1022</col>
That is the explanation or justification of the course which I think it right to take.<lb/>
One or two other questions have arisen on which I ought, perhaps, to say a few words. An incident occurred in the course of the debate to-night which I have been pondering ever since and which I cannot even now understand. The noble Viscount opposite was pressed to make a statement of the character and the scope of the guarantees the Government had obtained from the King, and he was good enough to state what they were. It seemed to me that a vast number of your Lordships were enormously impressed and astonished and even taken aback by what we were told. I was under the impression that we had known it for a very long time. Why were we packed in that sultry Lobby a few nights ago to record our vote of censure upon His Majesty's Government except for that very thing? The only difference that I could catch between what we knew before and know now was that I think the noble Viscount used the expression to-night that the Government had authority to create a sufficient number of Peers to outvote any combination which might take place. But the original letter of the Prime Minister stated, I think, that they had authority to create a sufficient number of Peers to pass the Parliament Bill in its present shape. That, of course, carried with it the obvious conclusion that that number must be adequate for such a purpose, and therefore I cannot understand why we should be taken by surprise or have our conduct influenced by that announcement.<lb/>
It is not, however, in this House that the struggle will have to take place, but in the country. The noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, drew a somewhat painful picture of a decrepit old House, ineffective and useless for all practical purposes. This House may do what it pleases. We may keep every Peer we do not like out of the House and carry on our business, entirely exclusively, by our noble selves; but we shall neither reform ourselves nor do any good unless we have the country behind us and can bring the people of the country to appreciate the position we hold. Will the country respect the Government more when they see that they have ground down the present members of this House by an influx of Peers created for that
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0516"/>
<col>1023</col>
special purpose? It is not very surprising that the Government have shown great reluctance to use the authority which has been given them by the King, for it has to be remembered that the country will begin to understand that this startling straining of the Prerogative and this extraordinary and outrageous creation of Peers are not to pass the Parliament Bill but simply and solely to cancel an Amendment which enacts that on certain great occasions the people of this country shall be allowed to express their views. Until I am contradicted, I shall hold that the people of the country will understand that that, and that alone, is the reason why this august procession is proposed of 400 or 500 coronetted individuals up the classic hall of Westminster to find seats in your Lordships' House where they may be able. When the fight is carried to the country that is a fact your Lordships ought to bear very carefully in mind.<lb/>
There is one other point. I must enter, if I may say so, my most strenuous protest against the way in which some speakers bring the King's name into this discussion. We have, I believe rightly, expressed in strong terms our opinion as to the conduct of His Majesty's Government in this transaction; but, my Lords, the King acted as a Constitutional Monarch, and did what he believed his place in the Constitution called upon him to do. I can conceive nothing which would put any Monarch in a more undignified position than to be told that the Unionist Party were going to try to save him from the consequences of that action which, as a Constitutional Monarch, he deemed it right to follow. As a loyal subject of the Crown I emphatically protest against such expressions being used of the King. I am sorry to have spoken so long, but my personal position was somewhat dragged forward by the noble Earl. Let me add that, considering the far-reaching effects that are involved upon the interests we have at heart, we ought to defend our position. I fully appreciate the gravity of the situation in regard to the number of Peers with which we are threatened, but if Unionist Peers are to be found supporting the Government in carrying this measure which we have all so much condemned, I shall feel obliged to record my vote against the Government on this occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1024</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02490"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT HALIFAX</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are three things which have been made abundantly plain in the course of this debate. The first is that His Majesty's Government have extorted from the King sufficient guarantees to carry out their policy under the scarcely veiled threat of the Crown being brought down into the arena of Party politics. The second thing is that, having obtained these guarantees and possessed themselves of the Royal Prerogative, they are using that Prerogative to enable them to carry legislation without reference to the country, although that legislation was distinctly repudiated by the country when it was before them. The third thing which has been made evident is that whereas it was a matter of common knowledge that the last days of King Edward were embittered by the conduct of His Majesty's Government, and that his days were not improbably shortened by it, we now know that his present Majesty, at whose Coronation we have been recently assisting, has been sacrificed&#x2014;I might use a stronger word&#x2014;in order to buy Mr. Redmond's support, without which the Government could not have remained in office a day. I had made up my mind, like the noble Duke who has just spoken, after much hesitation and many doubts, to follow the lead of the noble Marquess, from whom I separate myself in this matter with the deepest regret; but in view of the unprecedented conduct of the Government and of what I think to be their grave disloyalty to the King, and in view also of what has been so well expressed by the noble Duke as the grave misfortune which it would be to the country and to further resistance if it could be said that this Bill was carried by the votes of Unionist Peers, I find it impossible to reconcile it with my conscience not to go into the Lobby with the noble and learned Earl, Lord Halsbury, and I absolutely associate myself with every word that has fallen from the noble Duke, the Duke of Norfolk, on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02491"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like as an Irish Unionist Peer to state to your Lordships my reasons for so cordially supporting the line of action taken by my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition. I do not suppose that there is any one in your Lordships' House who dislikes and detests this Bill more than I do, and if I thought that there was any chance of this measure being permanently
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0517"/>
<col>1025</col>
defeated, there is no one who would follow my noble and learned friend into the Lobby to-night more readily or enthusiastically than I would. But, my Lords, I see no hope of this measure being permanently defeated. Indeed, when the letter from Mr. Asquith to Mr. Balfour was made public we could not hide from ourselves the fact that he had, by an action which I think I can justly describe as unconstitutional, unjustifiable, and treacherous, made sure of the passage of his Bill through your Lordships' House. That being the case, any opposition to or any endeavour to defeat this Bill is to my mind utterly useless on the part of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I think the present. situation is summed up by a paragraph in a leading article in <i>The Times</i> this morning, which stated that the Lords no longer possessed any power of effective resistance to the Parliament Bill. That being the condition of affairs, what is the question that I am justified in asking myself? It is, Do I prefer your Lordships' House under the Bill <i>plus</i> or <i>minus</i> 400 or 500 Peers? I do not hesitate to say that I prefer the House <i>minus</i> that addition, and I will tell your Lordships why. In the first place, if that number of Peers are created they can at any moment, under the sway of an autocratic Prime Minister at the head of a Government with a small majority in tile House of Commons, rush through your Lordships' House any measure they might think fit. Again, it would be impossible for your Lordships to reform this House, in the manner that you have suggested and shown by the Bill of my noble friend behind me, if there was in this House a majority determined only to have it reformed from a Radical point of view. Thirdly, and lastly, it would be absolutely impossible for your Lordships to repeal this measure, as the Leader of the Opposition has declared we will do, if there was a majority of Radical Peers in this House. Consequently I say without hesitation that I would infinitely prefer this Bill without the addition of those Peers.<lb/>
I know that every one on this side of the House views this Bill with detestation. I need hardly say that I sympathise most sincerely with Lord Halsbury and all his followers. I can feel for them in the dislike which they entertain for this Bill. But there is another section of the Party
<col>1026</col>
to whom I would venture to make a very humble appeal&#x2014;that is to those members of your Lordships' House who, like my noble friend Lord Camperdown, propose to go into the Lobby to-night with the Government, in order to prevent what they think will be a greater disaster, namely, the flooding of your Lordships' House by the creation of a large number of Peers. We must all respect the noble Earl for his self-sacrifice, but I do ask him to reconsider his decision. What would be the position of the Leader of your Lordships' House if, when the noble Marquess is transferred from this side of the House to the other, he was proposing to bring about a repeal of the Parliament Bill, if it was flouted in his face that a number of Unionist Peers had supported it in the Division Lobby? I therefore sincerely ask Lord Camperdown to reconsider his position. We have every one of us in this House a perfect right to hold our own views on this all important question. I have put before your Lordships the views that I myself hold. and I repeat that I sympathise most sincerely with those of Lord lialsbury and his followers.<lb/>
We all agree on one subject and one great principle&#x2014;that is, our hatred of this Bill. The only difference between us is in regard to the question of procedure and as to how we can best. make this iniquitous Bill least obnoxious. We are all working to this end, and therefore I do deprecate most sincerely, when we all believe we are honestly acting according to our consciences, that there should be any friction of any sort or kind between noble Lords on this side of the House. May I give you an example, though perhaps it is rather an egotistical one. Sir Edward Carson, one of the most brilliant. Irishmen who has ever entered the House of Commons and the Chairman of the Irish Unionist Members, is a man who for over twenty years has been my chief ally in all political matters, and a man, may I say, whom I value even more as one of my close and intimate friends. What are his views on this subject? We both cordially detest this Bill. We agree upon that; but we differ in a friendly manner as to the methods by which we should make this measure less obnoxious than it appears at the present moment. But does any one for a moment think that because of that Sir Edward Carson and I are going to differ or change our views with regard to
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0518"/>
<col>1027</col>
what this measure really means to carry&#x2014;Home Rule for Ireland? No. I hope in the autumn, with Sir Edward Carson and the Irish Unionist Members, most of whom, I am bound to admit, agree more with Sir Edward Carson than they do with me, to carry on a campaign in England and Scotland in order to convince the people that Home Rule will bring ruin, bankruptcy, and perhaps civil war to Ireland, and danger and discomfort to England and Scotland, and will undoubtedly mean those countries in the long run having to pay a large sum of money to redeem Ireland from absolute bankruptcy. That is the feeling that permeates noble Lords on this side of the House; and while we agree on principle we ought not to allow ourselves to be divided on the question of procedure.<lb/>
Lord St. Aldwyn put several questions last night to His Majesty's Government. I do not know that he received very satisfactory replies, but I should like to ask His Majesty's Government one question. In the course of the last few weeks I have asked them more than one question with regard to Ireland, but I have noticed that they have always taken refuge in silence. Will whoever speaks on behalf of the Government tell me what were the grounds on which His Majesty's Government advised His Majesty to permit a General Election in December last? That is a question to which we ought to have a reply. There was no need whatever for a General Election then. A General Election had been held in the previous January. The Budget Bill had been passed. Your Lordships' House had in no way obstructed any measure that had come up from the House of Commons, and therefore I venture to ask, On what grounds was that General Election asked for and granted? I doubt if I shall get an answer; and therefore I will furnish noble Lords opposite with my idea of the answer to that question. To me it is simple. It was because His Majesty's Government thought that it was a very favourable opportunity for them to appeal to the country, and they had every hope that in appealing to the country then they would be returned with a larger majority than they enjoyed at that time, which would render them independent of the Irish vote. That was the reason, and that I believe was the reason why during the earlier part of the election no mention whatever was made of
<col>1028</col>
Home Rule in any of the election addresses of members of the Cabinet or their leading supporters, or in their speeches. But when the election was three-parts over and they realised that their majority was not going to make them independent of the Irish vote, they then had, in obedience to Mr. Redmond, to toe the line, take up Home Rule, and declare their intention of passing Home Rule through the present Parliament. I fail to understand how Mr. Asquith can reconcile that proceeding with the statement he made in 1901 at Ladybank&#x2014;
<quote>"I have for some tune held the opinion that the Liberal Party ought not to assume the duties of office unless it can rely upon an independent majority in the House of Commons."</quote>
I would ask whoever replies to me to answer those two questions&#x2014;What was the reason for the General Election in December last, and how does Mr. Asquith reconcile the statement I have quoted with his present majority in the House of Commons?<lb/>
My Lords, I have ventured to put forward my views because I consider, as an Irish Peer differing as to methods, but as to methods only, from my friend Sir Edward Carson, the Chairman of the Irish Unionist Party, that it is right to him and to myself that I should make my position clear. My speech, I acknowledge, has been absolutely superfluous. The speech of my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition embraced every opinion that I myself hold, and to every word of that speech I give my strong support. I am glad indeed to think that the views which I hold, and which many on this side hold, were put forward in a speech so able, so eloquent, and so clear; and I venture to think, whether noble Lords opposite agree or disagree with the speech of my noble friend, they will be glad indeed that they were privileged to be here on such an occasion and to hear that speech, which I am sure will not be easily eliminated from their minds.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02492"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to address your Lordships for two reasons. First of all, because it has been my lot to take rather a different attitude with regard to this Bill from that taken by some of my noble friends. From the very first I have held the opinion that we ought never to have yielded one iota to the proposal of this Bill, and that we ought to have rejected the Bill on the very first day we properly could have done so without
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0519"/>
<col>1029</col>
giving the Government the smallest rope of any sort or kind. My second reason for addressing your Lordships is that I cannot help feeling that in a great many of the speeches we have heard in the course of this debate the whole question has been looked at from a piece-meal point of view. I do not think we can understand the real character of the struggle in which we are engaged unless we take the history of it and look at it as a whole.<lb/>
I am not going to follow the line of my noble friend Lord Camperdown, in which he implored us not to criticise the attitude of those who sit on the same side of the House as ourselves and from whom we have to differ. I do not think it is any use in politics not to fight, if fighting is necessary, whoever that fight may be with, although I entirely repudiate the idea that because I may differ strongly from any personal friend of my own on a political question and have to fight him&#x2014;and certainly if I do differ from him and have to fight him I shall not fight a bloodless fight, but shall hit him as hard as I can&#x2014;such a fight made the slightest difference to our personal friendship. I am not going to ask which is the more courageous course to adopt. I am not asking your Lordships to say that such and such a noble Peer shows more courage than another&#x2014;I do not know whether it is courage, or ignorance, or sagacity, or anything else. It is of no importance to me why a noble Lord is going to take a particular course; the only thing that is of importance to me is the course he takes, and that course I shall criticise as much as I please.<lb/>
If we are to go into the history of this measure, it must be remembered that we are constantly told&#x2014;we were told the other night from the Woolsack&#x2014;that the origin of this Bill was our rejection of the Budget. I think the noble and learned Earl's words were that the rejection of the Budget made this Bill inevitable. But our memories are not quite so short as that. Do we not know that when Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman came into office the very first thing he did was to declare war against the House of Lords? I will admit that the rejection of the Finance Bill gave a very great excuse to the Government to attack the House of Lords. In December last the Government announced that they were going to appeal to the country, and they put this question in the forefront of the
<col>1030</col>
battle. What, then, was the conduct which we on this side of the House pursued? We announced instantly to the country, on the eve of the General Election, that we were prepared to resign our right over Money Bills. What does that mean? It means that the only thing which stands between the spoliation of property, the only thing which represents property in this country&#x2014;this House&#x2014;announced before the election took place that it was prepared to at once give up that valuable safeguard. That was the first move that we made in this matter. Then on the very eve of the Dissolution we invented the Referendum. I am not going to discuss the Referendum to-night, but I do say that it was a thing which was entirely novel to this country, and anything more injudicious than just before. a General Election to commit the Party, whom you had not consulted and could not consult, from the very circumstances of the case, to a totally new-fangled addition to the Constitution&#x2014;any more fatal error than that I cannot conceive.<lb/>
We have heard a great deal about the verdict of the people at the last election. We have been told <i>ad nauseam</i>&#x2014;we were told from the Episcopal Bench last night&#x2014;that nobody can doubt that the last election was in favour of this Bill. I do not believe one word of it, and I cannot conceive how any one with experience of electioneering can honestly say such a thing. The whole country had been well bribed by the reckless finance of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the liberality of other people, and it was asked whether it liked the present Government. It liked them very much, naturally&#x2014;not enough to give them an increased majority, for in fact they lost a few seats, but still I admit it liked them very much. But as to this Bill, they neither knew nor cared anything about it. The Reform Bill of 1832 has been quoted over and over again. I wonder whether the people who quote it have ever read the history of that Bill. There was some interest aroused in the country then, and a very unpleasant interest it was, too. The country was very nearly on the verge of revolution then; but when you compare the present state of things with the condition of things in 1832 and tell me that the people are anxious to change the Constitution of the country and to abolish the House of Lords, my answer is that they know nothing whatever about the question and do not care two brass farthings about it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0520"/>
<col>1031</col>
The Government are prepared to take advantage of that condition of things, and to do it at a very curious moment. Both sides of the House admit that the House of Commons is not a representative body. The noble Viscount, Lord Haldane, told us last night that the House of Commons was not representative and could not be representative as long as there was plural voting. That is a remark which does not hold water for a moment. But we do know that the constituencies are so enormously mixed up and so outweighed on one side and small on the other that the House of Commons does not in any sense represent the feeling of the country. We all know, too, that Ireland is enormously over-represented. It is at a time when these things are admitted, when the House of Commons is not representative and when the people are apathetic, that you have brought forward this; and I am sorry to add that it is under these circumstances that we started in the campaign by giving up our power over Money Bills and by introducing a totally new and unknown element into the Constitution&#x2014;namely, the Referendum. When we came to the Second Reading of the Bill I said that if I could get any noble Lord to divide the House against the Second Reading I would vote with him; but the loyalty of the Party to our much respected chief was such that nobody would "bell the cat," and so we went on to Committee.<lb/>
I have never understood really why we went into Committee on this Bill. The only reason that I have heard alleged was that it was necessary in order to enlighten the country as to the absurdities which the Bill contained. There are a certain number of noble Lords in this House who imagine that they are enlightening the country when they take part in the debates in this House. I frankly confess that I have no illusions upon that point whatever. I know perfectly well that one half of the population never read debates at all, and that the other half of the people read the reports of the debates in newspapers belonging to their own Party, which so travesty anything said on this side of the House that I am sure it would not be recognised by the speakers. I have discovered that myself. I saw a speech of my own the other day in a paper called <i>Reynolds's Newspaper.</i> I know it is very hard for a man to know himself, but I really did not recognise either myself or my speech or my sentiments in any word or line of that report. We waste our time in
<col>1032</col>
this House if we imagine that by getting Bills into Committee and debating them we are enlightening the country. I think that we committed a very great mistake in not resisting this Bill on Second Reading because I believe it gave the country the impression&#x2014;quite falsely I admit&#x2014;that we were not against the principle of the Bill, otherwise we would have voted against it.<lb/>
I was very much struck by a remark made by the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition yesterday or the day before. He said that our having gone into Committee made us impotent to resist the Bill at the present stage. That I am not sure is not the truth, but I should not have thought the noble Marquess would have been of that opinion. Another thing he said, with which I quite agree, was that the Amendments which he introduced into the Bill left it a bad Bill. Very well, how have we been defending our trust? We have not voted against the Second Reading; we have made ourselves impotent to resist the Bill as it stands; and with our Amendments we have left the Bill a bad Bill. I did try at the first opportunity to save the House from declaring its intention of turning this Assembly into an elective Assembly. I thought that was a little strong, and I moved that your Lordships should leave out the Preamble of the Bill, but I think the whole of our Front Bench, with the exception of my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury, voted against my Amendment, and they did not oppose the Third Reading.<lb/>
What is our record with regard to this Bill when we go before the country We all admit that we have got a trust, a responsibility, in this House, and yet at no one stage of this Bill have we made any effective opposition at all, and we are not prepared even now to stand against it. I cannot conceive a more pitiable ending to the House of Lords. I have protested from the first against the Bill, and I protest to the end. There is the cry that we are going to restore the Constitution of this country at the first chance we get. That is a very good argument for those who stand to their guns, but not for those who are doubling to the rear as fast as they can go. That is the position we are placed in by noble Lords who make this cry. I have been asking myself, Why is it that we are to yield upon the present occasion, as is recommended to us by so many of our noble friends? First of all, they say it is a
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0521"/>
<col>1033</col>
dreadfully unconstitutional thing that 300 or 400 or 500 Peers should be made. Of course it is. But when once you tell an unscrupulous Party, conscious that they will stick at nothing, that you will yield to threats of this kind, you may be perfectly certain that the liberties of this House have gone, and I do not care for my own part whether the Peers are made in 1911 or 1912 or 1913. One of two things is evident, either that you must be the slave of the House of Commons or you will have sooner or later this very creation of Peers which you are now seeking to avoid.<lb/>
Then the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition said that the creation of Peers would be injurious to this House and disgraceful to the country. I think that. is a very adequate and proper expression of the situation. But who are going to be disgraced? The noble Lords who are coming in, bought beforehand, who are going to take their seats and to vote according to the bidding of the Prime Minister are going to be disgraced, and I am not sorry to have the opportunity of saving that I think the disgrace will be overwhelming. I can say that without a breach of order before they come in, although it might be difficult afterwards to express in adequate language the contempt I feel for them. Those who procure their presence here are, in my opinion, still further degraded. Procurers generally are more degraded than those they procure. But, my Lords, are we to be degraded by their presence? Can you be degraded by the presence of the degraded? I think you cannot, except by your own fault. The noble Viscount, Lord Midleton, said that it was necessary to keep up the dignity of this House, and that these new Peers would no doubt strive to keep it up. Let us ask ourselves of what the dignity consists. The dignity of this Chamber consists in the tone of its debates, and I do not think if these Peers were introduced they would do much to interfere with the dignity of our debates if the Peers which His Majesty's Government have added to this House of recent years are to be taken as an example. The dignity of the Chamber also consists in its power of action and its weight with the country, and what power of action and what weight with the country will the House of Lords have when it has shown itself willing to bow to the threats of the present Government sooner than have the creation of Peers?<lb/>
<col>1034</col>
I was very much struck, when the noble Earl, Lord Rosebery, was speaking, with the contention that he seemed to think so important as to whether if this Bill was rejected we should have a week or a month or six months in which to draw breath before another Bill was introduced and passed. He said that it did not matter whether that occurred next week or next December. But what is the permanent condition of this House under this Bill? We are to have eighteen months of liberty and then none. That is the condition my noble friend Lord Bosebery wants to inflict upon this Rouse permanently and for ever, a condition of things which I venture to say is absolutely incompatible with dignity and independence. It is far better, I am convinced, that, the country should realise what it is that is being done. If there are introduced 200, or 300, or 400, or 500 Peers I do not think there will be any very immediate effect, but I am perfectly certain that the country would not stand it long. Something would have to be done, and as what I desire above all things is a strong Second Chamber. I look forward with satisfaction to anything which will force upon the attention of the country and His Majesty's Government the absolute necessity for the reform of this House. I am not in the least frightened of the creation of these Peers. I cannot say that. I welcome them or that I would have any respect for them, but I do not see that they can do us any harm, and I think they will indirectly do a great deal of good.<lb/>
I must protest against one thing which Lord Midleton said. It is the first time I have ever heard anyone in the responsible position of an occupant of the Front Bench of either House of Parliament make such a remark. He told us that if we carried our point to-night by a small Division we must reflect that we were carrying it with the aid of some of the most ignorant people in the House. That might be said of every near Division which has ever taken place in Parliament, and I really do not know where such arguments are going to end. What is the excuse given by His Majesty's Government for bringing forward this Bill? I have been very much struck by the disregard of all precedent. The Government say that they have brought forward this Bill because of the absolute necessity of the case. The noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack said, "What
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0522"/>
<col>1035</col>
are we to do? We cannot get on; there is no check on the House of Lords, and how can we get on with an omnipotent House of Lords?" Lord Haldane took the same line. I challenge the noble and learned Earl to give us any reason for such a statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02493"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (EARL LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: The House of Lords has never in the whole course of its constitution acted as it has done between 1905 and now.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02494"><member>THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND</member><membercontribution>: I deny it point blank. With all respect to the noble and learned Earl, I say the House of Lords have done nothing since the present Government came into office which they have not done over and over again, with the one exception of rejecting a Money Bill in very peculiar circumstances in order to give the country an opportunity of expressing an opinion upon it, and then only once. It has arisen through the incapacity of the Government to carry on Constitutional government. That requires statesmanship. It requires no statesmanship to carry on unconstitutional government, and it is because the Government cannot govern that they are obliged to have recourse to these violent measures. I had an opportunity of telling Lord Haldane that weakness and violence generally go together. He did not seem to know that, because he said that some accused the Government of violence and some of weakness. I am rather sorry he is not in his place because I had some remarks for him. The Government say they want this Bill in order that they may have an unfettered democracy. I am afraid that means in order that they may have an unfettered Prime Minister.<lb/>
We may have to go through a very bad time, but I am quite sure. it will be worth while going through that bad time if the eyes of the country in the end are thoroughly opened to the position in which we are placed. I think it was Lord Curzon who said that the Government had initiated a revolution of which no man could see the end. I do not altogether agree with him. I do not think there is any difficulty whatever in seeing the end, although we may not be able to see the steps. We are now standing on the edge of the precipice of single-Chamber government, and that, it seems to me, is the end desired by His Majesty's Government. There is only one
<col>1036</col>
hope, I believe, for this country. That is that there should be a body of men in the country who will stand up through thick and thin for principles without regard to consequences of any sort or kind, and who will say, "These things are right, and you may depend upon us to stand by them."<lb/>
I am tempted to ask your Lordships to let me quote a short passage from a work with which doubtless you are all acquainted. It is supposed to be the advice which an old statesman is giving to a younger one. It is as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"Choose your part from the instinct of your order, from your birth, or from habit or what not; but having chosen it, follow it to the end. Stand by your Party or your order, and especially in the hour of trial or danger be sure you never falter; for be certain of this, that no misery can be equal to that which a man feels who is conscious that he has proved unequal to his part, who has deserted the post in which he was set, and who, when men said, 'Such and such a one is there on guard, there is no need to take further heed,' has left his watch or quailed before the foeman, to the loss, perhaps the total ruin, of the cause he had made Ids choice. I pray God that such misery as this may never be yours."</quote>
It is a Party which has such a spirit within it which may yet regenerate this country and undo all the havoc which the present Government are doing and which other Governments have done. I see in a letter to the papers yesterday that Mr. Balfour says this&#x2014;
<quote>"No section of the Unionists is likely to impute to their leaders either want of courage or want of resolution. They are well aware that if Lord Lansdowne or I supposed that the policy which we recommend involved surrender it would be no policy of ours, and that if we regarded the opposite course as fighting we should fight to the bitter end."</quote>
Yes, my Lords, we quite believe that. But what we cannot understand is that they do not think that surrender is surrender; they do not think that fighting is fighting. The noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, said the other night&#x2014;
<quote>"We shall want a united Party to reconstitute the Constitution."</quote>
Yes we shall, but we shall want a united Party not only in this House but in the country, and if we are to have a united Party in the country, believe me&#x2014;and I think I know what I am talking about&#x2014;we must give the Party in the country the belief that we have principles that we mean to stick by, and the course which we take in Parliament must be clear and plain in order that the people in the country may
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0523"/>
<col>1037</col>
understand it. I hope I shall not be misunderstood. I am not suggesting for a moment that the noble Marquess on the Front Bench below me and those who are acting with him are acting from any lower principle than we are acting from, but I do say that the course which they are adopting gives to the country the impression that they avoid plain issues, that they do not vote according to plain principles, and avoid taking that straight course in political matters which is comprehensible to the people.<lb/>
I am perfectly certain of this, that unless some strong section of the Unionist Party can be got together to fight in and out of Parliament for principle apart from tactics and apart from results, you will never rally the people of this country round you, and that the defection and apathy which you see now in the country will go on increasing. It is my belief that those who are following my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury to-night are acting in the spirit which I have indicated. I believe they will infuse an immense degree of life and courage into our Party in the country. I am as clear as I can be&#x2014;and I have given the best consideration I can to the point&#x2014;that the course we are now pursuing is the true patriotic course, and while I regret extremely to have to do anything which appears to be at variance with my loyalty to the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, allow me to say this. I have hitherto and up to this point taken no steps that could possibly be interpreted as disloyal to my noble friend, and though it gives me the greatest regret now to differ from him and to set up my judgment against what I am quite sure under most circumstances is his much better judgment, I ant clear that the course we are taking tonight is the right one and one for which posterity will thank us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02495"><member>THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am quite sure, whether we agree with him or not, that we shall all have the greatest respect for the consistency with which the noble Duke has pursued his present course. At the same time we have great admiration for the splendid and sublime indifference which he invariably exhibits towards every other deliberative Assembly except the House of Lords. It is impossible for me to regard the opinions and the feelings of a large number of my fellow-citizens with the complete in-
<col>1038</col>
difference which the noble Duke does. We have, I believe, on this side of the House, under the guidance of the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, taken a course throughout these proceedings which is perfectly clear, perfectly consistent, and can be perfectly well understood throughout the country. We admitted the fact of the last two General Elections; we accepted the Bill in principle; and while we admitted that we could never make the Bill a good Bill we made an effort to take away some of its most palpable defects. We have been only filially overruled by the action of the Government, by which the Prerogative of the Crown was, in our opinion, most ungenerously and most cruelly brought in.<lb/>
We object to the Government's action. We object to the methods which they have pursued in connection with that action. I believe there are many who do still attach importance to a Resolution of your Lordships' House, and with all the solemnity which lay in our power we have expressed the strongest possible disapproval of the action of His Majesty's Government. Is it worth while to stretch resistance beyond that point? We have by every power which lay within us expressed our opinion, and I confess that I take a higher view of the intelligence of my fellow-countrymen than the noble Duke does. He seems to be under the impression that it is not possible to impress the country as a whole unless there is an ocular demonstration. I have sufficient confidence in the intelligence of my fellow-citizens to think that we shall be able to make this action clear, to unmask the Government, and to explain their tactics and their proceedings. I absolutely fail to appreciate the contention of noble Lords that it is better to have 400 or 500 gentlemen go through the farce of taking their seats in this House in order that the country may be impressed therewith. What effective action is there that we can take, either within or without this House, which could prevent the Parliament Bill becoming law? If there was the slightest chance, within the hour or two which remains before the decision must be given, of noble Lords pointing out a single effective way in which we could prevent the passage of this Bill, I should undoubtedly refuse to follow the advice of my leader and would vote with them; but hitherto not one single word has been
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0524"/>
<col>1039</col>
said to explain how it is possible to prevent the passage of this Bill.<lb/>
Another misconception is that if Peers are to be created the creation will be a small one. I venture to say that that has been dispelled once and for all to-night. If the Bill has to be passed by the creation of Peers the creation will be a large one. There is, I believe, another misconception in the minds of many of my noble friends, which is that if this Bill passes through Parliament without the creation of Peers the Government would take the opportunity of creating Peers in order to pass Home Rule and Disestablishment. I can believe almost any iniquity of the present Government, but I do not honestly believe that if this Bill passed through without the creation of Peers the Government could be guilty of so despicable, dishonest, and contemptible an act as to ask the King to give guarantees that he would create Peers either to pass or expedite the Home Rule Bill or the Welsh Disestablishment Bill. I am quite sure that any idea that the guarantees were to be extended for any other purpose than that of carrying this Bill is absolutely erroneous.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02496"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: May I ask the noble Duke to say in what circumstances he thinks it is even possible? I do not understand how such a case could arise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02497"><member>THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: I am in entire agreement with the noble Viscount. I do not think it possible that such a case could arise, and I am glad if I have been able to remove the misconception which exists in the minds of noble Lords on that point. But I do hope that it will not be necessary for any Unionist Peer to vote with the Government. We have had an interesting discussion between Lord Camperdown and the Duke of Norfolk, and while I can perfectly understand the attitude taken up by Lord Halsbury and the Duke of Northumberland, though cannot agree with it, I fail to understand the attitude taken up by the Duke of Norfolk. The noble Duke appears to be under the impression that this Bill ought not to be carried by Unionist votes. Certainly every Unionist hopes that it will not be necessary to use his vote for the purpose of carrying this Bill. That would be a repugnant and odious proceeding. The great influence and power which the Duke of Norfolk possesses would, I venture to think, be much better exercised in an
<col>1040</col>
endeavour to prevent those who might be intending to vote with Lord Halsbury to-night from taking that course, and to persuade them to follow the course suggested by their leader and abstain from voting altogether. There need not be any necessity for a single Unionist Peer to vote with the Government if a sufficient number of those who have expressed their intention, unwisely I think, to insist on our Amendments would abstain from doing so.<lb/>
It is useless for me to refer at any length to the magnitude of the crisis. We all appreciate the difficulties with which we have to contend, and I hope that. we may all recognise that any action which we may take to-day is prompted by honesty of purpose and sincerity. But to those who may have some difficulty in definitely coming to a conclusion I do make a most earnest appeal to have regard to the position in which our leaders have found themselves. The advice which they have given has not been lightly given. It has been given clearly and categorically; and I do venture to remind those who are going to vote with Lord Halsbury to-night&#x2014;a minority composed of distinguished men, and men who have every right to their opinions and every right to express them&#x2014;that they can never be more than a minority ill the House. I ask them to consider the position in which they are going to place their leaders on possibly the greatest question that has occurred in our lifetime.<lb/>
Advice of a clear, final, and definite character has been given by the responsible and trusted leaders of the Party. I ask that before a minority of the House causes" those dangers which are apprehended by our leaders they will pause and consider the action they are taking. I know it is not right to drive Party loyalty too far; but on an occasion of this character I do venture most respectfully to ask noble Lords to consider the position in which our leaders will be placed. If the advice which they have given is rejected and the action of noble Lords is followed by the disaster of the creation of Peers, I fail to see how the position of our leaders can be anything but intolerable. I hope that, before that is brought about by the action of any of those who on all other occasions are our loyal supporters, those noble Lords will most carefully consider the consequences of their action.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02498"><sup>*</sup><member>VISCOUNT TEMPLETOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like at the outset to make it perfectly dear that there is no such thing as any sense of disloyalty in my mind in recording my vote, as I intend to do tonight, in favour of the maintenance of Lord Lansdowne's Amendments in this Bill. I do not approach this question from a personal point of view only. If I did, the few words which I propose to address to you would be very much curtailed, because I would merely say that I think the Bill is wrong and iniquitous and that, that being my conviction, I intended to vote against it. But I speak, not for myself alone, but for one of the most loyal, most law-abiding, and most faithful set of men&#x2014;aye, and women&#x2014;in the United Kingdom. I refer to the loyalists of Ireland.<lb/>
I will explain why I feel confident that the great majority of those Unionists are in favour of the way in which I propose to vote to-night. I sent out to the Unionist Clubs of 'Ireland, who may be regarded practically as the constituents of the Irish Unionist Members of the House of Commons, a circular asking them this question, and this question alone&#x2014;" If the Parliament Bill is returned by the House of Commons to the House of Lords with the Lansdowne Amendments disagreed to, what do you wish?" I did not ask them to tell me how I was to vote; I asked them to tell me how they wished I should vote; and those clubs, to the number of 121, and many more since not confined to Ireland, unanimously returned the answer that if I recorded my vote as they wished I would record it in favour of the Lansdowne Amendments forming part of the Parliament Bill. We have heard a good deal about the will of the people. I venture to say that in the action I am taking I am giving effect to the will of the people; and bow anybody can say that I am trying to go against the will of tin people passes my understanding. Surely the crisis is grave enough. Every man ought to vote according to his conscience and. in such a way that he is able to meet the people of the country and say that so long as he had power left he voted against the Bill, believing it to be a bad and iniquitous Bill.<lb/>
What is the situation which has been produced by this Bill? I do not wish to enter into matters which have been dealt
<col>1042</col>
with ably by other members of your Lordships' House, but I do say, speaking for the loyal people of Ireland, that the Government have placed the Crown in a false position; they have deceived the people; and in a few hours they are about to wreck the Constitution by establishing a single-Chamber tyranny. What is the position which we in the North of Ireland take up? Without claiming to speak for all, I certainly am able to speak for some. We say that you have no right, without consulting the people of this country, to hand us over to an alien Parliament in Dublin to be governed by people to whom we will 11 ever own allegiance. If I know the minds of the leaders of the people in the. North of Ireland, it is this. They have definitely stated that they will not pay taxes to such a Parliament, and that they will not recognise its decrees. By this Bill the Government are driving a most loyal, law-abiding, successful, and prosperous. people to the verge of civil war. I suppose I might as well ask that there should be no such thing as the rising of the sun to-morrow morning as ask that the Government should not do this. But, my Lords, there it is. Our views are solid on this question. We are not going to have Home Rule. We know that this Bill without Lord Lansdowne's Amendments spells Home Rule, and we absolutely decline for that reason to vote for the Bill passing in the form in which it was sent up to us by the House of Commons.<lb/>
It is said that if we allow this Bill to go through we shall have two years in which to fight Home Rule. As a matter of fact the period is only eighteen months. I for one do not believe that that eighteen months is worth anything. The same pressure which has produced the present state of affairs might produce a similar state of affairs in six or twelve months' time, and therefore the period of delay which the Bill allows seems to me an inadequate <i>quid pro quo</i> for letting the Bill pass. it has been said to-night that it is proposed at some future time, by following the lead of the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne, to win the country over to our way of thinking. But in the meantime I ask myself this&#x2014;Is there not a very great chance, instead of winning the country over to ourselves, that we shall lose a great number of our Party if we do not show a little vitality in voting against this Bill?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02499"><member>*LOAN EBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would not trouble you with my views upon the vital issue which is before the House if I did not feel that the eminent men who uphold the cause of "No surrender." are entitled, from one who is as grateful to them as I am, to something more emphatic than a silent vote. Nothing is farther from my thoughts than to apply any harsh or unseemly term to the counsel which we have received from the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition, but I think those who approve that policy must be at least content to meet those who object to it upon the broad ground that it is a policy of surrender; and of surrender because we are faced, in a concrete form, with a proceeding the likelihood of which has been common talk for many months, and which cannot have been absent from our minds when Amendments were moved in Committee, one of which, at All events, it was perfectly clear that the Government in their dependent situation could not possibly accept. And now because the Prime Minister, throwing all Constitutional precedent to the winds, has at hand and threatens to use a weapon which he warned us months ago he would not retain office unless he could obtain, we are to stand aside and let him pave the way to revolution in order to avoid the still completer revolution which it is alleged that the execution of his threat would involve.<lb/>
Is it consistent with common sense to suppose that the supporters of the Constitution in the country can follow these studies in comparative degrees of revolution? The fact will stand out that, after an imposing but meaningless resistance, you have given way to that which you denounced in solemn and emphatic language, and the conclusion you may be sure will be very hotly pressed that you did it out of trumpery consideration for your own social <i>status</i> and social dignity. That conclusion will be grossly incorrect, but it will rest upon a basis of antecedent probability, and so far as it prevails your Lordships will lose that influence in the country which it is needful you should exercise for the welfare of the people and for the defence of the Monarchy.<lb/>
May I for a moment examine the alternative?&#x2014;the dread and dire alternative in deference to which we are to sacrifice our freedom of action and our political consistency. It is said that unless we do this the House will be desecrated by a
<col>1044</col>
swarm of what are generally described as "Blackleg Barons," who will pass Home Rule and commit every other conceivable atrocity, which it seems to be quite forgotten can be perpetrated just as well without as with them as soon as this Bill becomes law, but which, assuming their presence, will be perpetrated without the intervention of that variously estimated period of grace to which some of your Lordships attach so much importance. I regard that period of grace with the greatest possible suspicion. It is a gift from the enemy, and therefore to be feared. It has the semblance of reality, but nothing more than the substance of a sham. Is it likely, to begin with, that this House, humiliated by surrender under very ignominious conditions and in the face of pressure and menaces of which we have already had a foretaste, will during that period exhibit those very virtues of firmness and courage which it is now invited to discard? The words are as true now as they were 2,000 years ago&#x2014;<i>Nec vera virtus cum semel excidit curat reponi deterioribus.</i><lb/>
There is another aspect of the question which seems to me to demand careful consideration. If you stick to this period of grace you will give to the Government an absolute lease of power during its continuance. They are bound to satisfy their Irish supporters with a measure of disintegration; they will conciliate their Nonconformist allies with a measure of disestablishment or irreligious education, or both; and they will placate the Cerberus of Socialism-cum-Labour with some of those sops which they are so ingenious in compounding for his edification; and all those factions will be as tractable as poodles because they will know that there is ample time for their respective requirements to be complied with and to become law. If you remove the guarantee and let them realise that it is a case of first come first served, there will be friction and a struggle for precedence which will give the Government a very rough time, and not unlikely bring to the ground that misshapen fabric of which hypocrisy is the material and log-rolling the cement.<lb/>
There is one other point I should like to refer to because it involves an argument which has been a good deal administered to us in the form of consolation, and which may be epitomised in the phrase "The time will come."Yes, my Lords,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0527"/>
<col>1045</col>
if this Bill passes the time <i>will</i> come&#x2014;it always does in such cases&#x2014;and if precedent is followed it will have a prelude the revolting details of which are known to no one better than to the noble Viscount who has championed the provisions of this iniquitous measure. As regards the issue before the House, I think the question of principle has clearly marked out. No exaggerated interpretation of <i>force majeure</i> can justify anybody in shirking a trust which he is capable of discharging. That alone would be sufficient to guide my vote. But if I were content to throw principle overboard and to look at the matter from a frankly opportunist point of view, even then I should not be able to concur in the course suggested by the noble Marquess, whose counsel I have so frequently followed before, and hope, if I live long enough, to follow again.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02527"><member>VISCOUNT MORLEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we now come to the operation which we have decided to adopt of considering the Commons Reasons for dissenting from your Lordships' Amendments. There are, as I ventured to say last night, seven points as to which differences have arisen between the two Houses. Three of those seven points, as we shall see as we proceed, present, I think, no reason whatever for difference. The noble Marquess last night rather brushed aside as if they were things of no concern the three points which had been points of contention and were so no longer. To-night, however, we have to go through the Amendments one by one. The first Amendment, as your Lordships are well aware, is to substitute a Joint Committee for the Speaker, as the authority for deciding what is a Money Bill and what is not a Money Bill. The Commons dissent from that proposal; and the Government in the House of Commons have added to the Speaker as persons whom he was bound to consult, the decision remaining with him, the Chairman of Ways and Means and the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. The Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee was chosen because he is always, or at least by our practice, a member taken from the Opposition, Then some fault was found&#x2014;even last night the fault was intimated by the noble Marquess, Lord Lansdowne&#x2014;at the introduction of the words "if practicable."Those words might, no doubt, contain any quantity of sinister possibilities. That was not in the least the idea of the Government when they proposed that form of fixing the deciding authority. All they meant by the words "if practicable" was to cover the case where the man was ill and could not be consulted or where there was a vacancy in his office for the moment. That is perfectly reasonable. That is the proposal made by the Government in substitution for the proposal of your Lordships of a Joint Committee as the deciding authority as to what was a Money Bill and what was not. In discussion it came about that the change was made with the full assent, as I am credibly informed, of both sides, Mr. Balfour himself not disagreeing. The form in which your Lordships have to consider it is this&#x2014;that the Speaker is to remain the deciding authority, but is directed to consult, before giving his certificate that it is a Money Bill pure and simple, two members
<col>1048</col>
to be appointed from the Chairman's Pane] at the beginning of each session. We could argue for any length of time; but all I can assure your Lordships is that that new form of fixing the deciding authority is accepted by both sides. I therefore have to make two Motions&#x2014;first, that your Lordships do not insist upon the Amendment substituting a Joint Committee; and when your Lordships have, agreed not to insist upon that, I shall move to insert, as a consequential Amendment, the Amendment that I have just been describing.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02532"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF MEATH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords you have all heard to-day the fateful announcement made by the noble Viscount I who leads the House, and we must feel that that is a pronouncement which will have the most lasting effect upon the history of this Kingdom and this Empire. Therefore perhaps I, who do not often I take a part in your political movements because I think that I can direct my energies to more public use in other directions, may be allowed upon this historic occasion to say a few words. There can be no doubt whatever that a revolution has been accomplished. This is the end of the historic House of Lords which has lasted for 700 years. I believe firmly that a better and a stronger Chamber will grow out of this unconstitutional action. I believe in my own countrypeople, and I am of opinion that when the country realises why all this violence has been committed they will not sanction it permanently.<lb/>
Why has this violence been committed? Is it because the House of Lords has refused to pass the Parliament Bill? Not a bit of it. It is because the House of Lords has added Amendments which give power to the people to have the last voice in the management of their own affairs, and I
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0529"/>
<col>1049</col>
am very much mistaken in the temper of my countrymen if, when they realise what is the true meaning of this attack on the Constitution, they do not resent it and refuse to forgive those who have been responsible for offering such advice to the Sovereign. We have had a revolver of the very latest construction presented at our heads, and we know now that that revolver is loaded and is about to be discharged. We knew that before, although some of your Lordships did not believe it. I believed it, and I believe the Party with which I have the honour to act at this moment as a humble supporter of Lord Halsbury recognised it from the very commencement, and that is why we have ventured to take the course, not a popular or an easy course, of differing from over 320 Unionists with whom we have usually had occasion to act in common.<lb/>
But, my Lords, principle is above tactics and above Party policy, and I feel that it would have been the direst cowardice on our part if we had ventured for one moment to consider this yielding or not yielding as a matter affecting our own individual advantage, our social position, our position as one of the Estates of the Realm. We should look upon it simply and solely from the point of view of what is best for the nation and for the people. We are here as trustees for the people, and as trustees for the people we must act. Trustees when they are acting on behalf of their clients have not to consider whether a particular course of action gives them trouble or whether it will involve the sacrifice of some of their own interests. If they are honourable men they will think of nothing whatever but the interests of their clients. Our clients are the people of these islands. And what are the Government doing? They are putting enormous power into the hands of the Cabinet. And may I ask, What is the Cabinet? Is the Cabinet recognised by the Constitution of this country? It is a junto, a sub-committee of the Privy Council&#x2014;that is all, although no doubt it has the confidence of the Sovereign.<lb/>
The Government are putting into the hands of the Cabinet power to be able at any time to say to the Monarch, "It is your duty as a Constitutional Sovereign to do what we tell you." Has that been the custom in the past? Not a bit of it. Even in the case of the Reform Bill of

1832 King William IV twice declined to accede to the demands of his Ministers. That is the only instance; because with regard to the year 1711, though Queen Anne consented to yield to the advice of her Ministers and permitted the creation of twelve Peers, those Peers were created for the purpose of putting an end to a bloody war. And what happened? Two of those Ministers had to fly the country&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

saying that there was no Constitutional precedent sufficiently emphasised to make it a Constitutional dictum or practice that the King should in all circumstances agree to the advice of His Ministers; and what I and some others are afraid of is that&#x2014;although this was done once in the Constitutional history of the country, in 1832&#x2014;if there is no actual protest made now it will become part of the Constitutional law of this country; and not only that, but if we have held at our heads at some future date an empty revolver we are to fall flat and worship. We are told that if we follow the lead of Lord Lansdowne and walk out we shall reserve to ourselves the rights and privileges which we now have, and that for at all events two years we shall be able to reject measures which we think we ought to reject. But I have not been given any proofs of this. Who is going to guarantee that within six months after we have yielded the same process will not be gone through again and that we shall not have this empty revolver again presented at our brains? And when we say the revolver is empty we shall be told, "Of course it is; everybody knows it is empty; but having fallen down in 1911 you must do it again."That process might go on year after year. Where would then be the freedom and the independence of this House and of the country? Their liberties would depend entirely upon the good will of the Dictator. He may be at present a most excellent man, but how do we know that we are always going to have this excellent Dictator in office? He is liable to the ills of human flesh, and he will die some day. What then?<lb/>
This House to-night is going to give up all the safeguards it has had for 700 years. Let there be no doubt about that. Lord Midleton told us that if these 500 Peers are made, if we are overwhelmed and a Conservative Government came into power and found these Peers in possession of the House, you would not be able to pass any Bill which might in the least alter the position of affairs&#x2014;that it would be perfectly impossible to do anything so wicked or so unconstitutional as to follow the example of these dreadful men who sit upon the Front Bench here. We Conservatives could not demean ourselves by willingly doing anything like that. But do you imagine for one moment that if the country realised the position we should not be compelled to do it?

Supposing a man comes up to you in the street at night with a Browning and points it at your head and says, "Your money or your life," and you struggle with that man and get the Browning out of his possession, are you not to present it at his head if you can? The Browning was not yours; you did not present it at anybody's head; the fellow presented it at your head first of all; and if you find, further, that that Browning did not belong to that man but had been stolen from another man, would not you protect yourself and the legitimate owner by shooting the man with that Browning if yon possibly could? Of course you would; it is common sense.<lb/>
Now a great deal has been said about the fear that the Peers are in of having this avalanche of new Peers thrust upon them. I have no such fear. I am an old House of Lords reformer. Years ago in public I stated, and wrote to the same effect, that the House of Lords must be reformed, and I for one will welcome 500 or 1,000 new Peers if the Prime Minister chooses to make them. They may be ridiculous, but they will make things lively in this House, and that is what I want. Mind you it will be an excellent thing from the Conservative point of view, because the Liberal Party will have to take out from their ranks all the most intelligent and the best elements of their supporters and put them in here. They could not do anything better from a Conservative point of view, because gradually those Peers would come under Conservative influences, and this House, instead of being a weak one as it is now, would be the strongest House of Lords that ever was known.</membercontribution></p>

We shall then get the people to understand what the position of affairs really is, and when we get them to understand that then the victory is won. If, on the other hand, we go on in our half dead condition knowing that at any moment we are liable to have this empty revolver pointed at our heads, what sort of position shall we be in? Shall we dare to have an opinion of our own? Shall we dare for one moment to encourage or drive, if you like to use the term, His Majesty's Government to use that revolver? No; we shall go on and drag out a miserable existence.<lb/>
Lord Rosebery told us that by yielding in 1832 we obtained a further existence of eighty years. I wish to goodness we had never had those eighty years. If only in 1832 a fight had been made we should have been a real live Assembly at this moment. The noble Lord said that after to-day we shall exist only for a few years in a miserable condition. I do not say those were his words, but that was the pith of his meaning. I ask your Lordships, Is it worth while, for the sake of a few years existence, to go on without any power or real authority whatever&#x2014;a sort of painted fortress, with a perfectly useless <i>simulacrum</i> of power, which will only deceive the people? Is it not better and much nobler to say to the Government at once, "Force us. We are not going to yield until you fire. Do your worst."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02558">*<member>THE EARL OF PLYMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: Your Lordships need not be afraid that I am going back now into the general question which has been debated for the last day and a-half and with so much eloquence from various quarters of the House. I want to confine myself strictly to the Motion which the noble Viscount opposite has made, and to the particular Amendment with which we are now dealing. I am one of those who very sincerely and with conviction supported the noble Marquess (Lord Lansdowne) in the policy which he pursued during the early part of this present session. I do not know that every noble Lord behind him followed him with quite the same conviction&#x2014;in fact we know that the noble Duke, the Duke of Northumberland, did not entirely approve of that policy. But I at least was one of those who thought that it was impossible for us to rest content merely with opposition and objection to the
<col>1056</col>
policy that was put forward by His Majesty's Government; and although it was unusual for the Leader of the Opposition to put forward a policy in opposition to the Party in power, I thought that the noble Marquess was perfectly right and that he took a wise course in putting an alternative policy before the country, showing at least that he was perfectly sincere in the broad suggestions of reform which he had advocated at the end of last year.<lb/>
The alternative policy which we supported was, although presented to this House in two parts, in reality one and indivisible. It consisted, as far as I followed it, in admitting the advisibility of a reconstitution of the House of Lords, and at the same time in the retention of the full power that we thought a Second Chamber, however constituted, ought to possess if it was to take its place as a useful part of the Constitution and as a legislative body in this country. That was the policy to which I gave my assent, and which we introduced into this Bill. I do not say that we have achieved all that the noble Marquess desired, but I did believe that the Amendment, which we have at present before us was in his opinion as it was in mine, the irreducible minimum of what we required if this Bill, was to pass. I put it to the noble Marquess, without the slighest reflection on the course which he is now taking, that he is asking us to do a very hard thing by what he now proposes.<lb/>
We have pledged ourselves to the reconstitution of this House and to the setting up of a Second Chamber very different from this House as it now exists. I do not say that we are pledged to the details of the Bill which the noble Marquess brought in. He distinctly said that that Bill was open to variation and criticism, and that he did not himself consider&#x2014;I think I am interpreting him rightly&#x2014;that the Bill as he introduced it was necessarily in detail the one which the House need accept. By passing the Second Heading of that Bill we pledged ourselves to the principle of the reconstitution of this House, and now he asks us to do what to my mind is too hard a thing for me to do&#x2014;that is, to walk out of the House and not to give my vote for, as I say, the irreducible minimum&#x2014;not what we desired, but what we felt we might ask for and could go before the country and defend. I feel that I cannot walk
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0533"/>
<col>1057</col>
out of the House without giving my vote for insisting on this Amendment. I know what the noble Marquess says&#x2014;he has said it to us before&#x2014;that if he had seen any possibility of passing the Bill with this Amendment in it he would have been the last to advise your Lordships to give way. I admit that absolutely. I know that is his view, and that it was only because he thought that there was no chance whatever of our succeeding in passing the Bill in this form that he advised the course of walking out of the House and ceasing our opposition. It seems to me a most dangerous thing to acknowledge defeat because of a threat&#x2014;a very unconstitutional threat, as we think, made in order to enforce the views of the Government.<lb/>
Surely if there is one way in which defeat is absolutely assured it is by acknowledgment. You may hold out to the end until you are beaten by votes; you are fairly beaten then, and there is nothing more to be done. But when you are confronted with the threat of a creation of Peers to swamp you and you submit, it seems to me that you have acknowledged defeat before you are actually defeated and made it absolutely impossible that anything but defeat should be your lot. We have heard a good deal about the old Duke of Wellington. I do not profess to remember my history very well; but is it not tie case that the French said of the battle of Waterloo that by all the rules of the game of warfare the British troops were defeated at Waterloo, and that it was only because the Duke of Wellington was so stupid as not to see it, and kept on so long that by some chance or another he turned defeat into victory? All that I put to the noble Marquess is this, that it is too difficult for me to follow him in the course which he advises. If I am to go before a jury of my countrymen and defend my action to-night with any conviction or sincerity, I must give my vote in favour of insisting upon this Amendment.<lb/>
Then there is the question whether the creation of Peers in itself would really be of serious damage to the country in the future. No one tore the last shred away from any possible justification for the threat which His Majesty's Government have made to us in order to induce us to pass this Bill more completely than the noble Marquess did the day before yesterday, and if he will
<col>1058</col>
allow me I will quote his words. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"Surely there is an obvious reason why this mode of proceeding cannot be regarded as a remedy to be applied in anything like ordinary circumstances. Is it possible, is it conceivable, that any right should form part of the standing machinery of the Constitution, unless it is a right that could be used not by one side alone?"</quote>
And then he went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"Supposing the great bulk of your Lordships' House were going to follow my noble and learned friend into the Lobby to-morrow, and you were prepared to create 400 or 500 Peers, or perhaps 600 &#x2026; do you suppose that such a creation could be followed within any period of time which we can contemplate by a similar creation on this side, and that then there should be a third creation, and perhaps a fourth creation? That is unthinkable and absurd."</quote>
I entirely agree with those words. It is reducing the Second Chamber in the Constitution to a perfect farce to suggest this huge creation of Peers in order to force it into passing Government measures. It is unthinkable that such a creation could be repeated over and over again. My noble friend Lord Milner showed that it was impossible for that to happen. But the threat with which we are confronted can be made over and over again. I do not say that it is a justifiable weapon to use, but if you admit by your action that it is an effective one you are forging and putting into the hands of the Government a weapon far more deadly and effective than, any weapon they themselves could use on their own initiative. That argument does weigh with me very much. We are giving way to a threat which is far easier to use as a threat than to put into operation; and I venture to think there will be very great danger in establishing this precedent.<lb/>
I believe, with the noble Marquess behind me, that we are at the beginning and not at the end of a great fight. That has led him to think that we had better at this moment withdraw from further opposition, but it leads me to exactly the opposite conclusion. I cannot believe that we shall be any better off if we recede from our position at the first encounter, or that we shall have the slightest chance of arousing the enthusiasm of the country if we show to them, at this the first absolutely critical moment, that we think it better to walk out of the House than to face the threat and the operation of the threat which the Government have thrown at our heads. Those are the only reasons
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0534"/>
<col>1059</col>
that I shall put forward to-night as compelling me to give my vote with my noble and learned friend Lord Halsbury. I do it, as I say, with the deepest conviction and the utmost sincerity, and with a belief&#x2014;as strong as I am sure the noble Marquess's belief is in the Tightness of the advice that he gives to us&#x2014;that in the vote that I shall give I am acting, as far as lies in my power, in the best interests of my country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02559"><member>THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not going to make a speech. I wish to say but a few words. I came down to the House a few hours ago in the hope and expectation that I should be able&#x2014;without, in my judgment, doing anything detrimental to the interests of the country&#x2014;to abstain from recording any vote in regard to this Bill which I greatly dislike in its present form. The course of the debate, I will honestly admit, has induced me to change my mind. Especially I have been influenced by the callousness&#x2014;I had almost said levity&#x2014;with which some noble Lords seem to contemplate the creation of some five hundred new Peers, a course of action which would make this House, and indeed our country, the laughing-stock of the British Dominions beyond the seas and of those foreign countries whose Constitutional life and progress have been largely modelled upon our own. We are now told that the issue whether or not these Peers are to be created for the swamping of the House may depend to-night upon a few votes, perhaps upon a single vote. That being so, I cannot hold the position of one of those who might have averted that calamity and did not. In face of these facts, I shall therefore, with a grave sense of public duty, give my vote against adherence to the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02560"><member>LORD HENEAGE and LORD ST. LEVAN</member> rose on the Opposition side of the House to continue the debate. As neither noble Lord gave way to the other, there were loud rival cries of "St. Levan" and "Heneage," but both still continued standing.</p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02562"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member> put the Question, and as it was received with loud Opposition shouts of "Content" and only a few cries of "Not-content," he declared the Motion carried.</p>
<col>1060</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02563"><member>LORD ST. LEVAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we attach very great importance to this Amendment and we feel that it is one upon which we cannot give way. We have already yielded point after point. We know now beyond a shadow of doubt that His Majesty's Government intend to introduce a Home Rule Bill, and unless the noble Marquess's Amendment is insisted upon the country will not have an opportunity of giving a verdict upon that Bill. It has been stated on the other side by, I think, almost everybody who has spoken and by several speakers on this side of the House, that in rot agreeing to this Parliament Bill without Lord Lansdowne's Amendments we are resisting the will of the people as deliberately expressed at the last election. I entirely dispute that. I am perfectly certain that the people of the country did not understand at the last election that the Veto Bill involved Home Rule. I know that the noble Marquess, Lord Crewe, stated the contrary was beyond dispute, and I think I recollect the noble Viscount opposite stating in the course of the debate that the people of this country must have known that Home Rule was involved in the Bill because speakers on the Unionist side were constantly telling the electors so. The noble Viscount forgot to add that when we did state that at the election we were contradicted by our Radical opponents. I myself was contradicted in that way. I ventured to say in the course of an election address that Home Rule was involved in the Veto Bill, and I was told by a prominent supporter of the other side that the question was not before the country.<lb/>
Other Unionist speakers in my part of the country had the same experience. The Radical candidate in the part of the country where I live said that he would vote for this Bill but not for Home Rule or anything leading up to it, and there is no doubt in his case that he did not understand that Home Rule was involved in this Bill. He further said that Mr. Asquith had indicated that under the Veto Resolutions the Liberal Government only intended to deal with such measures as had been before the country and been fully discussed, and he did not think they had a mandate for Home Rule. I ask the noble Viscount or any other noble Lord opposite, or the noble Earl, Lord Russell, who has spoken so often on this point, if
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0535"/>
<col>1061</col>
they can tell me how the electorate, to whom responsible speakers on the Government side spoke in this way, could possibly understand that Home Rule was involved in the Veto Bill, and, if not, how they could properly understand the Bill. Further that, the Veto Bill was never discussed in Parliament as every other great measure has been before being submitted to the people. The election was sprung upon the people immediately after the failure of the Conference; and all we knew about the Conference was that there had been a difference of opinion between the leaders on both sides who took part in it, but nobody knows to this day what that difference of opinion was. The fact is, the people never had the Veto Bill put before them in a way which would afford them an opportunity of expressing a considered opinion upon it, and I think that our opposition to this Amendment being withdrawn is amply justified for that reason alone.<lb/>
The Duke of Devonshire made a speech to-night in which he very ably put forward arguments for which we have the greatest respect, but he said something that I have never heard before, and which I think is of very grave import. He called attention to the position of our leaders, and I gathered that he implied that if those with whom I am acting did not acquiesce in the action he pointed out to us, the position of Lord Lansdowne as a leader would be shaken. I am quite certain the noble Duke thought it necessary to say that, but I totally disagree with him; and I feel so strongly on this point that, with your Lordships' permission, I will tell you what my position is with regard to the leadership of our Party. It will be within the recollection of some of my noble friends that many weeks ago when I contemplated the possibility of the deadlock arising in which we now find ourselves, I indicated to them that the course I should have to follow would be that of what is called persisting to the end; but when the crisis did come I felt, like we all do on this side of the House, the very greatest reluctance to differ in any way from the noble Marquess, and I wrote him a letter expressing my regret at not being able to agree with him on this matter and giving him my reasons, such as they were. I said that I regarded it only as a difference on a point of tactics, and that when this question was out of the way I purported continuing the support
<col>1062</col>
that I have given him in the past. I also told him that I had arrived at the conclusion which I had arrived at without consulting any of those who are called the leaders at the present moment, and I am sure that Lord Halsbury and Lord Selborne and Lord Salisbury will support me in that if necessary. I wish to say that, because it was such an important point raised by the noble Duke, and I desire to make my position perfectly plain. I do not want that there should be a shadow of doubt about it so far as I am concerned. In a kind of way we are not actually resisting Lord Lansdowne; we have followed his lead, only we have gone further. Lord Lansdowne said, "Come on," and we came on so hard and with such good will that we found it impossible to stop. I have supported the noble Marquess against this Bill throughout. The Bill has not changed; I have not changed my opinion with regard to it; and I am therefore going to vote as I have always felt about it and still feel about it. I am going to vote against it, and I think that decision requires neither explanation nor defence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02564"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Amendment has been before your Lordships for some days. It is impossible to bring forward any new argument with regard to it, and I should be the last person in the world to attempt any reiteration of my noble friend's arguments, especially when they have been put forward so ably already by the Leader of the Opposition, Personally I had no intention of taking part in this debate, because I knew that my noble friend Lord Cromer was most desirous of speaking, and his views and mine are identical. But unfortunately he is ill to-day and unable to be here to make the speech he intended to make urging his friends to vote, as I am going to vote and as he would have voted if he had been here, for not insisting upon this Amendment.<lb/>
A short time ago Lord Lansdowne advised us, under well-known circumstances, to abstain from voting and to allow the whole of the responsibility for what was done with regard to this Bill to fall upon the Government and those who support them. We were under duress, and were no longer free agents; and I entirely agree with my noble friend and should have been only too glad to follow his advice if all the other members of the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0536"/>
<col>1063</col>
Unionist Party had been willing to do the same. But since then there has been a great difference of opinion in the Unionist ranks, which, as my noble friend Lord St. Levan has said, has grown to such an extent that they cannot control it. At first it was only a skirmish, but now it has amounted to almost an open rebellion. The whole circumstances have now changed, and it has come to be a question what independent members, and especially those of a Cross Bench frame of mind, ought to do on this occasion. It is perfectly clear that in loyalty to his own friends and to himself Lord Lansdowne can only act in accordance with the advice he gave, and Lord St. Aldwyn as a party to that advice and to the circular seems to be in the same position. But independent members are in a different position, and it is for us to see as far as we can that not only the good advice of Lord Lansdowne is carried out, but that the effect which he intended that advice should have when he gave it, and which has now been entirely altered by the rebellion in the ranks of the Unionist Party, should also be carried out.<lb/>
I have not the slightest hesitation in the course I shall pursue in these circumstances. Every man must be the judge of his own conscience. That does not seem, however, to be the opinion of some noble Lords in this House. They claim the right, as my noble friend just now said, to go beyond Lord Lansdowne's advice, and the right to form their own judgment as to how they shall vote. But directly any one else wishes to go beyond Lord Lansdowne's advice and to judge for himself which way he shall vote we are told that we are traitors both to Lord Lansdowne and to the Unionist Party. Well, my answer to that charge is that we are only traitors to those who are traitors themselves. I must also recall a very useful phrase which was used by Lord Halsbury yesterday. Lord Halsbury said he could not see any difference between those who abstained and those who voted with the Government. You cannot have it both ways. If there is no difference between those who abstain and those who vote with the Government, you cannot brand those who vote with the Government if you absolve those who abstain.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02566"><member>LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry if I misquoted the noble and learned Earl, but his explanation practically makes matters better for me. I have had a pretty long Parliamentary experience. I have sat in ten Parliaments equally divided between the two Houses of Parliament, and I have had to give a great number of votes, many of them independent votes against the Party with which I was acting. But I have never during the whole of that time given a vote with a clearer conscience and freer from any doubt than the vote I shall give tonight against the creation of 300 or more puppet Peers, or with a firmer conviction that by doing so I am serving the best interests of my King and my country.</membercontribution></p>

It may, however, be permissible for me, on behalf of that large section on this side of the House with which I am acting, to say one or two words in conclusion before your Lordships proceed to a Division, by way of summing up the case as it appears to stand in the opinion of the noble Marquess and those who act with him.<lb/>
It has been brought against us more than once in this debate that it has been a debate of rather a domestic character. Nobody regrets that more than myself. There is a difference between noble Lords who sit on this side of the House, and I rather agree with Lord Plymouth that the difference is not one of procedure alone but that principles are involved. I have not said one word in this controversy against the sincerity, integrity, and conscientiousness of any man, whichever way he is going to vote, and I hope my noble friends will make an equal concession to those who. taking their fortunes in their hands, are going to do what they regard as an odious and distasteful thing, rather than see this House involved in what they conceive to be not only a great danger, but its certain and ultimate ruin. I ask
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0537"/>
<col>1065</col>
noble Lords to concede to them what they claim for themselves.<lb/>
From this discussion surely there emerge two salient facts, first that enforced with so much emphasis by my noble friend Lord Rosebery this afternoon&#x2014;that there is no getting away from the fact that this Bill is going to pass. The action of Lord Halsbury and his friends may retard its passage into law for a few days or at most a few weeks, but they cannot prevent its ultimate passage. We have reached a point at which it must be admitted that the powers of effectual resistance have gone from us. We cannot force a General Election. I do not know that my noble friends who sit behind me would force one if they could. That, at any rate, is a solution of the question to which I for one am not prepared at the present moment to refer. That is the first feature of the present situation&#x2014;that the Bill is going to pass. If your Lordships throw it out to-night there will be a sharp and swift resurrection of the Bill, and nothing can prevent it from being placed on the Statute Book at most in a few weeks from the present date. I wish it were not so.<lb/>
The second point is that it has emerged from the discussion for the first time with absolute clearness to-night that if the Prerogative of the Crown is to be used for a creation of Peers it will be, to use the words of the noble Viscount, a prompt and large creation of Peers sufficient in number to overcome any combination of forces on this side of the House that might be brought against this Bill. ["Hear, hear."] I do not join in those "Hear, hears." I think it is one of the most deplorable things that have ever happened in the history of this House. I am not now concerned to question or to characterise its morality. I am only concerned to describe it as an impending fact. For a long time a number of my noble friends on this side of the House have cherished what I have told them was an illusion, that if there were a creation of Peers it would be slight, small, and insignificant. They declined to change their opinion even in the face of the statement of the Home Secretary in the other House and of the practical endorsement of it by the noble Marquess, Lord Crewe. Even then the scales did not fall from the eyes of several of my noble friends, and they said that Lord Crewe had thrown over his colleague in the
<col>1066</col>
House of Commons. Is it not perfectly certain, after the words of the noble Viscount, Lord Morley, which I need not recapitulate, that if the Bill is thrown out there is going to be a creation of Peers so large&#x2014;I do not pause to inquire whether it is to be 300, 400, or 500&#x2014;as to alter altogether the composition of this House, to destroy the House of Lords as we have known it, and to upset the Constitution of this country? Is not that the second great salient fact; that emerges from our proceedings this evening?<lb/>
May I ask this question of my noble friends who are about to vote? Supposing that by your votes you defeat the Government and force such a creation, what good will you do to yourselves, to your Party, to the Constitution, to the country, or to any one concerned? I know that you are animated by motives wholly dissociated from personal feeling. You are acting in the public interest. I ask you, therefore, in the public interest. What is it you are going to effect? You are not going to stop the Bill being passed within a few days or weeks. That is conceded. The noble and learned Earl attaches more importance to the interval of a few weeks than I do. It does not seem to me that your operations to-night can succeed in doing any more than arrest, the passage into law of this Bill for a short time. Then are you going to make the Government contemptible in the eyes of the country? I wish you were. I truly think that nothing more ridiculous, more open to the charge of contempt, could be imagined than this creation of Peers; but at the bottom of my heart I cannot help thinking that the country&#x2014;I am not speaking of our Party in the country, but the great mass of the electorate&#x2014;so far from believing that His Majesty's Government had resorted to an action which is ridiculous, would say that the Peers, who had twice stood out against His Majesty's Government and been defeated, were finally being hoisted with their own petard. I do not say that that would be a just thing for the electorate to say, but it is a very likely thing to be said; and so far from thinking that ridicule would fall on the shoulders where it ought to fall&#x2014;on those of noble Lords opposite&#x2014;I think it might conceivably recoil on the heads of noble Lords on this side of the House.<lb/>
My noble friends have been very strong on the point that this action which they
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0538"/>
<col>1067</col>
hope to take is necessary to convince the country of the seriousness of this revolution. I pay my noble friends the compliment of saying that the whole of their action during the past fortnight, their speeches, their letters, their resolutions have not been without effect in convincing the country of the existence of a revolution. I pay them that compliment. But if they think that the country is likely to be brought more face to face with evolution because 400 or 500 gentlemen are going to troop into this House and sit on the Benches opposite I respectfully differ from them. I would ask noble Lords for a moment to contemplate the positive consequences of the action which they propose to take. If you succeed to-night in defeating the Government and compelling the creation of a large number of Peers, is it not clear that you will be making an enormous and gratuitous addition to the power for mischief of the Party opposite? A noble Lord last night used this metaphor, that noble Lords on this side of the House who were taking such a line of action were committing suicide on the doorstep of their opponents. I think my noble friends to whom I am appealing would be doing much worse than that. They would be presenting a regiment, an army, to the enemy in the campaign upon which we are about to enter.<lb/>
Then I come to the point on which Lord St. Levan touched just now&#x2014;the exceedingly difficult and delicate point of Party allegiance. Do not let any of your Lordships who are going to give this vote conceal from yourselves the fact that you are giving a vote against the definite advice of the trusted leaders of your Party. I believe that the sentiments which have been expressed by more than one noble Lord who has spoken from these Benches of personal and devoted attachment to the noble Marquess are genuine sentiments. I believe they are echoed by every man who sits in this House and who has had the privilege of sitting here under his able, his courteous, his attractive, leadership. But, my Lords, I cannot help remembering what Lord Salisbury said in the debate last night. He said, "The country only understands deeds; it utterly despises words." I cannot conceal from myself the fact that these protestations, genuine as I believe them to be, of loyalty and devotion to my noble friend, are accompanied by a reluctance to accept his
<col>1068</col>
advice upon the present occasion. I think that is greatly to be deplored. The position is a difficult one. I do not desire to press it for more than it is worth, but at least I do ask noble Lords on this side of the House to bear in mind that those of them who are going to take this action are taking it in opposition of the advice of their leaders, not only in this House but in the other House of Parliament.<lb/>
There is one other point to which I allude with some diffidence after what was said by the Duke of Norfolk this evening. The noble Duke, in what, if I may say so, was a most cogent and powerful speech, made effective use of the proposition that great reluctance ought to be felt by any one on an occasion of this sort in bringing in the name of the King. I accept that. The name of the King has been brought into the matter not by us. We have not utilised it to extract any Party advantage, even if that had been possible. We regret that the name, of the Sovereign has been introduced, but in this matter the position of the Sovereign cannot be altogether eliminated. There is no noble Lord who heard the noble Marquess, Lord Crewe, address us two nights ago who cannot have been assured of the fact that in November last and again in July the position of the Sovereign, confronted with the pressure that was put upon him, must have been painful, anxious, embarrassing, and almost, to use Lord Crewe's words, odious. If that be so, is it not absolutely certain that, whatever may have been the feelings of the Sovereign&#x2014;and we have been told what they were&#x2014;when these matters were placed before him, ten times more painful, more anxious, more embarrassing must it be to the Sovereign to have, as almost the first act after his Coronation in a reign that we hope will be happy and glorious, to give his assent to the actual introduction into your Lordships' House of a number of Peers that would destroy the character of this Assembly and pull down the pillars of the Constitution. I hope I have not made an unfair use, even by implication, of the name of the Sovereign.<lb/>
One last point. We are all Members of the House of Lords. We have reached it by different avenues, some of us by descent, some of us by election, some of us by service; but I believe there is no man
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0539"/>
<col>1069</col>
who sits in this House, not even the latest recruit to it, who does not when he comes within these walls acquire some measure of inspiration, some idea that this House is the centre of a great history and of noble traditions&#x2014;the idea that he is part of an Assembly that has wrought and is capable of doing in the future great and splendid service to this country. I have those feelings. I cannot contemplate with satisfaction anything which must effect the pollution&#x2014;perhaps that is too strong a word&#x2014;the degradation of this House, and I ask your Lordships to pause before you riot only acquiesce in, but precipitate or facilitate, a course of procedure with regard to this House which cannot but have the effect of covering it with ridicule and of destroying its power for good in the future.<lb/>
There is only one other appeal I would like to make. My noble friends who sit behind me and whom I have been to a large extent addressing are a small minority of the whole House; they are a minority of the Party to which they belong. I do not say this in an invidious sense. I state it as a matter of fact. They are a minority in numbers, though I do not say that they have not in their ranks some of the most distinguished members of your Lordships' House. It is open to that minority, in the Division which is about to take place, to adopt an action which their numbers alone or even their ability alone would hardly entitle them to take. I perhaps have put it not very well. What I mean is that it is in the power of 80 or 90 or 100 members of your Lordships' House to-night by the vote which you are going to give to dictate an action to the whole of the House. All I want is that your Lordships should clearly realise the responsibility you are assuming in this matter, because it may be that by a small majority, a majority of two or three or four of that small minority, you may impose upon the Government a course of action which may have a profound effect on the whole future of this country. I do not suppose a more momentous Division will ever have taken place in the House of Lords. It is possible that as a result of this Division 400 Peers may be created. If that is done, the Constitution is gone as we have known it. We start afresh to build up a new Constitution. God knows how we shall do it. We may do it with success

My appeals, I am afraid, would be useless if directed to him. They were only intended to ask members of your Lordships' House who are about to vote to carefully weigh in your own minds the vast interests that are at stake; to ponder, before you give your vote, the consequences that must ensue; and to be very careful indeed before you register a vote which, whatever may be your emotions at this moment, when you look over it calmly, I do not say to-morrow but a month, three months, or six months hence, you may find has wrought irreparable damage to the Constitution of this country, to your own Party, and to the State.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02572"><member>THE EARL OF HALSBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would have been quite content to join in the cry of "Divide!" which greeted the conclusion of the noble Earl's speech, but I cannot allow the oration to which we have just listened to remain without an answer. A great deal of what the noble Earl has said has been in the nature of an exhortation to us to do our duty and think carefully. Did it ever occur to the noble Earl that others besides himself have been considering our duty and do not require his exhortation to consider the supreme importance of the matter in which we are engaged? I can assure him that I have thought very deeply on the subject. Nothing could be more repugnant to my feelings than to be obliged to vote against the wishes of my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition. Not only the noble Earl but others also&#x2014;I think I may include the Episcopal Bench&#x2014;seem to
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0540"/>
<col>1071</col>
consider that for the first time in our lives we are encountered with the broad proposition that we should do our duty.<lb/>
A good many of the observations that were made by Lord Curzon have been traversed over and over again and I do not propose to go through them, but there are one or two remarks I should like to make upon what the noble Earl said. I noticed that a misrepresentation&#x2014;unconscious no doubt&#x2014;of something which I said has been twice repeated. I am stated to have said that this was a question of tactics. I never said anything of the sort in that connection. What I did say was that the only thing which divided us on this side of the House was a question of tactics. Noble Lords who do not agree with us on the question of tactics are as determined as we are on the question of principle. But there is a matter which they have not discussed at all apparently&#x2014;that is, what will be the condition of this House if this Bill passes? That is one of the things which have been entirely omitted. One would suppose that the subject on which we are now engaged is the question of leaving us in the position in which we were. But this Bill is a Bill which destroys the independence of this House absolutely, and when we talk about this being only a question of tactics we get entangled into the question of discussing our Party loyalty; but that has nothing to do with the broad question of principle here, which is, Are we or are we not to give our assent to a Bill which will destroy this Chamber as a legislative Chamber altogether? That is the question we have to consider, and that seems to me to be a question of principle.<lb/>
Let me make another observation. I am not one of those who regard this as a question to be treated jocosely. I do not think that the destruction of this historic House, with all its traditions, with all its powers, and with all the benefits it has conferred on this country, is a thing to be treated as the climax of fun. It seems to me that that is beneath the dignity of the discussion in which we are engaged and somewhat degrading to the dignity of the House. When pictures are presented to us and we are asked, in language which perhaps is more appropriate to the pulpit than to this discussion, to consider whether five months or six months hence we will
<col>1072</col>
regard our action as right or wrong, I confess that the only question which I would consider under such circumstances would be whether I believed I was doing right at the time; whether I was right in declaring over and over again in the course of the discussion of this destructive Bill that the Amendments which the noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition moved with such convincing logic and great eloquence were absolutely essential, and whether I was to abandon them at the last minute. Looking back, I should not care what the result was if I did that which I believed to be right. I am prepared to leave the final decision of the lightness or wrongness of it to a higher tribunal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02573"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am going to make the shortest and perhaps the most painful speech of my life. We have had an exhortation from the noble and learned Earl to do our duty. I have never supported the Amendments. I have never even been present in the House when they were brought forward. I have bitterly opposed the Bill of the Government. But the question now narrows itself into whether we should insist upon an Amendment which I have never thought would greatly mitigate the operation of this Bill. I certainly cannot risk the danger to which we are liable to be exposed by insisting upon it now. In a recent letter to the Press I urged the House of Lords to abstain from voting on this question. I hold still that that is a position which I should greatly prefer. I cannot conceive a more painful position than being obliged to vote apparently for a Bill which is abhorrent to me as it practically abolishes the only Second Chamber which exists without substituting anything in its place. Happily that is not exactly the position I occupy to-night, because the strict question is whether we shall insist upon an Amendment with which I personally do not agree. Therefore I have not the least hesitation in saying, profoundly painful as it is, that I shall think it my duty to follow the Government into the Division Lobby.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02574"><sup>*</sup><member>THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not going to stand between you and the Division. I am only going to ask you to weigh the value of the advice you have just got from the noble Earl on the Cross Benches when I have read to you his words
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0541"/>
<col>1073</col>
uttered in this House on May 29 lust, noble Earl said&#x2014;
<quote>"I can see no use in prolonging the existence of this House as a useless sham to delude the people of this country into the belief that they still have a Second Chamber with control over the First. Far better let the naked truth appear. Far better let it be seen by the country that, this House is a mere phantasy from which all substance has been stripped, than allow it to remain in the paralysed condition in which noble Lords opposite, and noble Lords opposite alone, wish to preserve it for their own purposes."</quote>
When Lord Rosebery said those words I believed him. Those views which he expressed are my views now. My noble friend Lord Midleton has found out to-night for the first time that there are great safeguards in this Bill. In my conscience and my heart I believe there are none. I believe that a Single Chamber&#x2014;naked, as Lord Rosebery would say&#x2014;would be safer for this country than a Constitution with a House of Lords emasculated according to this Bill. Therefore the Government's creation of Peers has no terrors for me.<lb/>
But the choice before us to-night is this. The House of Lords as we have known it, as we have worked in it, is going to pass away. We ourselves, as effective legislators, are doomed to destruction. The question is&#x2014;Shall we perish in the dark by our own hand, or in the light, killed by our enemies? For us the choice is easy. The threats of the</membercontribution></p>

The words that Lord Morley has read out to-night do not differ in effect from the earlier statements of Mr. Asquith. The advice that has been given and the guarantees that have been received will allow the Government to create Peers in order to overcome any possible combination&#x2014;that is exactly the same as what Mr. Asquith said&#x2014;but not to cover any impossible combination. It does not seem to us that the situation has been altered one whit by Lord Morley's explanation to-day, and deeply as I was moved by my noble friend's appeal, deeply as I feel having in this emergency to take a course different from him, and still more from Lord Lansdowne, vet there are moments&#x2014;and Lord St. Aldwyn was the man who pointed it out&#x2014;when every Peer in this House must take action according to his own conscience.

<image src="S5LV0009P0I0545"/>
<col>1081</col>
Amendment. As a member of the Belfast Corporation I want to put this case as forcibly as I can to your Lordships. I am well aware that this House invariably agrees with what has been transacted upstairs by your Committees, but on this occasion there is a strong reason for asking your Lordships not to insist upon your Committee's Amendment. If your Lordships were to insist on the Amendment you would be altering the existing law. The law at present is that railway companies should pay their full rates, and the effect of the Amendment is that they shall be entitled to an exemption of three-quarters of the rate in respect of the principal rates&#x2014;the police rate which is 11<i>d.</i> in the &#x00A3;, and the general rate which amounts to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in the &#x00A3;. That is a big concession.<lb/>
On what grounds do the railway companies claim this exemption? As far as I can make out, their claim is based upon the Public Health Act. Under this Act where a local authority became a sanitary authority after the passing of the Act railway companies were entitled to claim certain exemptions from rates. But before that Act was passed the Corporation of Belfast was the sanitary authority, and therefore the railway companies could not in any sort of way claim this exemption. It is perfectly true that by some oversight on the part of the officials of the Belfast Corporation a certain remission was granted to the railway companies for a period of some six years, but when new officials were appointed it was discovered that the concessions had been granted quite illegally. The natural result was that the concessions ceased, and now the railway companies have to pay full rates in the city of Belfast.<lb/>
The Belfast Corporation have been working hard all this session with the view of getting this omnibus Bill passed into law. The purpose of the Bill is to enable them to extend their tramway system, to acquire land for cemetery purposes and street improvements, and there is also a very important scheme in the Bill for the prevention of the flooding of the city. Owing to the city being built on low-lying ground, there has always been the danger of flooding when there is a heavy rainfall, and it has always been a drawback to the advantages of the city to have this threatening danger. The corporation have long had it in their minds to do what they could to get rid of this danger, and a scheme with
<col>1082</col>
that object is included in the provisions of this Bill. The Corporation naturally anticipated that a Bill of this sort, dealing with so many private interests, would have a good many petitions against it. There were a number of petitions, but they have all been met in one way or another and been withdrawn with the exception of the claim of the railway companies to exemption from three-quarters of the rates. Surely at this late hour of the session it would be a very unfortunate thing if a Bill of this sort promoted by a great corporation entirely for the benefit of their ratepayers should be lost; but it will be lost if your Lordships insist upon your Amendment.<lb/>
I do not like to impute anything to the railway companies. I have no doubt they are entitled to every consideration. But it does seem a wrong moment when a public body is promoting a Bill for the benefit of the community at large, and a Bill which in no way affects railway companies and does not in any sort of way increase the rates or interfere with the incidence of taxation, for the railway companies to take up this position. The moment when a corporation is promoting a Bill of this sort is surely not the moment for the railway companies to come along and use the occasion as a lever for securing relief from rates. I submit that the whole subject of railway rating should be dealt with by general legislation and not by the insertion of a clause of this character in a Private Bill. It may be said that it is practically the general case all through Ireland that railway companies are exempt by legislation as to three-quarters of the rates. That is true to this extent&#x2014;that by the Town Improvements Act of 1854 all towns which wanted to acquire land for the purpose of improving their streets were allowed to adopt the Act, and having done so were forced to exempt railway companies from the payment of full rates; but this was only the case with the small cities in Ireland. The large and important commercial centres had no occasion to take advantage of an Act like the Town Improvements Act. They never adopted the Act, and in those circumstances the law insists that railway companies should pay their rates in full.<lb/>
If this clause were insisted upon, it would mean that the railway companies would be exempt to the extent of three parts of their rates. As I have said, the police rate is 11<i>d.</i> in the &#x00A3; and the general purposes rate
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0546"/>
<col>1083</col>
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in the &#x00A3;, and the giving of the proposed exemption to the railway companies would amount to well over &#x00A3;2,000 a year. The case is aggravated by a recent legal decision defining what are lands for rateable purposes in regard to railways. Originally the law intended to cover only land on which the rails ran. That was the general idea of the Legislature; but by a recent decision lands used for railway purposes include platforms, sheds, pens for cattle markets, all kinds of goods sheds and everything else. In those circumstances it is a serious thing from a municipal point of view to allow railway companies to be exempt from the payment of rates to this extent.<lb/>
If the railway companies are relieved of this &#x00A3;2,000 a year, it must come out of the pockets of the ratepayers, and it will involve to them an extra rate of a half-penny in the &#x00A3;. In those circumstances I ask your Lordships to consider whether this is a clause which ought to be inserted in a Private Bill of this character, especially at this late period of the session. It would mean the establishment of a great principle; and so much weight and importance do the Corporation of Belfast attach to the principle which underlies this clause that they would feel compelled, if the clause is insisted upon, to drop the Bill, which would be lamentable after all the work which has been done in connection with it during the whole of the year. I therefore beg to move that this House do not insist on the said Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02613">Moved, That this House do not insist upon the said Amendment.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Shaftesbury.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02614"><member>LORD WELBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to oppose the Motion which the noble Earl has just submitted. This question was very carefully considered by the Committee to which your Lordships entrusted the examination of the Bill and over which I presided, and the decision at which we arrived was a unanimous decision. I would point out that, out of 124 towns in Ireland, railway companies enjoy this exemption in 104, and that in four towns they enjoy some exemption though not to the extent of three-fourths. Therefore in nearly the whole of the towns in Ireland railway companies obtain this exemption, and the Committee of your Lordships' House in these circumstances could not see any fair
<col>1084</col>
reason why the railway companies in Belfast should not enjoy the same exemption. A point which had considerable weight with your Lordships' Committee was that up to a year or two ago the Belfast Corporation actually granted to the railway companies an exemption over a considerable period of time, and I believe I am right in saying that when that exemption was first granted it was also granted in respect of several back years, showing that the Belfast Corporation at that time did not think that the remission of railway rates to the extent of three-fourths was unjust or unfair.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02615"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: I explained in the observations I made that an exemption had been given to the railway companies under some misapprehension for something like six years, and that it was due to an oversight on the part of the officials of the corporation. When new officials were appointed the oversight was found out and the exemption stopped.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02616"><member>LORD WELBY</member><membercontribution>: My point is that the allowance was granted by the Belfast Corporation of their own free will. Two or three years ago, however, their attention was called to a decision of which they were not aware, and on that they came to the conclusion that they were prevented from granting this exemption. Here you had the Belfast Corporation granting of its own free will this exemption, and only withdrawing it on the interpretation of a legal decision under which they believed they could not legally grant the exemption. Moreover, in 104 towns in Ireland this exemption is granted in respect of land occupied by railways. These grounds appeared to your Committee to be so strong as to justify them in inserting this clause.<lb/>
There were other reasons which influenced the Committee, but I do not lay very much stress upon them. One was that to a very large extent the same kind of exemption is granted in England, and seeing that it was also granted throughout the larger part of Ireland it seemed to the Committee not right that it should not apply to Belfast. If the exemption is fair in one case it is surely fair in the other. Moreover, I do not think railway companies in Ireland are so prosperous that they can afford to dispense with this exemption. I cannot say that the arguments adduced by the noble Earl were such as to induce me to change my mind on the matter, and I
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0547"/>
<col>1085</col>
doubt very much whether they would change the minds of the Committee. Indeed, I have heard from several members of the Committee, and they are unanimous with me in asking your Lordships to adhere to your Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02617"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can quite understand that your Lordships would feel great reluctance in differing from the finding of your Committee, and in that respect I share the view of the noble Earl, Lord Shaftesbury. At the same time I also share with him the feeling that the question here involved is one of such importance that it is only right that your attention should be called to it with a view to considering whether you ought to insist on the Amendment inserted by the Committee upstairs. The noble Earl opposite has correctly explained to your Lordships the character of the Bill we are considering, and the character of the Amendment with which we are specially concerned.<lb/>
I may recall to your Lordships that this Amendment, which proposes to treat the railway companies of Belfast on a differential footing with regard to rating, appeared in the original Bill. It was rejected in the House of Commons in the Committee stage, and was reinserted by the Committee of your Lordships' House. The Commons now disagree with your Lordships' Committee and object to this clause. I believe that Lord Welby's Committee in inserting this Amendment were influenced by what is really a misconception of the facts of the case. They thought, and Lord Welby's language here to-day rather confirms me in my view, that Belfast was in an anomalous position; that in practically the whole of Ireland railway companies enjoy this differential treatment; and that the insertion of this Amendment would put Belfast in the same position as the rest of Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02618"><member>LORD WELBY</member><membercontribution>: We were aware that in by far the larger number of towns railway companies have the advantage of this exemption.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02619"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord stated in the course of his remarks that Belfast was an exception, and he said he thought the railway companies of Belfast were entitled to the
<col>1086</col>
same exemption as prevailed all over Ireland. I cannot help thinking that the English law with regard to this question, under which railway companies do derive the advantage of differential treatment, may have influenced the Committee in their decision. But, as a matter of fact, the general Irish law on the subject of differential treatment is not the same as the law in England. Under the general Irish law no railway company is entitled to differential treatment at all. The only differential treatment that exists is that empowered by the Town Improvements Act of 1854, and the Public Health (Ireland) Act of 1878. Neither of those two Acts applies either to the large boroughs in Ireland or to rural districts, and therefore if there is any exception it is rather that in some places railway companies under special legislation do obtain this advantage. The general law of Ireland is quite clear. Under it railway companies are not entitled to special treatment. The Amendment in question, far from removing an anomaly, actually creates an anomaly.<lb/>
What the Office which I am now representing feel is that this is not a moment to consider the merits or demerits of differential treatment with regard to the rating of railway companies. There may be a great deal to be said for differential treatment. If t hat is so, the Irish railway companies are in a position to introduce a Bill into Parliament for the purpose of putting them in the position which they think fair and which English railway companies enjoy. But they do not do that. They do not come to Parliament and ask the Legislature to put them in that position. What they have done in the past and what they are doing now is to take advantage of the fact that a corporation is promoting a Bill&#x2014;a Bill which has nothing whatever to do with railway companies. This Bill does not impose a new rate and does not alter the incidence of rating. In fact, it is a Bill for the general improvement and good government of the City of Belfast, and when corporations come to Parliament with these Bills the railway companies hold them up to a species of blackmail, I think the noble Earl said, and they say, "If you do not square us we shall oppose the passage of your Bill and very likely you may lose it." My strongest reason for hoping that your Lordships will not insist on your Amendment now is that
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0548"/>
<col>1087</col>
the very same thing happened in the case of the Dublin Corporation in 1900.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02620"><member>LORD WELBY</member><membercontribution>: We specially put the Dublin case out of our consideration altogether. There were peculiar circumstances connected with the Dublin Bill which made us think that it was not a precedent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02621"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I am quite prepared to believe that Lord Welby was not influenced by what happened in the Dublin case. But the railway companies are, and it is the precedent of Dublin which has emboldened the railway companies to act in this way. It was a bad precedent, and I suggest with great respect that it would be very unfortunate if your Lordships seemed to give support to a course of procedure which is really nothing short of a sort of squeeze placed on corporations when they are trying to carry these difficult omnibus Bills, which raise a lot of opposition and are not easy to get through. With regard to the effect of the clause, Lord Shaftesbury has stated that it would throw a burden on the Belfast Corporation of &#x00A3;2,000 a year. The railway companies have not done so badly in Belfast, because for thirteen years I am given to understand they enjoyed a rebate on their rates of &#x00A3;2,000 a year, and this, I am informed, was due to an oversight on the part of the officials of the Belfast Corporation. Lord Welby claimed that the Belfast Corporation had granted this rebate of &#x00A3;2,000 a year out of their own good will to the railway companies, but if your Lordships will turn to the statement submitted to this House by the railway companies themselves you will see that in the last paragraph they use the expression "the railway companies applied to the corporation." I do not for a moment think that the fact is established that the corporation out of good will to the railway companies, feeling that they were entitled to different treatment, granted them this rebate. I am told that the reverse is the case; that the Corporation were in error as to what their powers were in this respect, and that directly they found out their mistake they took steps to compel the payment of the full rates. That is the position.<lb/>
I may mention that there are many other towns concerned which might be put in similar straits. Cork, Waterford,
<col>1088</col>
Limerick, Londonderry, Wexford, and other towns are in a position similar to Belfast to-day, and if your Lordships establish this precedent it is only human nature to expect that the railway companies will be emboldened by it and act upon it when occasion arises. There may be a good deal to be said for differential treatment of railway companies, but if those companies feel that they are able to persuade Parliament of the justice of their claim, then I say they should bring in a Bill for that purpose and not take advantage of a corporation situated as Belfast is to-day and seek to obtain, by direct pressure, that which they have not had the courage to ask Parliament to grant them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02622"><member>THE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that on reflection the noble Lord who has just sat down will regret some of the language he has used about what goes on before Committees of your Lordships' House. He talks of the railway companies blackmailing and squeezing the promoters. Is that what happens when parties appear before impartial Committees of your Lordships' House and persuade them to do that which they ask them to do? One would have thought that the Belfast Corporation were here as a sort of Aunt Sally to be aimed at, and that the railway companies have been doing something underhand in order to force them to do what they desire. Nothing of the kind has occurred and nothing of the kind does occur. It is not a question of squeeze; it is not a question of blackmail. It is perfectly open for any party to appear before your Lordships' Committees, and they only get their way if they persuade the Committee that their cause is just; and if you persuade the Committee that your cause is just you are not blackmailing or squeezing.<lb/>
As regards the merits, I wish to say little. The Committee heard all the evidence on this point, and as a broad general rule I think it is desirable, unless there is very strong evidence to the contrary, that the Committee who have heard the evidence should be supported in your Lordships' House. The noble Lord who represents the Government says that if your Lordships insist upon this Amendment you will be creating an anomaly. I am not going to split hairs with him over the definition of words, but you would be
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0549"/>
<col>1089</col>
creating an "anomaly" which already exists in England, and which exists in 104 towns in Ireland&#x2014;so I ant informed, and it was stated in debate in another place by my right hon. friend Mr. Campbell, whom I generally regard as an invaluable authority upon Irish matters. There are very fee towns in Ireland in which railway companies do not already enjoy what the Great Northern Railway Company now ask for in Belfast.<lb/>
As I have said, I do not desire to go into the merits. But there is one point to which I think, in my special position, I should draw your Lordships' attention as regards the progress of this Bill through Parliament. My noble friend opposite spoke of the late hour of the session. He is an optimist. I wish I could think that this is a late hour of the session. So far as I can see, we shall be here until shortly before Christmas. He then went on to say that it would be a great pity if this Bill were lost. I agree that it is always a pity if a Bill is lost at the tail end of a session, but I feel I ought to call attention to the way your Lordships have been treated by the promoters as regards this particular clause. What happened? The opponents obtained a decision in their favour in Committee upstairs, and, though there is no legal obligation to that effect, I think your Lordships who have had experience of Committees upstairs will agree with me that the usual procedure is for promoters to accept a decision whether they like it or not and go on with the Bill, or else to drop the Bill or a particular part of the Bill, or, if they do not do that, to ask your Lordships on Third Reading to reverse the decision of your Committee upstairs. But the Belfast Corporation did not do this. They did something for which I can find no precedent within the last ten years. They accepted the decision of the Committee upstairs; they asked your Lordships to read the Bill a third time, without one word to the effect that there was a provision in the Bill to which they objected; and then they asked the other House to disagree with your Lordships' Amendments&#x2014;not, as I claim, dealing straightforwardly with your Lordships having previously accepted the Bill as it stood on Third Reading.<lb/>
There have, of course, been instances where the House of Commons in similar cases to this have disagreed with Amendments made in your Lordships' House, but the last case I can find is the Dublin Bill
<col>1090</col>
which has been referred to&#x2014;the Equalisation of Rates Bill, 1901. But there I notice that on behalf of the promoters the late Lord Spencer drew your Lordships' attention to the point to which objection was taken, and the matter subsequently was the result of Messages between the two Houses and was decided in the way he desired. I do feel that if the Belfast Corporation intended to ask the other House to disagree with the decision of your Lordships' House to which they objected, they ought to have followed what was the usual course and attempted to reverse the decision here on Third Reading first. If they had followed that course there would have been plenty of time for negotiation between the parties; there would have been no danger of the Bill being lost owing to the usual procedure as regards Messages between the two Houses. And if this Bill is lost as the result of the exceptional course which the Belfast Corporation have followed in not dealing straightforwardly with your Lordships in this matter, no one will be to blame but themselves. That is all I desire to say on this point, but I thought it my duty to bring this to your Lordships' notice, because it would be a very undesirable practice to see grow up that parties should accept decisions in one House, allow the Bill to go through the further stages in that House, keeping it in their minds that they were going to ask the second House to disagree with the first House. If that became general, we should have a crop of differences between the two Houses which would be very undesirable and unnecessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02623"><member>LORD MAC DONNELL OR SWINFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although it is true that in a number of towns throughout Ireland railway companies have differential treatment, those towns are small towns. In all the important commercial towns in Ireland, numbering, I am sorry to say, not more than fifteen or eighteen, the rule is that no differential treatment is given. That is the universal rule which applies. This particular clause proposes that in Belfast differential treatment should be given. That is introducing an exception into the rule which applies to all the important commercial towns in Ireland, and I submit to your Lordships that it is not on a Private Bill such as this that an exception should be introduced. If such an exception is to be introduced let it be discussed upon its merits and not in connection merely with a clause introduced into a Private Bill. The
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0550"/>
<col>1091</col>
other important commercial towns in Ireland will have strong reason to object if this procedure is followed in this case, because if Belfast is made subject to differential treatment the railway companies in the other important towns to which reference has been made will endeavour to obtain similar treatment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02624"><member>THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the question is put I should like to say one or two words with regard to the point which the Lord Chairman brought before the House, which I admit is a very strong point&#x2014;the question of the procedure of the Belfast Corporation with regard to this Bill after it had passed your Lordships' Committee. As far as that is concerned, let me assure your Lordships&#x2014;whilst admitting, of course, that the Lord Chairman is amply justified in condemning the course taken&#x2014;that there was no question of want of straightforwardness in the matter. I am rather inclined to think that what happened was due to the fact that the only member of the Belfast Corporation who is a member of your Lordships' House is very erratic and never in the same place more than two days running, and perhaps the Corporation were looking for a champion for their cause and would not have acted in the manner in which they did if they had found a champion or had been more familiar with the procedure of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
The noble Lord opposite who presided over the Committee which considered this Bill and also the Lord Chairman seemed to think there was no cause for pressing for the deletion of this clause owing to the fact that the Corporation had allowed these railway companies for a long time to receive exemption. Therefore it occurs to me that perhaps your Lordships would be satisfied if some arrangement could be arrived at by which the railway companies would pay only the amount of rate which they were charged by the corporation until recently when they were called upon to pay the full rates. The noble Lord seemed to lay such stress on the fact that the corporation had allowed these railway companies to be exempt in respect of a portion of the rates for some years that I would ask him whether he would rest content if the railway companies should be charged the same amount as they had to pay during the six years in which they enjoyed the exemption referred to.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MARITIME CONVENTIONS BILL [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02654" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02655">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02656"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD HERSCHELL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill is designed to give effect to two international Conventions, one relating to collisions and the other to salvage, both of which were signed in Brussels last year by the representatives of no fewer than twenty-four countries, including all the principal maritime nations. These Conventions are the outcome of a movement in favour of the unification of maritime law which was started as far back as the year 1885, when various unofficial maritime associations were formed in different countries to promote this object and were affiliated under the title of the International Maritime Committee. This committee, with its branch associations, consists of lawyers, shipowners, underwriters, merchants, and other persons interested in maritime law, and a number of unofficial conferences have been held under its auspices. From this it was only a natural step that an official conference should be held.<lb/>
The first official conference on this subject was held in February, 1905. On that conference this country was not represented, but owing to the very strong expression of the views of certain associations and chambers of commerce the Government decided to send delegates to the subsequent conferences, which met in October, 1905, and also in 1909 and 1910. These two Conventions, in order to carry out the provisions of which this Bill is designed, were signed at the last conference in 1910. I may mention that at the last two conferences Conventions relating to limitation of shipowners' liability and to maritime mortgages and liens were discussed, but they are in draft form only, and will come up before another conference to be held probably next year. Your Lordships will realise that a great deal of consideration has been given to these Conventions, and in the interval which elapsed between the various conferences the Board of Trade took every opportunity of consulting the different interests which are affected, and I think it may be said that the Conventions as finally signed do meet most of the criticisms which have been raised. Of course, your Lordships will realise that there has had to be, as is the case in all international agreements, a certain amount of give and take, but on the
<col>1096</col>
whole one may say that the important changes which are required in British law are very few in number.<lb/>
I will now explain as briefly as I can the actual provisions of the Bill. The first clause contains the rule as to division of loss when both vessels in a collision are found to blame. At present, instead of the Common Law rule being applied by which each vessel would bear her own loss, the special rule of the Admiralty Court is applied, by which the total loss is aggregated and then each vessel bears one-half of that total. The Convention and the Bill propose to substitute for this rule a rule by which the damages will be apportioned in proportion to the degree of fault which each vessel has respectively committed. This proposal has the support of shipowners generally, and has not met with any opposition from the great majority of traders. It has, however, been criticised from certain quarters, and perhaps I may state the principal criticisms which have been directed against it.<lb/>
The first criticism is that this proportional division of loss is not founded on principle. I think this is quite true; but it is equally true that the half-and-half division of loss is not founded on principle. In fact, so much is this the case that it has been known for years as <i>rusticum judicium,</i> a rough-and-ready form of justice. The second criticism is that it is impossible for a Court to fix the exact amount of fault which attaches to each vessel. There are cases, no doubt, where it is impossible to ascertain this; but if your Lordships will look at Clause 1, subsection (1), paragraph (<i>a</i>), you will see that it is laid down that if, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it is not possible to establish different degrees of fault, the liability shall be apportioned equally. As a matter of fact, this proportional rule does obtain in a great number of foreign countries, and there it has been found, in quite ninety per cent. of the cases that come under the rule, that a half-and-half division is arrived at by the Judge. Therefore you may say that this proportional rule would only come into force in cases where one vessel was very clearly more in fault than the other. The third criticism is that the proportional rule would increase litigation. This is, of course, a matter which can only really be decided by experience. But it is contended that there may be some inducement under this rule to contest a case in the hope of only having to pay a minority
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0553"/>
<col>1097</col>
of the damages. On the other hand, by adopting this rule there will no longer be the incentive which there is under the existing law to proceed with an action in the hope of getting off with half of the damages instead of the whole amount because the other vessel concerned was in fault in a small or technical degree. But, generally speaking, I would urge in favour of this particular rule that its adoption is advocated by all the foreign countries which signed this Convention, and that France and Germany have adopted this proportional rule so lately as the year 1900. The adoption of it will remove the diversity of law which at present exists, and it is stated to work well in the countries in which it is established.<lb/>
The second provision of the Bill deals with the right of claimants to recover damages when both vessels are to blame. At present a claimant in respect of damage to cargo cannot recover in tort more than one half of the damage from the owners of the ship, and the same rule would seem to hold good as to claims in respect of personal injuries. Claimants in respect of loss of life can, however, under Lord Campbell's Act, recover the full amount of the damages from either vessel. The Convention and the Bill propose to alter the law so as to place personal injuries claimants on the same footing as loss of life claimants; but as regards all three classes of claimants the right to recover damages is always subject to the provisions of any contract to the contrary. When a vessel has been made to pay ill respect of loss of life or personal injury a proportion of damages which is greater than the proportion which she is found in fault, she has a right of recovery of the overpaid portion from the other vessel which is in fault, but this is subject to the important proviso that the right to obtain a contribution from the other vessel cannot be exercised when that other vessel is protected by any statutory limitation or exemption from liability.<lb/>
Let us suppose that a collision takes place between two ships, A and B, and that both vessels have been found equally in fault. A passenger in ship A who has sustained personal injury can proceed against either ship A or B for the full amount of his claim, but if he wins his case&#x2014;say that he has proceeded against ship B&#x2014;then ship B can recover from ship A one-half of the amount which she has paid as both vessels
<col>1098</col>
were equally to blame. But this rule is subject to the proviso which I have mentioned&#x2014;that if ship A has expressly exempted herself from liability for injury to her passengers then, according to the proviso, ship B has no right of recovery from ship A. This may seem somewhat anomalous, but it certainly would appear less anomalous than the alternative. We will suppose that ships A and B are in collision, and that ship A has protected herself against any possible claim in respect of personal injuries and that one of her passengers is injured in the collision. If this proviso is not inserted in the Bill, ship B could then recover from ship A a portion of the very damages from which ship A had sought to exempt herself. To put it in another way, ship A, as long as she is entirely responsible for the injuries which result to the passenger, has not to pay any damages; but if she is not entirely responsible but another vessel is partly responsible, then she has to pay a portion of the damages, although if she was entirely responsible she would not have to pay any.<lb/>
The fourth clause of the Bill abolishes statutory presumptions of fault, and this is a clause which has met with very general acceptance. It necessitates the repeal of subsection (4) of Section 419, and subsection (2) of Section 422 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. Under the first subsection winch it is sought to repeal, a vessel is held to be in fault in a case of collision if she omits to carry out any of the regulations, although such omission may not in any way have contributed to the cause of the collision. For instance, vessel A is crossing the Channel; her port light is burning, but her starboard light has become extinguished. Vessel B is steering a course down Channel, and instead of obeying the rule of the road she holds on her course and collides with A on the port side. Ship B is clearly in the wrong, but under the existing law ship A is also presumed to be in fault because her starboard light was not burning at the time when the collision occurred, although this fact contributed in no way to the collision; nor under any possible conditions could ship B have seen whether that light was burning or not. The second subsection which it is sought to repeal presumes that a vessel is in fault if she does not stand by to render assistance to another vessel after a collision. This is quite an unimportant matter, in view of the fact that any master who does not so stand by
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0554"/>
<col>1099</col>
and render every assistance in his power is subject under the Act to extremely severe penalties. That is practically all there is in the Bill which deals with the Collisions Convention.<lb/>
With regard to the provisions as to salvage, here practically very little change has to be made in British law, and it certainly is a matter for congratulation that all these nations should have been brought to see eye to eye with British law in questions relating to salvage. The only two clauses in the Bill with regard to salvage are Clauses 5 and 6. Clause 5 imposes a general duty on all masters of vessels to render assistance to persons in danger at sea, and Clause 6 provides that where a dispute arises as to the exact distribution or apportionment of a salvage award the dispute shall be settled, not in accordance with the law of the country which makes the salvage award, but in accordance with the law of the country to which the ship belongs.<lb/>
As to the general provisions, which are the last ones in the Bill, there is one important provision which limits the time during which proceedings can be instituted. Proceedings under the Bill must be instituted within two years from the date that the claim arose, or within one year from the date of payment in the case of a ship which seeks to obtain a contribution from another ship in collision, The point of this provision is to discourage stale claims, and I do not think any hardship can be inflicted by this provision having regard to the proviso by which the Court is given discretion under certain conditions to extend the period if it thinks fit. Clause 8 defines the scope of the Bill, which is to extend throughout His Majesty's Dominions with the exception of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Newfoundland, which Dominions will, of course, be capable of adopting the Convention and of legislating should they so desire. The Bill contains practically all the Articles in these two Conventions which were signed last year with the exception of one dealing with the defence of compulsory pilotage&#x2014;a matter which will be considered in connection with the proposals of the Departmental Committee on Pilotage.<lb/>
I have nothing further to say about the Bill. The Bill is an important one. It is the first step towards a very desirable
<col>1100</col>
object&#x2014;namely, the unification of the maritime law of all countries. There is no question that a great deal of inconvenience and even of hardship does arise from the diversity of law which obtains in different countries, and in view of the enormous number of cases where British vessels are tried before foreign Courts and where foreign vessels are tried before British Courts I hope your Lordships will agree to the Second Reading of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02658"><sup>*</sup><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the measure of which the noble Lord has moved the Second Reading is a very important, and I am inclined to believe a very valuable and useful measure. It has behind it, as he has told the House, a great weight of authority. It is intended to give effect to the two Conventions which were executed in the year 1910 at Brussels; and not only does it do that, but it marks a step in a movement which the noble Lord has truly told us has been in progress for some time&#x2014;a movement for the unification of maritime law, the anomalies and inconsistencies of which have occasioned in the past so much inconvenience and hardship. What I think it is desirable we should remember is this, that the interest of this country in legislation of this kind far transcends that of any other country. It is quite true that twenty-four Powers were represented at the Brussels Convention, but no one of those Powers has a maritime trade comparable at all with that of this country. It is, therefore, absolutely necessary that any proposals of this kind should be carefully scrutinised and full opportunity given to the mercantile community to express any views that they may hold with regard to it. That brings me to the only observation I desire to make. I hope I am right in supposing that the noble Lord will be content if he gets the Second Reading before the adjournment, and that we shall not be called upon to deal further with the Bill until much later in the year.</membercontribution></p>

It deals with traction engines, and its object is to assimilate the law of Ireland to that which prevails in England and Scotland. It contains provisions empowering highway authorities to recover damages for injury done to roads by extraordinary traffic. There are also provisions as to the weight of traction engines and the construction of their wheels. Further, the Bill contains regulations as to the number of men who should attend upon traction engines; provisions as to the consumption of smoke and the prevention of sparks; and, finally, provisions enabling county authorities to make by-laws for licensing traction engines. Two slight Amendments were made in Standing Committee in the other House, which, on careful consideration, would seem to have been very ill-considered, and I understand that it is the intention of the Government to have those Amendments reversed in Committee in this House if your Lordships consent, as I venture to hope you will, to give the Bill a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

In fact, if he cared to call me as a witness I could mention from personal knowledge a case in which the public roads in a part of Ireland with which I am familiar were at one moment reduced to a state rendering ordinary traffic almost impossible, owing to the sudden introduction of extremely heavy motor tourist cars&#x2014;vehicles of a weight altogether exceeding anything for the purpose of which the roads had originally been constructed.

<title>OLD AGE PENSIONS BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02673">Order of the Day for the House to be put into Committee, read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02674"><member>THE EARL OF CAMPERDOWN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on Thursday last, when your Lordships were good enough to give a Second Reading to this Bill, I said that I would defer any remarks that I might think it necessary to make until your Lordships reached the stage of Committee, and therefore I propose to make them now on the Motion that the House do resolve itself into Committee. This is a Bill which originated, I believe, with Mr. Hayes Fisher, but which was afterwards taken up and carried through the House of Commons in concert with the Government. At the present stage it comes to your Lordships' House containing certain Amendments of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1908, which it has been found necessary to make to meet defects which have developed in the
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0556"/>
<col>1103</col>
course of the administration of the Act. I do not think it is at all likely that your Lordships would wish to alter any of its provisions. Indeed, I do not know that your Lordships have the power to do so.<lb/>
But I would like to call attention to two of the clauses, because I think they furnish an illustration of the way in which His Majesty's Government very frequently refuse to accept Amendments inserted by your Lordships' House which they afterwards find were absolutely necessary and which this House was perfectly right in making. Clause 2, subsection (1), paragraph (<i>a</i>) of this Bill runs as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"In calculating, for the purpose of the principal Act, the means of a person, account shall be taken of&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>(<i>a</i>) the yearly value of any property belonging to that person (not being property personally used or enjoyed by him) which is invested, or is otherwise put to profitable use by him, or which, though capable of investment or profitable use, is not so invested or put to profitable use by him, the yearly value of that property being taken to be one-twentieth part of the capital value thereof."</quote>
That subsection deals with the case of persons who have money and who keep it in such a way that it does not furnish any interest. This Bill proposes to regard that money as having been invested at 5 per cent. I must say 5 per cent. sounds to me rather a high rate of interest to obtain, but still there it is, and I believe that that provision was proposed by His Majesty's Government and inserted in concert with them.<lb/>
Really when we think of the history of this matter it is very absurd. When the Bill of 1908 was before this House Lord St. Aldwyn pointed out that it was quite clear that there would be persons possessing as much as &#x00A3;1,000 or &#x00A3;2,000 which they would keep in a stocking, or at all events not put out at interest, and the result would be that they would, notwithstanding, draw a pension from the taxpayers. On the Motion of the noble Viscount (Lord St. Aldwyn) these words were inserted&#x2014;
<quote>"So as to produce the largest income that can be reasonably obtained from it."</quote>
That Amendment was sent to the House of Commons, but as soon as it reached that House what happened? Mr. Lloyd George said&#x2014;
<quote>"I want to submit to you, Sir, that this is an infringement of the privileges of this House. The effect of it would undoubtedly be to diminish the number of those who could claim a pension."</quote>
<col>1104</col>
Of course it would; that was exactly what it was intended for. Mr. Lloyd George proceeded&#x2014;
<quote>"The effect of the Lords Amendment is this. The pension officer would be obliged to recognise the income of a man, not in accordance with what it actually is, but in accordance with what it ought to be if he invested his money in a different way."</quote>
As we know, Mr. Lloyd George deals with land, not according to the income derived from it, but according to the income which he says ought to be derived from it. Then he continued&#x2014;
<quote>"For instance, if he invested it in Consols the pension officer might say, 'You are only getting 2&#x00BD; per cent. for your money and you should invest it at 5 per cent.,' or, if he had &#x00A3;200 in the Post Office Savings Bank, he might say, 'You ought not to invest it in the Post Office Savings Bank. If you were to invest it in some industrial security which you might acquire you would get 5&#x00BD; per cent.'"</quote>
What is Mr. Lloyd George saying now? He is saying in this Bill that the man must invest at 5 per cent., and if he has not so invested the money he will be considered as having invested it at 5 per cent. Then Mr. Speaker said&#x2014;
<quote>"I have considered this question, and I think the Lords Amendment is really an explanation of the words profitable use.' Who is to say whether a man has properly or improperly used his money? What is intended by the words profitably used?' These are vague, general words, and it seems to me that the explanation of the words is that the money is so invested 'as to produce the largest income that can be reasonably obtained from it.' An investment in Consols would not in many circumstances, but might in others, be the largest income that could be reasonably obtained. That is a matter of argument."</quote>
Mr. Speaker continued&#x2014;
<quote>"I think it would be the doctrine of privilege run mad to insist upon this as a breach of privilege."</quote>
Then there was further discussion, and in the end the question was put "That the House disagree with the Lords in the said Amendment," and that was carried.<lb/>
The Bill came back to your Lordships' House, and, if I remember right, Lord St. Aldwyn said it was not his business to defend the public pocket if the Government wanted to empty it, and your Lordships did not insist on this Amendment. But what is done in this Bill? Clause 2 actually goes further than the proposal in your Lordships' Amendment. That proposal was not that the man must be considered as having invested his money at 5 per cent. What
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0557"/>
<col>1105</col>
conceivable reason had Mr. Lloyd George for objecting to your Lordships' Amendment? The only effect of his objection is that the country has been compelled to pay a good many pensions to people possessing sums of money of which they were not making use. That is the first case.<lb/>
Now let me turn to Clause 4. Subsection (2) of that Clause runs&#x2014;
<quote>"Two years shall be substituted for ten years as the further period of disqualification under subsection (2) of section three of the principal Act, both as respects persons convicted before the passing of this Act, and, as respects persons convicted after the passing of this Act, in cases where the term for which a person has been ordered to be imprisoned without the option of a fine does not exceed six weeks."</quote>
An Amendment of that sort was proposed in this House by Lord Saltoun. It was actually agreed to by the Government, and on the motion of the late Lord Wolver-hampton these words were inserted&#x2014;
<quote>"If the term of imprisonment to which he is sentenced exceeds one month he shall be disqualified. .."</quote>
Those works likewise went to the House of Commons. Mr. Speaker was asked whether it was a breach of privilege, and he said&#x2014;
<quote>"I am of opinion that this is a privilege Amendment. It extends very largely the benefits of the Bill. The effect of it is to remove the ten years' disqualification from persons sentenced to imprisonment of less than one month&#x2014;that is, it limits disqualification for ten years to persons who are sentenced to more than one month. The effect of this will probably be to exclude a smaller number of persons; in other words, to add a certain number. Accordingly it varies the charge. I may point out, however, to the House that it is always open to the House not to insist on its privilege if it desires to accept an Amendment."</quote>
That was an indication from the Speaker that this Amendment was obviously sensible Amendment, and he advised the House to consider whether it was desirable to insist upon its privilege. Mr. Balfour then asked&#x2014;
<quote>"I should like to know whether the Government propose to insist upon their Amendment";</quote>
and Mr. Lloyd George replied&#x2014;
<quote>"Yes. I move that the House disagree with the Lords in the said Amendment."</quote>
Then there was a debate; and finally Mr. Asquith said&#x2014;
<quote>"If the House, whatever may be its opinion on the merits or demerits of a comparatively small change in the Bill, were to allow the precedent&#x2014;
<col>1106</col>
it would be a precedent&#x2014;to be set of accepting an Amendment of this kind, in my opinion we should very greatly impair the rights and privileges we have always hitherto asserted."</quote>
And on that ground he asked the House to refuse to agree to the Amendment.<lb/>
What are the Government now doing? They are now proposing that where the imprisonment does not exceed six weeks it is not to be a bar to a man receiving a pension. I merely mention these two things because this is not the first instance by several in which the Government have entirely refused to accept any Amendment, however reasonable, if it comes from Your, Lordships' House, and then afterwards found themselves obliged to pass a Bill containing the very Amendments to which they disagreed. I do not know what defence the Government can make to conduct of this kind, but it certainly seems to me an unreasonable thing to object because you do not know what you are objecting to, and then afterwards to reinsert the Amendments in a Bill as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02676"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad that my noble friend has called attention to this matter, because I agree with him that it is an instance in which the Government might have considered favourably the Amendments made by your Lordships' House although they were technically breaches of the privilege of the House of Commons. If the Government had in this case invited the House of Commons to waive their privilege, the Bill would have been considerably improved. But what has happened? For more than two years past pensions have been given to persons owning a considerable amount of property the income from which has not been calculated in their income. This would have been avoided had my Amendment been accepted, or had Clause 2 of this Bill been in the original Old Age Pensions Bill. The taxpayers have been penalised to that extent for the benefit of persons whom Parliament never intended should receive old age pensions at all. That is the simple fact.<lb/>
Then take the other case to which my noble friend alluded&#x2014;the limitation which
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0558"/>
<col>1107</col>
prevented the receipt of a pension by a person who had been convicted of an offence of a certain kind. There, again, the action taken in the other House has accrued to the detriment of the subject, because if the Amendment which is now in this Bill had been inserted in the original Bill some persons would have been eligible for pensions who were not eligible under the more stingent provisions of the Act. I do hope that His Majesty's Government may take this to heart to this extent, that they may be disposed to think that sometimes, even in a Bill which is of this nature and which it is difficult for your Lordships to amend without in some technical manner infringing the privilege of the House of Commons, it may be possible for us to snake suggestions which ought at any rate to be considered on their merits, and which, if so considered, might improve the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02677"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, not only as regards this Bill, but as regards legislation generally, so far as I interpret the mind of His Majesty's Government, we are always glad to have these suggestions, but questions of privilege may arise. As regards the particular Bill now before us, no doubt there has been a change which has now been agreed to; but I can assure the noble Viscount and the noble Earl that it was not because these matters were overlooked or because there was slackness in considering them that the course was taken in the original Act that was taken. I remember well the close discussion it received. It is, I think, a good sound general principle that a thing is only true on the balance of considerations, and at that time it was thought that the balance of considerations was the other way. We are none of us infallible. Experience has now shown that on these two points modifications are required, and they have been made. It was not through obstinacy or mulishness of mind on the part of those concerned that that course was not taken originally, but because it was believed on the balance of considerations not to be the right course.</membercontribution></p>

tions it was thought better. I do not think he listened to the words which I read, because those words were distinctly that the Amendment was rejected simply because it was technically a breach of privilege, although the Speaker in both cases indicated that he thought it was an absurd instance in which to enforce breach of privilege. I never heard anything about the balance of considerations. In fact, I do not think anything was balanced or even considered. The principle on which action was taken was that these were Amendments inserted by this House, and therefore they were to be kicked out.</membercontribution></p>

Your Lordships will no doubt remember that in Committee we had a discussion on this point, and my noble friend the Secretary of State for War was more successful than

I in explaining to your Lordships the exact bearing of this point. But we concluded the discussion with a promise on our part to consider the point and bring up an Amendment on Report. Your Lordships will see that I have tried to meet the case by this Amendment. There are two different, points&#x2014;the point as to the value of the land at the expiration of the lease, and the point as to the value of the lease itself and the annual rent which is paid for the lease. They are two wholly separate questions. Noble Lords opposite were afraid that by some phraseology we had used in the Bill there would be some limitation upon the value of the land at the expiration of the lease. That, however, is not so. We are anxious that the freeholder should receive the value of the land less the discount subject to the number of years before the termination of the lease. The provision in this Amendment is to secure that leaseholders who enfranchise shall not pay more for the value of the land during the expiration of the lease than they have been charged by the landlord&#x2014;that is to say, where the landlord has allowed them to have the land on lease at a rent below the value, in those cases the compensation should be based on the sum of money which had been fixed by the landlord, and not on any sum which the arbitrator might suggest. That is quite separate from the other point, which is the value of the land at the expiration of the lease; and having looked into the matter I can say quite confidently that we have not the least doubt that the landlord will get full value for the land at the end of the lease, subject to the discount, which is a matter of actuarial calculation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02731"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Viscount has stated the law, as I understand it, with entire accuracy. We have this satisfaction, that the words which it is now proposed to insert in response to a desire to get rid of anxieties are admirably chosen words, but they express nothing that was not in the Bill as it originally stood. The words add nothing. They simply explain an element of the law, and some day or another unfortunate Judges will wonder how this clause got in here, as the whole thing is quite clear in Clause 2. But it is satisfactory that we have at last arrived at words which leave no ambiguity in anybody's mind.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02736">The expression "place of worship" means any church, chapel, or meeting-house used for public religious worship, and includes a burial ground, Sunday school, or minister's house attached to or used in connection with and held upon the same trusts as a place of worship:</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02737">The expression "freehold reversion" means the estate of fee simple in the premises subject to the lease held by the trustees and any lease superior thereto; and, where the premises subject to the lease consist of land of copyhold or customary tenure, includes the interest of the tenant by copy of court roll or the customary tenant subject to the lease held by the trustees and to any lease superior thereto as well as the interest of the lord of the manor:</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02738">The expression "intermediate reversion means any leasehold interest in the land (whether under a lease or underlease or under an agreement for a lease or underlease) superior to the lease held by the trustees:</p>

<image src="S5LV0009P0I0564"/>
<col>1119</col>
would then be awaiting the Royal Assent. Among the Bills to be dealt with are the Old Age Pensions Bill, a Bill to enable the appointment of additional High Court Judges in India, the Labourers (Ireland) Bill, the Pensions (Governors of Dominions, &amp;c.) Bill, the Appropriation Bill, the Telephone Transfer Bill, the Public Works Loans Bill, the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, the Government of India Act Amendment Bill, the Cotton Cloth Factories Bill, and the Geneva Convention Bill. The Bills which must go over to the Autumn include the Copyright Bill, the Education (Administrative Provisions) Bill, the Pacific Cable Bill, and the Telegraph Construction Bill. That relieves the list somewhat and leaves us with those Bills which I have mentioned, most of which are quite short and are not, so far as I am aware, controversial.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02771"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I am glad to learn from the noble Viscount that he proposes to carry over until the Autumn Session a number of the pending measures. It would, as he evidently feels, be extremely inconvenient&#x2014;I might say extremely indecent&#x2014;that during the two or three days which remain to us we should be asked, with an Autumn Session before us, to hurry through measures of any consequence. The noble Viscount suggested that some of the Bills which he hopes to take during the next three days were Bills of little or no importance. May I venture to suggest to him that, though a Bill may be an agreed Bill, there may be many members of your Lordships' House who may desire to examine its details and ask questions about it. The noble Viscount mentioned the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill. Am I right in believing that under that Bill His Majesty's
<col>1120</col>
Government propose this year to extend the operation of the Evicted Tenants (Ireland) Act? That, I am sure the noble Viscount will recognise, is a matter of considerable importance. The Act in question had a time limit of four years assigned to it. That period of four years was imposed on this House, which very much desired to have a shorter time limit. I must say that if that Act is to be further extended under cover of the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill His Majesty's Government are likely to meet with a certain amount of remonstrance from noble Lords from Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02772"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: It could be, of course, only for the year, in order to give time to consider whether it should be carried on or not. But I will look into that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02773"><member>VISCOUNT ST. ALDWYN</member><membercontribution>: It is all very well for the noble Viscount to say that the insertion of an Act in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill is merely to give time for consideration. We know that Acts have for a generation been inserted in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill and have become permanent when Parliament never intended in passing them that they should be permanent. I think we may fairly ask, if the Evicted Tenants (Ireland) Act is to be included in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, that that Bill, if possible, should be relegated to the Autumn.</membercontribution></p>

This Bill is an old friend, or an old enemy, of your Lordships. It was in substance first introduced by the late Lord Davey. It passed this House twice, I think, substantially in the form in which it now and it has passed the House of Commons three times; but such is the inexorable difficulty in passing comparatively small Bills through Parliament under our present congestion of work that the Bill has hitherto escaped becoming an Act of Parliament. Last year it very nearly did so, but there was a difficulty with regard to Clause 3 between the building societies and the Incorporated Law Society. I considered the matter and found that there was some ground for complaint. The parties have now, however, agreed, and one of the most distinguished Judges on the Bench whom I asked to look into this difficult and complicated point has thoroughly approved, and I also approve of this clause. That is the only change in substance in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PENSIONS (GOVERNORS OF DOMINIONS, &amp;c.) BILL.</title>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02791">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02792"><member>THE UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (LORD LUCAS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a simplifying and consolidating Bill dealing with the pensions of Governors, and in spite of the rather misleading short title of the Bill it would apply practically to ex-Governors of Crown Colonies and only in rare cases to ex-Governors of Dominions. Your Lordships will find in Clause 1 the qualifications that a Governor has to possess for a pension. I may mention that we have somewhat shortened the qualifying period, bringing it down to ten years. Clause 2 gives the method by which the pension is to be assessed. With regard to that, I may say that there has been a slight revision of the present classification of the various classes of Governorships. Hitherto they have been classified by the amount of the salary, but now we take into consideration certain other things, particularly the difficulties and responsibilities and also the climate of the place. I think that the alteration proposed is a considerable improvement on the present system. Clause 2 shows how the pension is assessed, and your Lordships will see that it is by that method assessed directly on the actual work that has been done, the actual posts that have been filled, in these different classes of Governorships. That is not taken into account under the present system except very indirectly, because the pension is assessed entirely from the highest post that the Governor may have held. You might have one man who had spent the whole of his eighteen qualifying years in the most important Governorships in Class 1 and another man who had been fourteen years out of the eighteen in unimportant Governorships and only four years in Class 1 Governorships; yet at the end of that time both men would be drawing the same pension. Under this Bill that cannot be done, because each Governorship that has been filled by the Governor is taken into account in assessing his pension. We have raised the maximum of the salary from &#x00A3;1,000 to &#x00A3;1,300, which brings Governorships on a par with other important offices held under the State to which these Governorships are comparable. It is not by any means every Governor who will draw the full &#x00A3;1,300, and although
<col>1124</col>
Governors will be very much better treated under this Bill than they are at the present time, it is not computed that it will entail a very large increased charge on public funds. In fact, on the total amount which is charged to public funds for this purpose&#x2014;something between &#x00A3;11,000 and &#x00A3;12,000&#x2014;it is thought that there will only be an increase of 5 per cent. as a result of this Bill.

Your Lordships will see that in the first clause power is taken to increase the number of Judges of the High Court in India. There has been within the last few years a very great increase in the number of cases which have been tried at Calcutta, so large that it is necessary to increase the number of Judges, there being a large number of arrears. Power is taken at the same time to increase the number of Judges in the other High Courts, not confining themselves under this Bill to the one particular case I have mentioned. In the same way and looking forward, the Government of India are anxious to take power to establish additional High Courts when it should seem to them desirable. The third clause gives power to appoint temporary Judges, with regard to which there is at the present moment some difficulty. Additional Judges cannot be appointed without being counted amongst those who are already members of the Court. This Bill met in another place with nothing but commendation and praise, and therefore I venture to hope that your Lordships will give it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<title>LABOURERS (IRELAND) BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02800" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02801">Order of the Day for the Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02802"><member>THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this Bill is an extension of the Labourers Act of 1906. The object of it is to extend the financial scope of that Act and to facilitate its working. I hope no complaint will be made that this Bill was only circulated to your Lordships yesterday, because it is in the same form in which it was introduced in the House of Commons on February 16 this year, and it comes to your Lordships' House unamended. It is a Bill upon which no Division was taken. I do not think I need say very much about the Bill, because the provisions of the Act of 1906 are well known to most of your Lordships. You will remember that that Act was for the purpose of building cottages in Ireland for labourers and for providing allotments, and a grant-in-aid was given to the local authorities to help them to repay the loans. I think by general consent that Act has conferred immense benefit on the working and agricultural classes in Ireland. The number of cottages built since the passing of the Act of 1906 is very much greater per annum. Whereas previous to that date only 21,000 cottages had been erected, or at the rate of 1,000 a year, since that Act 12,862 cottages have been built, which, of course, in four and a-half years gives a very much larger proportion.<lb/>
The reason for the introduction of this Bill is that the funds available under the Act of 1906 are not sufficient to meet the demand for housing in rural districts. There are at the present moment schemes proposed by rural districts for the erection of 3,550 additional cottages and the acquisition of 1,116 plots of land for labourers at an estimated cost, of &#x00A3;679,000. This cannot be done unless an additional capital sum is authorised. The finance of the Act of 1906 was to advance &#x00A3;4,250,000 to the local authorities from the Land Commission at the ordinary annuity of 3&#x00BC; per cent, spread over a period of sixty-eight and a-half years. The advantage of that over the previous Acts, starting with the Act of 1883, was that the annuity which the local authorities had to pay for the loan was very much reduced. Whereas it used to stand at about 4&#x00BD; per cent., the effect of patting the loan on the basis I have described was to relieve the
<col>1126</col>
local authorities to the extent of 1&#x00BC; per cent. But the Act went further than that, as your Lordships will remember. It saddled the local authorities with 64 per cent, of the annual annuities, 36 per cent, being undertaken by the Government&#x2014;that is to say, 16 per cent, was charged on the Labourers' Cottages Fund and 20 per cent, came out of the Ireland Development Grant.<lb/>
The demand now is for a further increase of capital to enable these schemes to be carried through; but it will be observed that further capital cannot be granted unless further provision is made for carrying out that part of the guaranteed grant-in-aid to the local authorities on the basis of the previous Acts. With a view of meeting this, in Clause 1 of the Bill your Lordships will see that certain sums are set aside for the purpose of increasing the annual grant under the Labourers' Cottages Fund, and money is taken from the dormant portion of the Suitors' Fund in the Supreme Court of Judicature in Ireland to the extent of &#x00A3;36,000 in cash and &#x00A3;30,000 in Consols. This transfer from the Suitors' Fund to the Local Government Board in Ireland is to be invested by them, and the income arising therefrom is added to the Fund which already exists under the name of the Labourers' Cottages Fund. If there should be a deficiency in the Suitors' Fund in the Supreme Court as the result of this transfer, that deficiency will be met out of the Consolidated Fund, but of course it is not expected that there ever will be a deficiency. The cash balance at the Bank of Ireland, out of which the &#x00A3;36,000 cash is taken, stands at &#x00A3;110,000, so that a large balance is left there. The Suitors' Account No. 1, out of which &#x00A3;20,000 in Consols is taken, has a sum of &#x00A3;34,000 in Consols; and the Unclaimed Order and Residue Account, out of which &#x00A3;10,000 is taken, stands at &#x00A3;15,000. Consequently, in spite of this depletion, large balances remain under all those heads.<lb/>
The second clause extends the capital sum which may be loaned for this purpose from &#x00A3;4,250,000 to &#x00A3;5,250,000, with a proviso that should any deficiency arise, with regard to the contribution of 16 per cent, made by the Government under the Labourers' Cottages Fund, that deficiency shall be borne by the rates&#x2014;that is to say, the 16 per cent, might conceivably be reduced to, say, 15 per cent. That, of course, is not anticipated, but this
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0568"/>
<col>1127</col>
provision has had to be inserted in case of such a deficiency arising. Clause 3 increases the Development Grant&#x2014;which. as I have mentioned, is responsible for 20 per cent. of the annual annuities&#x2014;from &#x00A3;28,000 to &#x00A3;34,000 a year, and thus throws an additional charge of &#x00A3;6,000 a year on the Exchequer. That is the only additional charge which the taxpayer will bear in connection with this Bill. Clause 4 deals with the power of investment; Clause 5 with the right of removing insanitary houses; Clause 6 with the payment of purchase money and compensation into Court, and Clause 7 with matters connected with the evidence of Local Government Board inspectors.<lb/>
The main provisions of this Bill are financial, and it is nothing more than an extension of the previous Act so that rural districts in Ireland will have an additional &#x00A3;1,000,000 which they can borrow for the purpose of erecting labourers' cottages. This is a Bill which raised no controversy in the other House. The original Act is generally regarded to have benefited the rural population of Ireland to an incalculable extent, and I believe there is a general feeling, which I hope your Lordships will share, that this work should be continued and extended.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02803">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Ashby St. Ledgers.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02804"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the principal provisions of this Bill, as the noble Lord has told us, deal with matters connected with the finance of the Labourers Acts, and, so far as I was able to follow him, they seem to be unobjectionable nor were they provisions with which this House would naturally much concern itself. But the noble Lord passed over without any explanation at all one clause in the Bill which does seem to require a little elucidation. I refer to Clause 5, which permits the demolition, upon an Order from the Local Government Board, of any dwelling-house certified to be insanitary, provided suitable accommodation has been obtained or is obtainable by the inmate of the house elsewhere. It is no doubt the case that there are still a great number of extremely bad houses in Ireland, but, on the other hand, it should not be forgotten that the number of those houses is diminishing at a very great. rate. I looked before I came to the House at the statistics, and I find these remarkable
<col>1128</col>
figures. Whereas in 1871 there were in Ireland no fewer than 227,000 houses of the fourth class&#x2014;fourth class houses, I understand, are mud cabins with one window&#x2014;the number had fallen by the year 1901 to less than 10,000. I mention that because it shows, I think, that by a natural and most satisfactory process the number of these houses is diminishing, whereas a corresponding increase in the better class of houses is noticeable in the same statistics.<lb/>
What I want to ask is this. Where a labourer's house is found to be unfit for human habitation it may be almost summarily demolished provided it is shown that suitable accommodation is available for the inhabitant of that house elsewhere. You may say that if an Englishman's house is his castle an Irishman's cabin is not less his castle, and he might have a very great objection to the demolition of his house, even if it was a very bad one, if the accommodation offered him was not in an equally convenient place. Suppose his work lies in the neighbourhood, it would not in the least comfort him to have his house knocked down and to be told that he must go and inhabit a better house in another place. I should like the noble Lord to tell us what is really the change in the law which this clause makes. The same question is dealt, with in Section 17 Of the Act of 1885, and it would be interesting to know, for it does not appear at first sight, what really is the change which it is desired to effect by means of this fifth clause.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02805"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not mean to slur over this point, and I have great pleasure in telling the noble Marquess exactly what is effected by this clause. May I say first of all, that if the noble Marquess will look at Clause 5, subsection (1), he will observe that no house can be demolished unless an inspector of the Local Government Board is satisfied that "suitable house accommodation is obtainable elsewhere." It is only in those conditions that, the demolition of a house can be ordered under this clause, and that itself, I think, is sufficient protection against any ruthless destruction of Irishmen's cabins.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0009P0I0569"/>
<col>1129</col>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02807"><member>LORD ASHBY ST. LEDGERS</member><membercontribution>: I feel pretty clear that that is the intention of the wording. The present situation is this. Under Section 17 of the Labourers Act, 1885, it is provided that if the inspector of the Local Government Board, at a local inquiry as to an improvement scheme, finds a house occupied by a labourer to be unfit for habitation he may report it to the Local Government Board. It then becomes the duty of the sanitary authority, when they have provided other house accommodation for the occupant, to serve notice on the owner prohibiting the unfit house being used as a dwelling-house, and if the owner disobeys the order a further order may be made to prevent the house being used as a dwelling-house or requiring its demolition; but it has in practice been found impossible to prevent those houses remaining standing and being occupied, and it is desirable to give additional powers to local authorities with regard to this class of property. Otherwise the provisions of the Act of 1906 would be very largely destroyed. It is now proposed that, on the report of the inspector, the Local Government Board may direct the district council to require the owner to demolish the house without option, and if the owner makes default the authority are in a position to carry out the work of demolition themselves and to recover the cost from the owner. There is a precedent for this to be found in the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, in the Working Classes Act, 1903, and in the Housing Act, 1890. In those cases power is granted to a local authority to recover costs from the owner for work which they have carried out for him in default of his doing it himself. So we are proceeding on precedents already recognised, and it is hoped that by the strengthening of the hands of the local authorities in respect of the demolition of this unsatisfactory class of property the real intention of these and preceding Acts may be carried out.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02811"><sup>*</sup><member>LORD SANDERSON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope your Lordships will not think it
<col>1130</col>
irrelevant or audacious on my part. if I venture to take this occasion to offer a slight addition to the account which was given by the noble and learned Viscount the Secretary of State for War on the Second Reading of this Bill as to the basis on which the appellate jurisdiction of this House rests. The noble Viscount said&#x2014;
<quote>"By a process analogous to the process by which the House of Commons secured control of finance at the expense of this House, only put into force in a still more drastic fashion, this House has gradually acquired complete control of the appellate administration of justice. That is the case in regard to the United Kingdom."</quote>
Later the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack said&#x2014;
<quote>"This House, having borrowed from the Crown the authority which is still called the decision of the King in Parliament, decides all appeals from the United Kingdom."</quote>
I conceive that that is a sufficiently accurate description of what happened up to forty years ago, but neither noble and learned Lord mentioned that in 1873 this House passed the Supreme Court of Judicature Act by which the whole of its appellate jurisdiction was abolished. Parliament, having made that enactment. thought better of it; the operation of the Act was deferred, and eventually in 1876 the Appellate Jurisdiction Act was passed by which the appellate jurisdiction of this House was revived under improved conditions and with certain amendments. In those circumstances I do not think that the jurisdiction of this House eau be correctly described as borrowed from the Crown. I submit that it has been conferred by Statute.<lb/>
There is one other point which is, perhaps, worth mentioning in view of the discussion which took place on the Second Reading of this Bill. By Section 5 of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act it is enacted that an appeal shall not be heard and determined unless there are present at such hearing not less than three Lords of Appeal, but the Act contains nothing which would prevent any lay Lord from exercising the right of sitting and hearing the appeal and taking part in the decision. I presume that there was a reason for that. It was probably in order to allow Peers specially qualified to sit occasionally as assessors. But, whatever the reason may have been it has never caused any inconvenience, because as a matter of fact no lay Lord ever does exercise the right. In these circumstances
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0570"/>
<col>1131</col>
it was quite incorrect for Mr. John Burns to have said that this House is not satisfied with being the highest Court of Appeal. The real fact is that this House, having the right to be the highest Court of Appeal, scrupulously abstains from acting in that way, and leaves it to the Judges. That is not a matter which it is very easy to bring home to the great mass of the electors. I think the noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack mistook their attitude of mind when he said that this House is charged with taking a part in unpopular judgments. It is not supposed that this House declares the law; it is supposed that by some unicameral method it makes the law, and the legislative and judicial functions of the House are confused. I believe the late Lord Selborne, on the Second Reading of the Appellate Jurisdiction Bill, called attention to the possibility that this might happen. It undoubtedly has happened, and I think it is well worth consideration in what way the impression can be removed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02812"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: It is quite true, as my noble friend has said, that the Appellate Jurisdiction Act of 1873 gave statutory recognition to the judicial functions of this House. In what I said in moving the Second Reading of this Bill I was referring to the origin of that jurisdiction, which any of your Lordships who are interested in the subject will find set out in Mr. Pike's History of the House of Lords. It is a very old jurisdiction, and how it got transferred from the King in his curia to the King in his Parliament and then to this House is a matter which is buried in considerable historical obscurity. But. there it is. It is quite true that the jurisdiction on the appellate side is a totally different thing from the legislative jurisdiction, and any confusion there has been in the minds of people between the two has arisen from ignorance. Whether hereafter it may be possible to set the seal on the propositions of, this Bill by transferring the jurisdiction to a Supreme Court of Appeal for the Empire is a different question. That, as I said before, seems to me to be the reasonable and natural outcome of the situation. This Bill only deals with the substance and paves the way for Parliament, if hereafter it should think fit, to take that course.</membercontribution></p>

<title>TRUSTEE (BODIES CORPORATE) BILL.<lb/> [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02822">Bill read 3<sup>a</sup> (according to order).</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02823"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR</member><membercontribution>: I have several Amendments to move at this stage. This Bill was brought in by Lord Avebury, and the purpose of it is to provide that certain corporations which now, under the Public Trustee Act, are licensed to act as custodian trustees should be at liberty to act as trustees at large and also to make charges. I informed Lord Avebury that it was necessary that I should consider the Bill. As soon as I had time I did so, and I have been in communication with those very influential
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0571"/>
<col>1133</col>
people in the City of London who are moving to allow the great banks to take this position and they have consented to the Amendments which stand on the Paper in my name.<lb/>
The purpose and substance of these Amendments is two-fold. In the first place, I do not think that because a corporation is licensed under the Public Trustee Act to become a custodian trustee it would therefore be right to allow it, merely, at the motion of, for instance, an existing trustee or one of the beneficiaries, to take the position of trustee absolutely and to be at liberty to make charges for the care of the trust. Therefore I have provided in these Amendments that they cannot do so in any particular case except by leave of a Judge, which is very easily and cheaply obtained in Chambers. If the Judge gives his permission in a particular case he will be satisfied, no doubt, of the solvency of the trustees and of the propriety of allowing this to be done.<lb/>
The second Amendment is this. As your Lordships are aware, the Public Trustee has the Treasury at his back. If he commits a breach of trust the Treasury has to act. In the ease of many of these corporations which are licensed to be custodian trustees, their wealth may be sufficient to be an adequate guarantee, but it is very undesirable that because they are licensed to act as custodian trustees people should be left under the belief that in trusting them they have the public guarantee of the Treasury at their back. Therefore I propose to insert a proviso to the effect that every prospectus, circular, advertisement, or other document issued by or on behalf of a licensed corporation and relating to the undertaking of trusts shall, if such prospectus, circular, advertisement, or other document contains any reference to the Public Trustee or to the Public Trustee Act, 1906, contain a separate and distinct statement that no liability attaches to the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom in respect of any act or omission of the licensed corporation.<lb/>
I confess that, although one is very anxious to yield to the opinion of men like Lord Avebury and other great authorities, it is not without sonic degree of misgiving that, even with these Amendments, I contemplate the departure from
<col>1134</col>
the wholesome rule that a trustee cannot make a profit out of his trust. However, that is the purpose of the Bill. The Amendments safeguard the matter in the way I have described. Discretion is left to the Judge, and I hope that that safeguard may prove satisfactory.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02838"><member>THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the noble Viscount opposite a Question of which I have given him private notice. I am sure all of us must have read with the gravest concern and apprehension the reports in the newspapers to-day with regard to the state of things in the industrial market. We read not only of serious events which have taken place, but of not less serious events which appear to be impending unless the spirit of conciliation fortunately comes over those most concerned. I would venture to ask the noble Viscount whether he can tell us anything of interest either as to the facts or as to the precautions which His Majesty's Government are disposed to take in the event of the aspect of the case becoming more serious. The noble Viscount will understand that at such a moment I should not think of pressing him to give to the House any information which it might be in the public interest not to give, and it is with that limitation that I put the Question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02839"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I may say this. About the question of the railway companies it is not desirable that I should say anything. The Board of Trade is engaged in conference with those concerned and has been busy all day; indeed, it has been so from early morning to midnight for some few days in dealing with this question. What the outcome may be we cannot tell. As regards the general situation in the London docks, all I can say is that the situation to-day is no worse. There is a good deal of business going on. There has arisen, unfortunately, a difficulty over the claim of the men employed at the Albert Dock to be engaged at the gates. The object of that is obviously that only union men shall be engaged, and over that friction has arisen and controversy is
<col>1136</col>
proceeding. Passing to Liverpool, your Lordships were informed by the newspapers of what happened yesterday, and the accounts are substantially correct. A violent attack was made on the prison vans and had to be repelled by force. The troops were used and firing took place, and unfortunately life was lost; but no further disturbance occurred during the evening, and this morning, according to a telegram which I have had, all has remained still quiet. Convoys of food are being got out regularly. If violence of that kind&#x2014;utterly unreasonable, turbulent violence&#x2014;is repeated the policy of the Government is to put it down and to use all the force necessary for the purpose, and the disposition of both police and troops ought to be adequate for the purpose. As regards Manchester, business is practically at a standstill there, although there is no disturbance. Two battalions of Infantry and a Cavalry regiment are at hand and ready to be moved in if it should prove necessary. I trust that it will not prove necessary, for the use of military force is to be deplored if it can be avoided. At the same time, with scenes such as we have witnessed there may be no other way. As regards other places, at Cardiff last night there was a disturbance, but this morning all was reported quiet. These are the salient features of to-day's situation. We are watching very closely what is going on, and we are in constant communication with all parts of the country where disturbance is apprehended, and all precautions that we can take are being taken; but it is well, I think, to say no more about details which change from hour to hour.</membercontribution></p>

The Amendment is in Clause 1, page 1, line 26, to leave out "include" and insert would allow "The object of this Amendment is to deal with existing trusts, as, of course, in future trusts it will be possible to provide for anything which is in this Act. As the Bill now stands, it is possible that the word "include" might be construed as requiring that in order to exclude a trust from the operation of this Act there should be a specific statement with reference to trade. The words which I propose to substitute may be regarded as somewhat wide, but I cannot see any middle term between the two. I apprehend that the purpose of the Government is to exclude from the operation of this Bill such trusts as I have before referred to.</membercontribution></p>

Secretary of State to make certain allowances to members of the staff of the Government of India at home here in England. It is possible already for him to make these allowances to those who are in the Indian Civil Service, but some question has arisen as to whether it is possible for him to make them to gentlemen who are serving in the India Office at Whitehall. The object of this Bill is not only to remove this doubt, but also in a case of considerable hardship to make it quite certain that the Secretary of State has not acted <i>ultra vires.</i> The Bill is a plain and simple one, and I shall be glad to give any further explanation of it if any noble Lord wishes.</membercontribution></p>

<title>TELEPHONE TRANSFER BILL.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02885"><member>THE EARL OF LIVERPOOL</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it may be for the convenience of the House, as this Bill has not been printed and as there is very little time for getting it through its various stages. that in moving the First Reading I should briefly state the various stages of the transfer which has taken place between the Post, Office and the National Telephone Company. The negotiations first started when the Conservative Government were in office, and I think they were initiated by Lord Derby.<lb/>
As regards the question of payment, the Bill makes provision for taking over the whole of the business of the National Telephone Co. First, the Post Office pay for the whole of the working plant and buy it on tramway terms, that is, making allowance for depreciation&#x2014;<i>i.e.,</i> construction cost less depreciation. Secondly, the Post Office pay for the goodwill of the private wire business the average profits for the last three years. Thirdly, the Post Office pay for the goodwill of the business in the Brighton and Portsmouth area, where the National Telephone Co.'s licence was extended beyond 1911. Settlement is arranged either by agreement or by arbitration, and there are now no outstanding points of opposition either on the part of the company or the staff. The Bill authorises the Treasury to pay the purchase price, which may be settled, as I have said. by agreement or arbitration.<lb/>
Then as to the transfer of the staff. The Postmaster-General will transfer to the Post Office service the whole of the staff of the company, with the exception of a few of the higher officials, such as the directors, &amp;c. The general condition of the transfer is that the staff will be transferred to the grades of the Post Office doing similar work, and their seniority as compared with the <ob/> Office staff will depend on the relative service in corresponding duties in the company or Post Office. As regards the pensioning of the staff, under certain conditions a portion of the service when in the employment of the company will be counted towards <ob/> namely, a period of two years will be <ob/> from their entry into the Post Office service, with the exception of those who had not completed two years service with the National Telephone Co., and these will count the actual period which they had in the company's service towards pension. Those members
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0576"/>
<col>1143</col>
of the staff of the National Telephone Co. who joined the company's pension fund in 1896 will, provided they transfer their shares in the pension fund when it is wound up to the Postmaster-General, be allowed to count for pension purposes the years of their service with the company or any other telephone undertaking. Those who joined the National Telephone Co. subsequent to 1896 will be allowed to count the years during which they had been members of the company's pension fund. There was in a very few cases a difficulty to assimilate the company's pension list with that of the Post Office, but this has now been arranged and cleared up by giving an additional salary in lieu of pension in about twenty-five cases in all and they have a guarantee of permanent employment. I may add that under the company's scheme only 2,000 people were pensionable; under the Post Office roughly 12,000 are pensionable out of a total of 18,000 transferred from the National Telephone Co. to the Post Office. I think that briefly describes the main points of the transfer. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1145</col>
of the lightermen have come out because they refused to work under non-union foremen, and then there is the question to which I referred yesterday arising from the claims of the dockers at the Victoria and Albert Docks to be engaged outside the dock gates. Negotiations are going on and the best is being done that can be done, but we cannot forecast what the result will be. In Liverpool the comparative quiet of yesterday continued throughout the night. Some tramway men came out yesterday, and there have been attacks on the trams, but not of a serious character. The gravest feature so far as Liverpool is concerned, is that the Strike Committee have called on the men employed in the electric power station to come out at 2 p.m. to-day. Whether they have come out or not I do not know. If they have, the result will be to stop all trams and cut off the electric light in Liverpool, Bootle, and the large areas around. There have been one or two fires in vessels in the docks, but they have been put out before much damage could be done. A cruiser has been sent by the Admiralty to the Mersey for purposes of protection. In Liverpool there are, I think, sufficient troops&#x2014;4,760 Infantry and Cavalry in all. The situation is being watched, and more will be sent if necessary for the preservation of order. In Manchester there has been no marked change in the situation.<lb/>
<col>1146</col>
The convoys of food have been kept up in spite of desultory attacks made, not by decent working men, but by hooligans and strikers. In Sheffield convoys of food are also being constantly attacked, chiefly by persons of the hooligan class. Infantry have recently arrived in Sheffield, and they will give any assistance necessary for the preservation of order. At one of the railway stations there was an attack last night on a signal box by a mob which threw stones from a bridge and drove out the signalmen. Assistance to guard the railway has now been given. So far as the general situation is concerned I have nothing I can usefully add. There was a meeting this morning at the Board of Trade between some of the representatives of the men and the Prime Minister and the President of the Board of Trade, but I have no statement to make of what passed. We have thought it right to restore things to their normal position by letting the Guards Brigade return to their regular station in London. I trust, however, that no occasion will arise for their service. For the rest the situation is being carefully and closely watched, and we hope we are in a position to deal with developments of it so far as law and order are concerned.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02911"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the object of this Bill is to continue various expiring laws in order that arrangements may be made under them which cannot be made without statutory authority. There are also financial considerations. There is included in this Bill one Act as to which a question was raised by the noble Marquess
<col>1148</col>
the Leader of the Opposition on Tuesday last&#x2014;the Evicted Tenants (Ireland) Act, 1907. As to that, the Government do not propose to carry on the existing Act beyond the limited time proposed in this Bill, and it is only for the purpose of dealing with certain cases&#x2014;numbering 630, I think&#x2014;now under consideration, many of which are very proper cases to be dealt with. The Government do not desire to bring in another Act of this kind, and, though I am very reluctant to give Parliamentary pledges with regard to the future, it is believed that if your Lordships will assent to the inclusion of this Act in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill for a year, we shall be able in that time to dispose of the whole of the business outstanding and not have to ask for any renewal. As regards the other Acts in the Schedule, they are measures which I think are proper to be carried on. Some of them are absolutely essential, and it is in accordance with usual practice that they should be included.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02912">Moved, That the Bill be now read 2<sup>a</sup>.&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Haldane.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02913"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: The noble Marquess the Leader of the Opposition called attention on Tuesday last to the inclusion in this Bill of the Evicted Tenants (Ireland) Act. That Act is a very unusual one to include in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill. In his statement the noble Viscount, I think, recognised that. I cannot refrain from reminding your Lordships that the duration of the Evicted Tenants (Ireland) Act was the subject of vigorous discussion, not only in this House, but between the two Houses of Parliament four years ago, and it was then pressed by this House, with the assent of the noble Marquess, Lord Crewe, that the Bill should remain in force only for three years. Your Lordships agreed to an Amendment to that effect, but the House of Commons sent back the Amendment with a demand that the period should be four years. Upon that Lord Ashbourne proposed that we should insert the words "four years and no longer," and the reply from the noble Marquess the then Leader of the House, Lord Crewe, was&#x2014;"Certainly, if you desire it," or words to that effect. Therefore there was a clear Parliamentary bargain that this Act should not exist for more than four years. I submit that if it was desired to extend the period it ought
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0579"/>
<col>1149</col>
to have been raised as a separate measure and not in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill.<lb/>
We know what the course of the, Evicted Tenants Act has been. We had from the Government Bench the clearest assurance that the cases that would come under it numbered between 1,200 and 2,000. Yet we know that, although under the restricted wording which we unanimously adopted it was intended to confine the Act to those who had fallen in the fight during the Campaign, some 10,000 applications were made under the Act. A large number of those were never intended to be dealt with by Parliament at all. I am sorry to say that it has come to the knowledge of those connected with Ireland that cases have been dealt with which ought not to have come under the Act&#x2014;cases of tenants who had been evicted not in the slightest degree because they had fallen in the land war, but who were evicted simply because they had been unable and were unfit to carry on their business. Some of the men dealt with under this Act had been for years out of the country, having voluntarily given up their farms.<lb/>
I should like to ask the noble Viscount whether, if we at this advanced hour of the session offer no objection to the Evicted Tenants Act being included in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill for a year, we may count on it that it is the intention of the Government, subject to any unforeseen circumstances, to bring the Act to a close within that period; and, secondly, that should the Government for any reason wish to extend the Act for a few months they will introduce a Bill which we can discuss and not again include the Act in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02914"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: I think I can give the promise asked for. It certainly is in the contemplation of the Government to wind up this business in the course of a year. That is so definitely their intention that I think I may give the further pledge that if, through unforeseen circumstances, we wish to further extend the Act we will introduce a Bill for the purpose.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02915"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: I hope an intimation will also be given to the Commissioners that they are to use the extension of the Act only, on the noble Viscount's pledge, for winding up the business which has already been entered upon.</membercontribution></p>

It carries out the recommendations of a Committee appointed in November, 1907. The Committee included representatives of both sides, the employers and those engaged in the industry, and they arrived at a unanimous conclusion on all points except one, and that point they unanimously agreed to leave to the determination of the Secretary of State. This Bill merely gives the Secretary of State power to make such by-laws. I may say that it is an agreed Bill; both sides want it. It has come up to this House in an unamended form and is a subject of certain urgency because the manufacturers want to have time to make preparations and arrangements for next summer, I hope, on these grounds, that the House will grant the Bill a Second Reading and pass it through all its stages to-day.</membercontribution></p>

The noble and learned Earl on the Woolsack the other day very properly animadverted upon a Bill which I had introduced on the ground of legislation by reference, but I think if he will look at this Bill he will see that it offends very much more against those canons than even my Bill did. This Bill is absolutely nothing but legislation by reference with the exception of the first subsection&#x2014;
<quote>"The Secretary of State may make regulations for the purpose of giving effect to such of the recommendations contained in the Second Report,
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0580"/>
<col>1151</col>
dated January nineteen hundred and eleven, of the Committee appointed by the Secretary of State on the twenty-seventh day of November nineteen hundred and seven to inquire into the question of humidity and ventilation in cotton cloth factories, as he may deem necessary for the protection of health in cotton cloth factories."</quote>
That is the only sentence that I understand, and, unfortunately, I find it necessary to take exception to it, because this subsection as it stands gives to the Secretary of State unlimited powers to make such regulations as he chooses with regard to these matters.<lb/>
When this Bill was in the other House of Parliament there was a Memorandum which is not prefixed to the Bill as printed in your Lordships' House. That Memorandum said this&#x2014;
<quote>"The procedure proposed in the Bill follows the precedent of the Cotton Cloth Factories Act passed in 1897."</quote>
Unfortunately that is not correct. Under the Act of 1897, which was continued by the 1901 Act, it was necessary that notice should be given of the regulations and that any regulations made should be laid before Parliament, and it was enacted that either House might, if it saw fit, stop such regulations. This Bill gives an unlimited power to the Secretary of State to make regulations, and there is no provision at all for their being laid before Parliament; nor is there any provision for their publication, as would have been necessary under the Act of 1901, to all persons concerned. It would be very easy to insert words which would meet this point. I think the words might run thus&#x2014;"The Secretary of State may, by a special Order made under Section 126 of the Factories and Workshops Act, 1901, make regulations," etc. That would embrace all the restrictions and obligations of which I spoke just now.<lb/>
As I said, I do not wish in any way to impede this Bill, because, as the noble Lord explained, it is an agreed Bill and it is desirable that it should pass. We are now in the dog days and in the days of hurry, when we are always ready to pass any Bill about anything in order that we may get away; but at the same time I would ask the noble Lord whether it would be possible&#x2014;I understand that the other House meets next Tuesday&#x2014;to now insert the words that I have suggested and send them to the other House. If the noble Lord says that he will take the point into consideration and will insert the words if
<col>1152</col>
he finds that he can do so, of course that would satisfy me. If, on the other hand, he is not willing to go so far as that, and if he does not think he can admit an Amendment now, I would ask for an undertaking very much like that which was given to Lord Midleton just now&#x2014;an undertaking that the Home Office, when making such regulations, will lay them on the Table of both Houses just as they would be obliged to do under the Act of 1901. I have thought it necessary to make these remarks not only because of the action of the Home Office but of other Departments. I think the Local Government Board is about the worst, but the Treasury is pretty bad. When the Old Age Pensions Act was before this House I succeeded in persuading your Lordships to insert an Amendment very much to this effect. Subsequently the Treasury made a regulation which turned out to be absolutely illegal, and which, in consequence of this provision, they were obliged to withdraw. That is an instance in which the insertion of words like these was of material use. I shall be quite ready to accept whichever of the two courses the noble Lord is prepared to adopt.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02923"><member>THE LORD CHANCELLOR (EARL LOREBURN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, one of my colleagues on the Front Government Bench will reply to the practical suggestion which the noble Earl has made. I only rise for the purpose of adverting to the complaint made by the noble Earl with regard to legislation by reference. I am perfectly impenitent with regard to everything I have said on that subject. But I wish to say this, that we ought not to lay blame upon the Government draftsmen, than whom I do not know any more competent, more laborious, or more deserving public servants. We have got into a habit for generations almost of legislating by reference, and I do think it is a most unfortunate practice. For some years past we have had a Committee in both Houses who have undertaken the task of simplifying and consolidating the law, not altering it but consolidating it by general assent, and I think it might be well if next year we extended a little the compass of our work. I think we might take a Bill of this kind, write it large, so to speak, so that people can understand it, and then substitute those provisions for the provisions which contain legislation by reference. I can promise the noble Earl that I will bear the point in mind.</membercontribution></p>

It is in all probability nothing more than a slip, and I do not know that there would be any objection to accepting the Amendment which the noble Earl has suggested; but at this late hour in the session I would prefer to accept his other suggestion and give the undertaking that he desires&#x2014;namely, that the regulations shall be printed and laid upon the Table of both Houses for forty days as is provided in the clause which the noble Earl quoted.

<p id="S5LV0009P0-02930"><member>VISCOUNT HALDANE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at the Geneva Convention in 1906 many humane and useful provisions in regard to war were agreed upon, and among them was Section 27 of the Convention which provided that the Red Cross should be protected. It is obviously desirable that this emblem, which is the guarantee of immunity from attack in time of war, should be protected. This distinctive mark is a very important one for the purpose. The Powers concerned undertook, those of them who had not legislation adequate for the purpose, to propose to their Legislatures
<col>1154</col>
legislation which should protect the mark from being appropriated by trading companies and other persons, thus depriving it of its distinctive character. The Bill which is now before your Lordships is a Bill to give effect to that Convention. We ratified the Convention subject to our being able to secure from our Legislature the assent to the Red Cross mark being protected. This Bill has passed through the other House and is in every respect a desirable Bill. In case any private persons should have appropriated the mark while there was no legislation preventing it, although I do not think that these people are very deserving having regard to the well-known character of the mark, we have given them four years in which to get out of it. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE LABOUR DISPUTES.</title>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02949"><member>VISCOUNT MIDLETON</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when the noble Viscount asked us to reassemble to-day lie rather led us to believe that it would be in his power then to inform us as to the effect of the very serious negotiations which have gone on since your Lordships met last week. I think we must all congratulate the Government and the country on the great limitation of the area of the strike operations due to the negotiations which have proceeded in the interval; but I am sure it would be a satisfaction to your Lordships to know how matters stand now, to what areas the strike has been reduced, and, in particular, whether His Majesty's Government are now in a position to state the names of the Commissioners who it is proposed should immediately take up the task of considering the position and action of the Conciliation Boards.<lb/>
There is one further question on which I would like to ask for information. It certainly appears from the published reports of the last few days that beyond the actual trouble in the strike areas, a certain amount of serious rioting has occurred in wales, not merely in connection with strikes; and I am sure some anxiety is felt with regard to the position in some of these centres, and notably Tredegar, at which we understand some further collision has taken place, I am sure the noble Viscount will not misinterpret it if I say that what I know is felt by members on this side is that we all fully realise that the Government are naturally and laudably anxious to avoid the employment of troops, and, above all, to avoid the employment of troops where any collision might be provoked merely by their employment. On the other hand, I think we must realise that the operations of the last few days have caused a very severe
<col>1160</col>
strain indeed on the police and troops called upon to act, and that in some cases there would certainly scent to have been occasions when, if the military forces which were called out had been allowed to act effectively at first, and after the provocation was such as to call for that intervention, possibly much damage might have been saved, and, indeed, some loss of life.<lb/>
I would press the noble Viscount to assure us that it is the intention of the Government that in these cases of aggravated disorder, where it is necessary to call upon the troops to use their weapons, that if such a case does again occur it will be fully understood that those in command will be encouraged to act effectively at the earliest moment which will cause the restoration of order. There have been cases in Wales earlier in the year in which unquestionable very serious riots were allowed to proceed for a considerable number of hours without such intervention. If such intervention seems to be called for, then to allow disorder and damage to go on actually in the presence of the troops seems to create a probability of farther intervention being called for in other cases which might be avoided if it were understood that troops would only be called in when it is intended to take effective action. I do not wish in any way to show any want of confidence in His Majesty's Government, but we should be glad to be reassured as to the state of affairs in some of these centres of disturbance in Wales.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0009P0-02950"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (VISCOUNT HALDANE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will deal first with the latter part of the noble Viscount's interrogation. The object of the Government throughout has been to avoid bloodshed wherever possible, and, on the other hand, to observe the paramount purpose of maintaining the protection of life and limb and property. The plan adopted at an early stage for the purpose of dealing with this difficult situation Was to divide the areas where there was likely to be rioting into districts. England and Scotland were divided into districts, and a picked officer was sent to command the troops in each area, and troops were sent to him with instructions to him to be in close communication with the civil authorities. We, on the other hand, at the War Office were in close communication with the Home Office, and in that way we believe
<image src="S5LV0009P0I0585"/>
<col>1161</col>
we succeeded in bringing the civilian view and the military view into close relation. We were always very well informed through the Home Office of what was necessary, and were able to issue instructions accordingly to the officers commanding the districts.<lb/>
It was impossible, of course, from London to survey every point in the disturbed areas, and we consequently gave a discretion and a direction to the officer commanding in each district, placing on him the responsibility of seeing that adequate steps were taken. He was thoroughly informed in writing of the principles which we thought ought to guide him. He knew his work. It is obvious that even so, and even with the 58,000 troops we had at our disposal and ready, all of whom it was not necessary to use, but the greater part of whom were used&#x2014;it obviously was not possible to cover every point. For instance, a signal-box might be attacked by a sudden mob, and consequently it may seem as though there were cases where the military might have acted and did not. The fact was the military could not get there in time. We were very anxious not to send military in where they were not really needed. It was better to rely on police and special constables where they could be relied upon, but there were cases where it was impossible for the police and special constables to cope with the disorders which arose. Liverpool was one such case. Wales was another, and there have been other eases, though I am thankful to say very few of them.<lb/>
So far as I know, only five people have been killed by the rifles of the troops. I say "only," but I think it is a great disaster that five should have been killed. But it is better that it should be shown that the law has a firm hand and that disorder can be dealt with than that the troops should flinch from the duty cast upon them by the common law of the land. Under those circumstances, the survey of the situation discloses this, that the real rioters were not workmen out on strike. As a rule, these men were men who did what they did from a strong conviction that they were vindicating their rights. They might have been right or they might have been wrong, but it was their conviction, and they were not the prime movers, as far as we could discover, in these disturbances. Wherever you have social disorganisation, such as that
<col>1162</col>
we have experienced, there comes to the surface an element which the good feeling and steady-going mind of the public keeps under in ordinary times, but which breaks out more or less unrestrained now and again. It is that element, consisting in the main of people who have nothing whatever to do with the dispute, who were the cause of the riots and actually came in conflict with the police and troops. I do not say that was always so, but it was so in a great many cases.<lb/>
The House knows the strike was settled on Saturday night, but, although the strike was declared settled by those in authority, as regards both the railway companies and the men, and an agreement was come to, it takes some time to carry the decision into effect; and, moreover, there are always cases where the local interests of the strikers make them not ready to fall in with the view of the authorities, and, accordingly, there are places where there are still what I may call sporadic strikes going on and where the labour difficulties have not been got rid of. I am glad to say the prospects are good of things being settled. Men are returning to work, but in the North of England there are cases where things are not yet finally settled, and the Board of Trade is using its utmost exertions to assist those engaged in endeavouring to come to terms to accomplish that object.<lb/>
Part of the terms of the settlement was that the Government should appoint a Royal Commission, not to sit in the leisurely way in which Royal Commissions usually sit, but to set to work at once and dispose of these matters in the minimum possible time. I am now in a position to announce the names of those whom the Government has selected to serve. The Chairman will be Sir David Harrel, who has bad considerable experience in settling these disputes, and whose intervention has been acceptable. With him are serving Sir Thomas Ratcliffe Ellis, well known in connection with industrial matters, and particularly with the coal trade; Mr. Arthur Henderson, M.P.; Mr. Beale, of the firm of Messrs. Beale, Marigold, and Beale, solicitors, Birmingham, who has great experience in railway matters; and Mr. John Burnett, late of the Board of Trade. We hope the Commission will get to work at once, and that it will be able to present a Report on the points in con-

troversy, and that that Report may be instrumental in assisting to dispose of the points which are still outstanding.</membercontribution></p>
